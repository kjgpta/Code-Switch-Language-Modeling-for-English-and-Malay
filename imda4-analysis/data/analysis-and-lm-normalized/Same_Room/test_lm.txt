steady #bom-pipi# bro what about you [ah]
jom kita #bercatch# up
#ons# #kopitiam# [pe]
how's life [ah]
sekolah kau macam mana [ah]
(hmm)
[ah] [ah]
jadi seorang
jadi seorang jurugambar is aku punya impian actually
(hmm) actually [kan]
untuk menyerah segala galanya untuk mengejar impian aku ini bukan senang
tapi if i were to
like menyerah my freedom cause [kan] being a photo~ being a photographer is like a freelancer job
entah
tengah cari ni tapi aku pernah [ah] satu kali aku (um) aku photographer cousin aku punya wedding actually
nasi lemak [ah]
bang nasi lemak dengan nasi goreng satu
just one dish
okay [ah] kalau aku kena makan one dish for the rest of my life
(hmm)
aku rasa aku akan pilih makan pizza
pasal pizza tu filling pastu portion dia macam besar
okay [ah] not bad boleh makan for the rest of my life tapi the downside is aku punya health akan deteriorate rabak
pastu like the most memorable meal for you [leh]
!oof! aku pun nak pergi korea [sia]
[eh] hari tu aku baru tengok movie [tau] keluar dekat pawagam cerita dia pasal time capsule
so macam
aku terpikir [ah] if right you found a time capsule [ah] from long ago macam ten years ago gitu what would be inside your time capsule [ah]
you and
you and me both [sia] always keep losing our ez-link card
then only ez-link card [meh]
it's like confirm got other stuff [what]
[ah] [ah] [eh] kau dulu art major in secondary school terlupa aku
what to do kena kerja for a living but right terpikir juga aku if #manja# tak payah kerja lagi for like a living what do you think we will do [ah]
tak akan depend on just our government kita punya government bankrupt juga
so like macam
kalau macam gitu apa macam susah apa yang kau harap macam free gitu
healthcare tu susah juga [ah] kalau nak jadi free
aku rasa rasanya
education pasal education sekarang walaupun ada subsidy #mendaki# tu semua [kan]
mahal juga pastu kita singapore kita punya education kena tinggi baru kita punya job macam bagus bagus kau tengok [ah] nak jadi doctor education kena overseas university n_u_s ke susah juga [ah]
abeh kalau
kau kau masuk uni tak
aku punya course ni macam
kena masuk uni [ah] kalau tak aku takleh tak ada future untuk aku so university [ah] under medicine gitu tapi susah juga [ah] pasal very competitive punya situation so if i were to join a local university [ah] under medicine it will be so competitive with all the j_c kids [lor]
aku punya impian actually nak jadi photographer [ah] tapi macam
aku ni
impian photographer [jer] macam hobby gitu
so tak nak pursue sangat under photographer pasal freelancer [kan] so dia punya
the work pay is not very stable
so not very stable very hard [lor] in singapore
(hmm) so just extra income kalau aku tak ada apa apa [ah] tapi sekarang aku ni belajar under medicine so
aku punya first and foremost punya important punya course nak masuk in uni will be under medicine ataupun
pharmacy [ah]
kau pula kau punya course apa [ah]
i say
if you really like it then
you can start by building up your portfolio now
by like trying all this part time under design media stuff
cause nowadays these days
[kan] ta~ (um) cause of the time
there isn't much jobs right but then they also calling a lot of design production so you can try to like build up your portfolio
so you can try to like build up your portfolio
because uni all about portfolio [what] so starting from now you can try you know
tak [ah] aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah
and then kalau nak try under pharmacy pula dorang punya
working hours also a bit tough
then
then like (um)
you all need macam diploma degree baru boleh dapat the experience
so my course a bit tough [ah] i just need to wait until internship [lor]
aku tengah cari kerja [ah] sekarang tapi pasal
covid [kan]
so
times are tough [ah] so i know for government pun they macam
they
they retrenched quite a number of people so
a bit tough to find job now even though macam
they need people
they also need very quality type of people you know [ah]
#ons# bro if it's like nothing to do with our diploma then okay [lor]
my exam [ah] (hmm)
my exam can [lah] can do can do by is cause
because covid [mah] so
everything online and is not paper exam written is all like coursework and assignment then you got oral oral viva or something like that i don't know [ah] our brand new for because of covid so like
a bit difficult [ah] or i i still don't understand the system a bit
to be honest right h_b_l [ah]
i at home i sleep you know
so like i sleep you know so like cause it's where my comfort comfortable place is [mah] so it's like at home
then near my bed like that then
very very easily to just go on my bed and just sleep you know you [leh] you have h_b_l right for the whole semester
i mean slowly if the situation getting better [ah]
some classes is online some classes offline not too bad [ah] but like
if really the whole of my
five days is online [ah] (hmm) bro i just sit at home not even listening i eat eat eat at home not even listening to class
teacher go through stuff also i like a bit don't understand but i also don't want be you know in front class unmute then suddenly everybody hear my question
so a bit [lah] i don't think so i can tahan [lor]
they don't also really need and not much people also tourist don't have
ask people also don't have want to up the economy [mah] so
if we apply job all then a bit tough [ah]
relate bro is like i swear i got no money then like i keep spending you know all the shopee sale and all
today nine nine (hmm) got no money bro
possible [meh]
bro got one time
the person [ah] the shopee person
keep going into my house keep knocking my house door like
[eh] berbual pasal covid covid ni semua [kan] [eh] aku dengar that time kau kena
aku bilang kau aku ada concert satu kat sini
satu kat malaysia
and you know what because of covid the [one] in singapore got close down first [oh]
cause the singapore issue was more more prominent you know
so like
then the other concert was in malaysia
i haven't book ticket for the flight so that's good
but is i already book ticket for the concert itself but got cancelled last minute and then after that cancelled and then immediately don't have the concert anymore so cause of covid i also cannot watch the concert cause the concert thing is all like close packed right so
what to say [ah]
that [one] is what i miss what i missed the most cause of covid i want go to concert and all
for both the concert
the [one] in singapore was n_c_t
then the [one] in malaysia was super junior [ah] you know the sorry sorry guy
then [ah]
the [one] in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia tu a bit slow [ah]
cause they want show cancel or not [ah] then they cancel then they refund a bit slow but i got both the refund if i have bought the flight ticket right
malaysia airline won't refund [one]
(hmm)
i think
not much [lor] from singapore to malaysia maybe about one hundred (hmm)
(hmm)
i think right i think you will like got seven
can [lah] can relate my money gone so fast man no job now right cause now [ah] covid then they do online concert
online concert take so much money also but then after that #sian# [lah] my money all gone [lor]
[oh] same [lah] same [lah] like n_c_t they all like multinational people but then they all cause they train in singa~ train in korea right so all of them in korea [lor] like you know all of them chinese member [hor] you all cannot go back [ah] so they only stay in korea
i think right
i think i'll be homesick [lor] cause [ah] i a bit of a mother's girl so a bit of mummy's girl so like my mother not with me [ah] i think i will like i don't feel comfortable [lor] then i will also definitely enjoy the experience [ah] going overseas and then study you know
you [leh] you ever thought about studying overseas
i think australia will be the most safest for me and like but then the thing is realistically speaking you also don't know if the cert can be taken in singapore but theoretically i want to study in korea why cause can see my #oppa#
(um) that's why [ah] if like you want to study overseas as a melayu i think [kan] australia will be the most safest because
you know australia they very open and stuff so like ya but then when you overseas you need to stay in a place where [ah] the place has accommodates to what you are [lah] like being a muslim so kalau kau nak tinggal kat korea kau kena tinggal kat #itaewon# situ [ah] [ah] cause i heard situ banyak kebanyakan melayu tapi contradict juga situ juga banyak tempat clubbing
so right semenjak kita kat rumah [kan] confirm kau tengok banyak netflix [kan] confirm so macam cerita apa kau tengok kat netflix
tak aku tengok movie [eh]
i a bit scaredy cat [ah] to watch that show but right talking about devil daughter teringat aku pula aku punya favourite show sekarang lucifer i don't know kalau kau tahu [ah] tapi banyak orang tengah bebual pasal cerita tu so basically dia macam [ah] detective punya show so they solve crimes and all that tu macam aku punya favourite genre [ah] [ah] so basically lucifer tu dia dia actually devil dia syaitan tapi tak ada orang terpikir that he's really the devil until like his face his devil face came out then like (um) then people started believing it [ah] cause they are like mere humans [kan] so dorang macam a bit scared of him but he's a really good detective also [ah] he work like hand in hand dengan the detective cop chloe it's a great show [ah] but it's super overrated now
(hmm)
or a bar right i saw recently did it just came up but
no bukan part two it's like season five part one so the season five is split into two different (um) two different parts [ah] so got season five part one then got season five part two so the season five part one just recently came out then season five part two suppose to come out in like september so and so but then cause of covid right they cannot like shoot the last few scenes last few episodes [mah] so in september then they resuming back [lor] cause the covid
then i i also saw that thailand show i also started watching [eh]
[oh] cause actually my friend also recommended the show so i started watching [ah] cause i saw then i see the first episode cause my attention span not so good [mah] so i see forty minutes or an hour right i like a bit i a bit sceptical [lah] but then i started watching like the first episode !wah! not bad then i started watching the rest [lor]
[oh] cause my [one] i watch on netflix so no advertisement
i leech off my cousin
[oh] talking about singapore [ah] cause they want to try to cause no tourist [what] so they want to try to increase the tourism board they got a lot of interesting attraction nowadays now fifty percent off at zoo [eh] or river safari or night safari i haven't been [lor] cause my family trying to get the tickets [ah] then there's also like discounted price for u_s_s you know now u_s_s is fifty eight dollar like including a liho drink then other than that (um) other that u_s_s and the one land resort i think wildlife resort singapore maybe you can try everybody now going cycling at like #pulau-ubin# or coney island have you been to coney island
maybe can rent bike because i don't know if kat situ macam ada tempat rental bike [kan] macam east coast park [kan] ada tapi i dengar east coast park pun tutup pasal banyak orang ramai sangat orang kat situ
same
other than work [ah] (hmm)
nothing much [lah] actually i just want find work cause i want get the money and also to pass by time cause like you said at home stare back then like keep ordering food [ah] become fat you know during this whole circuit breaker
spend a lot bro you know i tell you before got the online concert right weekly basis got this different group my favourite group [lor] so like they all like inside a unit [tau] so they got four sub unit i pay each and every single one of them luckily my sister also pay with me pay half half [lor] !wah! but that [one] really hit it [eh] every week got concert my money gone [leh] then got merch some more merchandise !walao!
secondary school [ah]
ya ya why my softball teacher my c_c_a teacher !wah! [seh]
i don't know [leh] last i talk to him was in february i think cause i went down to school [lor] other than that not much [eh] cause his insta but never reply to d_m
[ah] dia macam dia macam mana nak cakap [ah] dia macam mysterious kau tahu tak dia mysterious abeh macam kau ajak [kan] dia macam tak comfortable gitu dengan lelaki [eh] dengan perempuan so kat dalam school context okay [ah] but outside school context aku tak tahu [ah] tapi aku punya cikgu yang lagi satu kau tahu yang yang teacher tu aku nak jumpa tapi aku macam #paiseh# aku tak tahu nak ajak dia keluar ke tak
literature
tu pun aku dah lama tak jumpa last aku jumpa pun february yang aku turun sekolah abeh then then hari tu aku nak wish happy teacher's day pun aku lupa
aku jumpa kau kat situ [pe] hari tu
aku tak ada sebab aku tengok c_c_a [jer] aku tak ada sebab serious aku suka turun bawa pasal aku punya c_c_a [kan] abeh aku sorang aku rasa abeh aku macam catch up [ah] dengan cikgu cikgu lain semua sekejap tapi other than that not much [ah] aku tak dapat aku ada number dorang [ah] tapi macam aku tak tahu kalau dorang save aku punya nombor ke tak ataupun dorang okay ke tak keluar dengan ex student tak tahu [ah] kau pernah nak ajak kau punya cikgu arts tak keluar
(um) [a'ah] [lah] dorang sekolah tapi lain lain tapi ada satu yang sama sama sekolah dengan aku (um) tapi dia different course [ah] dia masuk p_f_p dulu baru dia year one sekarang aku [kan] year two sekarang so tu [jer] [lah] yang sama yang lain semua a-level [ah]
[oh] yang a-level punya dah quite some time [ah] dia tak ada dia tak ada banyak masa [kan] sekarang dengan a-level dia so nak jumpa dia pun susah kau pula
kau punya kawan yang best friend kau dulu kat #tampines# [kan] jauh [kan]
cause [kan] one of my friends yang a-level dia dia sekolah dekat [jer] [ah] not that far so macam to me also can also pick a place to find a day then like we just you know we just compromise a bit [lor] but cause we not that far right so not too bad [ah] cause our group of friends then got three of us so
you got a lot of people right in your group of friends
(hmm)
surprisingly no [leh] i never met any of them outside school i've never seen them not even teachers i've never seen teachers outside school but right a bit a bit funny cause i got a teacher who live near me but i never see her before like i know she lives there i seen her once or twice in secondary school but now i never see them anymore
ya ya ya that [one]
i actually sometimes i want to see some teachers outside of school [lah] so like if i see them at least i can i got chance [mah] to say [eh] how you doing but because i never see them outside [ah] a bit #sian# [lor] then [lor] cannot catch up with them at all then macam susah [ah] gitu even during hari raya this year macam like nak gi [ah] apa rumah cikgu cikgu [kan] tak boleh pasal covid [kan] so tu pun nak catch up pun susah abeh bila catch up pun macam kalau nak catch up kat luar sekolah tak tahu kalau dorang nak ke tak pasal kebanyakan cikgu kita [kan] lelaki
zoom raya [ah] it was like (um) i got two session [ah] one with my mum side one with my dad side morning we meet my mum side cause [hor] but our my mum side not a lot of people so it was easy to coordinate just call i three pe~ three like three families [ah] like mine included [lor] but then my dad side [ah] eight siblings [eh] difficult [leh] then they all very they cannot hear one another

i cannot tahan [ah] i think [ah] i had to celebrate my birthday during circuit breaker like my birthday was right after the circuit breaker (um) announcement [ah] so a bit sad [ah] then like you know (uh) cannot have the big celebration like last time so i celebrate with my family [lor] but then i celebrate with my family also cannot do much cannot eat outside [mah] during that period of time so all order in [lor] then like a bit special kind of situation [lah] cause first time [mah] celebrate at home nobody else so okay [ah] not too bad [hor] how about you what is the most difficult part bila kau during circuit breaker
[ah] i drink bubble tea but like cause i a bit lactose intolerant so i can drink maybe like the small [one] if not like my stomach a bit upset so aku punya favourite bubble tea is called heytea dia cuma ada kat orchard dengan #jurong# so tak banyak sangat [ah] aku quite picky on aku punya bubble tea koi gong cha tu semua okay [ah] tapi aku lebih suka heytea it's more settling to my stomach kirakan so if i buy bubble tea i will buy kat orchard [ah] kat situ kalau dekat dekat dengan rumah aku gong cha [ah] tapi tu bila kakak aku belanja tapi aku sekarang dah tak suka bubble tea kau pernah try mister coconut
i always buy the standard shake with nata de coco fifty percent i now member [mah] so like i can the nudge you know so like when you collect the you buy the drink [ah] you collect the point then you can like off set when the next time you buy then you know last time during circuit breaker cause last time mister coconut and bubble tea all close right then you got see or not the trend they got buy the handmade liho then they make it at home you got see
you you you got try or not
[ah] no [ah] cause i find it a bit expensive also [ah] then like the bubble tea the boba [ah] the pearl [ah] a lot [leh] then i scared cannot finish then is is a it's like a golden pearl kind then i don't really like the golden pearl i only like the black pearl or the black sugar pearl [eh] brown sugar pearl
i got try [eh] playmade but i don't really like playmade [eh] to be honest cause [ah] their pearl is a different [ah] it's not tapioca pearl it's not like the normal pearl it's a different kind of pearl [lah] then i don't really like the taste [ah] then the i know everybody like playmade [ah] but like i find their pearl a bit a bit a bit questionable not to my taste bud [ah] probably probably you can try then you see then you tell me [lor]
yang colour pink yang mana satu
[oh] cause i go with my friend [ah] then my friend helped to pilih then you know she like a bit like a bubble tea expert [ah] she keep all the bubble tea chart all in singapore but then like (um) cause i wasn't that much of a bubble tea fan before so macam aku tak tahu apa aku nak beli abeh dia tolong aku dia tolong aku (um) pilihkan apa bubble tea like i think i tried the kalau aku tak salah aku tried the not the pink pearl [ah] i tried the tapioca pearl kot [oh] tak aku try yang black sesame pearl tu macam tak sedap sangat
aku rasa hey~ [eh] heytea pun macam quite expensive aku rasa depending on apa kau beli [ah] aku selalu beli brown sugar so heytea is about macam five eighty gitu then kalau kat chicha san chen kau pernah try chicha san chen tak
[oh] tu dia punya pearl very chewy very (um) sedap in my opinion tapi dia punya brown sugar nya tu macam macam macam susu [ah] basically dorang letak susu [jer] so but then i like their pearl [ah] not bad not bad sama dengan heytea tapi [kan] paling mahal [kan] is (uh) not too sure [eh] (hmm) maybe
maybe maybe koi aku dah lama tak tak try koi
aku tak suka pearl dia [ah] to be honest like i tried the pearl [ah] it's a bit i mean i cannot i cannot expect [lor] cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so (uh) i just anyhow [ah] but like i buy also i a bit scared to try the pearl pearl or like the normal bubble tea [lor] i always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo milo blended [ah] ice blended or something like that [ah] small like that [lor]
#shiok# bro #shiok# i tell you my favourite drink [ah] is horlick cause of that i i i cannot stop drinking horlicks [ah] i tell you is like !wah! out of the place [eh] my favourite drink now so like !wah! thinking about my school food [ah] !oof! now [ah] got halal #mala# also in one of the food court so not bad [ah] then their #mala# also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken [ah] suddenly come out [ah] after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces [eh] then we don't know where it go
then in another of our food court got like this one like food [ah] i think i think this other poly also have is like (um) indomie !wah! indomie goreng that [one] the best bro that [one] like my go to that one [ah] with horlicks !oof! me and my friend every day right every day buy that meal then you [leh] what's your favourite food in school

i saw their mcdonald's cone is seventy cent
actually (uh) i never really properly by iris only follow my friend maybe i should try one day then you [leh]
i think standard [ah] i think all poly also got subway and cheers also if i'm not wrong you school got cheers
i also know your school quite big then how [ah] if you late to school or like you #swee# #swee# you just [ah] you know five minute before school you reach then how [ah] you confirm late or not
actually not really [ah] honestly if i late to school then my my my my class at the end of the school [ah] only take me about ten~ five five minute to reach there so i can like speed walk then i can just reach earlier but it's quite quite space [ah] got a lot of big spaces [lor] but better [ah] than it being cramp i guess so like not too bad [ah] but still small [ah] but like spcious also to say the least if i'm not wrong also my school the smallest poly right
no [ah] #nanyang# #nanyang# bigger then then then then my school
honestly right (um) my first few days of school [ah] my first few weeks i cannot make it but then but then like afterwards like okay already [lor] (uh) but then like (uh) how to say [ah] your my school (um) some food court they two different lifts must take right specifically that [one] i a bit confusing [ah] and then the one behind my school is just the sports c_c_a centre so that [one] only if you got like c_c_a if you got like p_e like that [ah] like s_n_w then you go there [lor]
!wah! but then the downside of it right i must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold [leh] like i swear i don't wear jacket right i i i confirm i want like shiver till damn bad i tell you but then after lunch [ah] somehow [ah] the aircon a bit [leh] sekali become hot but maybe because of window open [ah] then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
(hmm)
sometimes ya [ah] cause like we want the space to study right after school [ah] cause we need the school wi-fi then [lor] all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late [ah] then they play their game i don't know league of legend or mobile legend [lor] then they take up the space in (um) in the library [eh] then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already [what] they we cannot tell them (uh) excuse me we need the table [mah] so just have to tahan [lor] like !wah! [leh] then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor [ah] sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port no charging port then laptop die [ah] g_g [ah] this kids [ah]
(um) honestly cause of covid right people will kick you out even if we are students right they don't allow us to like stay there so they like they say got one time the i saw the security uncle tell the person you you over here what you want do you got school or not then the person then the student the student was like no i want study then you should study at home [ah] the uncle was damn rude [eh] then cause the person was taking quite some time to pack right then he was like what you waiting for christmas is it !wah! like this security uncle cannot say nicely [meh] covid already then like be understanding [ah] we understand you got superiority but like
(hmm) cannot [ah] i think they will be stopped at the entrance i think like cause they wear uniform already [mah] then i don't think so they can go in so like i don't know i don't even think so they can cause nowadays when i go back to school some times i don't see them like coming over also then like i think it's (um) a a rule for them to go back home afterwards i don't know but either way also the place is crowded [lor] cause got student want to use the wi-fi for h_b_l [mah] ya
ya but like our table not so far apart (um) like they put us five people per table but like how to say [ah] (um) they so one metre one metre also the table but then now five people per table without the one metre ruling [mah] that [one] a bit [ah] cause my teacher sometime don't know if it's true or not so they ya but then also cause of the five people per table one metre away right my teacher also a bit more careful i guess but like [ah] don't know [ah] it's just a bit [lor]
(um) sometimes it cannot be helped [ah] because like m_r_t is m_r_t [mah] then everybody need to use it need to take it for for to travel to paxes cannot expect them take gojek and all the transport [mah] so like (um) sometimes cannot take it [ah] cannot be helped so like m_r_t public transport cannot be helped [ah]
a bit scared [ah] but like i said cannot help it like i a bit scared cause i live with my grandmother so it's (uh) the thing is more contagious to them you know more higher risk for them so sometimes i a bit scared [leh] but most of the time so you just go home you straight away bathe [lor] don't interact with other people i think that's the best ting to do [lor]
see uni cannot go out she every time got chance she go out you know how old people are you know how they are they cannot sit still [one] the always want go out like that then like most of time we tell her cannot [ah] cause a bit far the places she want to go like her sister's house at #bedok# [eh] a bit far then her sister also want bring her go mall and stuff but then my grandmother also a bit [ah] cause she you know got the safe entry all right then she like she like a bit lazy she don't know how to do the safe entry [mah] she find it very
ya [lah] typical she doesn't like to take bawa~ unless like she late [lor] then she take gojek [lor] or she take grab
no [ah] it's actually me i help her book then she just pay [lor]
nowadays got not much work from home [ah] but then rest of my family members all work like my sister now she in camp [ah] then the rest all is (um) cannot work from home [ah] so my mother my parents they go to work physically to you know earn the bucks
but i say [ah] she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also i got nothing to do [mah] so i sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the makanan now right very different it's like post post post covid like suddenly she add on i don't know what bunch of ingredient [ah] inside then all the masakan masakan lauk lauk yang dia buat [kan] semua macam different so macam dia ada add add extra ingredient kau tahu tak
lebih sedap ada [ah] tu memang [ah] tu standard tapi different tu different it's all macam [ah] how to say [ah] modified [ah] i guess
(uh) i actually don't mind [ah] cause she make food [mah] so i just eat whatever she cook [lor]
(hmm) [oh] i like soup [ah] so like my favourite will always be sup daging ataupun sup ayam but then sup ayam she tak buat sangat [ah] cause she say like a bit susah so tak tahu but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning [ah] she cook in the morning i sleep you know then i wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks [ah] i don't know if you got try before kuih keria !wah! that [one] i help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all i help her buy [ah] cause that's the least i can do [mah] then sheng siong also a bit a bit pity on her [ah] to go down buy stuff so i might as well just buy for her [lor]
dekat tu dekat [ah] jauh pun jauh cause i in the inside i the most inside the neighbourhood [mah] so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk [ah] don't want waste money buying~ don't want waste money buy [ah] apa sometimes take bus [ah] if i lazy want go home like that [ah] i take bus but other than that i walk [ah] walk faster
actually tak i go seorang
ya cause fast game [ah] just touch and go so i just go there then come back then like that [lor]
if i go school right i just buy something for breakfast then i go home to eat my grandmother lunch i don't like you know (uh) eat outside so that's the good thing [ah] i i get to save money like that
!wah! then especially are especially [hor] they tax you see what they could !wah! kung fu aunties anticipate at their excited one ya [ah] anyways [ah] i think it's time to let go i think we i think we are done catching up i think
nevermind give this person some time [ah] cause covid [mah] then the business never go up at least at least give them some some some money you know
ya serious [ah] whatever [lah] okay [lah]
kau buat apa the whole day
[oh] world of married
what is it about
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
[oh]
you know
lately right
i feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like #syamsul-yusof# right
i feel very sad for him [seh] cause like he's like my favourite
then bila i dapat tahu yang dia akan cerai with dia punya (uh) isteri right
it really make me feel sad cause i thought that was the love of his life [seh]
(hmm)
but i don't know [eh] cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if i'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then (um)
actually i don't know asal dorang break up [ah] [eh] asal dorang nak
cerai everything
but i just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
(uh) children i think one of it
(uh) is a guy one is a girl
then (um) i know #puteri# (uh) which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
(uh) divorce right
it really shows that
maybe #syamsul# did something [ah] but i don't know [seh]
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
i will i saw their like (um)
marriage and everything
and then actually (uh) on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick [eh] but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
!wah! if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
at that point of time yang aku rasa macam !wow! he found the one
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
[seh] like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya i guess
but you know
other than (um)
like #syamsul-yusof# all right
i also remember got this
i think
it was just berapa tahun yang lalu
you know #alif-aziz#
and bella ya i think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
i feel like #alif# is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love bella and bella has no choice cause bella is very soft
and i rasa macam
kalau i bella i pun maybe will do the same thing cause i'm stuck in that cycle
of loving someone who is
toxic
ya they got back together i think time bulan ramadan i think they got back together that which make me feel macam
why but then bella was saying like [oh]
don't [ah] jangan [lah] judge and everything then i was like (oo) okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
actually that time i terserempak dia then when i saw him right
i feel i don't feel (um)
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when i look at him i feel kesian cause he looks very like
(um) scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
(mm)
but i think it's also because (um) he
entah [lah] maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time i know [ah] dia kena tangkap pergi karaoke dengan like other girls
i mean the other girls were like not even
(um) saying sorry or anything
[oh] your hair
(um) i don't know [seh] i think you should just
buat kot cause like
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya i mean no harm trying [ah] sebab if you tak try then you'll never know what
ya so you should just go for it [ah]
i going school at i think i need to be in school by ten so i need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
[ah]
from ten to to ele~ [eh]
from ten to twelve i have like (uh) group consultation then from twelve onwards is (um) ten minute consultation with my professor then after that [dah] balik
ya
but i have a lot to do so
no [lah] like i can balik but at the same time macam i got like macam this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
(uh) should be kat rumah [lah] cause sekolah like
i don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
ya no fast (err) there's only one halal malay stall which is ayam penyet
(uh) okay [lah] but like i feel like s_p food is nicer
[ah] which make me feel so like
ya
i feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
but it's okay [lah] cause like most of my classes dia online
so kalau online then i just
foodpanda or what [ah]
ya
[oh] my dance classes [eh]
(um)
okay [lah] bila i first datang right
i feel a bit macam intimidated
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind i mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
(mmhmm)
asal you tak sabar i thought that
kalau you habis kerja then you don't know what what you gonna do with life
then isn't it better
to have like a sense of security kat sana
[oh] ya i don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay [lah]
you know
i feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
[ah] cause i rasa lonely kat sekolah
maybe but like i feel that everyone
macam cause most of kita nya classes online [kan] then dorang macam kita macam tak ada that common like bonding for us to make friends and ni ni semua
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they #chiong# last minute or what
i just feel
so lost
as in i #chiong# last minute but they all very studious like
the example [eh] macam kau ada assignment due on week seven
dorang [dah] habis week
three
or week four
macam #kanchiong# habis
i don't know [seh]
but ya and then
[oh] did i tell you i met
(uh) our soccer friends
dorang actually kat s_i_t sekarang
[ah] our captain remember
[ah] nama dia start with letter l
and dia punya kawan (uh) i think nama dia start letter b
ya
ya the same place as me [ah]
[ah] my our campus is
[ah] dover
ya
ya [oh] my god i was so happy when i saw them i like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
you know i i nak beli baju daripada shein you know shein
is like a
a website [ah] where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like i really need to look at the review [ah]
ya and i thought of buying it [ah] cause like
i feel like
i tak ada baju [seh] pergi sekolah
although i pergi sekolah dua hari [jer] every week
(mmhmm)
why fifty dollar quite a lot [what]
[oh]
but i think in your con~
in your like situation memang susah nak save [tau] actually
because you only receive like nine hundred [ah] spending money how to save
ya
[eh] i feel that the money that you have
for like kerja [kan] is just for you untuk
spend for the month
but like maybe okay [lah] not that
direct nine hundred [ah] but like
maybe one hundred you simpan
those kind of thing
you know i rasa macam this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya i i rasa macam i've been a snorlax for so long
then sekarang macam
baru bangun
[dah] bangun kena kerja keras pula tu
ya it's very hard
i mean
i think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
(mm) i like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
[orh] for #anas# [eh]
you know i feel [kan] untuk present kita nak beli present untuk lelaki memang susah sebab
lelakinya present selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu because lelaki dorang macam very practical
ya i mean i feel for #anas# right maybe you should get him clothes
i think it's safe to buy triple x_l [eh]
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
cause [eh] i haven't finish cakap [lah]
because
dia tak muat
okay then takpe kot
ya you can buy
can buy him sabun
ya i mean if you want it easy then just baju [eh] then just (uh) perfume [lah]
(uh) i think it's okay it's just sometimes dia very busy
and everything
i think
he's
struggling
in a way
but at the same time i rasa dia boleh [lah]
takde [lah] i mean
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya i mean he really has such a very packed schedule
i don't think he has time to meet people also
that time he met #dakshah# also sebab i tak free
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even #dakshah# had to ask him out
(mm)
ya that's true
depends [ah]
(uh) a bit of physics but other than that no
!huh! i very like packed with a lot of things [eh] i got c_c_a i struggling with school takde time [ah]
[oh] did mama tell you that
[oh]
but it's really difficult to ajar him [seh] cause
(mm)
ya i mean it really stems to your parents also [lah] i mean
i don't know i just feel that sometimes
(um)
parents dorang tak tahu tau yang actually macam mana nak handle budak-budak and everything
and then they just like feel yang cikgu yang akan
betul [kan] budak-budak punya pelajaran and stuff but
doesn't work that way you know
[oh] he's nice
i thought he like don't want to do work all
[oh] he did !huh! what did he do
[oh]
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
[orh] but how much were you paid per month
!huh! fifty [jer]
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
[oh] my god not worth it sis
i mean like
ya [lah] you can say like [oh] you want to help the child everything but !wow!
that progress and also the time spent right
is very taxing penat [seh]
i [ah] boleh
ya i mean people always cakap !alah! p_s_l_e [jer] [pe]
but p_s_l_e really marks where you can go
to secondary and secondary is like macam
the place where you
make it or break it [seh]
ya i mean
i'm kind of thankful yang kita pergi a secondary school
yang not that macam
#minahish# and stuff you know
cause i feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
!wah! like you can really see macam mana orang turn out to be [seh]
and all the mats and minahs and
the fact that they start smoking even during macam lower sec and doing a lot of other things
it's really scary
actually i scared [seh] sebab you know (uh) recently i nampak kat news [kan] macam
like you know all those
stomp news and everything
(um) the
budak kecil right [eh] not budak kecil [ah] like just like lower secondary everything
dorang (um) they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase [eh] like it's damn
scary [ah] that how young and how brave are you to do that
[oh] primary school pun
what
then if i put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
i wouldn't know how to deal with it [seh] like i feel that you are so young
and i feel that it's a lot to do with like
social media [ah] macam tiktok
instagram
you know all these kind of things
i'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever [seh]
ya cause like i feel
teachers
ya i mean i feel that
my secondary school is the reason why i have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
and i just tak faham [ah] cause like i remember that time
(err) ada cikgu ni dia datang kat
me and then macam cakap [lah] like [ah] jangan buat malu keluarga [ah] jaga maruah keluarga
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen i was very affected by it
and then dia macam cakap [ah] macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua then i just feel that (err) they don't really understand
and then they just (um) try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know i'm actually quite surprised
cause secondary school [kan] kita tak pernah lambat [seh] kita cuma lambat on the last day of school
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
#afif# tak pernah lambat [ah]
secondary school
[oh] but i thought
but i thought we always go to school together
[oh]
[oh] my gosh okay
[ah] why he like that [seh]
you reminded me of our netball coach
dia pun lagi satu toxic nya orang dalam hidup
how old was she [ah] when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
!wah! early twenties then she act until like that
[oh]
she's another reason why i feel like i have anxiety
cause of her macam
i can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
i couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
[oh] when was i there
[oh]
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with [seh]
(mm)
[oh] my god ya it was during like the
(um)
exam [kan]
ya i cannot [seh] dia seriously something wrong with her
i mean how we've been overworked
i mean if you realize like those macam
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
there were like macam camne nak cakap [eh]
i feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
[oh] i know i know
she chinese that one right
ya i remember her [oh] my god
(err)
ya i didn't join any sports
just
i mean she gave me a lot of trauma [lah] to be honest
(mm)
(mm) you know i rasa [kan] the best coach yang i ada right was actually my singapore poly nya coach they were really like
so supportive and stuff
and although i macam tak datang training atau i not that good [kan] dorang still never stop believing in me [seh]
and then dorang always cakap macam [oh] #ayra# you can do this blah blah blah like that
ya
i mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise [kan] actually tak healthy gila [seh]
flowers kenapa you ingat birthday i ke
i
i suka (um)
actually i suka mixed [ah] you know i'm over the years i get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right i keep looking at macam
i don't know if you know this instagram [ah] it's called sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
i mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever nanti dorang letak dalam satu bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower yang macam yellow colour everything then you have like macam
blue colour of flowers and i and then macam ada purple sikit and then i rasa macam [oh] my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a macam
you know macam brown packaging gitu
ya
[oh] actually [kan] i takut [seh] nak simpan flowers so i i hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday
ya that time bila i simpan flowers [kan] banyak cicak masuk bilik i [seh]
cicak lipas then flies
ya
wilt wilted [eh]
wilting [eh]
ya
but you know [ah] i don't know if you pernah dengar there's this cafe called antea social
and
ya but the anti is spelled as a n t e a
ya
but it's not i don't think it's halal [lah] but then
they brew their coffee [eh] no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
and then they sell like cakes [ah] [oh] my god bila i nampak i macam !whoa! macam sedap [jer]
macam nak pergi [seh] but confirm mahal
[a'ah] singapore
!huh! why you ask me that
[oh] (um)
!haiya! for me
(hmm) let me think
actually
i know that
if i cannot like macam give birth or what right
i should be open to having anak angkat [ah] cause like
like if especially if my husband wants a child
but at the same time i feel i don't know why but i feel macam tak comfortable
ya
ya i tak comfortable i think in a way because like
i mean like you can always say [oh] i will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
pers~ someone punya
that's why
[ah]
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head [ah]
ke~ kenapa would you consider
[ah]
ya
i i don't know [ah]
but
this says something about
i mean
i'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
but would you nak sim~ would you simpan like cat or whatever pet
you love cats
ya you know last time i thought that maybe i can [ah] pelihara like
kucing when i [dah] besar but when i think about it right
i don't think i will cause
i need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and i don't think i have the energy to do that
(mm)
i don't know [seh] it really depends [ah] whether i have time to jaga them or not

(uh) ya it's true [ah] yang dorang patut be to be at the in the wild and everything but i also feel that
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild

(err) you know [lah] pasal
covid you know (err) i think the last one kita met was probably before
covid right it was (uh) kau datang sini (um)
the recording yang aku nak nak minta kau tolong untuk aku pergi u_s
and then that is probably the last
is there anymore yang kau datang rehearsal is there any rehearsal
yes
march
(mm)
ya
betul
(mm) lama [ah] about diam tak diam dah
six months [eh]
[ah] dah enam bulan [ah]
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
so ya tapi dah [oh] no dengan ayah tu is probably when (uh) #farhan# [ah]
kita nak work on lagu #farhan# ya
but ya i mean (err)
aku kind of tengah
(uh) basically
tak ada tak ada majority things yang come to aku punya (err) aku punya life
(err)
i've now baru start main bicycle (err) aku baru beli bicycle (err) a cruiser
(err) aku just pergi cruising around dengan family aku
(err) other than that aku rasa aku working on some project macam
songs and what not and then
aku been doing a lot of (err) things kat
(err) studio
(um)
aku rasa
(err) nothing fantastic yang aku rasa tengah going on
which is (err) [ah] tapi
aku rasa tenang [ah] macam biasa [ah]
tenang [ah] so more more of and more more upcoming projects
yang akan kami you know macam
(err)
but paling boring is (err) tak dapat pergi (err) seberang tambak [ah]
itu yang paling boring [ah] pada aku for the past six months ini
ya
sebab member member yang kat sana semua tengah tunggu aku juga
so ya
bila kau nak ikut
!huh!
[ah]
[ah] aku suppose i think (err) i think (err) dia bukan
[ah] maybe maybe betul pada kau macam in thing sebab semua orang
but the point is sebab tak ada
tak ada activity yang duk~ tak boleh keluar negeri jadi
that is the whole why everybody was into that and the thing is juga
it's the best time untuk nak explore and then kita are much more older right now
i guess it's the exploration yang
it will stop orang kata macam
kalau dulu lepas sekolah
i mean time sekolah kita [kan] dulu explore kat bawah block lepas itu pergi jauh-jauh
lepas itu mungkin ada orang
(err) main
main tangkap spider at some point of time [kan] kita orang dah malas buat benda ni because yat~ kita nak kerja
so when kita dah kerja probably kita jumpa somebody
(err) bila (mm) jumpa kawan
[ah] nonsense buat nonsense nonsense punya barang then
aku rasa at this point of time pasal kita orang kena
tersekat dekat negeri
jadi mungkin aku rasa that's the best time untuk (um) beriadah [ah]
untuk just do leisure out of
kau punya own comfort zone jadi this is the best time untuk kau come back to kau punya
(err) youth balik ke
you know where kau kau missing out
[ah] and aku rasa it's a good good good thing juga with this (um)
with this (err) pandemic because
aku rasa kita will tend to macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita itself
ada this tempat ada that tempat ada
then kita pun tahu yang macam okay kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat right now apart from just makan
kita start to do cycling will start to explore macam
(um) tempat-tempat yang kita tak pernah pergi before
[ah] so aku rasa
it's good juga [ah]
but (err) pri~ kalau kau cakap about that is the the the in thing right now
probably ya probably
but not just ak~ aku rasa ada orang pun buat not just (err) cycling tahu
some people go to macritchie i mean we we've seen that before
but randomly but now is macam semua orang dah start to macam even
(uh) explore our own country punya whatever yang ada kat dalam [ah] not just bab makan [jer]
apasal kau tak nak main basikal
ya i mean yang kalau kau cakap pasal longkang it's definitely
at this point of time tak ada [lah] semua orang nak masuk longkang
tak ada [lah] semua orang nak masuk longkang tapi
but if there if there are thing macam tu aku rasa there will be possibilities pun pasal
pasal it's not macam something yang apa
something yang (err)
normal but aku rasa
might never know longkang tu pergi mana sekarang semua orang banyak go on the p_c_n tahu
macam kira park connector punya
and then
like recently aku just started cycle daripada where aku [ah]
from #hougang# all the way to #bukit-batok# via p_c_n
yes and it was actually pada aku macam
[oh] and then kau tak kau tak nak explore right macam
so dude during that that that exploration tu
(err) aku from #hougang# going to #bukit-batok# (um) go through macam
and you (err) you wouldn't you wouldn't realize ya macam
the park connectors are macam really boleh bawa kau macam daripada (um)
clarke quay
or daripada wherever daripada sini pun daripada p_c_n
all the way boleh sampai ke clarke quay
clarke quay all the down all the way sampai dekat queenstown
from queenstown keluar pergi dekat #buona-vista#
from #buona vista# all the way pergi #bukit-batok# how's [ah]
how far is that how far is that
ya but the thing is the thing is that is going from the west side
going from the east side aku tak tahu there are such a thing macam itu tak
[ah] wa~ was it macam dah start p_c_n dekat (uh) east area becau~ boleh kau realize tak
okay tak
i mean kau kau dah pergi [ah] juga p_c_n tu ke ataupun kau
pass by ke kau jogging ke tak ataupun kau nampak [jer]
[oh] so sudah sudah kau sudah use that [lah] p_c_n dekat
[ah]
then daripada daripada (uh)

i think [ah] (err)
the age is also catching up
so (um) before i think like (um)
when you were in your mid twenties gitu
(uh) you can you can apply any job you want but
i i don't know i don't know whether (err) if this is
true to everyone [ah] but i think
(err) cause i ever applied like (um) just some jobs
you know like (err)
just out of curiosity
i don't think
(mm) dia orang you know they they they they they even like
(err) reply me at all i don't know whe~ what went wrong [ah] probably
(err)
my my resume is (err) nonsense
(err) you know or or it's just that
my experience are no experience at all
but (err) then i i found out again like probably it's
the age is also catching up [ah]
so
ya probably that
ya but i mean (err)
don't
don't don't let down [lah] you know i mean don't
don't
don't (uh) what
ya [lah] don't give up [lah] just
send [lah] you know
you send i mean [ah] for me i'm not sending like one thousand
(err) resume out but before like
whenever i send you know like
three four
maybe one or two will come back [ah] but
nowadays like even if you send about fifteen
none of that like come back so
ya [lah] (err) #zul# (um)
like now [kan] macam
with all these things that happened
you wish you can
go back in time tak
but you hav~ but you have the experience [sial]
you have the experience wh~ why why you why you scared
why you scared about all that that that you know like
i think just (err)
chin up put your chin up and and (um)
ya look on the brighter side [lah] you know because
they can be young
but
you ate the chilli first so ya
ya
[ah]
really [meh]
anyhow
[eh] [ah] #zul#
kau tak nak tak suka pergi east coast
kau rasa kau ada kau rasa kau ada penyakit tak with that
[ah] because there are some people who don't
tak [ah] i mean aku cakap dengan kau pasal there are some people who
(um)
tak mandi (err) would would find themselves
it's actually bukan #rabak# [ah] punya penyakit it's just that something yang
yang fa~ penyakit yang tak familiar [ah] but you have that you know
(mm)
!huh! it's not it's not a bad punya ini [lah] maksud aku macam kadang-kadang [kan] macam
ada orang (uh) tak boleh main dekat
(err) tak boleh main dekat rumput
nanti kalau tidak dia orang gatal-gatal
ada so itu penyakit
jadi yang macam kau mungkin kau
mungkin pada kau it's something yang
macam orang tak familiar macam mungkin pada kau orang rasa kau macam leceh
tapi sebenarnya it's (um)
it's actually (err)
benda tu mungkin macam
di~ dia memang leceh tapi persoalannya is
bukan pasal tu it's actually memang
it will affect kau punya
mood it will affect kau punya the the the
day yang kau bangun the next day it will affect macam
kau rasa (um)
you don't feel good about it so
ya it's as good as macam kau
might have a macam a feeling yang macam can occur sampai (err)
macam
tak sedap [ah] you know tak sedap badan
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
tak [lah] tak [lah] pasal aku aku just wonder [lah] pasal kadang-kadang [kan] kenapa aku cakap east coast [kan] randomly juga pasal [kan]
(err) ya [lah] all this tempat or all this
things yang kita buat ni [kan] semua macam relate to apa yang aku dengan kau
boleh buat macam east coast was probably buat lagu
cause i guess macam tenang
tapi macam kadang-kadang (um) tenang but
in the night probably kalau ada kereta
kalau tak ada kereta (um)
then nak patah balik nak tidur you know macam ak~ you know
pagi pagi [jer] dah #sian# macam kira sudah pukul
pukul tiga pukul empat atau especially when the
sun is macam really on top of us memang take it will be like macam
wa~ yo~ tu~ ya kau
it was really it was really macam pain [lah] tapi kalau
kalau ada kenderaan you know (um) senang sikit [kan]
macam ataupun macam tak overnight [lah] you know grab or what not
so ya [lah] and yang macam
all these benda benda yang macam (um)
(err) exploration ini semua [kan] macam as kita grow
so
like aku rasa ini semua macam
things yang (uh) a cycle [eh]
[ah]
and
kita cakap right now is like kau going to almost
(err) reaching kau punya four digits
and what will be another twenty
ya aku sudah aku sudah forty ya
laid back
more chillax
chillax
habis yang yang baru-baru ni semua kira time dekat covid tu
kau just stay rumah ke ke kau ada cabut juga pergi mana-mana
ya
kau takut tak time yang lockdown
takut maksud aku macam
what if it's really really apocalypse [ah]
pernah ada kau pernah ada sampai itu mentality tak
meaning macam really semua orang dah sakit and then
(um) went up to kau punya house ketuk ketuk ketuk ketuk macam zombie [eh] kita cakap macam
macam that kind [ah] lepas tu sekali macam
macam [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh]
open [ah] lepas tu macam [eh]
boy [ah] open [ah] itu macam that kind of thing [ah]
nonsense [kan]
but this was before yang the first phase was the one yang
tak ada chance untuk keluar pun [kan]
[kan] that first few weeks [kan] at least a month tak keluar [kan]
so this phase two yang that one month tu
tak [kan] yang kedai-kedai gunting pun
ya [kan]
ya circuit breaker
like i think we were talking about circuit breaker itself
phase one was later on
yes and then ada phase two right
ya so this was macam the first
first few days yang when dia orang announce tak boleh keluar
[ah]
okay [ah] (err)
[ah] aku was having so much (err) banyak banyak (um)
kind of macam (err) slowly slowly became macam
spending [sia]
dalam diam aku did a lot of shopping you know macam
macam online shopping which is aku never that did did that before [ah] but i really did [ah]
and then ya it was really macam
like any other day any other day it was just macam two dollar punya shopee
three dollar punya stuff and then every
like every two three days mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku [eh]
but ya [lah] it was really funny that aku (err) ada that phase [ah]
because aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat [eh]
(mm) i mean being apa yang engkau nak buat
and then kita orang tak ada that that that that
tanah lapang you know we don't have a big (um)
big land to
to play around to to run around
[ah]
kalau kau nak pergi luar to check people out pun macam
and the road was empty the whole street was lonely
[ah]
aku rasa that that experience was really macam best untuk aku [ah]
and then because aku pun ada at some point of time
(err) during that circuit time pun aku hantar
aku punya aku punya senior aku punya dad dekat hospital jadi
aku saw how the street are lonely
till it go into phase one
and then yes
phase one is when everybody macam really macam
sudah come back to macam you know
(um) lively [ah]
[ah]
i think yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka
[ah]
but ya
but i think during cir~ (err)
during c_b (err) apa (err)
during (err) circuit breaker punya time pun i think (um)
i did walk around [lah] macam pergi mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then i saw the whole thing [ah] macam
!wow!
it was really macam almost to
almost to macam
being in the eighties balik where there is not much people around
(err)
but at the same time pun macam lonely juga
[ah]
ya
ya
i think it's okay if we are younger
because kita pun will be hide inside
you know macam it's okay if you're younger
but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have (um)
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then (um)
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown [ah] and then ya
semua benda boleh boleh change kalau tak betul-betul le~ you can change you punya
perspective you can be
crazy also juga [kan]
right i mean
but we we are alright with that we~ we've we've
we've done that with our music life we've we've we used to be isolations
ya
so ya [lah] but still pun
ac~ the effects are there [lah] you know
[ah] the effect and i just macam for the
tak tahu how it will go on [lah] but i guess
this is one part of our life yang kita jumpa [ah] you know
(err) i don't think
it might happen again or it might happen again but lagi more [ah]
[kan]
kerja [ah] it's not no work you know affected
aku rasa it's (err) more of (err)
more of (err) like going through a war
tapi it's not the war of bombing [lah] gitu
it's macam (um)
macam (um)
it's macam
a smooth war [ah] you know a smooth war that macam
kita tak boleh expect that you know
kita tak boleh expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone macam
tak ada kerja or probably macam
not not like before this you know
where everyone was really macam
constantly (err) doing things
be it (err)
kerja atau tak kerja [lah]
[ah] but now is macam
(err)
you know all being (um)
stopped i would say that
ya
or or or the environment
or the environment macam play (err) (err)
make them to kind of macam stop from
[oh] itu [lah] itu [lah] (um)
aku pun macam kira macam !wow! after all these years (err)
of going through [eh] (err) things (um)
i i was having a conversation the other day balik pada macam
[ah] the things that we do
[ah] you know macam (err) you know talking about
music in general macam macam (err) the whole world right now is (err) having
or the whole creative punya line in the whole wide world is (um)
is (err) not doing very well right
habis aku was just (err) bagi tahu
(err) #deedee# the other day a friend of kau tahu #deedee# [lah] [kan]
so aku bagi tahu #deedee# about macam you know the rest of the world
(um) especially macam dekat u_s and what not
they had an industry and the thing is
dia orang punya creative was kind of macam stopped right now
and kind of stopped or or or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
kita orang was that macam kita orang tak ada industry and kita orang nak kena stop juga
so macam you get what i mean it's like macam (um)
macam ya [lah]
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
but kita orang kind of tak ada industry
pun nak kena stop juga sama macam dia orang
and lagi teruk
(ugh)
ya ya ya all the big (err) bars club
ya i mean but what lucky enough juga what if kalau kau dah baru graduate
kau baru graduate last year probably baru nak start kerja dah
you know but now lucky enough macam kau ada time untuk breather you know a bit breather and
(um)
chill a little bit and them (um)
you can have time untuk
see what's going on and then from there
(err)
come to a point whether
apa kau nak buat ready untuk next you know
because right now also everything macam kau was talking about
(uh) all this macam kerja dekat dalam studio
and what not
and you know right now everyone was really macam
(mm) really macam
ya [lah] tak tak boleh go out for
for in the studio pun kalau tak betul-betul
and even now the studio are all not operating pun
ya it's like the same thing like what happened dekat ini juga
time (um) everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
crazy times juga
(uh) for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not (um)
youtube just used whatever content you know macam
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if if you look like really really close
(um)
ya semua orang macam
anyhow [ah] kira macam sembarang [ah] kira (uh) it's ya
it was haywire napster coming in you know
[ah] it was for for for consumer they will like it [ah]
but people who produce it people who
who you know
and even macam sekarang ini macam netflix and there are big big (err)
(mm) you know big (err) movie affected by
but how they going to use all these macam despite of time
you know macam how can they macam selit how can they like you know (err)
whack or or or
or just like (um) be part of
this you know like just come in and slide in
ya i mean
there will be light there will be light
aku i'm very sure there will be there will be light somewhere
it's just that macam
(um)
aku rasa don't don't don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you tak macam
tak ada benda yang yang kau belajar
th~ but the thing is take it as if macam there's a new skill yang kau belajar
apart from that probably (um)
like also kau kena ingat juga since kau cakap video dah ada
aku rasa you should share it [ah] you know macam
share it because ya
ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
[ah] ya
i mean it's just only one game so
i think
that's a little bit too much
because like ya macam
okay [ah] i mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use [ah]
like you can't really copyright that shit
[eh] fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
(err) ya i think that's different
(mm) fair
asal pula
(oo) ya okay i get it i get it
is it not bad [sia]
i mean i mean at that price range quite affordable already [sia] considering like
okay [lah] okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
[ah] (uh huh)
is is like apa
(err) it's like p_s five in india
somebody dekat dalam kat india
somebody copy [eh] copyrighted [ah] ya copyrighted [ah]
somebody copyrighted p_s five so
p_s five they sony can't release p_s five as p_s five in india because it's copyrighted
how i know
th~ i mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then sony sony will try to
probably [ah] i think
probably will try to buy it off the person [ah]
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
i mean iphone punya itu okay [lah] no i mean iphone bad examples because they already copyrighted all the
all the way the series so like in that same vein you can actually do that ya like if you wanted money [ah] you know unless dia orang macam like [ah] okay [ah] kita skip one generation that kind of thing so it will be very weird it will be like
p_s one two three four
then five is apa roman numerical v
bodoh
[ah] ya and it's sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
[oh] p_s four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya [lah] you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create [ah] create [ah] you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay [ah] it was rocky [ah]
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better [ah]
i mean it's just a brand name only [ah] at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like (oo) look at this razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive [ah] but then it's like
bodoh
[eh] [ah] no i'm not about that life man
man
no [ah] not about their life or i mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya [lah] i mean it is a gaming peripheral [ah] but still like
at least limit it [ah] like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy razer they would be like [oh] razer
and then it i~ you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that [one] by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
[eh] that kind
[ah]
i mean i have tukar topik [ah] like i have troubles
with my current night shift
cannot [sia] boring gila [siol]
boring gila
like at least in my previous company right night shift i had something to do
like i'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this [one] is like i'm sitting in front of the computer like [oh] my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay [lah] like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the [one] that you are looking at this the second [one]
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit [lah] like
whoever [ah] whoever say something right then (err) or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job [ah] and then like cannot [ah]
you know i'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring [siol]
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that i don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that i work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
i still get paid
ya [lah] no [lah] leave
unpaid is
i think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
(uh) i can't even take leave at this point
i mean i can [ah] but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay [ah] depends on the company [lah] but this is this is one of those that is three months then i get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense [ah] but
the travel expense though it's free
no that's the thing the other thing is i have to clarify was apa this transport allowance right
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by ez-link right [ah] i thought can but no
but
ya i got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance [ah] you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya i mean i mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything [ah]
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
i mean you can't i can't
it states there in the contract that i can [ah]
let anyone use the thing
[sial] [ah] i have i have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me [ah]
no [lah] it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
i mean like [eh] there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like (err) if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that i'm travelling
(uh) all these places and i'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because i'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras [ah]
like i'm just saying there's
there's (uh)
hidden thing to it [lah] like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
gaji then like for what [sia]
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply [ah]
no [ah]
like where the hell am i supposed to go [sia] if i'm watching cameras all day
i mean can [ah] can is can [ah] like the
like the the the culture quite laid back quite lepak [ah] considering like anytime you can just ask somebody to cover for you because they all like okay
you work in shifts then after you work morning then cukup time dah lapar [eh]
kau nak apa apa tak kat kedai #kopi#
aku nak gi
then take orders [ah] #teh# #teh# #kopi# ni itu
then if tak then order from grab
i mean the
no [ah]
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the off~ no you eat there in the !oops! room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
(uh) i mean it's true [ah] i can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that [one] then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before [lah] but
the during the kerja but sometimes
ya that's true
i mean i already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that i didn't expect from this [ah] job
because dia punya tempat kat town
then usually town food bloody expensive
so i got chicken rice three fifty
like [sial] [ah] where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
okay [ah] don't say town [lah] #ulu# punya tempat pun susah nak cari three fifty like
(uh) ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is [ah] but yet
i mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days als~ a few days ago also
[ah] zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries i mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
a saman so to speak
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya [lah]
[eh] no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
s_h_n is
fourteen days [siol] i think you just swab test to say that you are not you i mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
it's it's set for their citizen [ah] i think kena saman
okay [ah] not really okay [ah]
the saman saman is a is a wrong choice of word [ah] (err) it's more of (err) ya
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that [lah] like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
but it's not a saman
something like that
ya i mean that's true
it's like what (uh)
i heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya i know
two thousand plus i think
(uh) i think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay [ah]
[eh] but then new zealand that time got (uh) recently i think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
i mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive [ah]
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst i'm i was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like i mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see [lah] what happened now
three hundred thousand already
(uh huh)
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three thou~ three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see [eh] go into the a&e
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
[ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like [sial] [ah]
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit [sia] like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
(oo)
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest [what] so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya [lah] i mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only [ah] i mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything [ah]
ya
okay
really
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
ya #borat# is #borat# [lah] so
i wonder if they edited that out
(uh huh)
i mean to be f~ okay [ah] no [ah]
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find i don't know i think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is [ah] but you know it's fucking video proof [ah] like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
i don't know which state
said that
(uh) they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
i don't know [lah] which state [ah] one of the judge [lah] they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like i mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is [ah]
[ah]
no comments no comments
in othe~
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for #taiwan# soon
i think world war three should start soon
(err) china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to #taiwan# right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit #taiwan# [ah]
i mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
[eh] ya
i mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
#taiwan# is part of china and then
i mean ya [lah] like
and they could have just let #taiwan#
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of #taiwan# like no
i think they call them (uh) d d c p right [eh] no d c c
[oh] !wow!
i mean #taiwan# is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay i mean
okay let's be let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay [lah]
that [one] no comments [ah] ya
it has it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
legit [ah]
[oh] !wow!
bodoh
(uh huh)
!ee! [ah] ya
that's malaysia

ya
you all busy fighting each other also [lah]
[kan]
ya [sia] all those all those [ah] grab drivers top up from j_b semua they like bloody salty [lah] [sia]
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
all this ni semua nak tak nak [jer]
abeh dah malas nak buat apa
[oh] speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay [ah] it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
[kan] i mean already is sinking
that's what i'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying i'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
[ah]
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
[oh] obama punya tu toast invited obama to play among us
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part i know but now i
i didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that [lah] but okay [ah] there are the backwater parts [ah]
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just i think this happen only because
one of the siapa [eh]
crap i forgot i don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
a o c
a o c
nah
yup
week
[sial] [ah]
(uh huh)
it's basic human nature [lah] what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you [eh]
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
banyak kau punya millions
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya [lah]
okay
(uh huh)
okay
!wow!
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions [ah]
differently
ya
ya i mean
it is it is what it is [ah] it's his style
either way it [eh] no i mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what i've said is correct
then you just have to believe [eh]
we might as well be
#kim-jong-un#
[oh] my god i don't know [ah] [sia]
it was but is a guy he say i love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
nak buat [sia]
and that that is trump in a nutshell [lah] [eh]
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing [oh] i do (uh) money money money lagging
[oh] !wow!
correct
yup
i don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care [ah]
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the c_b period
that [one] terrible [siol] like
only essential workers [what]
me [ah]
then like yours truly [ah]
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
[ah] rental punya tu
they got
it's not even that much [sia]
taxi yes grab no grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like [sial] [ah] they can [sial] [ah] that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the c_b period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should i drive around when i need to pay for the fuel later so i just wait there
where as the grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that i was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during c_b period [sial] [ah] how to earn fifty [sia]
okay [ah] not not everyone can [ah] but that's why that's why during c_b i had the same driver a week straight [sia]
he live somewhere [ah] there like nine hundred plus there i think
then everytime i book [eh] same guy tomorrow [eh] same guy
but padehal he just like on the app lepak kat rumah then tunggu ada call [jer] the [eh] bro i on the way [eh]
then like [ah] sorry [ah] bro ada benda boleh tunggu ten minutes tak
and like okay [ah] ten minutes only [what] not like i going anywhere i just take like for grab
i don't i'm not really that
picky or like in a rush kind of thing cause you know i i go out early then i don't sampai kerja like on time on time i always sampai kerja with a lot of time still like half an hour before
that kind of shit [lah] so like i don't really care will have to wait extra just for the grab to sampai
no it's like i'm there i'm just waiting you pick me up go dah sampai kerja buat kerja but then it's like ya
like unless on that day i overslept or something
then like shit i need to go now i need to go i need to sampai like right now
rare [ah] but then only then i will cancel
but then other than that no [ah]
if not nak kena tunggu lama [siol] or the the best the best that i got (uh) book
the punya g_p_s say ten minutes
it was at #boon-lay#
[ah] around that area tunggu tunggu tunggu tak sampai sampai the car not even moving
don't know call call message
everything no reply
[siol] then i like what the fuck [sial] wait here half an hour already [siol] then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing [sia] cancel
no [ah]
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already [sia]
[kan]
then like gi mampos [ah]
just cancel get a new [one]
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
(uh)
okay [lah] ya there's there's the more apt way to say it [lah]
asal [kan] makanan sampai boleh makan dah cukup that kind of thing
like no see that's the thing there's a lot of patient customers out there like kalau kau ajak fight dah dua jam then tu lain cerita [ah] or the worse [one] is
you collect the food already
you collect the food already dah sampai right
then you put delivered
then takde the food not there
#sot# [sia] tu
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
okay makanan dah sampai the thing says okay delivered buka pintu
mana makanan dia
then like [eh] [sial] [ah] kena scam
[oh] ya ya ya ya
then terus dia keluar [kan] pizza makan
tu memang ajak fight
ya
or those people in p_m_d i mean the disabled people
(hmm)
[ah]
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift [what]
like rare you find
that that [one] is dorms
[eh] well
service industry [lah] [eh]
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit [ah] you get that kind of shit [ah]
you is body disease

bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
okay [ah] suka hati korang [ah] [ah] you want to stock up i don't know how many
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
okay [ah] suka hati [ah]
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it [ah]
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
cause malam is when all the supplies masuk [pe]
then ya all the vendors datang then they take stock and all that nonsense usually it's like right now currently [ah] is like
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night [ah]
cause
takde orang
(mm)
[ah]
okay [lah] i mean
the one that i went to was somewhat like this
[ah] #gek-poh# punya prime small-ish [ah] so like [ah] there's not
there's only one entrance and one exit [lah] so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
then takde cashier
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell [ah] got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell

bodoh it's fucking bodoh
that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you [eh] not the six hundred m_l no
one point five litre
i tell you which driver tak mengamok if they get that kind of thing
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world i mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
[ah]
like okay [ah] if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then i would understand [ah] but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like [eh] !siala!
this thing [ah] like that like that like that
then like
bodoh [ah] it's just bodoh

okay like this it's so hot
okay i should try editing it with light room
[oh] look like
pelik [sia]
okay like this
should i edit it out
okay
damn sticker
(oh)
okay
okay later i will edit i will try to edit with lightroom so nampak macam
i because i i used i edit like preset on my lightroom punya account
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like vsco
vsco has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what i did
is is more like untuk photographer [sia]
but you can learn [ah] it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone i posted it's so h_d i love it [sia] no that is the only picture that is h d because i used lightroom
apparently i guess like depends on how much how much filter how much (um) you edit [ah]
like your preset the macam
the higher your
your saturation (err) contrast and all that right
the worst the h~ the quality would be i it instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on instagram
the qua~ the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less h_d
ya
that's why that's why if you when i updated pictures in vsco right mine look nice on vsco but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of (um) effect and then like the effect you put how high it is [ah] technically
[kan] and that's what my photographer friend said [ah] and i was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's ri~ that's why
i'm so tired
don't waste money
[oh] is my card with you
okay
(mm)
ya same as you right
[oh]
[eh] wai~ but if i end late
if i end like late i cannot take m_r_t [what]
like if i end before eleven forty five
(mm)
but will that minus off like my pay
(oh) okay that is nice
(mmhmm)
it just enough time for me to take m_r_t home [lah]
so like can i have to go back to orchard
[oh] [oh] the stop the bus
tak de bus stop dekat somerset somerset also will be easier [ah] because like somerset have take
then i stop at #dhoby-ghaut#
[ah]
duduk sana [ah] depan laboratory kita why we sitting here
(uh huh)
nice i mean at least better than smiggle
ya why why would you even put like six cents
they say they want to increase my pay after like
whatever whatever but they didn't even do that
i'm so tired what the shit
okay i can't wait to watch my netflix
aku semalam tak pergi sekolah [kan] i literally stay at home and watch #anime# ya

[oh] my god it was so good [kan] then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then !ee!
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
and technically the anak is a princess
i mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood [lah] because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner like commoner bu~
dia punya sister the cousin-in-law is a princess then got married to another prince then after that she became like this the lady in charge of all the princess and the kings punya mandi mandi and stuff

because tempat dia pun kecil even at the two storey two storey room is small ya like when yo go inside the room right
you didn't have like t_v toilet sofa balcony then you go up it's just the beds
ya so it's nothing much ya ya ya it's like it's like studio m but maybe slightly smaller i think because of the area and then more hipster

ya [sia] but okay [lah] she was drunk so
(mm)
(um) sure
three a_m [oh] my god so so lambat

[kan] asian moms okay [lah] it's not a bad thing [lah] but sometimes it is
ya
but one point eight k is too much [ah] honestly
(um) not bad what you have to consider you have to consider your gaji you have to consider how much you have to set aside for like is being cut for example your food your home utilities
but that's not possible for a graduate student like just finish schools kind of
ya [sia] i mean like the most we can get is two point two i mean like that's the standard diploma
salary i think
true but you have to work [lah]
why not you rent your at your brother's house
he has a room what and the child is small
she doesn't need her own room yet
i mean like you cannot live there for technically like for free free apa you have to help out also right
ya but you are still living in the same quarters
so you have to actually do a little bit of chores
why would you even do that
i can't wait for my sister to have her own house
i mean i think she has or maybe like she contacting somebody i don't know [oh] my god it's so annoying tengok besar [sia] this is my stomach

ya but i wasn't exercising last year also not as much as year one
i think it's because of weight gain

honestly i don't know
she didn't really starve [lah] i think she just i don't know she just eat lesser she don't eat dinner ya she only eat lunch
tak tahu apparently when she eat the trufitz is it helps to curb her appetite

but but it's true [ah] when you eat the trufitz
kau takkan lapar because i ate that for like one week [what] and it does help !wah! i don't eat a lot in during lunch i don't eat a lot during dinner

anak pun dah dua macam okay [lah] you know what i'm just gonna be like him [lah] he he is a major in (err) i think major sergeant [ah] i don't know in n_s in his army ya cause he signed on ya
that [one] is navy navy lagi susah malay navy lagi susah
[oh] okay (err) [oh] shit about the army [oh] my god so now i i want to be a i want to join in the army also as a female yeah i want to go to all guys there yang perempuan ni actually boleh buat semua macam gitu
!wow!
i know how to self-defence like siapa-siapa nak pegang [kan] try me like seriously i learn a lot how to self-defence with guys [lah] cause dah banyak kali kita dah take advantage but then i learn how to be stronger [lah] belajar belajar belajar belajar #pang# satu kali ni this guy [ah] dia nak try one time shoot he run away he was like like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one yang nak ambil advantage punya he he tried to macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua then i was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can [lah] can [lah] terus i give up like okay kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa i give him one punch at his face because i was
because i was like damn pissed off [lah] cause he really thinks i'm like girls is just like so weak you know like i hate it because
that [one] i don't care [lah] like i just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me ke buang (uh) me from the army or whatever it is right as long as i'm safe because i can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done [lah] and dia pangkat sergeant and is a very high rank already for for like the sergeant punya rank [lah] so if he if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did buang so whatever he did to me he will get back [lah] ya
we are basically like the black people
no seriously like white always have the privilege i mean guys always have the privilege
(mm) that [one] is damn sad [lah]
i can't really say much but ya whatever it is like try me whatever happens happens [lah] because i know how to save myself but then we see how it goes [lah] who knows things change we don't know but like i can just be brave that's what i can do i just ya put my mind into him
like because like i feel like i'm talking to you like you know just don't make anything bad happen to me okay
i don't know the way that is not like (err) being like disrespectful disrespecting [lah] i'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad [lah] kirakan cause he's the one that create us [what] so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable i am with #allah# like this is how peace he make me feel like when i'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like bukan macam [eh] lu macam muak no
that's exactly ya that is like ya allah tolong [lah] jangan [lah] buat macam gini you know like please [lah] please [lah] at least that [one] he knows macam because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that i'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know macam like berbual maki ya allah you know that
kind of disrespecting ya but then no [lah] so far i never do that before i'm like always like you know i'm always very comfortable
[oh] my god
i don't know what is their motive though we never disrespect your god why must you disrespect ours
i think because they watch a lot of nuns [lah] how is it scary we are [oh] my god we are covering up what we can cover man nevermind they don't understand we at least understand our religion nevermind as long as we believe in what our god trying to make us do nevermind they don't understand they don't need to understand [lah] they don't have to also
if not just ask us [lah] about you know try to understand about our religion at least like okay [lah] explain us about good i explained ask about your god
just because we look scary !wow!
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those hijab people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay [ah] macam you are a french person okay and you don't like me because i wear hijab and i don't like you because you are very ignorant am i like why are you so ignorant #blah# #blah# #blah# no right like i'm leaving you alone because like you do you i do me like like that
like all those wannabes
same sama ya true true
(mmhmm) like not like not just saying that we are that old you know to the point where we can judge them like seriously this is you know
ya ya ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect memang betul kita semua bukan perfect pun
so is like something is even orang yang very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam [oh] !wow! kita aku rasa aku betul [ah] tapi orang lain tengok macam [eh] actually dia ni apa [sia] dia buat [a'ah] [sia] salah [sia] padahal sendiri fikir macam [oh] baik baik baik
tapi nanti bila dah live a long life already fikir balik macam like [oh] my god what the hell man what is this like what did i do like something like that [lah] like so sekarang for the mak and minah i feel sorry for them [ah] because they maybe tak dia kurang ajar
pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar so ya i have this okay so people keep saying that i'm a minah and i'm very against it because do you even know what's a minah
i can be any anyone [lah] like can just say i'm a girl with a lot of personalities
i can be a minah i can be a #mat# i can be a guy i can be a girl i can be bias i can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and #allah# give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to macam you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes kita tak macam we never k like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but padahal macam pada kita is like i'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to macam sugarcoat everything macam [oh] !wow! you are doing so great [eh] takpe [ah] kau pakai hijab tak tutup (err) apa apa ni leher takpe [lah] lupa melayu sikit takpe [ah] kau tak tutup pun takpe [eh] takpe [ah] tak pakai tudung [ah] kau pakai tudung dengan sleeveless pun tak apa [eh] kau nak main bola pakai tudung
never heard of that but ya like semalam dah cakap [ah] it's like okay that kind of teguran is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like !wow!
[eh] example like macam !wah! #farah# so nice [ah] she everytime sugarcoat me ya but padahal #farah# itself is like
like i don't really mean that you know like i i'm just trying to sugar coat you because i want you to be my friend like that type you know so it's like people just don't know the difference
exactly (uh) like seriously i feel so malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri
(mmhmm) i mean they have like that self esteem okay fine that [one] i but then like that's too much [lah] know your limits [lah] no need to rub to our faces [lah] at least (mmhmm)
[eh] [oh] my god kalau tak jadi riak pun #allah# tak terima [sia] so #allah# sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat so the more you share to people macam [eh] kau tahu tak aku solat [sia] [eh] lima waktu [sia]
okay then what you want me to do macam [oh] !wow! you confirm go to heaven [lah] what you expect exactly so is like [oh] my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite quran [ah] a lot of time macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam [eh] kau dah khatam belum like aku dah khatam [sia]
i'm like okay you can at least say like macam okay kalau if your friends like haven't khatam and you have already khatam like at least two times three times you can just ajar that person macam okay [lah] aku tolong kau [lah] aku bimbing [ah] apa aku akan jadi your guide [lah]
guidance okay so kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam k [lah] aku jadi cikgu engkau [lah] aku dah khatam banyak kali like you don't have to say that macam okay [lah]
like for example i haven't khatam you already khatam then i'm like i really want to khatam because i want to be closer to god i want to really understand it i want to finish it i want tears of (um) like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then #farah# came up to me like example [lah] macam (uh) do you need help like kau belum khatam [kan] sebab aku baru khatam so kau perlukan bantuan tak at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me i was like okay [ah] boleh tolong tak
macam you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like [oh] my god like memalukan gila [lah] serius serius like tuduh ke
[oh] my yes yes yes
[oh] my god anda tak faham tu [jer] boleh cakap
(mmhmm) ya then is like okay [lah] if you want to be jealous because of a good thing is is actually good [ah] actually macam tak bersalah is not meant to be judge
!alamak! aku dah baca quran dah berapa tahun tapi dia baru dua dua bulan dah habis dah khatam macam
ya ya ya
[oh] just now we were actually talking about motor [eh]
ya exactly i was like [eh] bukan ke tadi kita berbual pasal motor (um) sports bikes or street bikes
okay [ah] at least she got license [eh] very #shiok# [sia] actually once you get license just relax only
as long as we have raincoats [ah] raincoats at least save your head body ya
(mm) !wow! first hand for first hand [lah] at least for first hand [lah] for class two b cause (err) every rider need to start at two b then baru two a then two so for two b motors for sports bike [lah] ada yang ten k ten k first hand
that kind of five k ya that [one] okay [lah]
but (err) you were asking why motor right because i just want a motor because i really like motor since young and i want to be like my cousin nevermind but i'm really into motor
is not because like nak ikut orang like firstly memang nak ikut orang tapi because i ikut tu pasal semakin minat you know like i fell in love with bikes then (err) bawa kereta i really want a car also i want a car license but that [one] i plan to
take it when i'm having a salary payment maybe dah kahwin baru ambil lesen because i want a family car so car is just for my family [lah]
then motor is like cause i'm still young i want to live my whole life like yolo you know what i'm just gonna buy motor and have fun on my own ada mat tahir pun akan lelong cause my boyfriend now also have bike tapi sekarang tengah #tekong# [lah]
then ya [lah] enjoy my life first as a teenager not a married woman yet no not yet (mmhmm) nak kahwin dua puluh dua
kau dah dua puluh satu [ah] [eh] kau sembilan belas [a'ah] turun turun semakin like

[ah] tu [lah]
okay so the you know the (um) with a song that i showed you just now is it's it's basically (um) it's a k pop song by shinee
(um) ya so (um) so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny (uh) k pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
too and and and then they dia orang like buat videos yang can make you pause for a while and like [oh] i'll double tap that
it's i never heard i never heard
[oh] okay okay (uh) maybe i think so like you know pull you like in to my side
entah aku tak tahu but we'll find out soon
i recently learn this term it's called (um) (um)
kissing my teeth but k_m_t if you've seen it on twitter k_m_t stands for kissing my teeth
so like (um) like you're not you know that that meme yang the person is like (um) like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see k_m_t maknanya kiss kiss my teeth
so like for example (uh)
what what's the [oh] ya ya ya ya i know it's so true [oh] my god
like once you respond habis that's it (mm)
i do it you know i've got come my adik i do it at #nasha# when i ask her to like get me something
[eh] #nasha#
i am a minah at heart
[ah] i mean like that number [ah] the number the number of hours i'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so (um) like on on on wednesday because i was working from home
like i finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
it's six o'clock that's it i tutup my laptop i roll over to my bed and i buka tiktok
i stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling f_y_p and i didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
and she was like you tak nak makan [eh] and i was like [oh] right dinner i totally forgot
it's so addictive i love it
i learn so much i love it
ya that's that's the tea
i got into
(um) because i saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily (uh) loaded and shared and i think that's one of the main (um)
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like (err) an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on (uh) any
(uh) any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
today i learn so macam like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say [oh] that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first i i thought it was like the musically yang bodoh punya
ya betul betul betul
yes yes and we know that musically dengan vine tu semua budak kecil
y~ yes like the budak mana from #clementi# tengah buat dancing
[ah] tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your f_y_p page cause it's well curated [oh] i see it is on your f_y_p page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your f_y_p even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to act~ bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize [eh] you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once (uh) once it realizes that [eh] this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the prior~ priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin> to see you
[oh] !wow!
[oh] [oh] !wow! amazing !wow!
grab ge</mandarin> knows you but you don't know his name

hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that i did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where i don't like i thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
[ha] tu [lah] i thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff #anime# you probably won't go the other way
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
wha~ wha~ what's your exact the plot twist that i didn't quite expect you know watching #anime#
ya i've i really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya i'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but i'm i'm watching i don't know if you know this show it's got #saiki#
the disastrous life of #saiki#
[oh] that's good
(um) it's more slice of life i guess (um) so i guess i prefer that kind rather than macam like actually the things i remember watching
but it's very very promising and i might start on it
okay okay so i might i start ya so this one is more of like (um) slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called #saiki# (um)
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so macam for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers kalau dia tak pakai [kan] nanti dia bangun pagi [kan] terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah
like exploded
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if if someone say it's can you like urut me like he would urut and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
strength [ah] yes yes yes so i was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also (uh) teleport (um)
he he can he has pyro~ pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole #anime#
ya it's just him
the whole #anime# revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep (uh) people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole #anime# he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
(um) you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear i i guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
it's so merepek but it's so good it's so kelakar gila like if you have the time then give it like one episode i love it so much like during lunch breaks
my one hour is so precious while i heat up my food and go eat right
i watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes i okay may have taken more than
i don't skip i love everything about it
okay yes yes i skip the intro that's what i do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight i'll just watch [ah] #saiki# it was so good and the thing is i think there's like a couple of seasons i rasa belum habis
like i've started two three weeks ago i rasa belum habis
(um) i don't know it's about twenty three plus
i watch i watch during lunchtime i watch during dinner time tak habis-habis [tau] i'm like bila ni
ya but i still can't finish
and i watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also i'm like !wow!
right right i should have finished like one season
aku tak tahu ada berapa season berapa banyak episode i'm still with season two [tau] season freaking two
ya ya
[oh] ya ya ya ya
[oh] yang total aku tak tahu aku belum i don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
i'm starting there
ya it's like to it's she's own i guess i prefer that [lah] cause i guess i can relate to it more macam #shonen# is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
ya you really have to get into it
even this one tak masuk akal pun at least i i can relate
[oh]
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those i vaguely recall watching a #gundam# series on kids central
[oh]
ya
(mm) (mm)
yes yes
yes
(mmhmm)
ya
okay okay
(mm)
that's very interesting i've actually thought of that
fact #gundam# i all i all i remember is i i watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
(hmm)
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into #gundam# and you're like no
#gundam#
i i actually (um) because i brought home #najhah's# punya (um) #haikyu# jacket and
[ah] it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now (um)
yes she's she's tall tall is one thing she's also like quite berisi juga like she's not stick thin
so i was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet [lah] correct
(um) so i was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
plus it's like her favourite show so i tak nak hampakan [lah]
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay i like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when i left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so i think
[ah] no i think it's still with #aisyah# okay nevermind that's fine
ya so (um)
i i told her like [eh] sorry [ah] i really cannot bring you because n_c sixteen and i don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like i want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would (um)
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is n_c sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch (um)
but some countries
she knows but some countries its p_g thirteen i saw [ah] i saw on re~ reddit she's on fucking reddit
she's on freaking reddit for like anime i was just like [oh] my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least i can ask kak zan and kak najhah you jangan macam gini [eh]
it is where i feel like you need to be ready it but
ya (um) it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when i was really into my like fitness craze (um) there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends [lah] or it's more of like q&a or like one of my favorites is (err) e_l_i five which is explain like i'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really (um) topics that you don't understand like (uh) explain like i'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular reddit page was so i'm now more if you but i used to follow it because (um)
i like to read like i like tea you know to (um)
and it was on relationships or like am i the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
some how are some people are just really ridiculous [tau] merepek gila [tau] dia punya perangai and then after awhile i realized that for
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their (um) comments is always [oh] this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children i'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you i get it that you know i i feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
[ha] tu [lah]
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad [lah] i feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service i'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most r_ts therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
[oh] ya so back to [ah] so (um) so i asked her like (uh) can you give like (uh)
like a summary of the story cause i couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere [lah] and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then i was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
#izz# can easily catch up [eh]
[ah] okay [lah] not bad [lah]
[oh] yes
not bad
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me i'll just find online i was like [eh] n_c sixteen where you want to find online macam mana cannot because it's n_c sixteen you cannot watch she's like i'll find the p_g thirteen one
and i'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like i'll find a way
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya ya okay
sub technically i got a
but ya
i'm also trying to think that where is the n_c sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
[oh] okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
[oh] my god okay okay but you know i only realize how important we think when i watched
(um) this movie i think it's called the spy movie i watched it with #sha# it was after a levels
(um) i watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about (uh) this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
(um) came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian (um)
colli~ okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this (um) spies
jesse mccartney no [lah] that's a singer merepek [jer] sampai [jer] kutuk aku bukan
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
tu [lah] (uh) tak boleh haram
it was a spy movie and it was i think m eighteen i mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time i saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
!wow! really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually i mean i do i mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix i should take you
i mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an i wanna what
i'll just keep it to myself
i was so surprised i was really taken aback because i will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was (um) a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and (uh) so he was videotaped right and then the spies exec~ executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that i'm like wait what
i couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it i think
ya i'm pretty sure
i was like [oh] i was really full i couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then i was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you (um)
and then ya so i guess from then on i realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's m eighteen
when it's r twenty one you better make sure that you know
i was not prepared
(uh huh) like nudity or sexual references (uh) ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending [oh] it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya i was legal and i knew what it looked like comically i suppose
but i was just i didn't expect to see it on big screen
(mm)
what i get to is shooting up then i'm like [oh] okay !wow!
that was like twenty fifteen and i still remember it [oh] my goodness
ya i was so shy he was very indifferent about i was like it was a lot
[ah] biasa okay [lah] bagus [lah] apa apa [lah] #shah#
ya !alah!
[ah] right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like i mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by i feel like if i don't do it who else is going to do it and i really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
(um) this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya #wey# or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
i think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with #haikyu# she was really into #haikyu# her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so i really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that (um) but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
i just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
i mean i honestly can't speak for you so i don't know
ya it's like how when i watch those malaysian romance (uh) series
when i was younger [lah] when i was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
[ah] tu [lah] [oh] my god that is is so true like we were big kids already
[a'ah]
it really impacted the way (um) i saw how relationships or is
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like tunduk to the husband
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when i look back and i'm like no no no like
when i interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
you should just have said t_v tiga so
kau datang dari drama mana ni
ya
recently i watched because it came out on netflix i watched nur
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this (um) new ustaz baru graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a pre~ a celebrity preacher
who has his own (um) tahfiz school and his own masjid
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so (uh) so he's a very popular
preacher on on t_v and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
and then one day while he was giving the ceramah subuh thank god he he
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know i didn't q&a session are we i no one is it
kat masjid dia orang and then he received like some questions of people (um) and it's really weird because
[ha] dia orang q&a tak pernah dengar [kan]
ada q&a session (uh) the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version masjid version
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like (uh) thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out (um) it was from this girl
bila keluar masjid then dia nampak this kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis on a white piece of paper
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial (um) like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like res~ respectful the person like
he was macam ya like !wow!
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like [oh] my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have (uh) this kind of like
(uh) ya ya ya they asked i can't remember what the questions were
(uh) fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like (um)
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
so but like more in depth [lah] so like for him like want to provoking macam hati dia macam #dup# #dup#
(uh) kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni
yes it is idiot
so okay so #tup# #tup# they ended up getting married
yes
i know i know done with the question about everything so (uh) he was looking for her
everywhere like dia punya dekat jalan and they met and they dated
[a'ah]
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she tergesa-gesa but the she just
ya ya i think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like (um) like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like [oh] my god i need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so i was like okay [lah] when i watch this okay fine this one can i can brain everything (um)
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's tak masuk akal the level of patients and the
[ha] it's very unrealistic i feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
i mean (um) the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but i have to say that it was somehow the better ones
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that i watched was cinta si wedding planner
with (uh) starting #mira filzah# and if you know #adi-putra#
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first #mira-filzah# was twenty four seven
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom bedroom but she's chilling and then kat rumah and she's about to sleep and she's wearing tudung
or she's sleeping in her tudung
ya
and i'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult [lah] logically
yes yes
ya that's why like
it's it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head [ah] [ah]
or like maybe not the not the you know the nenek-nenek kind
the instant [ha] instant i'm like okay i get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid (um) commercial shampoo commercial
dia cuci rambut tapi dia pakai hijab macam
[ha] tu [lah]
what wallet

dia memang so annoying i say already
suka [lah] tu dia
what if
[eh] what [ah]
ya means can give full bottle already [lah]
i don't know because because only until six months you can give milk then after six months you can give food already
ya
ya but the thing is that then like this [one] is i don't know
ya how [eh] when to increase milk
too much i don't know
you see when should i increase my baby ounce ounce oun~ oun~ is ounce i don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty m_l per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty m_l ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pedi~ pediatrician
ya then they say
when should i give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can [eh] as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty [ah]
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
so ya [lah] dia nak masuk two months already
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can [ah]
ya
[oh] ya i lupa i need to call seoul garden bukan need to call i want to call seoul garden ya i lupa abeh dia punya time dia [ah] tu [ah]
!huh!
do you think i should call now !huh! nanti pukul berapa [ah] six
ya
happy birthday to you happy birthday to you [oh] ya ya
no because okay the story is this that time i like yang masa i keluar dengan dia [kan] then lepas tu i just tanya dia [lah] macam like (err) like do you have any plans for his birthday because if not i feel i thought i want to bring him to pergi u_s_s then lepas tu after that she say [oh] no [lah] nothing [ah] usually kita just pergi makan [jer]
ya then lepas tu [ah] i say [oh] okay [lah] so (um) then i shall bring him out on saturday instead then (um) then tak tahu [lah] kalau friday he want to meet me after he book out then she say okay [lah] then lepas tu i was like (uh) dia cakap apa
ya and then and then (um) ya [lah] then i just say [lah] macam i planning to buy him a cake like because (um) he wants a macam swensen nya cake gitu [ah] cause that time my birthday [kan] kita beli yang cookies and cream tu [pe] then lepas
ya that's why so so so i was thinking [lah] macam like maybe can share with the whole family also but then lepas tu like we ended the conversation kat situ like kita tak berbual banyak cause i only told her that i wanted to make something special for him [lah] because like like ya then lepas tu on monday suddenly on monday
[oh] is it my boy [oh] no my piercing
ya jap it's here it's here ya it's here ya
ya so like apa [ah] what i talking [ah] [oh] ya and then about the cake then apa [ah] then
apa [ah] i lupa [ah] i forget what i want to say [oh] ya on monday ended on monday and then on monday she texted [eh] monday ke no [lah] semalam no no monday ya then monday like macam we just talking about some random things yang
i saw on facebook [ah] macam pasal makeup and stuff then lepas tu (err) i just say that like i told her like what's my plan for saturday so i say [ah] saturday i decided to just bring him to luge because i ask her like macam [ah] #aiman# pernah pergi luge ke tak then then she say [ah] i don't think he have been there then i say okay [lah] then so i'll just bring him there then like the u_s_s can apa save it for other time
then lepas tu i say ya that's why it's not hundred dollar on the dot [tau] dorang kasi macam little by little like twenty twenty gitu ya ya i mean i read about it [lah] i don't know
!huh!
ya i think so because from what i baca dia cakap [ah] like macam dia will kasi in division like they won't kasi hundred dollars straight
but i tak tahu must read again [ah] tapi tu pun like in december lama lagi [seh] it's not now [lah] ya but it's not like now like dorang dah bring out the news it's not like straight away they can
ya but so lambat like what ya ya ya so so ya so so i told her her [lah] i told her yang apa [ah] pergi dengan our friends like the the chinese friend
because apparently i wanted them to help me with the surprise pasal kita kat #sentosa# [pe] so like terus apa like can like beach surprise you know that kind tapi end up i was thinking because supposedly kita pun [ah] had been planning to go boat noodles supposedly tapi tak ada time because it's either they want it on a weekday like #aiman# like in camp and then or like saturday sometimes i work sometimes i don't want to
go out pasal #aura# [pe] then lepas tu i was thinking then lepas tu i just say [lah] like (err) maybe we should just do it on the birthday [lah] so so ya then i told his mum that we're going to eat and then go luge and then makan then balik [ah] ya then lepas tu on wednesday like last two days she text me she say [ah] she buying [eh] she ordering food for friday because like macam yang masa that monday
when i told her about like this plan the saturday plan then lepas tu like she didn't even like we we were talking about the friday plan [lah] tapi cuma tak confirm you know ya macam like because i said that (um) have to see how what time he balik if he balik (uh) early then maybe you just stay home then i balik with #amirah# because #amirah# is working she will finish at six thirty
so six thirty dah habis then i balik dengan dia so macam surprise juga apa [kan] ya so so then macam either that or i still meet them at causeway point ya habis lepas tu end up like we didn't agree on anything ya and then on wednesday she text me yang she ordering food on friday so means dah confirm [lah] [kan] ya
i mean not really discuss [lah] but then like we talked about it but we don't we didn't came to an agreement that okay we shall do this you know that kind macam we just talk then lepas tu but also because it's her house and then we we we know like i think she know i know that like you cannot just come the house that kind because there got one time
(um) #aiman# ask her if i can come over for dinner on sunday lepas tu sunday [kan] dia boleh makan dekat rumah [kan] so like ya then dinner on sunday lepas tu [ah] so she was like (err) why never tell in advance you know that so like like ya then lepas tu
no like
a week before or something like cannot like friday you tell her that kind friday ya ya ya exactly ya ya then
ya okay ya then lepas tu dah gitu then [ah] apa-apa [ah] so so like ya then wednesday she say then lepas tu she say !aduh! that is so far probably

it's interesting because i found interesting games macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main [ah] macam gasing or #chapteh# lagi ada five stones there are five stones
five stones they have five stone [ah] they have five stones and they have like they have this handmade paper plane
and then they have another one with the handmade [ah] where you it's a paper ball where you need to blow on it and then in order for it to to expand then make into a round shape then you can just you know play it around like that
so ya i think i am more attracted dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu [lah] [oh] ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam [lah] macam-macam permainan [lah] macam permainan dulu-dulu i think i'm
from what i heard from my friends like i'm more to like the old side of of like i mean ya i'm that i i give that kind of vibe to them [lah] like i i really like [oh] like old school style like you name it like for me like it's very very fun and interesting for me [ah]
happy family you mean yes
[oh] i think you will know my answer i will i really am a fan of (uh) you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
i would not say i grew up watching it [lah] how how would i explain it dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok drama korea macam cuma drama melayu macam dekat channel five i mean i do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so like i got into korean drama is because of one of my friends (um) she suggested me this [one] at at that point of time of the year [ah] the title was boys over flowers
so i i bet everybody knows this so masa tu macam [ah] [eh] tengok [ah] boys over
flowers best [tau] cerita dia [ah] cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya then nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni then i was like
[oh] okay mula dengar macam [oh] okay then when i watched i was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so i'm like i'm so down to it i'm so like and i end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
it brings me back so much [lah] like that was the joy that i found in watching like
i think basically i like korean i korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like [ah]
they i mean they have a lot [lah] but ya i think i'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
[oh] i like
we watch the same thing ya [ah] kitchen nightmares
[oh] those were the days i tell you yes i do watch catfish is i think is the number i don't say it's number one but it was on m_t_v right at that point of time ya i remember watching catfish i was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's [ah] go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like !wah! like !wah! you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
(err) how do i say this i'm not the type because i don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone i don't dare to use it because i heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say [lah]
it might be i mean i i'm thankfully enough because i'm not on that side of it i never tried any apps so i never gotten catfish before but i heard stories of
like people using fake profiles macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu then orang mesti macam [eh] i want tinggi !wah! cik lawa [ah] buat kawan [ah] [kan]
so i'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so i'm like how can how can people
i mean ya i mean
ya i i got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like [ah]
aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau i'm here for you like you know
like that that's the that's the thing i like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
[oh] ya ya ya
movies
(uh)
[oh] movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one [lah] i mean i watched
from the season season one to like i think i i i forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good i mean ya it's because i think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and i mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting [what]
macam dalam dunia ni itu [kan] macam movie [ah] tu [kan] based on
non-fiction [what] so it's like bila ada movie macam gini macam !wah! macam dia orang pakai macam magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
[eh] it is so good i wish i wish (uh) i could you know get that that kind of (uh) if it was to exist in singapore [lah] or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you
[oh] no okay okay i know
[oh] okay okay alright alright
yes bec~ that is
three hours is because (uh) they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture [what] ya when making movies [lah] but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it [ah] it dia ada macam crime crime scene kat dalam tu
so macam never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
how [ah] you know that kind of thing i mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good [what]
!oof! cartoon i can say i watch a lot of cartoons but from what i know from my siblings i love to watch teletubbies i you know i i remember i had
teletubbies punya patung i mean i tak collect banyak [lah] i mean i don't have much but i remember i had like two two of the characters i think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is [ah]
tinky-winky is the purple one the first one with the red handbag
i think of i don't i don't
each and every one of them has their own
own macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya character dia orang ada macam barang macam tinky-winky ada handbag kalau dipsy dia ada topi dia [kan] then [ah] laa-laa dia ada dia punya orange orange bounce ball
then for po they have the scooter [ah] po was unique he because po was younger then po has the the scooter
but ya tinky-winky tinky-winky also is like
very unique because he has [ah] a red handbag with him
ya so ya i grew up watching tinky-winky i got
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so macam macam spongebob pun unik juga pasal spongebob berkawan dengan (uh) dengan apa dengan starfish they call it right ya dia berkawan dengan starfish kawan dengan (uh) sotong
ya the character is [ah]
it's a it's a it's a squid right it's a squid ya ya it's it's it's interesting how about you
ya i'm sorry about that i know i mean it's ya
[oh] sesame street
[oh]
i get it
[oh] no if me it will be
if me it will be (err)
(uh) [oh] [ah] (err) i think it would be ya like i say it's boys over flowers soundtrack that's [ah] same like you when i got into boys over flowers that's where i get to know k pop that's why i get to know certain groups form because of the o_s_t
ya that's ya i mean like ya
of course of course yes yes
[ah] titanic
mesti sudah tentu titanic siapa
siapa yang dengar nama titanic tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal [kan] cerita pasal kapal
mesti mesti cerita pasal kapal
cinta !wah! that was the first movie also right yang very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting [eh] yang ini [oh] i got i got a question for you (um) if you have three wishes what would you wish for
kenapa tu
seorang yang tamak
(err) it'll be money health and food
(err) terutama saya suka i suka makan i suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan [kan] i mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
i mean [kan] it's important in everyday life [what] you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
food also is something like kita boleh
kita boleh macam explore you can go like
macam try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if i could get like any food i crave for i can like okay i wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya i mean like
ya that's just a wish [lah] but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us [lah] as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all [ah] ya [oh] i have another question for you
[ah]
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
(uh) it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind pasal yang
kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir [kan] dia macam dia diam [jer] jadi if
i have that superpower to to know what you're thinking apa dalam minda dia macam !wah!
i can maybe like let's say nak buat kawan kita because i'm i'm a very shy person to be honest to new people [lah] if you want to make friends
so it's like if i can read people's mind like [oh] okay dia ni rasa macam gini-gini maybe i can from there i can start a convo maybe because i know what's going on in their mind [what] so
ya for me it will be (err) read people's mind
i wish it could exist but i mean [ah] you know
[ah] food it's always about food [ah] in the end it's always [ah] it's i don't know maybe food or
i know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too [lah] what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
i think i mean like that's part of (uh) your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect i mean dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam
yang kecil-kecil [lah] you know tapi mana ada yang macam
and like tapi apa-apa pun in the end it's all you know it's all up to you [lah] actually
alright so how about [ah]
k got another question for you okay (err)
let me i'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya [ah] okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's true
(mm) i get what you mean
what was [ah] the thing that i wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me i more to
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like masuk kedai [jer] [ah] nak beli baju ni [lah] [ah] kena bayar tak payah bayar okay
i mean just bawa balik i mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant i mean biasa [lah] sometimes kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli [eh] nanti guna ke tak tak guna [eh] tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna so
so ya it pays a lot of factors so i believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want i think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
(err) [oh] i got this is another interesting and unique question that i found (uh) if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya i agree i agree with you if me i will think
if we do not longer need to work i think we will be doing gardening
i mean you know garden is i mean to some it'll
be a healing process because like you plant berkebun i mean lepas tu you tanam any pokok [ah] any bunga atau pokok yang yang favourite [lah] [kan] tanam then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful (uh) peaceful what do you call [ah] called a procedure you call it that ya i mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
tanam maybe like you can tanam fruits buah-buahan sayur-sayuran i got a neighbour [ah] [ah] my neighbour likes to plant [ah]
starfruit
it was so interesting because i never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do i in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another i think in common common common areas also macam
ada macam tanam cili padi habis you nak cili padi daun kari daun kari for me it's very common daun kari then ada apa lagi [eh] macam bunga-bunga
bunga rose i don't know if it's common bunga rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever i walk past their house there'll be a lot like
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
[ah] ya yes
hobbies actually !wah! hobbies i would say there's a lot i mean i think one thing for me is baking you know me [lah]
i i love to bake i think i i i since i started baking when i was i think i tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi i think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of (uh) food [what]
so it's like when comes to ya i think my hobby is baking for now [lah] i try i like to venture out on a lot of stuff like i mean i vacant i used to like bake like [ah] i think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
for me that was a biggest step cause usually i will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies macam kuih-kuih kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek [kan] macam
kena bahan ini [lah] bahan itu [lah] tapi nak dia punya process the process of making it is is very hard [what] so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
prac~ i mean it depends on the person practising (uh)
i mean for me it's best to practise first than you i mean some people like to gamble they just like [ah]
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me i'm i'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff [lah] ya
of course yes
[ah] favourite lagu genre genre genre macam genre melayu ke genre [ah] sembarang-sembarang apa-apa genre kalau apa-apa genre
(err) if i were to say well we both like k pop but if genre lain would be macam
genre lagu-lagu pop lagu pop pop like lagu
[oh] cakap pasal lagu pop macam teringat kalau lagu [ah] you know pop #yeh-yeh# it's the malays well it i always like to bring back to to the old times then like i say my friend see me as like [ah] throwback throwback kind of person ya lagu pop #yeh-yeh# is
masa tu memang masa tu kita sekolah rendah [eh] sekolah rendah kita dah dengar lagu pop #yeh-yeh# that was that was the band that i think that was the first i forgot what's the band's name i forgot what's the band's name but that was the first
[ah] ma~ malay band that i listen to at that point of time i think it's because of my sister like she also listens to this kind of like ya but ya pop #yeh-yeh# ya it's like in dari korea tu biasa [lah] [kan] ya for me like lagu irama melayu would be the pop melayu [lah] they call it pop pop
pop malay they call it ya how about you how about you
[oh]
live music pernah pergi dengan
i go with my sister i go with my sister (uh) to this to this con~ to this concert (um) concert
band [ah] apa nama band tu westlife
!alah! boleh lupa pula [ah] band nama tu [ah] i pergi dengan my kakak kita pergi because my ni minat (uh) westlife sebenarnya so it was more meaningful and especially because it falls on her birthday this was back
(uh) it was last year ya it was last year ya basically it was last year we went for this concert [ah] this westlife concert it was a very that was the second time i went for concert yang live usually i tak pergi pasal i
[ah] satu duit [kan] very [ah] macam mahal [kan] tapi like this time round (um) my sister decided like me and the price is affordable so i was like [eh] you like this band why not we go also ya so was very
eye-opening experience for me cause like you experience them singing live some more is like
they are the iconic band that people recognise all over the world like it's not only it's not only the singaporeans were there were a lot of [ah] other people from countries who came to singapore to just watch them westlife
so it's like it was really i remember it was really fun that day and some more it falls on my sister's birthday so ya how about you
i know it's always it always happen ya ya ya
[oh] it really happen in front of your eyes [ah] i know okay
[oh] (ugh) my fa~ talking about shopping just now right (uh) fashion style i'm more to a casual side macam santai-santai tak ada anything very dramatic atau macam i suka pakai simple simple just a simple one like
pakai t-shirt seluar
(err) kasut tak kisah [lah] kasut ke sandal [ah] tu [jer] i'm i'm that type of i don't go for very like dramatic of like like ya i rarely wear accessories too but only recently
i decided to not recently i think last year i decided to purchase a lot of accessories i'm in i'm i started to get interested in accessories so especially in earrings
so you know me you know my collections i just decided to cause it was it was unique and cool because pasal it was handmade tak pernah nampak macam susah nak nampak [ah] kat luar tu orang jual macam handmade earring macam
you can say like (err) laces you know lace there there is one lace earring where you like
need to sew on it and you know you create and stuff so for me i'm more to like very simple and very casual nothing not so dramatic and all and of stuff ya i'm curious about yours how about you
i'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense macam colour
brown [ah] brown red call it [lah] orange (uh) this kind of colours that i'm more to
ya i i don't go for macam colour colour macam
macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang you know what i mean right macam you look at !wow! it's so it's so bright on you like i don't wear bright colours i'm not that that kind
and warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde [kan] dalam global mesti ada [kan] so hitam is i think
hitam like is the is the main [ah] but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about [eh] ya
betul betul
love talking about love i suddenly so shy no [lah] kidding love at first sight
(um)
i'm not sure about love at first sight but i believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us [lah] but love at first sight
i think i'm on a neutral side i mean love on first sight macam macam mana nak cakap [eh] kita jumpa orang tu first time then kejar i'm not terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta i mean i
i kind of i mean not i kind of i used to i used to to you know look look at like [eh] [oh] my god like maybe i'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will i really interested to like i mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
i'm on a neutral side basically (uh) ya very interesting how how what what do you think
[oh] i understand k k
[oh] my god okay
[ah] faham faham ya ya ada orang pun fikir
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like i mean maybe some people mesti tengok macam !wah! dia ni kacak [ah] dia ni macam handsome [jer] [ah] tapi tu [ah] fikir-fikir balik [ah] kita like would you really
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so i got [ah] another question for you
(uh) [oh] you talk (err) [oh] okay k if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
!alamak! okay that that will be hard for me also because i enjoy drinking teh o ais limau dengan syrup syrup limau ya !alamak! if if me k if if i were to choose between syrup limau dengan teh o ice i will pilih teh o ice
i mean syrup syrup manis i mean i teh pun manis [lah] [kan] tapi teh lagi macam lagi like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting !wah!
yes correct
i would [oh] wait this is very interesting because i got a few countries i would like to stay in mind but if our !alamak! this also very hard [lah] i mean
i am basically like i said i love korea so much down to the culture but if i were to really pick like
if i were to stay there for the rest of my life i think it would be australia or new zealand
i mean i think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting [ah] country to i'll say i'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in i think i look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country i would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that [ah] from my friend went to australia it was ya i'll pick australia i think is is i think is like well ya everybody will pick australia i i don't know i don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing i i'm torn between sorry i'm i torn i'm torn between korea and australia but i mean i think i'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more i mean how do how do i say this mean they i mean
it's hard [lah] to say but then i mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of (err)
different type !aiya! basically it's culture [lah] but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
[oh] no (uh huh)
it's just mi apa noodle
ya ya correct correct ya ya
[oh] no okay
[oh]
ya of course me too i won't i i i i myself also don't like to stay in one place i would like to know like safe is singapore [lah] like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only [what] what for we will go like [eh] let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya [ah] what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
[oh] of course of course
kalau sound (uh)
any sound [eh]
actually any sound tu i takde idea tapi macam if you were to ask me if [ah] i tak pergi where what is [ah] my favourite place to go i will pick (uh)
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same i think it's particularly because i like to watch flowers bunga basically like i said [lah] bunga cantik like i really really really
you know my favourite [ah] bunga matahari bunga matahari is my kesukaan bunga matahari tu [lah] macam every time i tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia
the colour dia colour macam cerah [kan] colour kuning [kan] dia macam what [ah] it it will lift up your mood
when you see sunflower for me [lah] for me i don't know about other people when i see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries i'm like how can they grow up so big like that i wish i could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country i mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that i'm not good at
gardening or planting i mean once i plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know i i ya
yes
if me i know i i i i heard stories that [ah] rose rose is hard
to to plant and to jaga macam kalau tanam tanam bunga rose tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena [ah] selalu
kasi dia air so gotta give it enough sunlight if if not it will it will not grow grow well [lah] from what i know rose but if i would would want to plant it's like i say
bunga matahari i nak tanam pokok bunga matahari ya
like i say if i can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you [ah] much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
plants and looking at [ah] flowers bloom bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak [eh]
pokok [eh] bunga cantiknya
[ah] it will make us macam it will make
make us forget about the busy life in this [ah] singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from [ah] from that side that busy [lah] that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these [lah] i also really agree with you on all this cause it's
k
hari kita nak berbual pasal
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one [lah]
so i think you can start first [ah]
why batman and iron man s~ specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that i would want to have right
is like
those abilities like macam
[ah] kinaesthetic
kin~ [ah] kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility [ah]
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya i know i i mean as in like it's a different perspective [lah]
but for me right i've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours macam you cakap you want to be superman atau pun nak jadi
batman
[oh] bat sorry batman or iron man okay kau nak jadi batman or iron man i would also want a superpower yang
can help others
but like for me is basically
[oh] so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
(mm) dia bukan dia bukan specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
[ah] so for me [oh] ya teleporting [eh] didn't actually come across my mind until tadi sebut teleporting
(mm) [ah]
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that i really want than i can teleport to like
any place of the world you [tau] macam harry potter
harry potter there's this
(err) magic spell i forgot [lah] apa magic spell [ah]
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower i forgot [lah] what's the the magic spell
(mm) [ah] disapparate [ah] dia orang disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age [ah]
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing (err) port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish (err) irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
goblet of fire cedric diggory yang ada siapa tu yang handsome tu nama dia [ah]
r~ robert pattinson
ya that [one]
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers [ah] wait wait but i also i i
if if i
ya i know but i want to answer my part of the question first like if i had a superpower
[ah] if i had a superpower
i would want to have telepathy
ya but
the telepathy must be something that i can switch on and switch off like if i want to know what the other person is thinking or if if i want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person i can like macam switch on and off
k but maybe
[ah] specifically to children [ah] because i really want to know
what the children are thinking behind i think it's a occupation hazard [ah]
like
budak-budak [kan]
kadang-kadang budak-budak pun kita
tak faham apa yang dia nak
what is going on their brain
so you i think will be very interesting
for me to macam tahu what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
i think also works for [ah]
adults [ah]
(um) but the thing is that's why i say i want a switch on and switch off button
i do not want macam to be burdened
by what i hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why i say i want telepathy but
[ah] boleh on and off [ah] gitu
ya [lah] but
the thing is on and off [lah] i think every superpower ada burdensome
telepathy [ah] [eh] sorry apa
teleportation [ah]
apa
but it saves time it's very quick
cepat
(mm)
ya [ah] but the thing is
you are saving time
it depends [lah] whether you have more time the thing is people i think people nak this
teleportation
please [lah] don't cut me off [lah] the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this [lah] but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it [lah] [ah]
ya okay
so that's teleportation
(err)
(um) if i were any superhero i think i do not want to become any superhero
i think money
burdensome
macam kalau duit
duit definitely okay
ya
but money to me do it is not everything [ah]
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
[ah] your energy your smile and your
tolong orang
okay apa
superpower macam okay teachers are also have superpower that's what i believe [ah]
sorry occupational hazard k [ah] teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or jaga or apa
budak nangis datang kasi peluk to orang besar [kan] macam nothing [ah] tapi
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
i think you know
how
our son #aydin#
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
in the mata like macam [orh]
!wah! you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
(mm)
(mm)
all
i think maybe because of welfare
unlimited [ah] okay
[orh]
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then i have another thing
sociology perspective [eh]
but what if naik lemak
like they dia orang tak nak
work hard themselves
they just expect to be given [eh] dia ni rich apa so tak payah [lah] work hard so we just wait for him apa to durian runtuh
okay
(mm)
okay
(err) but i okay [lah] maybe for you [kan]
unlimited duit
it's something that you think of [lah] but i to me i think you know me as a person [kan] i'm not a person that wants unlimited duit
k
but i [oh] something came across my mind [lah]
ya i know it's just
a superpower
with unlimited duit
ya
(mm)
because [ah] okay the thing is something there macam
i cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that apa i respect it's just that i'm just
showing
the other side of ya
(mm)
okay
that's you were saying superpower
since you were saying superpower apa ni your superpower of unlimited duit
i was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
(mm)
i will like that i would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome [lah]
yes no the thing because i was thinking
if there's if that's if there is someone [kan] macam
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
apa
ubat for covid nineteen like the perfect ubat
for covid nineteen like maybe i would want to study belajar macam mana like
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
[ah]
[ah] the bull's eye of medicine [ah] [ah]
like macam
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
i think you should make it
free only untuk
k the thing is i think [kan] kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni [kan]
probably free depending on what type of ubat
but also
subsidised
(err) like singapore singapore doesn't give macam a lot of things percuma free
subsidised
then that [one] you have to talk to the experts [ah]
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is i
i will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem i think now
no the thing is right
[ah] not everyone
i cannot you cannot please anyone everyone betul tak
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
apa you your superpower that you wanted was
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
unlimited duit
doesn't resonate with me
i like and i knew when i said that i wanted
unlimited
knowledge you pun macam [meh] (uh) macam gitu [lah]
okay so
[eh] so that's about superpower [lah]
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and i iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and i'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
macam kena gaya
dengan my personality [lah]
[ah]
or do you want to give me a superhero that macam sama dengan i wonder woman
or because i can
that is just t_v [lah]
(mm) wonder woman [eh]
is okay wonder
okay can i i i will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
wonder woman is just macam too feminist [ah]
ya
ya [lah]
so but she can do [oh] she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
cakap bohong
about wonder wo~
[orh]
okay
about wonder woman agaknya macam most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie kekasih dia
pasal
dia tak boleh
tua
dia selalu sama umur habis ke
ya lambat gila [lah] sampai kekasih dia
she had to watch her kekasih die
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
[oh] it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why i do not know
so the villain made the clone
[eh] then that's boring man
[eh] but they are supposed to
i think they will filming [ah] lepas tu dia orang stop pasal covid nineteen [kan]
[oh] dah habis filem dengan production [eh]
[oh] because of covid nineteen then tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok [oh]
[eh] why not [kan] dia orang macam
people view online [lah]
ya there's [ah] people be ya video on demand
people view
no not apple [lah] then only apple people
only imac
(mm) something like netflix [ah]
macam okay netflix is a one time payment (uh) tapi kalau nak tengok movie movie ni e~
extra [lah] then technology is already so fast pace
but is it
movie baru
atau pun movie lama-lama
netflix
dah buat gitu
ya [lah]
okay actually [kan] i'm not too sure how much
netflix bayar per month [lah] because we are using we are sharing accounts right so
no
untuk for us saje [lah] but i'm not too sure how much but
actually like
this production macam
movie korean you're alive in zombie though
movie korean ya alive and zombie though
like
!wah!
how
as in like they don't
tunjuk kat pawagam
so macam mana dia orang buat duit
[oh] ma~ i know okay
maybe
[ah] those movie yang exclusive
dalam netflix ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] monthly subscription which is berapa [jer]
!aiya!
(mm)
okay
okay pasal bapa sponsor ni i know too well pasal i watch korean dramas kadang-kadang dia punya sponsor macam over sangat
macam satu jam [kan] dia punya cerita satu jam
dia punya sponsor macam
tiga puluh minit empat puluh minit
like ridiculous [ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] but
but mesti ada kuota [lah] jangan melampau sangat
melampau sangat
ya [lah] faham tapi macam ada yang melampau every few scene [kan] ada okay jam tangan okay bag
[ah]
because of time
(mm)
i want to save time pasal
okay the thing is i know you have a problem dengan with me
pasal i suka cepat cepat cepat boleh tengok movie fast forward fast forward
but you must understand my my feel
okay the thing is i told you already [kan]
otak i macam
runs very fast
no the thing is the details
kalau i nak tahu
if i want to know
i will read about it
ya or i will go back
if macam if betul-betul mustahak [lah] gitu
kalau tak mustahak
cepatkan saje because
like you know i have a lot of things to do
like
kemas rumah
buang sampah
buang sampah yang berkeliaran kat kat ruang tamu ni
ya [lah]
takpe dia dibersih
and
macam-macam lagi boleh buat kalau boleh
tak apa
jangan buang masa apa
[ah] dan juga kalau
cepat tengok
cepat tidur lebih tidur (mm) macam gitu [lah] (uh)
(uh)
so that is my stand on why i'd like to fast forward
bila tengok movie ke tengok drama macam gitu [ah]
lupa pula apa initial question tadi [eh]
superpower okay

(mmhmm) okay
okay (mm)
[oh] my gosh
(mm) ya correct correct correct ya you make the final (uh) apa tu big change [ah]
[ah] then good [lah]
i feel like you are too hard on yourself ya
because like kau fikir banyak sangat then after that like at the end of the day you know macam this thing happen like you tak expect [what]
you know sometimes you expect it to be very bad right but then sometimes like you won't know pada kau because you see that artwork everyday the lecturers see it like [oh] dia macam it's their first time seeing it [ah] so they will either like it or not like it [ah] so if it if they like it means it's good [lah]
ya and like
apa tu what they say about your works semua like during the presentation
no fine arts [ah] aku lain [kan] (mm) (uh huh)
(mmhmm) okay
(mmhmm) (uh)
(mm) [orh] maybe macam i feel like the concept doesn't really
(mm) okay [lah] [orh] okay then that's bad it's how you how your concept is and how you project is [lah] i feel like
entah [eh]
kau punya asal like okay kau lecturer berapa banyak dalam presentation room
(mm)
dah ni
okay (uh huh)
dengue my friend had dengue but he was hospitalised and then he's okay already you know mine was my friend was like i think two weeks then like okay aleady
fever and dengue dia rabak [eh] chronic [eh] but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct [oh] okay so only one presentation [ah] bagus [sia]
aku dua presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself macam tiga lecturer yang kita ada
and then like (uh) week sixteen is another lecture that we tak kenal ya so it's like (uh) brand new face that see macam because our lecturer ya correct correct
cause that lecturer kita [kan] everyday nampak [kan] so like they bring this another lecturer then from there terus but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like (err) that one i can say (uh) make or break [ah]
ya but the adjunct lecturers semua baik gila ya
but depends [ah]
is it i i don't know what that that lecturer is called
[pe] processor ya entah [lah] that what name ya
i feel like this sem my lecturers are quite good
cause last sem really it's rabak [eh] and i feel ya entah maybe because pasal like
entah [eh] i feel like last year was their year macam shu dengan eff~ like eden i feel like this year it's like me and effy punya ya their they are so rabak !oi! [ah] ya last term last term
(mm) honestly aku
tak sabar nak pergi
!huh!
same year (uh huh) year one sem two
it was a bad year year two sem one this sem mine is good
(mmhmm) [orh] it's your own major right ya ya kita every sem tukar kelas ya but fuck
cause
because like honestly i thought this sem kita akan tukar kelas lagi but then me and effy macam !alamak! kita geram gila [ah]
you know we still in the same class tapi macam okay how it goes right that
sama class so everyone in sama class [ah] so basically its like monday tuesday is kita punya satu module [jer] kita ada for this sem for next coming sem [ah] satu module [jer] but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
kirakan major [ah] like what we want
macam we have macam performance installation we got ya ya we got a lot [ah] performing arts then we have
apa tu packaging motion design semua then we can only choose three aku ambil
ya ya part of my module c_d_e cause c_d_e is like cross elective
okay [what] macam aku ambil figure drawing is the same [what] but it's still under fine arts [what]
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of apa tu routes to go actually so this one i took we have to choose three then (uh) from that three then kita belajar then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem aku tak dapat ambil dua yang figure drawing full [kan]
ya so aku just have to cause my c_d_a i only have to take two for my module ya !huh! [oh] my god aku four [jer] [eh] (mmhmm)
[oh] ya ya but packaging [ah] the aku dengan effy took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one i forget what [oh] design and brand strategy because honestly (uh) kalau kita ada tiga ni benda [kan] then intern kita will be easier though ya because like for us macam apa [eh]
(uh) whatever we take is to prepare us for the future
ya and honestly aku tak sabar untuk intern i don't know why
what is that have [lah] choose your ya correct correct [oh] for you guys [lah] okay (uh huh) [oh] !wow! [eh] that's good [eh] [eh] that's good
girl you know how we have to get for our intern we have to choose six from like example intern s_g
fastjobs ya exactly then we (uh) these ten slots [kan] we put inside this p_d_f then that p_d_f (uh) for the p_d p_d_p p_d_f [kan] we have to send to our lecturer which is like our p_d_p lecturer [lah] for the whole three years then (uh) she will be chooosing he or she will be choosing for us our intern ya he or she feel that which one is better for us
right exactly that's why i feel like yours is better [oh] okay
cause like i feel like kita boleh pilih but at the same time macam our lecturer will be the one that ya but (uh) honestly after that after this coming semester [kan] kita ada three months holiday right then me and #effy# thought of like kerja at any (uh) graphic comm punya firm and then from there kalau like we feel that in in apa tu that company is quite good then we just continue until intern [lah]
ya so it's like a smart move right
no it's in year three babe ya [lah] so continue [ah]
dah ada kerja what you mean okay (uh huh)
kerja for that really [meh] no [lah] i don't think so tu i_t_e ni diploma
[eh] you okay or not
no [lah] i feel like during okay [lah] i feel
the process it will take place in that sem [lah] week sixteen twenty blah blah blah ya
the process then kau will first day macam for example first day kau is during that year three sem one ya i feel like it's like that ya [lah] so apa yang kau nak start dalam year two sem two ya [lah] the process is year two sem two [lah] ya [lah] okay so that's what i should've say girl
but honestly right i feel yours is better [ah] but it's nerve wrecking also [lah] ya true
(hmm) entah [eh] i feel like it's a both pros and cons because
pros is like at least you get to talk
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can macam
how to say [ah]
like the companies that choose you you can choose yourself you know
then
then after that like (uh) tak the cons is like you have to compete with everybody [ah]
and a bit like macam
in your face [tau] macam company tu tak nak kau macam !ouch! sakit [sia] honestly right yesterday i saw like a lot of jobs right they dekat apa tu indeed aku nampak banyak macam art teacher abeh those apa [eh]
that c word i forget what is that for the ni [lah] budak-budak art
bukan taxi [lah] !aduh!
[oh] my god i forget but then it's like something
got conductor not it's not conductor [ah] ya curator
i mean like your course quite broad [lah] honestly and yesterday also aku cari macam kedai-kedai [eh] kedai [eh] company you know there's a lot of art galleries looking for people to kerja as part time [eh] stop it
ya so stop !hais! [eh] kau nak kerja dengan aku ke tak yang picking packer okay [lah] this whole week kau take a break then maybe kita start kerja next week [ah]
ya
kalau bukan this week kau nak confirm dengan aku bila okay okay okay
!hais! no cause aku start kerja [kan]
!huh! no it's actually quite okay but the thing is i i don't know [leh] i i feel like
what i sign up for it's not what i get
so it's like no honestly if they were to put me in a retail punya position i can find other retail stores to work you know b_h_g it's a stall but macam kirakan there's a lot of macam promoter at each section so you are doing that kau kat situ macam kau kena jaga overall then kau kena tengok-tengok and at the same time you have to like go for the customer ni semua [lah]
that's the fuc~
point you know [oh] my god i just censored my own ya and then like i never even get that position so aku it's a retail position or cashiering i don't know i mean it's not even promoter it's just that whole retail store kau kena take care of ya so exactly that's why aku terus like
aku dah tak aku dah quit i told #shah# about it and then i was super depressed you know what i did they don't even know what i'm supposed to do at that yesterday you know they just gave me the job and like [oh] you can just go to the customer then i'm like [oh] okay then after that they never tell me any other instructions
so what am i supposed to do i just stand there walk around [lah]
i think six hours nine eleven to six [eh] i just whatsapp the manager [ah] say like the environment is not for me (uh) what (uh) this is honestly not what i expected it [lah] macam this is not the position i he haven't reply but i left the group already ya kalau tak esok aku kerja esok thursday aku actually [dah] full this this week
fun [lah] find another job [lah] what what is my plan i need to find a job
u_s_s call me back but i don't know [eh]
tu aku nak tanya kau nak kerja picking packer ke tak no no no the packer

[oh] my god don't say aku punya printing [jer] one time printing fifty five dollar [eh] i have to print my (uh) board i have to print my
what you call that
(um)
apa tu photo book c_p_j
ya because our c_p_j now is like macam
apa tu macam buku [ah] kirakan
ya
contextual
document doc
the funny part is
i got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my c_p_j and ya they (uh) then end up orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah su~ exactly so i'm like exactly then (uh) #effy# is quite mad ya
effy dia #sot# [lah] tak aku example it's like really unfair [ah] i don't know why but it's just the school [lah] i can say
you show peop~ macam orang punya kerja it's like a good thing [lah] but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
apa tu copy yours and do better and after that
dia orang punya kerja yang kena pilih
and you are still kat bawah trying to survive padahal kau punya it's like orang yang copy
ya i think there's that [ah]
[eh] kau suka pergi hiking tak
tak aku macam nak pergi hiking
aku dah lama mana tak pergi hiking abeh one time aku kat n_s abeh macam mana
every friday saturday sunday
entah [lah]
not every [ah] ya can say ya macam friday i fetch him and saturday the whole day expo [ah] so every time dia nak patah balik patah balik sunday ya
sunday
i don't know though honestly it's going better cause at that time [ah] we actually went downhill [lah]
aku tak bilang siapa-siapa ya it's like i don't know [ah] at times we gaduh and then like but that one time we gaduh right quite rabak ya but (uh) the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it macam you know if we break it off then what's the point of us macam wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct correct (mm) the thing i like about him right dia punya mindset is really mature !oi! he's your age ya
then like i don't know [ah] dia macam dia cakap like kalau you dah tak suka i semua ke apa in our relationship anytime [tau] kalau aku just dah tak ada feelings but just bilang dia and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go [lah] kalau tak macam if he wants to make it work [lah] ya so it's like very matured thing [ah] at the same time kalau kita nak break it off
we have to really macam talk things out to each other and yup i don't see that coming any mean time ya
and then like now it's getting better i don't know i feel like ya
i think that one week before he went n_s we really fight a lot
ya really a lot until we i think he (um) apa [eh] i call [kan] dia tak angkat
at that point macam betul-betul like he like we had enough of each other [lah]
but then macam (um) during the n_s period the first few weeks terus macam makin lama makin okay then now it's better [ah]
ya cause that time he was on holiday then i was like quite free right dengan my school schedule then like we met almost everyday [sia] then i feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
we keep fighting then now ya then now we it's good [lah] cause we got our own space and we can focus more ya
and we don't fight a lot also and like you miss that person a lot to fight so ya i don't feel it better [ah]
and like pejam celik pejam celik aku next month [dah] one year dengan dia dok
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then i told you that i like this guy ya tu masih suka [eh] aku masih (uh) kerja kat u_s_s [seh] baru baru [oh] my gosh then now dah nak one year it's quite fast [eh] really really fast
aku kawan kau pun dah nak masuk apa two years two years right going to what after this after december two years already [sia] friendship quite fast [eh] last year was our year one
now we going to year three

(uh) kalau tak salah dia drop out ataupun dia stop for a while then continue

i don't know and i was quite shock that she actually told me [eh] [oh] really [ah] [oh] ya ya that one i told you right that was quite good [eh] good acting girl
then aku cakap kau kalau seri bilang kau kau act macam tak tahu [jer] [eh] aku cakap gitu
[oh] my gosh damn i miss being in the same class as you [sia] stupid
ya honestly my class sekarang is not really actually bonded every class aku pergi is not bonded
it's all clique by clique by clique which i find it macam a bit irritating [ah]
ya so aku sekarang stick dengan effy [jer] walaupun the other girls [kan] dia orang satu clique (err) like ada chinese girls dengan chinese girls and then kita ada lagi satu girls macam macam indonesian dengan singaporean macam campur but dia orang semua baik [ah] aku punya orang is
even though i have three (err) i'm always like with that one friend i will always be neutral to everybody ya so macam mana-mana aku pergi nanti dia orang macam [eh] nelly nelly so aku macam okay [ah] then like (um) that that one group of girls semua okay [lah] dia orang okay dengan aku so aku okay [ah]
melayu indonesia cina ya campur-campur [ah]
cause kadang-kadang aku tak ada benda nak buat buat pun aku pergi kat dia orang macam !hey! how's your work
ya group work pun kadang-kadang aku just campur dia orang
(err) #nadhirah# [eh] (uh huh) #khine# ya dia suka
tahu pasal !huh! how they know
no girl it's very hard for him to like somebody and the way the girls that he like is all mostly chinese or korean or japanese dia punya pasal [lah] [eh] macam girls like angel yes ya you know malays is super hard [ah] kalau nak kawan dengan dia kawan rapat macam kita boleh i feel like a lot of girls jealous bila kita rapat dengan him because kita jumpa #khine# kita selalu macam peluk abeh rapat-rapat [pe] but he's like for me it's like i don't know [eh]
i cannot be friend i cannot like someone when that someone is my friend
ya and i put the line already [eh] you know and i find him more like girl friend instead of a boy friend macam !hey! #khine# (mm) okay
nanti kadang-kadang macam !hey! girl then aku macam aku terus #khine# then after that [ah] that time aku masih in my in my clique [ah] aku nampak dia kat (err) apa campus one lobby abeh lepas tu dia macam !hey! girl then wear tudung [tau]
then semua orang tengok aku [tau] then terus kita lari kita peluk each other dia macam macam you know those like love movies like something then we just we just have each other [ah] then everyone look at us you know macam semua tak expect [ah] like (um) macam dia [kan] handsome nak mampus so everyone confirm macam (err) confirm everyone macam [oh] i want to be the one that is hugging i don't know [lah] kadang-kadang i find it macam a bit merepek [ah]
ya
but i really like our friendship [sia] it's really quite unexpected [sia] honestly
honestly i didn't really want to make friends so with anybody because every semester i have to change class do you think it will work
(hmm) entah aku tak tahu nak berbual dengan siapa aku macam okay let's just berbual dengan budak-budak pakai tudung mana tahu dia orang baik [ah] aku macam gitu but then once i heard kau hello i'm anna i'm twenty one from i_t_e girl be my friend
because everyone is very young [eh] at that point then i'm like !huh! ya that's why it's like entah [ah] but the the reason why i was close with #shaz# first because i was the only one that talk to her during that general ya g_s class
cause that time aku cakap dengan shafiq (err) aku just nak cari classmate aku [ah] macam kawan daripada class aku [kan] at least [ah] aku boleh pergi kelas dengan dia aku tak seorang ya so that's my ya because she sit in front of me tak aku just try out [jer] then aku just hi (uh) like what class you from [oh] i from (uh) one that time kita punya class apa one g [eh] honestly tak ingat apa dia cakap one g
[oh] girl same class then kita just all the way together [ah] plus from there aku tanya dia like

then kita dah sampai sana kita cakap pasal cerita hantu juga and then #fahmi# has a lot of encounters then we go like okay
terus okay [lah] bye go get into the car we want to go to #canberra# want to collect something because minnie ordered something
on the way there
so yo~ so that gather place in is in the middle you know you either exit here or exit here both way you exit pun dia macam
senyap tak ada lampu just senyap like that
tengah exit dekat sana betul-betul sebelum belok nak keluar main road i saw one
on the left side
gula-gula
and there
i saw and then i was like
[eh]
okay dear then i wanted to take to take a second look but then i'm like okay tak apa if i take a second look the one sitting on my left would notice that i saw something
so i diam
then like that again at the corner of my eyes it's just like that again then okay
then i said [eh] no face [eh]
cover only [eh]
then they all say usually the face open [lah] apa [lah] terus aku macam okay [lah] my luck [lah] dia tak tunjuk muka
aku syukur [lah] dia tak tunjuk muka kalau dia tunjuk muka aku rasa sawan dekat sana [tau] dalam kereta sawan

so macam rasa dia tak seram sangat it was actually funny
sebab you were just talking about it apa then i saw it so i macam rasa macam [eh]
okay
okay i didn't see the face
it's not as scary because the cov~ the face is covered
so aku macam okay

and then when it happened your parents were not annoyed macam apa [lah] budak-budak ni
(uh)
[ah] [ah]
[oh]

i know your papa even ada benda pun dia diam [lah] takkan dia nak cakap ada [lah] [a'ah] bapa nampak takkan dia nak cakap
(mm)
okay the master bedroom toilet okay

[ah]
!hey!
okay why is it right your first instinct is to turn to it not to aw~ not
turn away from it
kira macam jinx
i saw you first
train
!wah! until now
until time [ah]
no but like at that point in time [ah]
[oh]
!whoa!
!wah! so weird [leh]
anabelle
[oh] shit
that one dig out the eyes
no [lah] my mother a~ ask me nak potong gigi dia ke nak keluarkan mata dia
potong satu gigi dia
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(uh huh)
at the side table [lah]
okay when you say that there's obviously something
tak ada
one last [ah] one last
[ah]
ramai-ramai
!wah! irritating [ah] playing around
[ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
correct correct
!whoa!
!wah!
short [eh]
tak then you so daring to take three takes
scare yourself first
ya
exactly but how they are the one doing the task [tau] which are brushing the teeth and washing the dishes
kira pada you you macam !siala! aku mangsa keadaan [seh] aku tengah menjalani hidup aku
don't
and then have you heard any in f_f okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is [lah] but like i just choose to ignore it
because like i'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
ya so like they all tell me the story i'm like [ah] ya ya ya ya and then later this new person mama dia was like she found one yet and i'm like (uh) (uh) nurul kata memang ada
like you what me you what you want me to do like
i never see but like it's it's true benda memang jadi
so i cannot deny [lah] i rasa mesti ada
but hundred a_m bro
bro hundred a_m is fucking real bro
you close club at ten o'clock ten [oh] ten ten ten you never come out the thing halau you [lah] [sia]
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
budak-budak sana [lah]
so minnie minnie kena apa [tau] closing and minnie is a kind n~ that's not like us [tau] macam pakai benda terus buka boleh keluar
hers is like memang kena tukar seluar baju makeup bag alright
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
suddenly she turn around ada orang macam dia rasa ada orang pekik dekat muka dia [ah] gitu
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred a_m is last time right to~ tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
you know right so that stairs minnie pernah jalan
orang tolak dia benda tolak dia gila babi sampai dia terus land dekat bawah
that is like i think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
orang tolak dia terus macam lepas tu dia terus jatuh dia jatuh all the way to the to the floor
(mm) (mm) all the way down
terus macam okay
ya so like the the part where
the benda will always
the benda will always macam apa ni
(uh)
apa tu
ya like
bang the weights all this semua orang pernah kena
everyone that's one hundred a_m always tutup exactly
ten o two
ten o'clock semua orang dia dah halau
because dia orang pun tak nak kena
ya so macam [eh] !siala! kau orang ni real [siol]
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
the connected to the hotel apa the for the swimming pool
ya maybe so
pagi orang opening shift so opening shift
masuk
no opening shift is masuk !siala! i open the shutter i have to be the first person there
unless i open shutter aunty cleaner ada
with me
then there will be two of us correct
dia open shutter dia nampak member jalan
so dia macam sir the gym is not open yet
kau first person [tau] buka apa yang kau nak berbual dengan member
so (uh) then i say why you why you say like that no because i didn't think like that [lah] i think macam member macam (uh) coming from the the swimming pool like you forget to lock the door or what then he sneak in
so i was telling him that
we haven't open then i follow him so that okay let's say [ah]
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
so this person jalan towards this treadmill ni pillar [eh] jalan this way so this i thought macam [oh] kau nak main catching i will walk here and kejar you surround you here
so dia dah tunggu sini tunggu tunggu tunggu orang ni tak jalan-jalan so dia tengok tak ada
and dia macam okay [lah] tak apa [lah] maybe orang ni dah keluar pergi back door ke apa [lah] tak tahu [lah] dah keluar balik dekat shutter dia pergi tengok dekat c_c_t_v dia berbual seorang
dia kejar benda nothing
and then me asal kau buka c_c_t_v asal kau very curious
tak ada [ah] aku nak kena tengok betul-betul apa dia masuk daripada pintu mana aku nak tengok closing shift semalam tak tutup pintu ke apa i need to know
sekarang kau dah tahu sendiri kau berbual dengan siapa tu
kau nak hidup kau ni sekarang apa maksud dia hidup kau tak ada makna [tau] hidup kau tu permainan syaitan
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
macam benda yang macam kena tolak ni semua okay [ah] kena kena pekik you know you hear it you feel the air but you don't see it
tapi ni sampai kau nampak orang
have more extreme one but i just feel like don't want to tell
k the less extreme one
(uh) you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
terus dah tired gitu and then
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so #lasiri# was sleeping
terus dia kena hempap
so [ah] so ya people when they say hempap [eh] hempap ni semua dia ada scientific reason
there is a scientific reason for all that [what]
then
when i say cannot [ah] will say no bro
when i tengah itu aku buka aku dapat buka mata cuma aku tak dapat pekik aku dapat buka mata
aku dapat buka mata [kan] and then
and then dia kata apa ni
(err) i saw the lembaga
sitting on top of me damn big
so so she's a trainer [what] so she went to this one guy
!hey! bro
kau tengok [eh] chest aku [eh]
rabak [kan]
kau kena hempap
then dia macam !huh! aku tak bilang kau apa-apa apa
how you know
aku pun kena [ah] dengan lembaga besar [kan] mata merah !huh! kau pun kena aku dah selalu kena #wei#
ya so this so bermakna before she even tell that guy that guy already know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone i will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then i feel like [eh] maybe real #siot#
[kan]
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the the weight at night
that gets angry
(uh) ya same
[eh] you ask and then you say no right same i also did that siapa [sial] [eh] tak apa jangan jawab
sama bila rasa tekan malam-malam [kan] siapa [sial] gila babi [eh] tak apa sorry jangan jawab aku tak nak tahu aku #paiseh# aku #paiseh#
bodoh i scared [sia]
and then they'll be like
!hey!
come [ah] fetch me at my place [ah] !hey! #cheebye# after you tell me all this you want me to fetch you at your workplace you okay or not okay
(mm) hoo
so ash wanted to tell us something about it

it's so mahal
[oh] i found i found a place okay everything in there is halal
it's called my kampung
#kallang# way
so they have like korean they have everything japanese
chinese stall you know tak chinese stall yang macam economy rice
but they make it nasi padang
and they follow okay two veggie one
meat three dollar eighty cent
cheap right they really follow the economy style
ya and then tempat then like got a lot of cuisine and then everything's halal and then like you don't have to worry
downside is it only accept cash

(mm) not bad
waffle is swensen no no the thing is i cannot with swensen
the food is not great the service is low
i cannot [ah] swensen is just so [meh]
i would rather
you put me at pizza hut
rather than swensen
choices ya
[oh]
then got kid's meal meal then there's also the
[oh]
but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then i'm like shit
(uh) (uh)
the bread is the sourdough
#siot# [lah] tak ada mood [sia]
(uh) it is it's just a very wheat bread to me
(uh) (uh)
(uh) pizza hut they have one day this meal they call it
curry zazzle
i don't like it also but then that is the only thing that is spicy
so like i have to eat spicy food right
and always because when i go out right i feel very very very hungry i can't even wait for the baked rice to cool down i will end up burning my tongue
!wah! means you reach work #swee# #swee# [sia]
i no time to this one know
cannot no time i know [lah] every time go work
from here i know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the m_r_t that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then i usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace [ah] that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
[oh] then you can walk
you quite smart [hor]
i've never thought of that [leh]
!wow!
shit
ya but because i think like clifford tu macam kena jalan kena tempuh tempuh clifford kena tempuh like q_r q_r [tau]
okay
(err) my day today was okay it was quite a slow day (uh)
because i didn't do much (uh) today
(um) i got up got some coffee
then
i open my computer
watch some youtube videos
and then i tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work [lah]
i haven't actually applied for anything
(err) i was there was this (err) job link that #adli# sent me
it's from apple
ya the phone the phone apple
(err)
the job punya name if i'm not wrong it was apa tu
(err) annotation analyst
at least if i remember correctly [lah] but then there was an addendum to the title
that said (uh) it was (uh)
malay language specialist
it should be [ah] or siapa-siapa yang boleh faham [ah] melayu
ya but the job punya
the job punya description !wah! was not that not that bad (uh)
basically just listen to
transcriptions [oh] sorry (err) listen to audio punya files
and then
transcribe them into
words [ah]
then i think i think most of the audio would probably be in malay i think it's for siri
no i think it's like maybe macam n_l_p punya type of thing (uh)
(err) natural language processing
ya ya basically [ah] but i think there's also another aspect of macam
(err) natural language processing punya
feel
which is more concern with (err) a_i and machine learning
where the
the a_i itself
actually (err) learns language
because [kan] you know ada ada debate [kan] whether language is
(err) nature or nurture macam whether there is a biological foundation for language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then (err)
so
so ya [lah] the i think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
the brain punya mechanics in obtaining language and i think they want to see whether they can apply that to a_i ke tak whether the a_i can learn
[ah] yes i will be part of that
[a'ah]
soon [lah] in a few days [lah] i want to see no i want to see if they can actually i can actually just apply with my current resume
because my results [kan] belum keluar
so like
i got no results
the
if i apply then like a bit weird (uh) but i'm quite sure i will pass [lah] so i think tak ada hal kalau nak apply [jer]
(err)
so far no (uh) except for a few that i saw (err)
special education punya teacher
kat a_s_p_n
(err) wherever [lah] i think there's a few locations
because i fall into the macam the
no like (err) i i meet the requirements ya
(mm)
okay [lah] the exam was
only one exam was quite difficult (uh) the other three macam
gitu-gitu [jer] (uh) okay [ah] i did two of them quite well (err)
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and (err) second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy (uh)
the best [eh]
probably second language learning
!huh! why
no (uh) because it's like i mean it's rooted in theory [what] so it's more difficult to screw up
but at the same time kalau dia rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest punya score possible
ya ya i just want to pass
(mm) ya
your leave
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
wait pause they made you take
a test
[oh] so macam what are your strengths what are your weaknesses gitu [ah]
[ah]
skewed biased
i mean the name of the workshop is strength training [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya your boss's boss
wait he got cut off [oh] because the break up room punya time was ending
ya
(mmhmm)
!huh! how come your computer shut down in the room
[oh] so the
so basically the zoom thing crash [lah] nothing wrong with your computer [lah]
okay okay good
sebarang [jer] [siol] leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the benda ni compulsory [kan]
!whoa!
okay (uh)
i sat in the chair
belajar belajar all the way like for hours and hours straight
but it's okay [lah] i mean i managed to
(err) get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya i got all the info i needed
like
the
the only issue was (err)
for the eighteenth century punya lit
that [one] maybe i could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
tak
as in like i know
can i know the story i know everything then i just need to know how it goes and then i just pick and choose the parts that i want [ah]
i mean
it's work for me throughout the four years (uh) for all my lit punya courses [ah] plus i hate lit (uh) so
no i went for the english aspect
not for the lit
asal
biar [lah] dia
apa dia
[ah]
then he suddenly appears
menyibuk
tak menyibuk [lah] dia
tak cukup
tak cukup perhatian
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift [eh]
(mmhmm)
left maksud
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
so
so basically there was no person in charge [lah] for the thing
!wah! co in charge [lah]
on the ups
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
after six a_m
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] kejap pause
but the appointment pukul enam pagi
[oh] okay okay
nak kena siap apa [seh] you just need to go over to the location [pe]
ya
(hmm)
so he's new
[ah]
(mm)
okay so he's not actually baru [ah] macam gitu
[oh]
so so your shift doesn't deal with macam n_e_a punya barang-barang [ah]
apa n_e_a and (oo)
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
[eh] to whoever's listening
confidential okay
(mmhmm)
kirakan dia lost [ah]
the what thing
[oh] okay
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
(mm) (err) on the days you're schooling
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya
okay n_e_a shift is what time to what time
tiga pagi juga
you
[oh] you cannot request for shift change [eh]
[oh] for your class [eh]
[eh] i think i destroyed your chair
[oh] okay
kita orang macam chair destroyers [eh]
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
(mm)
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
i mean even on your off days also most likely kena tidur [kan]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
it's like a fake fake off not rea~ i think it's a i think it's a shift punya thing (uh) pasal dulu #nasri# pun bila dia tengah kerja shift
i think you felt the same way in that
macam even on his off days his time was taken up by
tidur dulu because you need you need that that rest before you can actually
take a break if that makes sense
(mmhmm)
[oh] shit serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
justin bieber
[oh]
[oh] they are not big fans of justin bieber
(mm)
wait so so you mean different punya clients
have different workflows [eh]
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
[oh] ya [lah]
you better do it
ya
serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit (err)
weird
i think especially because macam lain-lain punya organisation ada lain-lain punya processes
so macam
like
there's no
solid base to work from within your own organisational punya itu
like it's dependent on the client rather than the itu
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you (uh)
the previous shift
terlalu banyak apa
comp~ complacent [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
abeh
(mmhmm)
ya
i don't know (uh) i think
honestly to me
janji kerja dia habis dah habis cerita
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send (uh)
in what sense
(mm)
what what do you mean kena macam tu [eh] apa
first come first serve siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
(mm)
wait
pukul lima five in the morning
okay
(mm)
(mm)
macam
[a'ah]
ya like you
and you don't want to be the kind yang
tanya tanya tanya macam !oi! you want or not [eh] you want or not gitu
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] ya
and i think like you want other people to step up also right
like i have a feeling like usually the one yang step up is you and not all all those other people yang itu
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ada apa
[ah]
[ah]
jaded
(mm)
[oh] okay
i was actually going to make a joke
pasal [kan] ada apa budak baru nama jaden [kan] abeh seniors dia jaded
so jaden dengan jaded sama-sama
never mind never mind let them cringe janji janji kita punya audio dorang dapat
[ah] okay [lah]
betul tak betul betul
(mm)
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
!huh!
ya ya they know we we also know
no no no it's like it's like bila kita orang dua orang [jer] berbual macam
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
kalau orang melayu apa [ah]
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker [eh]
no no there's there's
ada ada ada there's a there's a (uh) there's a phrase i think for for home wreckers
macam like like [ah] is it
is it kayu tiga
i think it's kayu tiga
ya there's
no now that one person has more (uh)
voc~ malay vocabulary to transcribe
kayu tiga
[oh] okay [lah] betul [lah] i mean we we're having
macam
ya ya
i don't know (uh) but see like the the the thing is the thing is when i'm talking to you right now
[kan] it is
i i feel like i adopt the same cadences
as if i was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so i think it's fine [ah] it's not like i put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can i think it should be acceptable [lah]
!aiya!
[ah]
[a'ah] [sia]
i mean maybe the design of dia punya h_d_b blocks also plays a part [lah]
but at the same time tak [kan] you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time orang nak balik rumah
[ah] ya [lah] of course [lah] it's their job
tak [kan] orang sia-sia [jer] ketuk-ketuk [siol]
just anime like
banyak [ah] anime
#weeaboo# kalau melayu apa #weeaboo#
kalau indo #weeaboo#
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
i will try not to swear
i've been watching (um)
apa
(err) fire force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that i think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
(err)
part dia pun belum sampai dalam anime dia
(err) there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
they had they had to stop for a while pasal covid
ya
ya evangelion
evangelion
(uh) apparently january next year in japan [lah] tapi kat singapore belum tahu [ah]
maybe add three or four months
[ah] ya
in japan
[oh]
but (mm)
ya but then like i wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file [ah]
they have their own i'm quite sure they have their own macam
cinema punya based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
cloud
[oh] ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one [ah]
i feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of (uh) apa
artefacts
(err) to do with the film [ah] let's say macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself abeh nanti macam
macam
tak lawa [ah] dia punya tu
but but then again
ya ya that's the thing macam kalau film it's like
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
you are actually projecting it based on light and the and the image not the pixel punya density
like with digital all like you are constrained by dia punya
the pixels [ah] and the resolution that it was framed at [ah] macam you know lord of the rings
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four k
is because dia punya digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty p
ei~ either ten eighty p or fourteen forty p or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands (uh) two thousand one to two thousand and four
ada apa
dah ada apa
takde [ah] but it weren't limited like if you if you film
the actual film
like
(err) like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four k when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
but all the c_g_i and the extra extra punya barang-barang
was (err) ten eighty p punya rendering so if they were to upscale that to four k
the problem would be whether apa tu
dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya effects
or whether dorang nak apa
(err) just use the existing punya rendering
and then upscale to four k tapi macam buruk [ah] macam zoom zoom in gitu [ah] that's the kind of effect
[ah] ya ya ya macam stretched gitu
or like something someone would draw in paint
tak kasi dia makan dulu
tunggu [ah] dia
i don't know why for some reason when i laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the [kan] the thing become red right
ya that's clipping i think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
i want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait i write i write the script
i write the script
then
(err)
can i direct also
obviously no i think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
!huh!
i mean you have an eye for the frame [what]
[ah] ya [lah] you have an eye for the frame i will write i will write in the script macam mana dia punya scene develops
and then after that you will get like
you know like the three quarter removed punya angle or like
what there's a
i think there's a like different terms for different things (uh) like
macam the #kubrick# punya
stanley #kubrick# punya follow through the halls
behind ya that kind of shot [ah]
(mm)
a u t e u r [eh]
[a'ah]
#auteur#
ya
but
no tak nak tak nak
(err) anything [ah] can also (uh)
tapi macam kenyang [ah] boleh [ah] gong cha
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya i think i think can can be done
but i feel like
i have the image
in my head
but i don't know
how to work the camera to achieve that itu
flexible
in what sense
(mm)
okay ya
(mm)
[oh] to get [ah] ya ya i mean i mean
it might
no no
i think director director macam gitu is
dorang dah
dah successful dah ada banyak duit then
the ego that comes with it is itu (uh)
but i think
if i were to write
a movie
confirm i will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and (err) location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
i think i will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that i actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
i think it can go anywhere [ah] doesn't necessarily have to be macam
horror or itu it can be like it can be like drama
but with
a
psychological (uh) age not twist [ah] like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because i feel like that's what that's what movies are all about [ah]
that looking into the
the person and the nature of the person macam who are you gitu
(err)
quite a few actually
handmaiden was good but it's not
okay [ah] stimulating [ah] but it wasn't like
it's like in what i have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like (um)
like you know annihilation
nata~ ya that that that's like i think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
macam telling you
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and (err)
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that i love about the original jurassic park the first one not the lost world
(err) j_p three was a mess but i just watched it for fun
the the thing that i like about the original punya jurassic park is
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
that that (err) that apa
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
it kind of moves beyond macam like what what constitutes
through
(err) power
you know and like
a display of real fear
like how you know there was a scene of the guy yang dia dia
(err) apa ada t-rex
then after that dia abandoned budak-budak then after that dia terus dia lari masuk toilet then t-rex gigit kepala dia
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
(err)
let's see
[ah] the wailing
the wailing
it's like
it's like (err) macam
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like i want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
(mm)
i think i think they shou~
go to the house
ya
apa dia
(mm)
[oh] ya ya [a'ah]
(mm)
i don't know i i cannot i cannot remember that particular detail [ah]
i only remember the beautiful shots of the itu
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
and the shots with the with the ghost woman also macam lawa gitu
it's very macam ethereal
mana satu
i don't think you were with me
was it was it the
[oh] ya that's okay okay we watched that [one]
we watched that [one] in the cinema (uh)
i cannot remember but it was the director of pengabdi setan
but i i want to watch pengabdi setan [ah] where to watch [ah]
malam ni
nevermind [ah]
i think that [one] will i probably will have to watch with #rehan# lights off speakers on
[oh]
(mm)
ya but
i think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
i can just i can just wing it [ah]
because i i took the scriptwriting punya course apa
[eh] i got a you know don't play play you know
you make the film i write the script dah settle [ah]
director of photography [ah]
written and directed by then i put my name
i just want to see that
what
[ah]
no you know no
no [lah] we do it we do it properly [lah] but i i just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from (err) getting
(uh) machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
[oh] ya
no need [ah] low budget [ah] indie
live what
no [lah] it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no [lah]
we put i mean yes i'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when i'm free [lah]
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
[oh] ya correct correct
okay [lah] then when we on our off day then we do [ah]
i think can can no worry can be done
[oh] ya also i think i might be actually getting the expensive g_p_u
not anytime soon [lah]
like next year
like next year because tu apa tu
(uh) my g_p_u hot [ah]
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty p
like my monitor punya resolution terlalu tinggi for the for the card
so macam i need a stronger card
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or [what]
[ah] whatever game you can try you try [ah]
(mm) you never try borderland three
buy [ah]
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so i think confirm murah punya maybe like thirty thirty-ish maybe less
i know #rehan# that time buy on sale thirty seven s_g_d murah
for the for the release price [lah] the release price is sixty bucks i think
then then this black friday [eh]
what you buy
[oh] ya
[oh] ya later [ah] later
masks
yes
dah sampai
compress
semprot
okay [lah]
[oh] okay
!huh!
i want to i want to take one
#nezuko#
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation [ah]
ya [lah] so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the #weeaboos# it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
that's why it's so macam itu
sebab i don't like it [ah] because all the mat reps semua macam tengok macam (uh) demon slayer demon slayer
then i'm like bro you don't know what the #weeaboos# go through
i think
(mm)
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya i think it's
it's very oxymoronic [ah] in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
[oh] no like like i am no longer special
ya
ya
(mm)
(uh) #haikyu# is not that
(mm)
tu semua
boleh beli dari aliexpress [pe]
ya
hunter x hunter is quite popular
ya i know
ya
ya like i wanted to buy like
figurines for
#oregairu#
the
my teen romantic comedy snafu
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
of the thing because it's actually dia macam
grounded in realism
macam with real respect for people punya feelings and not just some
random rom com yang dorang macam sebarang #rojak# letak kat dalam ni semua abeh mix mix mix abeh
janji kelakar habis [ah]
ya like it was well thought out and well written [ah]
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire i think that was the fourth season third or fourth season [ah]
but ya the series just ended but then i cannot find any figures so sad
ya
(mm)
but at the same time like you must also consider macam kat japan [kan]
how it works is usually
yang the source material dorang punya #manga# ke
dia punya light novel ke visual novel ke [pe]
has to be actually very popular dalam its own format
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
or sampah habis
ya
so that's basically how it works (uh)
(mm)
different ke
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
[oh]
so sahaja [jer] [ah] dia ambil
(mm)
(hmm)
(mm)
j drama
(mm)
[ah] i watch one but i can't remember the name
real dramas [eh]
(mmhmm)
makeup
[oh] dia muda [eh]
okay [lah]
decently young [lah]
husband dia singaporean [pe]
[oh] abeh dia just dapat kerja kat sini [ah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] bullying [eh]
maybe dia punya dia tak kasi basis book tak suka [ah]
(mm)
ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
okay
(mm)
international
because there's a connection
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya
paling selamat macam
wait dia tinggal kat mana
as in as in in indonesia dia tinggal kat mana
[oh] i mean #jakarta# is the city [pe]
[oh] okay
i think maybe most people who want to take korean are nice people
the not nice people take what language
take japanese
now
can you watch korean without subtitle
boleh [eh]
try (uh) nanti
you watch the show then after that you tell me you tell me what it is next time [eh] kita kita cari korean punya movie
[ah] then after that i i i off i off the subtitle then after that you narrate to me
[oh] okay
wait so so far your your korean punya tu sampai tahap apa
as in like dia punya apa tu
macam
berbual macam budak-budak ke
boleh understand adult punya language ke
(mm)
[oh] okay
[a'ah]
[ah]
macam hyperinflation
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
(mm)
[oh] yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and i think speaking
came first sebelum writing
(mm)
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of (err) child language development
ya i learnt that
[ah]
#koreaboo#
but [oh] ya the key caps
dia punya shine through lawa tak
!wah!
[oh] macam too good to be true gitu ya
ya then it was like seventeen like that
[oh] okay
it dropped down some more
ya one o four key
[ah] ya i mean it's not lucky [lah] it should fit because it's all out punya key cap apa
!huh!
(uh) most of them use the same stems anyway [lah]
so
mama
so mama you already you know right that kakak [kan] suka makan ayam goreng right and then lately kakak macam makan popeyes sebab i think popeyes punya ayam goreng is way nicer than k_f_c what do you think
but i think
popeyes punya ayam is more crunchy [eh] i think it's like it's not
i don't know but i think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to k_f_c and then ya the mashed potato popeye punya like lebih sedap
and then compared to k_f_c k_f_c punya tak sedap langsung i mean like it's it's it's nice
k_f_c's one is nice but
(err) the popeyes' one has a lot more things in it compared to k_f_c k_f_c is just like mashed potato and the gravy but popeyes is like gravy mashed potato then got like the vegetables and everything
ya
(mm)
[oh] ya you know (err) starbucks right now cause (err) christmas
starbucks right now it's christmas right so
(err) they got the toffee nut
crunch latte and then they got these new other flavours also like really want to try before because that time so many times i want to try never get to try the starbucks one before but ya
(err) but they say it's quite sweet because my friend
allowed me to like taste some of hers then it's was like okay [lah] quite sweet but actually quite nice also
and then they got the one at n_t_u_c they sell the packet [one] also
feel like buying it because you know like home
like
i be my own barista at home right because of co~ (err) coronavirus and everything
so ya do you want to try it with me
i want i don't know i want like i want what's that called the turkey with the cranberry sauce
i don't know why but i think because i watch
so many videos of people like preparing christmas
dinners thanksgiving dinners then i'm like i keep on wanting it and also want my
what's that called [ah] gingerbread cookie because
lagi-lagi like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
and then [oh] christmas cake the log cake everything ya i also want that one
ya
ya that's why
and then
like right now also i think you know i got my performance right then everybody want to celebrate also very hard because
(um) because of the coronavirus the maximum group of five thing and all
which is okay [lah] but at the same time quite sad especially when it's around this time of the year when it's like christmas and then everyone to
everyone want to throw like chalet or like meet up to gather together
but then you still have to wear your mask macam susah and then it's also tak fun langsung sebab
you cannot meet your friend
ya
[oh] ya they got the hundred dollar fees the hundred dollars
tourism voucher right and then like
that one i searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people macam complain
dia susah to dapat the vouchers sebab ada berapa banyak website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website tu then in the process semua pun macam very sulit and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it i think kalau tak salah first of december
and then starting to starting on monday also got the mask
can take our masks also i don't know if you know
ya
i don't know [eh] i think so like i saw at kita punya void deck they put the poster everything then they say (um) start date thirtieth this monday [lah] thirtieth november until like
two weeks later
ya and it's very dirty and like very uncomfortable already cause the metal keep like the metal thing at the nose is like twisted and bent already
haven't yet haven't yet school holidays still got school
ya
like usual [lah]
ya
i also don't know we all don't know yet
[oh] i don't know i see first how cause we also don't know what we want to do with the vouchers cause in case we got any celebration or what
then (uh)
the mask
ya the mask i never put in the washing machine but it because keep on using and then keep on washing then like when you dump in your bag when you take it off or like when you want to eat all these are very hard
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean kemas and then the after is yellow very dirty then macam macam asyik lunyai and everything so ya
the one that i painted all cannot use because the paint smell very strong then if i tried i tried wearing it but then
like he did like that
ya
ya cannot
ya even after washing cannot wear cause it's very (err) smelly and all
ya the paint is not the paint i think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like i told you it's very thin also so i think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask tak boleh dipakai so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that dia punya paint very faint very thin macam acrylic dia it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with (err) like a bit more macam like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if i buy like waste of money like that because i only use it for the mask and then like i won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last [mah] so that's the problem then it's not like i just want to try then i look at the mask also i feel like wearing so like
very rugi because i don't want it to get dirty so ya
so i've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles [one] but i don't want big bottle i want like small bottle because like if i buy a big bottle there's no point for me because i won't be using it often
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when i want to clean it up i have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag banyak all my stuff so ya i don't know see how [lor] even if i buy like (um) the big big bottles now i won't buy all colours i just need certain colours but the problem is you know like i love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
ya like that [lor] don't know how see first
i also don't know we see how we have whole month then we have school we also don't know how then ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then covid doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so tak tahu [ah] macam mana
i don't know see how like if i can get into uni then go into uni [lah] if cannot then see how start working first or what
ya like that [lor] see how don't know how already
cause it's also quite hard [what] poly and j_c very different you know go into uni~ then with the whole coronavirus also very hard already
tomorrow got my (err) i got school what so then after that i need to rush my assignments
ya
ya if can by monday if not by tuesday because i need to print it out and then submit by thursday morning then on monday also i got another assignment due so that one i need to clean up also
ya
until six seven p_m
ya
c_c_a no more already but the normal class is until six p_m seven p_m like that
okay
ya
[meh]
no i don't think i can meet you all because i need to finish all my assignments already then kalau tak habis then i will be rushing then susah if i rush because
i got like my two thousand word assignment essay and then got my (uh) reflection journal that i have to clean up
finish already the reflection journal finish already but then i have to clean it up and then
for the
essay the two thousand word essay i'm only at like nine hundred words so ya
two thousand
ya
ya
but it's actually very easy just the organisation and the
because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but but it's actually quite easy [lah] because i got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like (um)
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya i still have my religious school until next year
no it's not finish end of this year semester ends mid year [what]
ya
i think so [ah] that one also not so sure you have to check with the ustazah again
no
ya
ya the water sports sounds fun [ah] but i also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also i very scared it's very packed so tak tahu macam mana
until june two thousand and twenty is kalau tak salah the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
ya
i also don't know see what have [lah] what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is i think tomorrow will like
i don't think i'll be eating a lot also cause i need to rush my assignment like i maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this i have to
do my assignment i have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
(um) chop chop type of person ya you know so kena we all nak buat macam cepat-cepat because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then dapat rehat cepat so ya
ya
ya
i think you can ask #adi# if he want to go market with you if he not working because i cannot go i got madrasah tomorrow
no [eh] no preference
i think like a lot i think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog goreng or like fishball like that
the epok-epok also just now (err) orang sebelah kasih also like very nice also
i never get to try the sardine i wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but the epok-epok like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very garing
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
(um)
bake it
[oh]
i think like the epok-epok when i eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old #chang-kee# [one] cause it's like
(err) taste a bit like it but i feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat sebab dia banyak inti and then dia pun macam dia pun macam very crunchy rangup like that
the old #chang-kee# one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet i tried the #ondeh-ondeh# and the red velvet one
ya the #ondeh-ondeh# one
but it's like
the #ondeh-ondeh# one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the #ondeh-ondeh# because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was (uh) on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
but it was like very little but got flavour [lah] and then macam very sedap macam rasa macam those #ondeh-ondeh# cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because i ate the red velvet before that then macam very manis and everything then i cannot tahan also
ya
the apam i ate and
i eat one and i think there's one more right now in the kitchen
[oh] then i don't know cause the apam was actually supposed to be one for me and one for adik but i think i know i ate it but i don't know if adik ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the #bhatoora#
i thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
on the kitchen stove i thought that was the apam
ya i mean ya i also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the #briyani# with the potato also can
and then the the kuah from the #bhatoora# also still have
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the #bhatoora# like in the morning eat very nice [ah] but also like really oily
i think they fr~ like i ya they deep fried or something
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to tuang it's on the #bhatoora#
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but i don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
[ah] got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but i think
and you know when i was eating the chickpeas i thought like [oh] maybe can make hummus then we eat with hu~ we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread i think very nice also
ya that's why i was saying [ah] so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
i think i don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first (uh)
and then i don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
doing hummus right tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan hummus
macam sedap [seh]
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
i so shocked cause i really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
[oh] ya #baklava# also very nice #baklava# with like teh o sedap [seh]
#kunafe# is which one
(mm) i don't think i tried #kunafe# before but i think i've heard about it before
the bak~ is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
i think
i don't know see first (uh) i think like
[ah] cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
i don't know i i actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
[oh] ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
but i very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then bila dah nak makan then macam rasa dia berbeza cause orang lain yang buat
so ya macam tak tahu [ah] like
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at #joo-chiat# right like (err) that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
!huh! #ang-mo-kio# a&w halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
i thought they say got a&w [oh] no that one is shake shack
[oh] i want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream macam tak
ya the whipped cream it's like macam it's not like serasi in that not not not serasi it's like tak equal like that bila dia spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
i think the #satay# when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the lemak and then you know the #satay# punya minyak [ah] like that right and then you eat with the lontong the bawang timun everything then you cecah in the kuah very sedap and then macam
ya the babat i thought the babat #satay# i wouldn't like but when i ate it bila masih panas [kan] sedap gila then macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan
i think the i don't know for me was the nasi was nothing special it was like nasi minyak like that
and then like the i think like overall it was really nice [ah] but the they have the like the sambal not the sambal but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right i expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli makan dengan green chilli gitu with the nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam crunchy crunchy gitu
but the daging very nice macam makan gitu macam sendiri because it's very easily peel off then macam very sedap
and then macam the minyak right i was thinking if like if kalau kat rumah sendiri right the nasi you put in the minyak then you panaskan you buang you buat macam nasi goreng like that
ya but i think i like it [ah] cause
i i was like in the mood for like just not
not a lot of flavour but like just the daging taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli makan tepi gitu
but the sad thing is the vegetables dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit [jer] the lettuce and everything ya
sebab if i have a lot then macam makan pun macam tak segan right then can put and wrap everything nicely
ya
ya
i've been wanting to eat that also like i think maybe buy seaweed and then nasi then we still have a bit of the serunding right
and (uh)
ya i saw then i was like thinking maybe i don't i don't think seaweed and serunding will taste nice so i think macam beli lettuce atau cabbage gitu [kan] serunding and then buat macam wrap wrap gitu then sambal belacan and then a bit of macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak
kat dalam makan
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know (err) during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for k_f_c you know even their k_f_c right the k_f_c each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
no [eh] i don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so nak beli barang tu semua but maybe we all like
keluar keluar to cause hari ni is
(uh) naomi's birthday and then like we all thought macam
(uh) kita pun terlupa then it's like [oh] then we just okay [lah] december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
so
ya
ya during december then (err) i also meeting like some of my (err) like
(err) #kailey# and #ayumi# the couple that i tell you about right then i am meeting them so like macam
to cause like dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya timetable semua very busy right so nak jumpa and then macam makan sama-sama or something then that time i told you me and #ayumi# we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right dia belanja because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what [ah] see how
i want (uh) we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how [lah] because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then i cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed [ah] because like we all thought like (err) we all planned already and then like that night last minute (uh) that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her [mah] but don't know how [lah] see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped kena find orang baru [ah] don't know how see first
i think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there i think it's like
bet the person bought lebih sedap daripada you beli because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then macam
tak was-was also nak makan
so ya then kalau you beli besar pun like knowing you you know like you makan one slice then you can simpan if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel [oh] the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at #jurong# point anymore i only eat the
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like lemak manis everything i never try the mango one but i tried like a bit [lah] because i also cleaning up right then i tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one !wah! very nice i rugi they never buy the apple flavour
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
if not then go eat at hajjah maimunah or something sana [kan] sedap and then like
you guys can eat #bingsu# or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle i can tell you the place that i eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
it's besar so dua orang makan kenyang
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat [lah] but i doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things [what]
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like belanja her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it [seh]
if not
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like macam treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
minum teh like that or like twg got like the two set the two people set
ya so you boleh makan kat situ macam tea break i don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where macam dia orang makan [ah] you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from twg
then
that time also
(uh) my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the (uh) tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also dia minum macam sedap
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive [lah] but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan catch up with one another
no that one is
another one i don't really remember but i can ask her
cause like the one that i do my painting right the one that i said like buka the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but i think kalau tak salah it's
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so i think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
the desserts all like really nicely macam betul-betul sedap-sedap they got assortments macam like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like i searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain macam susah nak pakai voucher ni sebab you tak tahu really macam mana nak pakai you tak tahu hotel mana accept hotel mana tak
but ya like that one also i wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what i remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people [lah] but you cannot like hund~ (err) four hundred dollars
ya
i think
(err) if not you can go #bugis# like the #bugis# #haji# area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to #bugis# street there right that one that time i went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's (err) like it's like affordable (uh) not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
(err) ya and then if not you can go to the that time the #joo-chiat#
#changi# area
the ya then macam got a few cafes [lah] if not also the
around her area
#choa-chu-kang# area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite #ulu# [mah] so ya
ya
that time i went with her at #jurong# east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like (uh) the like i bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad [lah] but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like #bugis# or something to lepak and berbual-berbual kat situ because atmosphere pun #shiok# and then makanan pun actually really not bad and then nowadays #bugis# area i think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time i makan burger with my friend right then i told you that the atmosphere also not bad
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
i want eat the i don't know i want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but i just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
i think five like i know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
[oh] ya cannot refund right
tapi if like that macam susah because from the look of it susah nak travel sebab pasal covid and then i read up they said that kalau nak travel pun sekarang dah ada banyak measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so macam susah like waste of time
but i don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but sekarang pun macam end of year pun belum lagi okay everything macam we are still kalau tak salah in phase two
so macam i don't know [ah] quite susah
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
!huh! if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go #bali#
indonesia
i want eat i want to eat the i really want to eat the indonesian bakso sedap [seh] dengan macam chilli sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi roadside makan-makan gitu
dengan dia orang punya soda gembira everything and then the atmosphere orang-orang rokok everything
i want the murtabak manis
[oh] ya this whole year takde pasar malam [seh]
i don't think will have
luckily my school has some of the pasar malam food like #takoyaki# all and then like cantine all have the goreng pisang goreng keledek all so okay [lah] can still tahan but the #you-zha-kueh# burger ramly all !wah! i really miss keropok lekor
and then the susu honeydew tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air sugar cane dia orang suka [seh] tu rindu [seh]
[oh] i want to go the i want the indian sweet again the pink colour one you know the pink and white one i always eat then i want to buy one of the skirts again
ya but
and then drink with mango #lassi# over there sedap [seh] that time we drink with the mango #lassi# !woo! masam tapi manis
[ah] ya that time yang #deepavali# that one that #adit# left halfway
ya that one that one the mango #lassi# very nice
[oh] ya
why suddenly got a lot of face wash [ah]
[oh]
i suddenly like i go back home right i like shower and then i was like okay and then shower shower i looked at the face wash area i saw like [eh] a lot of face wash then all the face wash was like the brand that
like you see like i never used before right then i was [oh] okay then didn't think about it then i was like [eh] rezeki sebab my face wash also nak dekat habis then i actually wanted to buy my new face wash then i saw got new face wash already i was like okay [lah] can
two face wash and then one pimple cream and then her perfume and her makeup stuff
but i don't think adik will use because adik very particular about his face
ya
[oh] ya then the perfume nenek give right the bau right stay for very long [eh]
ya like i spray like my class nine eight a_m right i spray right until like i spray like on my bod~ like on my because i was wearing like inner clothing then i was wearing outer clothing so i spray on the inner clothing on my body also until like
one after zohor like one two p_m masih ada bau dia like it's very faint but tapi masih ada bau dia and then nenek punya
the lipstick and bedak muka right i pakai right !wah! it's like [eh] very nice because the thing is like bedak muka i wanted to i was like i i i

bedak muka i already because like my foundation i needed something to set and then when she gave it to me i was like okay i can use it and then like i used right and then her lipstick i was like [eh] like !wow! okay very nice very like very comfortable [lah] then i was like okay this is like my nenek
and then the lipstick colour also because like very
no no no the lipstick colour you know dulu dulu nenek has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
(um) smo~ like smokey maroon red

ya for me today was okay [ah]
apa tu (err)
tadi
today today was my off day
and i got like three days off you know how i told you macam i
ada kira-kira
sepuluh hari lagi left
of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) i've been trying to clear so
slowly slowly [ah] slowly gila
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like i found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths (uh) they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so i think a bit macam
a bit
apa tu senget
ya
ya a bit skew~ skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's tech~ it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
[ah] macam gitu [lah] ya
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups i was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something i forgot his name
but apa tu
dia
ya i was inside luckily i had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
i went first in that group and when i went first
the apa tu the
i took like i think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which wa~ that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the sh~ zoom didn't respond
i think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya i had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one i found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
kurang ajar [seh] kurang ajar gila
it's not it's tak compulsory tapi macam
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya

ya [seh]
okay [lah] okay [lah] tak cukup attention
tak cukup apa tak cukup attention kesian dia
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but apa tu
but
(err) because remember i had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three a_m shift correct
so dia baru join
so it wa~ like his first day was just me and him
because there was this other person but he selalu
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
kena
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
ya it was quite rabak (uh)
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
i may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow i might need to leave earlier
and he was i_c [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so i i was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just i think (err)
i may need to leave tomorrow morning after six a_m s_m_s
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go i was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because i have this teeth
problem like i have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
(err) apa tu (err)
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night i think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
nak kena siap apa nak kena siap abeh nak kena pakai baju
ya [lah] abeh nak mandi semua
i don't know [lah] i'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what i mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
so anyway he told me that [lah] he told me macam
(err) okay i need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] i told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you i will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also

to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like i think i was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait wait wait [ah] !walao! !walao!
ya he was so lost and i felt so bad because like
i only

suddenly i saw i was still in the shift one
so i was like what the hell
ya i asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but i will just ask for off on the days that i'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that i have ya on the days that i have my
my language classes then dia macam
dia macam cin~ tak cakap apa-apa never say anything so aku macam okay
then like i and
i only found out about this
movement to n_e_a this confirmed movement to n_e_a because i had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because i'm changing clients
ya so it's a bit macam give me some heads up (uh)
ya so it's quite
ya but now i'm going to change to n_e_a shift
in december
same timing
three a_m to twelve p_m
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty a_m to twelve p_m [eh] twelve thirty p_m
then now it's like (err) three a_m to twelve p_m
i can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya i did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
i'm quite excited because it's a new i've been on this shift forever right you know
i'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) i'd have to
retake like i'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but i'm going on this n_e_a shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
tu [lah]
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans i think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
like ya i cannot force people like i cannot paksa orang to
datang and you know
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
and then macam it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
i'm
my sleep is deprived
i have to really plan macam straight away after finish
twelve thirty
i have to sleep
and then i have to wake up at like i don't know six seven
pastu keluar lepak and then go straight to work atau sleep a bit more and
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if i have to meet people at night then i can't sleep
know what i mean
ya
(mm)
tidur [jer] kerja
ya and because my shift pukul berapa pukul tiga
tiga pagi sampai dua belas setengah petang
it's like
if i were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know i don't know i think
high chance right that i will be on this n_e_a shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for n_e_a
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
no takde takde takde
no they dorang big fans of n_e_a macam the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill (uh) actually
tu [lah] maksud dia
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything [ah] because it's a totally lain punya client ya
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what i mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
tiga ribu
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what i mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree i have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
ya she she took chemistry in the u_s pastu (um)
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so i mean it's good [lah] i i think i've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
that i've been very complacent macam i've
like this current shift that i'm on [lah] i've been too complacent
not complacent macam terlalu banyak
terlalu banyak
terlalu banyak
(um)
apa tu terlalu banyak
i don't know i i just i
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time i used to ya last time i used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
(err) [oh] yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok the the deadline and all that
like [oh] because we have to we have to make like attend~
a clock report right every ten a_m
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
abeh kita proofreading we put everything [ah] like whether the date is correct
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers [lah]
the numbering and all that and the [oh] categorisation and all that is betul
so
then now i'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like i one time i caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then i realised [oh] shit this is very bad i need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
macam whether they
whether they apa tu
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
volunteer because kita punya kerja [kan] banyak ada nak kena #chope#
reserve
macam you must #chope# certain deliverables [lah]
ya
correct so like every morning okay i tell you the process of macam mana kita kerja
okay so pukul tiga setengah i bangun
three fifty i wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
i've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty i download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
let's say pukul lima we have to send headlines
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] i'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
because i'm the kind of person yang i cannot tunggu for people
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not i will take it and i will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if i were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
i'm not a i'm not
like i'm not a apa tu
like i cannot be i cannot make decision like i'm undeci~ indecisive
i just want people to i have to be like smart about it (uh) when i when i think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
that was last time (uh) remember i told you there was like one time in between july sampai
september ke august
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
pastu
jaded ya
just jaded like macam
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
so dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
orang ketiga [lah]
no
apa benda home wrecker
kayu tiga
i don't know
i think so
i'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
no i think dorang nak more natural conversation so that
this whatever a_i can pick up
i know [lah] but macam we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)
ya [lah]
no but i just
i don't know takut it's not accept~ because i don't they also never say like what
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a h_d_b you know what i mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya

flexible
project
ya macam
in terms of you have to be able to be flexible if things don't work out
so if let's say you will have like you said you had a certain shot in mind right
then macam
sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your
ya manage your expectations [ah]
to get that shot you know what i'm saying
i don't know [lah] there could be those directors yang very macam [oh] i need this shot

(mm) it's every it's all the things that i appreciate in films put together and like !whoa! i was so surprised [eh]
you know what i mean like you it makes you think macam [oh] my god !whoa!
do the people that you know now are they like
who are they you know what i mean make me make me question my current relationships with like people that i know like my family even are they the people they are
ya [sia]
exactly
!wah! you know when he went through the house
was he supposed to or was he not supposed to
like you know how they say like the
i hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
but like you know when he went through the apa tu
[kan] ada i don't know whether the lady or the man yang cakap
if dia go through the door
like the family will die or something like that right so he went through right
but was he supposed to or not

(mm)
you're also insignificant
correct correct
(mm)
did we watch another movie together about the the cerita indonesia

this indonesian woman
who had to balik to balik kampung sebab
dia nak
dia nak reconnect dengan family dia ke apa

remember yang dia hang baju pastu
ada badan
cerita apa [eh]
yes yes yes that [one] yang tu yang tu
(uh) can watch online if you want [eh] you want to watch today
ya
why
(mm)
i still haven't watch actually that's why i
ya
but ya i think that [one] will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know [ah] movies are
just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like (uh) tanya or ask anyone i don't know
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay okay i also had scriptwriting
i had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah# #blah# #blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
i want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
i know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your mon~ and not all your money
but this kind of thing definitely need macam to set up to set aside like at least
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to i mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if i can off day that
meets with your off day
know what i mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
i don't know how to check how do i check
haven't played a lot of games yet but i will try it later i have a lot of time
(mm) i try play on borderland [lor]
i i haven't bought yet
expensive no
[oh] yes you're right you're right betul betul betul
betul #betuls# okay [lah]
(mm)
i kind of blew my money on shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but i bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
i bought camera through you right i bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] i bought masks
okay later i will show you i bought the remember i told you i bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train i bought the demon slayer masks
cute gila [oh] my god it's very cute
ya ya i dah wash lagi i dah basuh
i dah kering
i dah apa lagi (err) vocabulary boleh kasi dorang
i kering i dah squeeze dry
i dah compress tu [jer]
semp~
ya i dah i've done quite a lot of things [lah]
ya so as in it's drying now tengah nak kering i'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
bawa balik [ah] mana satu yang you nak
i i i i i only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
i ordered four
because it all looks so pretty semua lawa gila
of course [lah] but like i have other masks too
ya but i i'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
dia macam those who know will know right
and then people think like (err) this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
ya we've talked about this before berbual
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
like you know how when it when it's macam when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
i feel like when everybody watches it
dia macam it feels a bit cheaper because like
[oh] now they are going more mainstream lebih mainstream
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but i mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
popularity of macam demon slayer for example
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
not as popular of course [lah] but macam ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merc~ merchandise nak beli nak beli apa lagi
nak beli
ya macam these merchandise nak beli baju you know
it's so easy to find
ya [lah] but macam if you if it were another show for example macam fruits basket
atau i don't know what's another show i don't hear it (err) hunter by hunter x hunter
quite popular [eh] macam you know what i mean
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what i'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
well known so macam that's why i say there's pros and cons [ah]
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because i don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate i just talked to my
you tahu [kan] i ada classmate jepun in my korean class
so dia
(err)
she's very she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
so macam most of us kita ambil sebab kita either
interested in the culture
we watch k dramas
kita tengok dengar lagu
kita tengok cerita k drama dengar lagu k-pop or like you know just korean artist
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
so i asked her like [oh] how about ya so i asked her macam
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
and she say macam
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or j or j like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
macam real people
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then i ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] i just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics i think
(um) i'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
i don't think so i think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway i asked her like how's
the life in japan macam how was her school life or like at least [lah]
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no i don't think maybe i don't know
ya
but she's she
she's quite nice [lah] then she shared with me like about her school life (uh) how dia kerja part time
(um) like during high school and all that
quite interesting [ah] it's it's i love this class because macam
i get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and like the eleven year old punya remember i berbual pasal
cute gila
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
i'm ver~ i'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
ya because like i like i talk to her about macam my trip to #yogyakarta# the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also macam in #jakarta# and how dia rindu [lah] rindu gila dengan #jakarta# tapi she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place paling
paling selamat
for in terms of safety
general safety and for covid [ah]
tak kat #yishun# not at #yishun#
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
and then (um) dia macam i don't know
very nice [ah] they all very nice people i'm just very glad
i i guess
i don't know they would look as i don't know
i mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean i think i can understand a lot
of like whether i watch
i can try
i can try but just know you can check what okay okay
boleh boleh
[ah] i have a lot i have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe i'll be more pro
sampai tahap maksima
kidding
apa
(um)
i mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) i'm i'm guessing if i were to go korea now i can speak basic
korean like i can ask where the toilet is i can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is i just it'll take me awhile to (um) calculate [lah] because dorang punya numbering is very susah gila it's like
dorang count [kan] dorang punya currency besar gila [kan]
in the thousands so like
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia sama juga
so nak kena you must really calculate [lah]
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
banyak fikir [ah] i feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
to speak that language you know what i'm saying
correct i mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
exactly but macam
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
ya i just have to keep practising but i have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to layan my korean i feel like i'm such a
whatever a korean weeb is
when i try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because i want to improve but i just bought key caps
from shopee
ya i'll show you later it's very very nice bro
lawa gila it's very it's super damn it's super nice
!wah! i don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because i was a bit
suspicious
when i saw ya when i saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) i used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and and i'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for logitech [eh]
say it's for logitech
!hey! how are you
dah lama tak nampak kau
tak ingat [seh] i think like since covid about
macam
almost two months ago
[kan]
betul tak
asal kau ketawa [ah] kau teringat something [ah] ni [kan] mesti
[a'ah] that time yang aku video call kau tu [lah] yang kau ingat tak what happen that time
you were having your assignment but then i was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
i don't know i can't remember but it was video call
(mmhmm)
tu [ah]
[a'ah] [seh]
[ah] [sia] like a blessing in disguise [ah] [eh]
okay [lah]
kerja aku rabak juga [ah] like because i don't know whether
you heard
but
(um) kerja aku recently buang orang like at least two k of the staff are gone so right now i mean the ones that are left semua nak kena buat you know pick up the slack abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat
i was not affect~ as in like okay i was not affected for the exercise i was i mean i'm still having my job now [lah] but (um) you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done [ah]
ya actually i am most of the time only like (err) two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
everything can be done via the laptop [lah] but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to apa tu collect dia punya physical mails
cause there are some like letters from (err) the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
[eh] aku tak boleh imagine [sia] like i will i cannot even you know
both of us ada short attention span and like to have
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
abeh like you can't even like focus and
you know
i just can't pay full attention if i were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if i were to go back office at least half a day at least i get some fresh air otherwise i mean i'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time [lah]
a few hours at least
in a week
ya [lah] i mean staying at home involve like i mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
(mm)
!huh! as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
ya i know you always do [lah] you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere [lah]
i mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
[oh]
i know
i think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you i don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but i feel you [ah] like i stress eat also most of the time i think i think it's not just us
banyak orang juga like you know stress eat
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age (um)
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one (um) app away or one call away so
(mm)
is it i never heard of that before
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
[oh]
i see i will check that out i think one day aku check it out
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's fun speaking of joget recently also like literal you know literally yesterday (err) me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through macam dance punya youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing [kan] kau you don't feel i mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to kau buat like (um)
hiit workouts i mean that works better [lah] because you know it's a specific punya macam (err) they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then (um) she she we decided to because we have p_s four i mean she we decided to apa tu download
this thing (err) this game apa just dance [eh] ya so we've had we've yet to try that (err) it's going to be fun i mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
(uh huh)
ya
(mmhmm)
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good [ah]
like you feel more refreshed abeh nanti kau tak feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time (err) always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
as cliche as it sounds [lah]
i'm not one to preach but it is important [lah] cause now also zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang all fast food and things like that you know as compared to zaman dulu [kan] they're more much more
(um) healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like i have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my (err) to get my workout in [ah] on a daily
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes pun jadi [ah]
kau tahu tak aku
highly ambitious niat tu ada but selalu tak kesampaian like i set my alarm on at six a_m in the morning everyday macam berangan [ah] like macam kau nak [oh] berangan nak jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour [ah]
and then lepas tu start the start my day right you know working and then like macam feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said [ah] tadi you just have to be consistent [ah]
once you get the ball rolling i think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] is it
(mmhmm)
kena monitor [ah]
what's the average [ah] what's the ideal b_p
that's normal [ah] [ah]
that plays a part [ah]
ya (mm)
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
ya like macam if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you macam tak nampak so tired or worn out [tau]
(mm)
asal kau menyesal
ya [lah] it's never too late i think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more (um) you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
i mean it's not that bad [what] i mean if you never tell me i wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face [sial] babe
[oh] no i'm saying this is because my room is dark and i can't really see your face right now
aku memang suka like dark (err) like because i don't know like
i've always like you you see even my light is dim and i refused to change it because i like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually i did once upon a time but i took it out because
entah [eh] macam tak lawa sangat [ah]
ya i hang it like macam fairy lights around dia punya ni [ah] my my bedroom punya frame
and then i took it down i actually still have it [lah] and then macam because i prefer to use like macam candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that kalau fairy lights when you switch it on [kan]
okay [lah]
it looks fine i guess i just want to change things a bit
but i feel like it then i'll put it back on [lah]
i think the orangey type i guess there is different settings [ah] different modes that you can choose from like macam those like blinking ones or like macam !alah! you know macam lampu lap lip [lah] basically
it's like that
ya
[oh] yes it's right there
ya i use it is dia macam aurora lights
no [lah] i mean i don't switch it on when i'm asleep [lah] bila aku nak you know feeling spa day nak relax then i on the spa music and then light on my candles
bila aku nyanyi ya bila aku nyanyi nak feeling feeling
you know me too well
[a'ah] [eh] berapa lama [eh] kita dah kawan
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no
is it [eh] is it k one or nursery [eh]
sana tu mana
kat #gek-poh# [ah]
(err) k
two yes tapi k one
k one yang dekat (err) (mmhmm) (uh huh)
sama [eh]
there seven
[oh]
primary five [eh]
primary five ya
tak ingat [seh] but i know it's
memang confirm primary school [lah] but i don't know whether it's like primary five mother tongue [eh] ke apa
[oh] my gosh wait primary five
[oh] apa eleven
and then now we are like [oh] my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
i'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
tak tahu it's like literally after school it's not
even during school we don't really talk to each other [kan]
[ah] [eh] speaking of which tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun like literally random [ah] like aku tak rapat dengan dia pun like tu pun aku that time kerja part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then (err) kita tak contact pun and then after that random after few years aku jumpa dia dekat (err) #tioman# island ke apa then random gila then lepas tu we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we we plan a trip to #bali# and then i met her again just now so macam random [lah] like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to macam like meet them often but
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
(mmhmm)
[oh] [ah] tu pun random [seh] kau pun pergi trip dengan dia juga
[ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
that sounds so wrong
i mean come on everybody's thinking it
i bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
anyway speaking of which how's your love life dah lama aku tak dengar apa any anything new that you want to talk to me about
(mm)
(mm)
the last time kau cakap dengan aku dia
something about his throat [eh] sakit ke apa
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
rajin [seh] kau
(mm)
ya
(mm)
right
i think i know like you
i mean as a friend i i've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know macam you gave so much (um) care and concern love to others
ob~ obviously you don't expect the same in return [lah] kau ikhlas memang but
you know (um) from what you're telling me
correct me if i'm wrong if you're feeling like macam it's one sided like you
like
the effort
is only at your end
you know then bila kau sakit tangan ni semua i mean it's not it's not even something minor i mean is a big thing you know like
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
it is a a problem for you it's an issue for you so macam he's not putting in that effort maybe is that is that what you are saying like macam all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that i know there are hard times [lah] but
(err) it is all about compromising and macam if you're the only one putting in the effort and and and being invested
you know like (um) in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
then entah [eh] do you really think it's worth it then
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow! that really open up like
a lot of things like macam
while you are sharing me this i mean i completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay [lah] (um) being in a relationship of friends [ah] like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this (um) saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like (err) people come and go
and especially when the (err) when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
i don't know about men [lah] but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know i don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women [eh] i don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay (um) you know
(um) you shouldn't get back to your (err) to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly [kan] (err) maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my ex~ no not experience [lah] but from what i noticed like i do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense [ah] i'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
i mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
!aww!
!aww! so cute
a book like a diary
[oh] right okay
[oh] my gosh
[eh] but you know it's a good thing you know like i think
[eh] that is actually a good thing like (um) it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know (um) on paper
(mm)
then it hit you [ah]
ya you i mean i know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like (um)
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
(um)
!aww! dia blue tick kau [oh] dia seen kau [oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up [ah] then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
[oh] my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
i think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes dia yang paling decent
ya
i mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
(mm)
ya [lah] like i said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up [eh] not not the cause of your okay [lah] somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay [lah] i'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause i'm a true friend i'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then i don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya [lah] but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you al~ you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
!aww!
!wow! you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
[eh] [oh] my gosh
i mean
if you may never know mana tahu
i mean i'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what i mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly [eh] when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
(err) it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
i would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what i mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead [lah] it doesn't i mean since you guys are like technically
on (err) cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay [lah]
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay i've tried you know (um) but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so kau just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't don't lie to me i know like you you you you play all these things scenarios in your head [kan] bila kau like you know
late at night kau tak boleh tidur thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
you know
but (err) do you know if he's attached now or not
[oh] my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
i mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually [ah] you don't like macam don't don't make it obligatory for him
kau tanya [jer]
[oh] is it
and then kau action [ah] treat him for his birthday or what
ya i don't give a shit anymore [sia] i can't even remember
bila birthday dia
[oh] dekat tu
tak [ah] kau action macam [oh] my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
tak
ya or (um) no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like (err) jual mahal but at the same time like !hey! you know okay i will suggest you to say just ask him like
[eh] isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah (um) let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
(err) do you have any plans macam a bit needy you know what i mean like if you will say like macam (err) let let let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to (err) do you have any plans macam like secretly hoping him would to say yes
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
kau set reminder set reminder
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
dia sama age dengan kita [eh] [oh]
[eh] you don't don't say that about yourself [lah] you are amazing
(mm) (mm)
[oh] my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
an hour we should like start a podcast or something [lah] it's like a good outlet you know like to to to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also [lah] dah lama kita tak jumpa [kan] and and it's like so good to to finally you know
[eh] ya [oh] my god i almost forgot about our #makisan#
okay to be fair i'm like facing the other side of the room now so i can't really see that it's like
you know kat belakang and not at the front so
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy i don't mind
like different topics every time
this is this has been an enjoyable voice recording session engaging
!wow! if i were to start with mine we need another one more hour
love life aku boleh like you can literally write a book out of it man
[oh] my god
my nonsense my o_c_d lain my love life lain
so basically (um)
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and (err) so (err)
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything [lah] about his life so
true enough [lah] he is a very (uh) forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an (uh) up point for him [lah] you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
number one (err) it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very macam like (uh) abang why you asking for my name no [ah] just~ upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in (err)
#changi# airport
(um)
and that #changi# airport is what we thought it was [lah] to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why [lah] but of course there's that connotation [lah] [kan] tapi it's not it's not really
that's why she's so secret~ she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it [lah]
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then (um) so now he is (uh) working at (uh) #novena# h_q and he is there because (uh) he wants to do office work and rightfully so [lah] because he wants to (uh) spend more time [lah] with your family
(uh) and
since he has going to move towards
getting married (uh) he thought this the right step [ah] as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound [lah] in why he's doing it okay then he talk about (um)
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay [ah] this one [ah] [oh] every time i do as in [ah] like
was it so difficult to [ah] get this out
so [ah] dia suka dia suka in the couch we are all sitting at the couch i was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here abah was sitting at a chair that i brought for him i got #zina# to sit right beside me
the mirror the mirror side
[ah] middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so [ah] what else (um) okay so i i
[ah] that one i didn't get to ask but that one is tak tak mai~ important [lah] ya
so the other [ah] important part was about his job experience [lah] so he did confirm his five years then i ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain [lah] actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he apa the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after p_o_p and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole b_m_t process at police again
[ah] okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
[ah] that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
[ah]
clear i ask him okay you know do you have contact (uh) do you have connect plan that's he look at me like (uh) what was that then i say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years [oh] we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said [lah] ya [ah] six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and [ah] okay
apa yang susah sangat
that's why exactly that's why i say
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and abah were very calm about it tak ada macam problematic so i spoke to them about the video thing i spoke to them that [eh]
[ah] so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was [ah] number one [ah] apa there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then dia tinggal #pasir-ris#
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale [lah] because they want to look for some a place near (err) istighfar
because dekat (um) the parents place #pasir-ris#
ya [lah] but i don't know why they want that place [lah] anyway so
i told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what i
this is this could have been boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik [lah] [kan] which is to
bilang [kan] that you want to (um) do this to both your parents and #zina's# parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that (err) the keys you know then what you have to actually this part abah was the one who [ah] already point out i just irr~ reiterated the point
nanti [kan] macam terdesak [kan] you have to like actually have to push for this [ah] then you are making it difficult for both sides
[ah] then he just he just nodded [lah] he he understood (uh) but i was still macam thinking [eh] do you real~ are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here [ah] but i think it's in between [lah] it's in between that apologetic but also macam like okay
[ah] he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel [what] begitu i say it's not about that [lah] it's about you informing do it properly
correct ya
so (um) ya so that that part they understood [lah] you know what it's it's spilt milk ready [lah] [kan] like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like i said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
[ah] then i then i also talk to them [lah] like okay want then i want to hear what is his plan abah also want to hear what is his apa dia punya rancangan [lah]
(um) then ve~ it was very clear rancangan is that
the next year somewhere dalam march they intend to tunang dengan zina
and then
that's why [lah]
that's why that's why i say i just want to hear him talk #zina# whenever #zina# butts in i was like i just wanna hear you talk and then (err)
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet abah probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement [lah]
the nikah would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least ada
[ah] revise plan [ah] [ah] correct
[ah] i also don't want to embarrass [lah] #zina# cause like i said it could have been easily a bashing #zina# session but no point [lah] the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
[ah] then okay then at least say that gives proper time [lah] for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then i say then the abah was saying you know #zina# just got
(err) just finish studying jadi apa the plan in these two years for for her (uh) then this #azram# cakap [oh] ya (uh) this is to would be
for #zina# to actually [ah] secure a job
ya because he and then he explained it before before i even need to talk about macam like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me #zina# also needs to work to build up a c_p_f
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows [lah] that's why that's why i say it's very it's very easy
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why macam it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple tak payah tak ada complication
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working [lah] and you #zena# needs to build her c_p_f and then i spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience #zena# hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for #zina# to
work so that she build her c_p_f and then they also talk about children [ah] then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
[ah] that one okay [lah] they bring about the halal thing [lah] so i was saying that yes i understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya #zina# needs to do some growing and then like i said and you both need to
and i and i pun cakap dengan dia [lah] that
you
you nak kena
apa
grow up
dia zina pun nak kena grow up
asing asing asing masing-masing kena grow up tersendiri
lepas itu
grew up together
[ah] so you need give that time untuk you both nak kena grow up [ah] that's the thing budak itu diam [jer] so i tak puas hati because like you can just be numb about this whole thing [lah] that is a which is (uh) quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that abah is there something you want to (uh) anything you want to ask them (uh) i said ya so [ah] let me check in (um) so
#ashraf# you've heard from my advice that i gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
so one thing that i brought out is you both nak kena
tersendiri grow
and then
[ah] come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you dis~ disagree or what is your perception
[ah] then they say
okay for me i (uh) i feel that
nak kena
memang [ah] nak kena apa ada this (uh)
grow up right memang nak kena ada grow up tapi (uh) growing up needs to needs perlu berada dalam
[ah] context apa
dari sendiri sebelum kahwin dan selepas kahwin
maksud dia has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
so it's like if he [lah] in the sense that [ah] so so i said okay i think you both
not just growing up
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that (uh) growing up takes place both [lah] during single and when you get married so i said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this [ah] so i made it very clear that don't just lip service dia perlu perbincangan further you guys need to communicate i told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when i say communicate abah dengar ini tak mahu communicate communicate like tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa abah there's nothing wrong with communicate i said so (um) i think they got it [lah] so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
then after the whole session also i told #zina# and even just now i texted saying that
kau orang nak kena sit down nak kena plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say [ah] ya [lah] grow grow grow but you just gonna
tak work on it you just gonna macam letak kat tepi [jer] and just macam put it into the back of your mind tak nak macam
apa buat kerja develop this it's not gonna work
so
of course [lah]
of course i'm not macam blind to this [ah]
(mmhmm)
because at the end itu mama dekat kitchen and (mm) mama malu malu [lah] apa [lah] nanti bila kita duduk makan baru mama duduk
anyway i
dayah tak ada dayah said she doesn't want to be there also [lah]
so (mm) ya then i told him okay #ashraf# after all that's been said [ah] i will let you know that i do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya [lah] i said you have
i didn't say sembunyi-sembunyi [lah] i say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
(mm)
then
(um) so basically that's it [lah] and then
at least it's it's clear [lah] that they have
at least he has his plan but
i observe from the
body gesture and how he interact with #zina# he is very firm he's just firm [lah] it's that not say very firm [lah] but it's firm macam whatever zina macam nak nak tanya [ah] #ashraf# right do you want water then he will just say
na~ no he will just use
very macam he won't just he won't say [oh] it's okay #zina# he he won't
(mm) like
so i can see [ah] and the way he speaks also is macam very direct and very
(mm) ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage [lah]
ya
so
ya
ya so it's not macam so as as am~ ambiguous as it was [lah] at least it's kind of macam very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to [ah] give #zina# time to work [ah] give #zina# time to develop
kita tak tanya pasal dia punya family ya i did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
sister is working as a librarian but at #changi#
#changi# business apa #changi# [ah] ya that one ya that one warehouse [lah] ya so
ya so it's was very easy [lah] then after when he left also i was telling [lah] see how easy and simple #ashraf#
was
by just being upfront
dia macam ya macam i i don't know that
no #zina# you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know i think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
so jadi macam
ya [lah] so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
then abah abah is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that abah like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay abah is comfortable with him already
ya so
like my [ah] that's why it was very simple [lah] because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that [lah] [kan]
so and he also can recognize [lah] the value in it and can recognise why you know #zina# needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that #zina# needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time #zina# would be the one taking care of it
#ashraf# [ah] because (uh)
someone needs to be there at home [lah] he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or #zina's# parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working [lah] and then i then i ask him so (uh) are you exploring the possibility of #zina# working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
[ah] that's something that they will have to macam resolve [lah] how but at the very least they are giving #zina# time to grow
(um)
okay [lor] then after then the
in the dining
(uh)
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear [lah] clear and upfront
and then ya like i said i got the full name got the wage it's been [ah] apa been attached to for the three months
[ah] it was okay normal not not that macam overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that [ah] the past (uh) he has yet to have the chance to go for jumaat players
ever since covid like macam basically he's just trying to share [lah] like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like macam he just brought up we were talking about jumaat prayers and then we were sharing
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
ya tak payah macam pening-pening sangat
[ah] actually after that was a lot more interest lepas itu lagi interesting
for example
(um)
was abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir [ah] ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah
ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik [ah] [ah] lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik
tolak tolak tolak semua bu~ bu~ budak ini yang terkena [kan] then i said abah
abah nak kena tengok [eh]
#hidayah# okay you you got two different daughters abah cakap apa different both are daughter yes both are your daughters tapi there are two different girls two different daughters
okay
#zina# is on the receiving end she is bre~ zina sudah memang nak menerima
apa berkahwin hidayah i don't think she is there yet dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu
pasal apa
then zina pun add in [ah] ya but she says she wants to get married ya memang dia nak tapi is she proactive looking no [what] she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors (uh)
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
!huh!
then (uh) then i said so abah you need to understand yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan
#zina# is receiving #dayah# is not there yet
so abah kena recognize that and #dayah# is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then i say abah macam habis kita then i say okay yes i know i i faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana now bila habis sampai bila abah kata
then abah let me give you some advice
if you nak di to even
dijalankan
abah bi~ (err) mama bila nak
calonkan or menunjukkan calon
biar quality
biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada quality dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik of course sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam give up dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah just throw [jer] ya then mama say tapi the one yang dekat australia itu abah mama tahu tak he is just a taxi driver then #dayah# will think macam macam bingit [lah]
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working [ah] [ah]
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
because he actually (err) apa he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to sewakan rumah ini so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
#dayah# at is at this stage of her life
itu [lah] yang aku cakap
that's why i say cari orang berkualiti berkualiti is not just about
(mm)
(mm) so we don't know that [lah] !huh!
ya so anyway jadi macam
abah understood that [lah] i said abah tak boleh control apa dayah nak ini
abah boleh control kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh control itu itu yang abah boleh control
so i said right now it seem that dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan fine tapi cari berkualiti this if people are not are ada quality and i said pada abah it's not about social status it's not about macam kaya tak kaya ya it's about the peop~ dia nak kena match [ah]
basically this this guy ya
jadi budak ini dengan dayah are two different people so cannot
that's why
so [oh] anyway going back to #zina# i i told #zina# like
you need to sit down and you really need to (uh)
figure out the plan on how you gonna
buat apa mem~ ber~ memperbaiki diri sendiri
then membina diri sendiri [eh] macam mana
[ah] lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak memper~ bina
bersama
jangan cakap saja
plan it out
tak boleh zina cakap [ah] ya ya okay i will look at it [lah] abang ya
dia cakap abang [lah] okay
fair enough [lah] if he (uh) considered (um)
cause he then i say (uh) i
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he i said [oh] i got to know yes~ i started off the conversation with him i got to know (uh) semalam that (err) you you are #ashraf# then i was thinking okay how is it macam mana dia akan menerima ini [ah] cara [eh]
zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku like
nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama i don't know [lah] but then lepas itu dia tanya (err) abang your name is #salim# is it [ah] yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me abang [ah] like if macam dia #satay# ada banyak ya then abang also can bring back the
so i thought (err) ya that's why it was easy [lah] macam abang pun cakap and because like i said
i told #ashraf# that i'm appreciative yang dia terus terang dia
ada apa ada wawasan [lah] [ah]
lepas itu abang pun cakap [ah] yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak clear [ah] habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini
(uh)
encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini [ah]
okay [lah] i thought macam the
macam mana it went through was good [lah] ya
[ah] az~ #azlina# #azlina# need to macam grow up [lah] on this
i i address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how #ashraf# is
because i i'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're macam like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has [lah] correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up i said i said just pick it up what #ashraf# has did did you see or not how #ashraf# did it
i told her [lah] did you see or not what #ashraf# did
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi
[kan] daddy cerita senang then i say isn't it simple so that macam orang tak curiga orang tak ter~ terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru
[ah] you just have to be upfront [jer] [kan] senang and ya [lah] ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
ya
that's why [lah] she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as [oh]
that's me i'm easy-going
i i told her off about that
#zina# that is not easy-going
(mm)
aku cakap dengan dia yang easy-going dengan being firm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going [what]
you are not (um) having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
(mm)
that's why during the
during the discussion dengan ashraf i was saying #zina#
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life i have been the one to guide her in what to study (mm) [ah] ashraf dengar [jer] [lah] what he want to say he just (mm) (mm)
that's why #ashraf#
if
(mm) but whatever it is he is already macam he never macam like show the reaction of macam you know or he didn't show it [lah] of being tak nak tak nak apa [oh] like shock or what i think he knows [ah] what he's getting into with #zina#
the way
ya [lah] of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya [lah] i agree of course that's why i said they both tersendiri nak kena grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed tersendiri
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent [lah]
dia
i don't think he would [lah] if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
if if kalau izat buat gitu then i will tell him off [lah] [eh] kau kenal dia ke tak [kan] kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa so we have to be we have to take this step kita kena ber~ (uh) apa kita mesti
(err)
ambil (uh)
kegiatan begini [ah] tak boleh macam [ah]
tak boleh macam apa ambil scenario [jer]
push #zina# right
pull
pull
ya
consume
i faham
step up
no [lah] dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan no
(mm)
so ya basically concludes the whole thing [lah] with
#zina# and #ashraf# then
i was two zero abah open this topic about #dayah# then i was asking #zina# #zina# what have you been talking to #dayah# [lah] about #dayah's# like (err) relationship or [a'ah] zina cakap no we don't talk each other !huh!
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya #dayah# and me then ya i understand that you and #dayah# are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then i say ya i know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya i tried already i see i try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what #hidayah# is telling me
okay so i'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
sekarang dua-dua sudah try [kan]
dua-dua sudah try
habis
tak boleh [kan] so you tell me apa nak kena buat sekarang
[ah]
nak buat apa sekarang then dia sudah [ah] ya try again [lah] try no
sudah try sudah sekarang [kan] tak boleh [kan] so nak kena buat apa
do what you want me to tell you the answer takkan [lah] i have to give you the answer
!huh!
why you must have the jawapan for me
i want to hear from your own mulut
macam mana
and then dia cakap ya then kita nak kena ask someone to help [ah] then siapa this someone to help
you [lah] [ah] then
kenapa it has to be me to ask you to
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
you know abang salim kita ada problem
okay just kind of macam jumpa
see things eye to eye tak boleh macam bersefahaman
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why zina kalau if this were the reverse that let's say you and #zina# you and #dayah#
i had the same kind of argument with me and #izat# i bet you [ah] you and #dayah# would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least [ah] you see [ah] it me and #izat#
macam mana pun that has happen [ah] #izat# would still come and apologize to me
i'm doubting you know whether you and #dayah# would apologise to each other
then you did #zina# was saying macam like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no i talk about personal things to #izat#
macam like life [lah] about children about
apa marriage like that that
ya ya
na~ [lah] macam ya [lah] macam like how how he (uh) apa decided to get married with with #salimah# then ya we have ya before even during during apa
during [ah] our apa being after being married also we still talk about macam certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not macam pen pals is not like macam like the way i would talk to #faris# for example but
macam at least macam things things about personal things i still can talk to him macam i can easily talk to him macam [eh] #izat# kau tengok macam [ah] macam dayah is like s~ i i can have the conversation with #izat# you know ya i can but macam
#dayah# and #zina# will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that macam
that's why [lah] that's why it seems it's
ya [lah]
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what i'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
no [lah] not really enstranged like even after this one i i have macam move on and forgive him already like whatever di~ he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise dulu lagi tak boleh apologise pun dia punya ego is so big
what the
like have to see it as steps [lah]
so
that i mean like
i know that if i meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to macam make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms #hidayah# and #zina# is different they are just happy with being ignored
dayah zina sudah give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring #hidiyah#
that's how bad it is [ah] so at least me and izat kalau kita disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like izat macam has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that macam he feels very strongly that i'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not macam (um) tak nak berbual dengan si salim no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
how he macam best character he needs to learn to work it out
so okay [lah] i think
kita semua memang have your own areas of growth but
#dayah# and #zina# is like they just ignore the problem then i say #zina# especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi [kan] lagi kau orang lagi will be more separated
i can tell that me and #izat# even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
you and #dayah# ready have a problem bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi what do you think
this passive aggressiveness tak boleh tak boleh [ah]
and not just macam like [ah] tak apa no it's not tak apa
(uh huh)
ya i i did i did macam tell her [lah] that at the end of the day we are all family and i also did tell her that (uh)
you nak kena
fikir how
this is important this memang mustahak
that family comes first
that you need to see that
you cannot just macam biarkan that this issue (err) to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so i told ya [lah] so i told her nevermind
the what i need from you is are you in agreement
bersetuju tak
nak abang salim tolong
[ah] first you have to you setuju if you setuju
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side i will ask hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak then
we will make it happen
jadi it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem masalah yang dia ada ini is trust issues #hidayah# doesn't trust her because #hidayah# feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what #zina# has trust issues because things #dayah# is no no dis~ it all dismiss i'm better than you [ah] so that's why [lah] trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts [ah] so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
macam
tak boleh [ah] it's just not healthy and you cannot just
biarkan macam gitu [jer]
yes so i
mama abah just listen so good thing was
mama abah willing to hear
and then
mama !wah! at one okay at one point
(mm) kenapa
(mm)
nevermind just (mm)
okay so anyway i'll just continue talking like (um) there was one point where (um)
#zina# was (uh) no i (uh) #zina# was saying that she was (um) the reason why apa she went on to telling #izat# first because she wa~ felt more comfortable talking to #izat#
then i said #zina# since when you are that close to #izat# then she said ya you don't know i'm that close to #izat# then i say rubbish [lah]
then she she sudah bingit [lah] bila kena rubbish then she walk off
i say since when i'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
she she kena already [lah] then she walk off
so that's why i told her ya #zina# you are close to #izat# because of the boys ya i said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to #izat#
#izat# is just a byproduct this relationship that you have i didn't meant to say the word byproduct [ah] but i say you are close to the boys just because of (uh)
(uh) you are close to #izat# just because the boys (uh) with #izat# you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to #izat#
then i say since when you been talking to #izat# since when
all all the
then say ya of recent years it has been the case [ah] that's that's the part i said [ah] rubbish then stop it since when then she already sudah kena then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it [lah] macam like [eh] mana sa~ !wah! you are the
you are that close to #izat# then i say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys [kan]
further studies
[ah] then i then i also
so going back to yang tadi [kan] we were talking about #zina# and #dayah# and i was asking #zina# who do you think you
need this person the person [ah] to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then i said ya then you think what #izat# can do this job [ah]
[ah] then #izat# do you think then she's like smile [ah] !aiya! [lah] cannot [lah]
then i say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that i know you know that i can help right
(mm) that's why
jadi sebab dia kena tengok and understand that this is the situation
(hmm)
jadi macam bila dayah
and #zina# sit down together then they can iron this out [lah] macam
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that i have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward [one] really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
they just don't see the point in macam making sure that they are
you know comfortable
ya of course
true [lah] dia tak boleh macam just simply you know say that [oh] this is a one time deal mesti [lah] dia ingat
ya so obviously it takes steps [lah] it's not macam i one time can boleh boleh
apa terus langsung
wish [eh]
so kalau tak kesah [ah] kalau it's not practical
okay like maybe first would be i want the bank account that will like refresh itself [tau] tak dia tak (err) like i don't need to put duit inside [lah] biar dia biar pakai [jer] refresh to the original amount so kalau macam gitu (err) i don't need like a lot of money i just have enough money but enough is good jadi like tak sombong gitu [ah]
top up [ah] top up tapi bukan kita yang top up [ah]
(uh) tak tahu siapa yang top up [ah] tapi terima kasih [jer]
then for you
nak kahwin [oh] tapi that's your first wish tu mesti mesti ada boyfriend dulu [ah]
terus suami [eh] takde boyfriend tapi now you got boyfriend right
dah berapa lama
three months
[oh] like how is it
tapi korang ada pernah macam (uh) fight ke apa ke
so far belum [ah] (mm) okay tapi sekarang [kan]
se~ sekarang [kan] macam covid [kan] so cannot really meet each other that much apa
[oh] but how frequently tu
twice a week
[ah] not bad [lah]
but like for me i remember bila i was dating [kan] (uh) we meet everyday sebab sama sekolah apa so kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama in the weekends so hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka so bila kahwin i also know that takkan jelak [ah]
tak serik [ah] tapi okay [ah] dah dah come on [ah] dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu should be fine [lah] [kan]
[oh] you met the the mum
okay
[eh] panggil dia apa makcik cik
ya [lah]
lepas tu makcik tu cakap apa
apa-apa [jer] jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia
[oh] tapi dah it's like coincidence ke atau memang nak jumpa dia
(uh)
(mm)
bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau like atau tak kasi dia jumpa you
[eh]
[oh] ya ya ya [oh] dia tak tahu
mak dia [jer] tahu [ah]
[oh] asal dia tak bilang
right
ya macam why he why he like want to like keep it secret [seh]
[oh] okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you [ah]
okay so do you guys like macam
but you guys haven't fought right okay [lah]
cause they say like you know
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then kalau like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child i don't know [ah] middle chair honestly i don't know
but i'm not sure if like they'll be a
problem with that so far takde [lah]
bagus [lah] k wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
[oh] [eh] apa bara api tu scary juga tu nanti kalau like if one of you all like marah habis [sia] dua-dua volcano [seh]
[oh]
so like your chinese [one] your you you're what [ah] tiger right ya tiger memang [ah]
macam [a'ah] bara api gitu tiger fierce
tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa so baru tiga bulan so you don't know [lah] like
i think it will take a while [lah]
one year
k [lah]
(um) i think one year okay maybe six months [ah]
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
cause for me and my husband kalau kita kita dah jumpa everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months kita macam dah tahu each other gitu [ah] so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
like
fight that okay i did something wrong then kita orang cakap [ah] kita mesti cakap [ah] like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys dia sekarang sekolah right so he berapa tahun lagi [eh]
right ya so he is
[oh] he's just a normal [lah] bukan honours [lah]
okay okay cause i think honours is like five years gitu
(mm) four years so dia macam
okay dia start dia belajar apa
gitu-gitu [ah]
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
(mm)
[oh] first year already tak surviving [oh] rabak hancur [seh]
exam exam [ah] okay so dia sekarang end of the first year
(mm) so
if he pergi counselling the course counselling he might have to restart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
three four more years with something you don't like [kan] lagi exams means you have to study for it
(mm)
[oh]
tu [ah] and he's still so young he's like what twenty five [kan] so so i feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter [ah] ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then lagi rabak then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
probably horrible for him
ya so i think
i think macam dia kena fikir betul-betul [lah] kalau dia kalau dia nak continue ke atau dia nak
like tukar ke because like one year is still okay tapi bila dah two years gitu [kan] then i think that's when it's (err) there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay [lah] kalau nak tukar right ya and i think it's quite easy to actually switch educat~ switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like kalau in n_u_s in n_u_s so actually kalau some people right they will (uh) come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first sebab lagi senang but you waste one year [lah] but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
(uh) (uh) so like macam gitu pun boleh [lah] kalau if you want because a lot of people kat poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like (err) some course that they don't like like engineering gitu then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma yang dorang nak and then after dorang masuk then they get to go [ah] so it for them is like (um) ya you you sacrifice one year [ah] to do what you want then so you can think of it like that gitu
but does he know what he want to do
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay so dia dah tapi dia electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff asal dia tak pergi digipen
(mm)
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
(mm)
ya i mean take a risk [ah] if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
[kan] i mean that's what i would do [lah]
like i'll i'll go for the one that i think i cannot reach first then i'll try my hardest but then kalau tak boleh you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best [lah]
then (um) okay but he's in which uni again
okay so i don't know whether
n_u_s has any of that kind of [ah]
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in n_u_s he has to think properly [lah] what kind of course he wants cause like
i don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for n_t_u ada a_d_m [tau] art design on media that [one] at least [ah] there's some form of creative output but for n_u_s i really don't know
(mm)
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but woo~ where do you want to go
what
[oh] okay okay
there's a master's in (uh) lasalle
(uh) (err) east asian studies
ya so like macam my teacher in lasalle the one i'm doing degree that [one] that time [kan] she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic i i didn't want [lah] so [eh] i mean i feel like
(um) i'm okay tapi i feel like i gone i got degree already so i want to at least do something about it i don't want to like
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
you think i'm like by the time i graduated i was already what twenty five ya so macam i felt like i needed to work or at least do something [ah] like not school for once gitu
ya pretty much even though like kat uni i i took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff tapi then i went back so ya then i think
i think that it's okay [lah] like
cause if you just study [jer] [kan]
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right (um) what i heard from my classmates [ah] yang dah dorang bekerja [kan] then dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun [ah] at the most sepuluh tahun gitu then dorang come back to like get just get a degree dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis like an essay like how to write essay all that dorang dah lupa
ya so (um) that was one of the reasons why i wanted to like just continue cause i scared that i will like lose the the hang of it gitu
ya then i'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words apa
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy [ah]
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
berapa tahun [eh] berapa tahun
(mm)
[oh] satu [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
okay two years [ah]
so kalau you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
when
ya
lepas kahwin betul-betul nak kahwin dulu [eh]
[oh] is there a reason why you want to like kahwin first
don't stress
but what i can tell you is like
(um) in terms of stress [kan] lepas kahwin [eh] you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before i kahwin and then lepas tu like i felt very
(um) stressed out sebab like nak our our mum she [ah] she like makes all the decisions i have to respect her i've to respect the decision and ayah decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after i married i'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking gitu so i feel definitely less stressed you know like i i
sleep like whenever i want
and and things like that [lah] i do pretty much almost whatever i want now
tapi takde apa-apa [ah] because [ah] kalau orang tanya pun i will just say [oh] my husband he's okay with apa so in the end religiously (uh) culturally it's okay ya that that's what i think [ah] so
kau siapa [seh]
so my suami is super like easy going dia faham everything i'm very honest to him
kalau i'm going to this place ke apa i'm going to overnight there i'll tell him [lah] i'm going to overnight kat tempat ni with my friends we just wanna chill kalau nak ikut ikut [ah] like like that's what i'm like with him so and that's what i'm like with that's why he's like with me also so kalau dia nak keluar ke apa with his friends i'm also okay like i think must have that kind of understanding [lah] so i don't have the stress and pressure that i had when i was under my parents
so i think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya i think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your (um)
kahwin ya
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet [ah]
but for you
(mm)
(uh)
ya betul [lah]
ya and then if you are getting married at the non covid
period
ya it's super like expensive [kan] then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare [ah]
macam dorang punya gitu macam majlis dorang gitu
tu [ah]
then macam i feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
malangnya i think you want like my kind of wedding
kampung
ulam [seh] kampung kat mana ni kampung apa malaysia
[oh]
#pulau-ubin# dorang nak tutup apa
#semakau# pergi tekong tekong sudah pergi
kalau nak pergi kat malaysia kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana
[ah] tak rapat [ah] tapi ada [lah] ada tu ada [lah]
filter kau block yourself you block yourself you know
kau block sendiri but then the rental will be insane
[ah] betul [lah] (uh) then (mm) #pulau-ubin# is actually quite interesting for a wedding
ya it is it is or a park you know i mean if you want to go for something cheap
#tuas# #tuas#
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
like like are they chinese ke malay ke [oh]
takde motor takde kereta [ah] bagus kau
dia jemput [jer] semua orang tapi actually tak jemput semua orang indirectly [lah]
orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat west kat east east so dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang (uh) yang (uh) (um) (uh) kat #tuas# situ kat #johor# masuk masuk [ah] #johor# masuk tapi kalau kau orang (uh) #tampines# #pasir-ris# tak payah datang sudah waste your time
paynow (uh) (uh) [seh]
so dorang kat sana kat mana dorang the majlis kat mana
clubhouse
okay
[oh] okay but it such a weird place [lah] to like get a get married at (uh) at #tuas#
ya i mean if you're up for #pulau-tekong# [kan]
like i'm if you're if you're up for #pulau-tekong# you're up for pretty much anywhere [seh] but i think you don't want #sentosa# right #sentosa# is too touristy for me
is like you only go there kalau nak show off
[kan] like if you just want to show off cakap like you like you got a lot of money then okay [lah] #sentosa# [lah] but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore yang you can actually get
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money gitu
[oh] ya you just book the cruise [lah] you just get one cruise (uh) (uh)
then you get married in the on the water
(uh)
(uh) tapi ada timer [ah] dah reach dah reach harbourfront okay habis wedding habis
(uh) (uh) (uh) unless if unless if like you [ah] ambil the cruise ship yang pergi #batam# and back [ah] then okay got time tapi ada cruise yang sekarang they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back [lah] so kalau macam gitu susah sikit [ah]
and orang tak boleh datang like wherever they want they have to come bila bila cruise dia dah nak ship off gitu [ah]
[a'ah] ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil [lah] sampan kau bawa sampan kau kelakar [seh] nanti dorang dayung sampan
mesti makcik-makcik semua bising bila datang dorang cakap
!alamak! susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah
(uh) (uh) [seh]
i think at night [lah] we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like p_g you know then bila dah malam [kan] then we say [oh] (uh) all the makcik pergi tidur and stuff and then terus we got to the club and then terus
like like go all out [lah]
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
i mean like no alcohol and stuff
but i mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
(uh) mocktail [lah] mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine
(uh huh)
[oh] nice ya we should go there i wanna go there
[oh] okay okay okay
(mm)
ya i know
so you went with adik
okay so like what do you guys get
(uh) (uh)
brunch menu (mm)
buffet [jer] buffet [lah] buffet dia halal [lah]
(mm)
okay [lah] best [lah]
[oh] chilli crab pun ada
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then you barbecue yourself or what
[oh] k
[oh] k k ya [lah] like buffet [lah] then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
(mm) ya ya ya
[eh] but no barbe~ barbecue pineapple is nice
[oh]
[oh] because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly [lah] i don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
!aww! it tasted like meat ya
(mm)
right i think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like i i want to go on staycation but i don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones yang macam the one i went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go [ah] even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like (um)
even when it was (um)
during the covid but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors i didn't like
ya so i tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like [eh] is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so rabak so i didn't even k i didn't even like
take them afterwards after the first [one]
(uh) (uh) but okay [lah] it was fun [lah] it was for once you get to feel like macam orang kaya gitu (uh) tapi like ya that's it [lah] but i don't know [lah] like
kalau korang nak (um) pergi staycation ke tak
i know the kalau if the #d'kranji# here is
(um)
clean certified s_g clean certified then maybe kita boleh pergi sana
cause there is like very secluded [kan] so it's a different experience gitu like out of city life
(uh) tapi i you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
[ah] [seh] or you can go with us [lah] like me and (uh) me and #hafiz# so you as in
(uh) you and me will have this share the room and then he and abang #hafiz# will share [lah]
(uh) so kita halalkan [lah]
ya
i think they'll be fine wait is he like
[oh] so susah tu but no if they like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
i think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also [lah] then at least there's some a bit of
(uh) (uh) a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause kalau if it's two #hafizes# i mean both tak boleh [seh]
(uh) (uh) so i think macam okay [lah] like we we can do that but it depends [ah] like cause i really want to like staycation but the thing is i don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that i'm like
i'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away tu [ah]
(mm) january gitu okay
(mm)
ya [lah] but i mean okay [lah] we can we can always go tapi the thing is like you said [ah] must plan [lah] ya
(mm)
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay [lah] so it won't be any different
i want to go j_b like staycation in j_b will be nice
i mean ya if the covid situation weren't like that [lah] obviously
really [ah]
like
how how bad is it
it is
[oh] ya the one you told me yang dia
they had like the music
(err) show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
i mean dorang pun macam orang melayu [lah] you have to understand [lah] kita orang pun macam everything also macam relax apa
kita macam tak
tak ikut sangat [ah] but
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover [seh]
like even
if they they recover like if #johor# is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
ya so i feel like macam
macam gitu it will be really susah for them to
to get back up
ya
and indonesia pun teruk teruk [seh]
like indonesia is teruk
kalau tengok dia punya cases
if
[ah] betul
ya like i think like
indonesia is also like quite high death rate [kan] death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else gitu
so this is very scary [ah] like lagi dorang pun i don't think they care then they are so dense gitu the the country
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya ya ya like even for our~ ours like we have all the preventive measures [kan] (err) then (err) but for them dorang tak ada pun i mean kita bila we needed the extra space terus kita pergi tukar expo [lah] tukar all the places that we already have tapi tak pakai apa because covid [kan] so we use that place to (um) immediately make it a space for the covid nineteen patients
tapi kalau indonesia i think susah because [kan] singapore [kan] kita [kan] asyik #kiasu# [kan] kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau indonesia semua relax
dorang relax [jer] kita [kan] #kiasu# everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia i doubt that they are actually prepared because
like from what it looks they are not
(mm) (uh) dorang pun macam kalau mati mati [lah] dah sakit that's their thinking [ah] dah sakit apa sakit so kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi
so dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu [ah] dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh (uh) manage [kan] all these things [ah] so it's very hard for them [ah] like india also is very very very bad
ya india is like one of the worst i think
ya ya ya yang teruknya [kan] a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour [ah] saying that it's
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
(uh) (uh)
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it [lah]
[a'ah] but like i feel like it's somewhat true because dorang really tak kesah for the for the old people
[ah] then like dorang macam they will only like take in like patients yang have a chance of survival
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck [ah] [ah] cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like dulu punya america
ya during (um) last time when america was quite bad [kan] i mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so macam kesian [ah] but in india it's like that every day now
(mm)
ya
ya
ya i i feel like ya but i mean the government can do much more tapi they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya i mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang (uh) yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan like
don't mess [lah] don't mess with other fri~ don't go meet with other people all that tu [kan]
ya tapi orang-orang tua dorang [kan] (uh) tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal [lah] [kan] kita orang dah cakap pakai mask and jangan (uh) jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang [kan] kalau nak keluar keluar [lah] apa nak jadi
(uh) (uh)
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so macam (um) there was this atuk not atuk #ah-pek# in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like [oh] no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
like we will just like !huh! like what what are we supposed to do you know [ah] but like kita tak boleh buat apa-apa cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so i'm like okay
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad [ah]
ya
ya i was in the bus and i was sitting opposite him
ya ya
[ah] luck luckily like (mm) i alighted much like (err) quite fast [lah] so so i i like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that i stay at got a lot of old people like that
orang tak suka pakai mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
#ah-pek# together kadang-kadang more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk macam biasa [lah] macam tak ada covid gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang just biarkan [jer] [ah]
(uh)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(uh)
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit (uh)
(uh)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(uh)
correct the security guard i think trying to find something to do [lah] dia dah dia dah like bored [lah] i think
okay
(uh)
(uh) and just be aunties [lah]
ya ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh) [seh]
(uh) (uh)
ya
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there dorang tak tengok pun [tau] kalau kalau kau scan ke kau tak scan ke dorang just masuk dia kasi masuk [jer] dorang tak kesah [kan] ya so it's like it's so like (uh) jarring you know sometimes ya but i feel like at least okay [lah] singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not [ah] i think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense poulate~ so densely populated like island ya like
(um) but because everyone has to wear mask so tak tak boleh buat apa-apa so it's that's why tak ada macam transmission not so much of transmission [ah] ya
(mm)
[ah] ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like [oh] my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to [ah] ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take grab or something like that [kan] so (err) it's it's like already in our we already know you know like (um) the social way to like macam social responsibility [lah] ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause dah berapa lama [seh] dah berapa bulan going to one year i feel
ya december twenty nineteen
(mm)
that's why then i'm like also like
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what i thought it was going to be luckily because we're here sebab [kan] kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain is like !wow! betul-betul rabak like but kat singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker punya time that time bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus [seh] ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) how how their conditions were right
[oh] my god ya true
ya and i think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff i mean like at least now people are washing their hands
with soap like dulu [kan] siapa nak cuci tangan dengan soap i ask you like tak ada [seh] all the aunty [ah] wash hand only wash water can already [lah] dorang memang mesti tak pakai soap punya mana ada pakai soap [seh]
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
now now they don't now they're like [ah] ya kalau tak wash nanti [eh] you never wash you never like use the soap [ah] then lepas tu baru dorang
you you really pakai the soap ya
(mm)
good things comes of it (uh) come out from it [lah] ya ya ya betul [lah] like i think it's (um) inevitable [lah] like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
like i realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
so the toilets are generally cleaner [ah] so like okay [ah] it's not bad [ah] (um) mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown [kan] and know france [kan] dah second lockdown
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for i think
ya just that we can't like travel
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya i know right i mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb [jer] [ah] cause no choice [kan] ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya rather than macam kat sweden where it's like free and easy and then !wow! the death rates are like crazy [seh]
ya so i think that there is that needs to be some
order [ah] law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
i heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then (err) some people made a a like sarcastic kind of (err) remark it's like (err) go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this [one] they say go to hospital because they found out like
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad kat japan [lah] so dorang kena mula balik [ah] everything [lah] have to go back the mask and all that (err) i mean for mask i think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff [lah] ya i think everywhere is still quite bad [eh] but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden [kan] kesian [seh]
tapi for me i kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat seoul garden sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu [ah] tu [ah] macam kesian [seh] [ah] nasib baik dia pergi doctor
[ah] naisb baik dia pergi doctor then lepas tu you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya [ah] tu [ah] so
i mean i think kesian [ah] macam he got more hate than
what he should have gotten gitu ya
no dorang three tables (uh)
so there were still like macam #bergroup# tapi (err) it was distance distance three distance tables but i think they got mix around [lah] macam kadang-kadang dorang mix like you sit here i sit there ke apa mix food (err) so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the (um) the fear that they have [lah]
ya so kesian [ah]
(uh)
(uh)
that time [ah]
ya ya
and dia dia sakit [kan] dia pergi doctor then bila dah kena covid and the check up [oh] at least i was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed [lah] the rules and stuff kat sini seoul garden [ah] if me i think i wouldn't say so much [seh] i diam diam [jer] tak [lah] but like i feel like macam why get myself into more trouble than than what i have already [kan] ya so i feel like (um) he's actually good part [ah] for him to be really responsible also
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese p_m he's he actually recommended (err) people to wear mask even when we're eating i don't know when we're eating or drinking then i'm like i saw the headline then i was like apa [seh]
like what the hell does that even mean gitu (uh) (uh) so i i was like !wow! this prime minister really wants to like (err) reduce the number of covid but i have no idea how he plans to do that
(uh) (uh) i think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you makan then i'm like but it's so like
inconvenient and i don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that i go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like (err) you you don't you can't transmit anything [lah] so i think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time i don't know how that's going to work [seh]
that's why i don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more [leh] then i'm like [oh] my goodness
(uh)
this kind of like way to combat right (uh) (uh) it's like i read it i cannot forget [seh] then i keep telling people then people like
how then i'm like i don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national t_v so (err) ya macam gitu like i don't even i i i don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it [ah] bagus [ah] dorang habis [ah] [a'ah] tu [ah] like macam it's
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous
ya ya ya he's just like [ah] give up [lah] dah mengaku kalah
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to macam (err) cheer up the community gitu (um) it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time [lah]
so mak

okay
(mm)
okay
but you can cook [what]
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
(uh) good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
(mm)
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
makan hotdog pun dah marah
in school setiap kali i bring back food then you marah
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm) okay
okay
can so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
my three wishes
i think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
i want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that i see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to trav~ they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that i can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
itu sahaja i'm not gonna i'm not gonna explain or elaborate on my three wishes
it's okay i'll ask the second question
(um)
(err)
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
(mm)
okay
i think for me
will be the first time i had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
dekat cafe #bedok# cafe dekat #bedok#
ya that's the first time i had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good i liked it
so that's ever since then i started to like eating duck because that was the first time i had duck
ya
(mm)
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
(mm)
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
(uh huh) paddy field
swan
no not swa~ flamingo
flamingo
crane [eh]
crane
and
and did you like it
(mmhmm)
(uh) that means kau suka [lah] kau akan cuba sahaja [kan] makanan
don't have courage to try new things
sebab itu kita selalu bila pergi india pergi tempat sama sahaja [eh] tak pergi keluar pergi mana-mana
if i give you arnab
okay
okay
so next time kalau kita balik india we won't go back to our hometown
go somewhere else
you say [one] [ah]
don't take back on your promise [ah]
okay
okay then i ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or t_v show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
[oh]
okay
(uh huh)
okay do you have any
(mm)
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
fross~
okay
disney pixar [lah]
then you did did you watch incredibles two
(mm)
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be foo~ bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
(mm) entah aku pun tak tahu i think twenty twenty three maybe
or maybe mungkin tahun depan
ya or maybe tahun depan [lah] aku pun tak tahu
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
then the storyline
or kau tak ingat
(mm) okay
(mm)
that's that's something new i learn about you you liking to watch twilight
(mmhmm) okay
then
kau ada tengok ke
kau ada tengok ke aku tak pernah nampak engkau tengok pun
which superhero movies have you watched
[oh] yang hari itu aku bawa kau tengok [kan]
okay
so between the three s~ do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
but dia tua [kan] kau suka
(mm) okay
(mm)
then
so if you were to
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
so i'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so i want to do consultancy
but i need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so i need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
yang dekat
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for pri~ (err) indivi~ sing~ (err) single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal [lah] his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
and yang help them
plan out their
master (err) their blueprint
the other option i'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or p_h_d
because i like educating
i like teaching so
if i do masters i can come back as profe~ professor in n_t_u so that's my other option i'm considering also which is why monday is main
no [lah] professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their re~ research [what] like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what i'm doing which is why on monday i'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to n_t_u each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so i just wanna meet him and talk to him about it [lah] and
tengok kalau dia ada apa-apa nak nasihat nak bagi ke atau apa-apa then
ya then i'll decide then i also need to ask him about exchange about internship opportunities itu semua aku nak tanya nak settle
ya
ya hari isnin nak pergi then
probably jumaat balik
ya but (err) isnin isnin i meet my mentor then hari selasa aku ada event
in school
then wednesday
wednesday aku ada apa-apa tak
[ah] aku tak tahu but probably i come back either on thursday or friday
cause i have events on tuesdays wed~ and wednesdays also so i either thursday or friday i'll come back
ya i enjoy a lot which is
a blessing [lah] because many of my friends
they
macam dia orang complain [lah] dia orang tak suka
tak suka apa yang dia orang buat then which makes it very difficult
not just my a level friends but also my friends from e~ actually i mean it's mainly my a level friends because
the poly friends who come they alre~ most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my frien~ a level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
man~ many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different [what]
for poly they already have a diploma in dip~ their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
a level mana ada civil
you mean from my j_c
no tak ada as in i on~
i only know one other person who's in n_t_u
was from my j_c also but the rest are all from different en~ (err) j_cs
ya i mean i think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in n_u_s
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like c_s and b_s
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why i think
it's a fifty fifty thing [lah] ada orang suka ada orang tak suka
then yang tak suka itu dia orang struggle
then yang suka they they will thrive [lah] so fortunately for me i
i like what i'm doing
(mm)
n_t_u i enjoy the courses i'm doing
mostly some courses i don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like i feel like which is why i'm considering pursuing higher education if i don't like it i won't pursue higher education [what]
ya
i'll probably still stay in n_t_u
ya
probably still st~
ya they have p_h_d and masters
but as in i think
ya they talk they cakap apa itu they all said something about how n_t_u they send their students overseas for like a short period of time to study overseas and all that itu semua [lah] aku pun tak tahu that's why like i said monday i'm gonna go and talk to my profs to find out more information
also
and it's important to start early [lah] because
maybe there's something i can do now to help to accelerate the process also [mah]
then cepat-cepat datang then i dapat my
degree cepat-cepat habis my masters or p_h_d
ya
i don't know so
but honestly ya
ya betul [lah] i i really like teaching
[eh] teaching ya
what
i don't know
full time teaching
!huh! go n_i_e
after i graduate go n_i_e
go n_i_e belajar beberapa tahun then
aku ajar dekat primary school
okay boleh [eh] okay
ya that's why i say as in a good com~ like a balance of me still doing
re~ something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing p_h_d [lah] and becoming a prof and do both
where i get to teach and still practice what i learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after i finish studying
then what about you
(mmhmm)
kau selalu duduk rumah sahaja
okay
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then aku
tanya [eh]
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
percuma
anything [lah] ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
okay
okay
okay
(mm) actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
yang macam kau cakap demam ke
or the selesema
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
like macam demam ke selesema itu semua
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then
lagi apa
so
if
kalau [kan] boleh master three new skills what would they be
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay

ya but you will eat that for the rest of your life
bread
(uh huh)
(mm) ya
okay so what would it be
just chicken meat macam gitu
breakfast dinner lunch
everyday
that's more than one dish you can only choose one dish
(mm)
me

i think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme

i think because
i don't know [lah] (mm) (mm) is to cater to people

to make their menu more interesting
ya

(uh huh)
[oh] pernah dengar i've heard of it before is it is electricity powered right
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can (uh) i think you just bring to the room and
ya
ya i i i've seen it before someone cook like macam beef rose
or stew
berapa itu
ya no [lah] it's okay
i mean
because next year i only be staying in hall for half a semester more [what]
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back [what]
i still have my hall room
probably ya i already say [what] monday i'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also i still have events and all that stuff so i don't know
kena tengok
right schedule
so ya
largely now i'm just looking forward to exchange
ya i actually i can either go in august or i can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
i'm
i don't know if i go in january
six months [what] it's just one semester six months
[oh] [eh] not six months [lah] three months of school
so
january to april but which is kalau aku pergi dekat january on in january right then i finish school in april i can extend my stay there [what]
no school (uh) just come back (uh) three months later
ya
yes and then kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan [kan]
she's working in u_k [what]
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
(mm) so i think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies [lah]
so ya she already graduated [what] she she no no n_s and then
ya different dia tak ada n_s then three years her course was just three years
ya
so she's working in the u_k now
then u_k is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working [lah] and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
dia punya bapak beli untuk dia
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that [lah] to make money
ya
so dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana
ya u_k [kan] just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry i think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
i hope the covid situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland [ah]
going for exchange
other options are u_s
ya can go u_s canada but i don't know if canada have
modules that i can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
india pun ada north india
tak nak malas because very expensive [what]
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five i think five thousand
i think so
and it's more dangerous also i think
u_s
then i u_s also i'm not interested i'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature [what]
it's more it's less
(uh) that one aku dah check semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries [what]
and u_k then bawah itu ada spain i think semua
ya but i don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
(uh) but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
(uh huh)
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand i have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then i'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you [eh] school fees right
why
or i can just go local exchange
ya
so pergi n_u_s or i or i pergi s_m_u
no i don't want go u_s [ah]
u_s ada orang kita tahu ke do we know anyone in the u_s
we don't have relatives there
siapa
i don't know i think it's something related to
i_t related
ya okay
okay
(mm) okay
right so i think that's it we can
end the recording in three two one
!hey! [lah] how are you man dah lama tak jumpa
really really long time semenjak aku last jumpa you right so how long do you think kita dah lama tak jumpa
no i think kita tak jumpa for quite some time i
it's way before covid so covid started last year right (err) last year when do you remember bila dia start
covid bulan sebelas covid bulan
okay covid november ya so i i definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so dah lama gila
right
early last year you know what what i can remember from my memory aku rasa is that
aku baru balik daripada my overseas job i came back then after that i saw you with your wife then after that kita dah tak jumpa lagi for a very long time then suddenly the next news that i got from you is that
(err) my mum bilang aku yang nurul is pregnant was pregnant and then after that [eh]
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and asal kau tak jumpa dia
yup
how old is your daughter now
[oh] my god you see
you see
it's [ah] it's he's a it's
he's turning two this coming december so that is how long that i've not seen you
and the the irony is that you only live like two blocks away from me
and we used to be very very good friends semenjak kita orang kecil lagi
[lah] you know what i was actually like in my mind right i was thinking when was the last time kita orang jumpa i mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet abeh kau nak berbual english pun dah susah [kan]
just after kindergarten okay no no no no no no no no no because if you remember correctly right for the longest time
(err) from my memory is that we went for apa [tau] performance ya you know that that was like some bengkel kanak-kanak or some do you know remember aksi mat yoyo when we used to be there was remember that show aksi mat yoyo it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
(err) we met up at mak long punya okay so mak long aminah suriga is the like the producer for those kinds of (err) shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes pasal dia it's a woman ya i don't know whether she's still alive i hope that she is you know
(mm) mak long
yes we just performed our buttocks off ya and you remembered in her house there was like there's there's like
a mini stage where she you know it was in like her i don't think that is her living room her house her flat was quite big
then kita orang and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so aku i remembered that [ah] kita start performing and then after that we became friends
because our our parents are friends not parents our our mums are kawan baik
aku pun tak tahu how they became friends [eh] yes because okay you know what let's let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and and we we start from where we first from where i first remember
when i met you dulu
rumah mak long correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows dekat (err) bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam performance and then i remembered doing shows kat situ with my sister dengan your sister dengan you together so it's #sriwana# yes yes you see now it's all coming back
ya lots of memories there but very (err) blur
vague
clou~ cloudy ya ya you can use the word cloudy because it's (err)
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes i think kita orang were quite active in performance because i remember (um) quite vividly there was this particular show kita orang semua nak kena remember that that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a kebun is it kebun in malay
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
engkau ada topeng [lah] but i do not have a topeng so what i need to do was with my face bare out in the open i need to because lembu [kan] ada horns right so i need to be a lembu with horns so what i did was during the song of (um) old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing dia orang punya topeng
i had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend i'm a cow that was really traumatising for me [lah]
yes ya
ya but at the same time i was very you know as a as a kid right the the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
kita happy go lucky just go with the flow mak cakap apa kita buat then after that jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi jadi lembu then just joget
in front of people
you were a duck i remembered kau itik kau itik because they had if you remember there was this disney nya itik
and then after that the dis~
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya ya ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be (err) not confirm just to be sure [lah] [kan] kita orang ni iya [lah] [kan]
so
(err) i remember that you were donald duck and kau joget macam biasa [lah] you were happy confidently you know yes
ya ya you were you were it
(err) you were itik okay so
i remembered that then the next memory that i had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that that memory don't okay [lah] the word is forget ladies and gentlemen (um)
lupa [ah] so (err) the next memory is bila aku dengan kau we were in your dad's car
baru balik daripada some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right kat luar some c_c [lah] community centre dulu dia orang cakap apa r_c [ah]
ya ya ya p_p_i_s we all p_p_i_s so it was it was actually quite (err) at that point of time i did remember that kita orang we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then i i i remembered that (err) we were doing good stuff [lah] which we did not know was good at that time
ya (err) aku pun ingat yang that that we get to perform then after that balik so getting back to the memory yang in your dad's car aku ingat bapa kau because your your your bapa was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam
manufacturing
okay cool cool but i remember kereta tu kecil then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right right so every time kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke and so we were at the back dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like [oh] so we made so much noise that the the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
right no no no continue no no no ya
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now kita dah tua ni [kan] it was very it was because it happened by (mm) ya so i'm not sure okay so your
this was another traumatising part (err) on my end
pasal your bapa suddenly pusing belakang then cakap can you guys stop it or not
so i was (err) you know i got quite scared of your dad daripada hari tu aku macam [eh] hi uncle
ya until now ya i respect him you know not because of that only because he he's your dad he's a old man all these [lah] and he's he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes aku rasa
i guess so ya i guess so
maybe dia bingit ya i mean we kita orang deserved it seratus percent we deserved it
[oh] ya [ah] we were kids we were
just stop [lah] like !whoa!
ya but you know
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know (err) i'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that nak bilang kau [jer] that was a memory [ah] ya your turn
right
(hmm) [oh] my god
i remember those moments of education yang aku tak
forced that's the word
really [oh] that was so sweet of you aku feel so (err) yes
yes aku terharu orang cakap so
really pasal aku kawan baik kau ke apa
you know what i felt the same way about you
engkau bukan seorang ya
[oh] i remember i know where you're going with this i aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda
and
ya i i i i that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well pasal aku ingat at that point of time [kan] you had a bike you had a bicycle you had a bicycle and that bicycle ada tank warna kuning it's a g_t bicycle with a yellow colour tank then lepas tu ada seat kat belakang
untuk kau duduk then after that that bicycle kecil [tau] tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang each other it's a chopper
what
[oh] my god i remembered
right
right (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
we ya
i remembered
i i i i try to describe it [ah] so so we burn the the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are tengah hisap rokok [ah]
then we were doing [oh] and you know ya that was
we were very very happy
right
[oh] ya
ya it it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any macam dustbin tak [kan]
but
it [oh] ya yup yup near our house [ah] ya the one opposite our house kat rumah bawah block #farhan# if you remember correctly
yes i remember that part also and another thing which i also remember was that (err)
brother john
salah brother love
no
love
brother brother love
john j a b c d e f g h aku pun tak tahu
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] same [ah]
ya i aku understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then kita lupa nama dia and then after that nama dia apa then we will go through all alpha~ alphabetically just to try and [eh] he looks like a john you know [oh] ya ya he is a john so we i i go through that thing also i believe apa [tau] [lah] like they did (err) they did a study about this dia orang cakap apa [tau] siapa yang dulu (um) buat show dengan mak long gitu
(mm) siapa siapa the kids that buat show dengan p_p_i_s #sriwana# so they have that it's in it
i think we should say thanks to her ya if (err) if you know like if i get to see her [eh] mak long hi remember me she probably wouldn't pasal ya
ya you can say that i have a janggut it's okay because i i saw you staring at my janggut and aku realise yang kau tengok dengan macam
right
okay
you
i mean you are very positive
ya ya i mean like to continue the whole janggut thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do kalau if you don't mind janggut ni sebenarnya apa [tau] if for me [kan] aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas
aku malas (mm)
ya because i realise bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk
kau tak keluar janggut kau jadi gemuk
ya but gemuk is okay because you know (err) i i don't mind but
what
right right right right right i i feel that i feel that you are trying not to raise up that that that whole thing about you know fat people are lazy or whatever ya i (err)
yes (err) i mean my mum is quite
fat and i love her and my dad loves her very much you know (err) ya she's been quite fat for
quite some time
(mmhmm) okay (err) i remembered when we we went to primary school together right we went to #xishan# primary school together which is in #yishun#
like i am one year younger than you if kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka [jer] nampak macam ten years older from you and of course aku punya attitude is very mature
bye
right
(err) yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other kita akan jumpa each other bila (err) macam nak balik sekolah so kau kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan thing sometimes
you know that kind of thing so
[oh] no
okay okay i i try to i try to from my memory [lah] because i'm one year younger than you so i probably have a bit more okay so (err) what happened was (err) after primary school [kan] pergi secondary school tapi aku went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from #yishun# you see i went to saint andrew's school (err) which is located dekat #potong-pasir# so jauh [ah] saint andrew's kat #potong-pasir# so saint andrew's dekat #potong-pasir# (err) aku had to do my early journey blah blah blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school [kan] mula pukul tujuh setengah
i have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty pagi then after that make my way to school by taking the m_r_t or the bus so i start my journey probably around pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah then after that
ya
normal timing correct so during that point of time we jarang jumpa each other because i was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
dekat dengan kau punya rumah so which is northland secondary school
see how lucky you are and you are living in (err) your your place right is located whereby it's
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the the view is wonderful from your house because (err) there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking kau punya pemandangan [kan]
warning sign [ah]
that what you must be like terkencing dalam seluar [eh]
confirm kena rotan with your mom confirm kena rotan with your mom i remembered because your mom is (err) your mom is very strict (err) woman from bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam quite (err) (err) how to say how should i put it [eh] verbal
ya she's she's fine with me i i i i actually you know what i i love her until now because sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih best friends you know i mean i mean not as close [lah] because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes i mean you tend to fade away and then after that datang balik fade away datang balik but i i appreciate the
the connection still
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my mak aku punya birthday ya and guess how old my mak aku is
mak aku is sixty six years old [lah] o_m_g o_m_g that is (err) there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
so yup
and
your father because i think we did have this conversation
(err) at one point of time
like you know what i remembered that we actually bumped into each other for for bulan puasa punya time
bulan puasa punya time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque i think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's it's nothing like this
yes either that or kita pergi sembahyang jumaat
yes so we did [lah] but not not not for a very long time [lah] sekejap aje kita lepak then after that (err) i bumped into your dad
(err) he went to the friday prayers yes so i bumped into him and i said [eh] uncle (err) how are you because your dad always speaks in english then mak kau berbual melayu so you have that that that both thing right so then after that
[oh] ya ya ya my dad also [lah] my dad also speaks english
[ah] then after that (um) ya so (um) your dad aku jumpa dia then after that (err) you did ask me this question before [eh] bapa aku umur seventy almost almost eighty years old kau cakap gitu dengan aku then aku ingat macam [eh]
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda [tau]
like around my dad's age [ah]
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad [lah] my dad will exercise tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke he should be at home or dia keluar rumah
as in to to do his exercises right
amazing macam bapa aku juga my my dad will wake up like early
and he will do the the simple exercises with the stretches no i i did introduce him to yoga but i i don't think he's interested in that
but tapi you know looking at him stretching aku rasa he is still you know quite active in that sense pasal sekarang
(err) during on his birthday right two years ago i think aku belikan dia basikal for his birthday present then sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar as often
ya he starts to like cycle so
like i'm actually happy for him you know because
ya rather than to just stay home watch t_v blah blah blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now [kan] dia orang dia orang kasih (err) facilities for the old people untuk dia orang workout
correct ya yes correct correct so (err) what happened was speaking about this right my my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to masuk class [ah] join a class yang singapore punya funding
i forgot what is it called s_g future or something like that skillsfuture ya so dia orang ada this skillsfuture punya thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some (err) security course so ya so
i guess i mean
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards bila kau nampak kat condo then after that [eh] uncle how are you
okay [lah] same same [lah] like yesterday also takde ubah sama aje like that [lah]
ya so (um) (um) he will be one of those and hopefully he be going strong you know like for a few more years [lah]
ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him
what do you mean
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking pasal kita orang punya growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road [lah] sekarang
asal
ya
yes yes that's a good segway actually because (um) i mean it it still sticks with me i mean like most people i guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially pasal aku realise engkau sampai sekarang masih macam (err) doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still buat kau punya music semua
ya
(hmm) okay (err) is it it's due to the whole covid punya situation sekarang [kan]
[oh] you do (err) facebook punya session like live punya session is it [oh] that's cool you know what i found out that (err) one of our friend's apa ni boy #cazly# because i did meet up (err) met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time [lah] so sekarang dia
when we hang out that time dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show i
believe it or not i do not have a facebook punya account i am not a
not say active [lah] like i am not interested in the whole thing i i i don't know maybe because i'm like you know i like it's weird because okay
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or i mean like current situation information daripada you know the social media but untuk aku i
i don't get my information from there i go to the news i direct news b_b_c and all this
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time macam
the reason why i do that is just tak banyak sangat information coming in from left to right too many points too many (um) you know opinions from the social media dia punya community
so i don't and as as you know i'm quite introvert also
am i ya i think so ya i'm quite introvert ya so ya because ya i i rather you know
i rather be alone
and i'm not lonely !wow!
tak i don't know kalau does that make sense to kalau aku cakap i i like to be alone and i'm not lonely (hmm) do i have an imaginary kawan
no no no
ya i mean but
why
okay so like basically just to be updated dengan dia orang [ah]
so what you're telling me that you have like (err) you have you are talking about facebook right okay so dalam kau punya facebook tu you post like funny funny things
right
but
ya i ya you know what i definitely one hundred percent
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you pasal engkau i i i realise i mean knowing you as a friend for for a very long time you are very positive (err) person seseorang yang positive [lah] senang cakap
you know and you are always smiling you always happy and i don't understand that about you sometimes
because how can this guy selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada [jer] macam funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer i will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang whatever [oh] so then you know that that's just me but for you right i realise as a person and i really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya pasal sekarang ni
you know there are a lot of (um) negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube i do go to youtube though tengok comment comments kadang-kadang video video guitar [lah] music whatever so there i will i like to read the comments because they are just
stupid and evil
at times
ya ya ya this is relative to dalam bidang kugiran music selamat hari raya kepada all the people in singapore
malaysians really why be careful [ah] [oh] what are you trying to say [lah] can you please be more (hmm)
(hmm) i'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful kepada diri engkau
actually aku pun aku pun suka orang malaysia [lah] but depends orang i mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person macam mana kau treat orang tapi orang malaysia pasal aku ada banyak sedara my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes
my mother is from #penang# my mum is from my grandmother is originally from thailand so what happened was that (err) dia orang fell in love then after that my grandmother and my grandfather (err) ran away dia orang lari kahwin lari
kahwin lari so daripada #penang# tu aku punya datuk macam this is a true story ya this is a true story so (err) what happened was my they fell in love i don't know how maybe under a tree then after that (err) datuk arwah datuk aku

under a tree bawah pokok then after that balik lari pergi ke #penang# for them to get married
so they got married they set up a house he became a policeman blah blah blah then after that he had i think like nine children
you know because at that point of time during the olden days they liked to have so many children i don't know why you know there was no control so my mum was apparently i think she's like number five or something ya
she's like the one of the middle child
okay
rewind
wait let me get it straight nenek kau punya kakak which is your
grand aunty [ah] yes
!wow! that is banyak anak untuk tujuh belas is a lot of kids [lah] tujuh belas is that's like a that's a factory plus reserves ya plus reserves !wow! what a woman !wow! so this is your grand aunty right
ya you know what to be honest with you i i'm not really that surprised [lah] because during that time my mom
memang banyak [ah] they have like you know like banyak
but seventeen is quite a number [lah]
ya i think i will go with that [what]
ya so seventeen is quite a number aku rasa
that's a lot
of numbers so (err) back to my my my grandparents then after that they got married then (err) they stayed in #penang# dia orang duduk kat #penang# then after that my at one point of time my grandfather like went to singapore and he got a job here in singapore where he became a policeman also something like that i'm not sure aku lupa
then after that (err) duduk dekat (err) barrack police (err) together with my father's father which is my paternal grandfather [ah] so they became best friends they became best friends then after that my (err) my mak aku dengan bapak aku
were matchmake

kahwin kahwin kahwin kahwin yes kuih kahwin kahwin try [lah] kuih saya kuih kahwin kahwin married married okay (um) so so so they they they were matchmake then dia orang kahwin (err) then after that a few years later dapat kakak aku
kakak aku is currently dekat hong-kong sekarang as you know then he she has her own family kat sana they're happy over there they plan to come back actually for december [lah] ya they actually bought the tickets and everything then lepas tu (err) because of the whole current covid situation dia orang terpaksa cancel dia orang punya flight [lah]
ya so (err) the whole family is quite sad (err) my parents especially because you know they don't get to see (err) my sister then especially the grand (err) son
his name is a tricky one [lah] (err) pasal dia pasal bapak dia is a french dude then my sister is malay right so (um)
nama dia is #luq# l u q and then after that ada l u q #luq# #luq# #luq#
l u k e ya ya ya that's the american luke right

and then
kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman ya so (err)
my
(err) nephew's name is (err) #luq-lucien#
#luq-lucien# so that #lucien# tu is very particular pasal orang french kau nak kena pronounce dia orang punya language in you know because they they they love their language so much it's and i agree that it's very sexy language aku memang suka bila orang french berbual
you know pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy (hmm) so i like how they they pronounce (err) stuff and the way they talk especially bila dia orang dah start berbual french abeh nak start berbual english lagi sexy [lah] but let's not get too deep on the on the sexy part nak kena
let's go back to the unsexy part
[oh] this so unsexy [lah]
okay music part [oh] so okay sorry you're you're you're done with me [ah] with my family alright i guess aku rasa aku punya family tak interested tak interesting aku rasa okay [ah] berbual pasal music [ah] no [lah] nah i'm just i'm just kidding that's why that's why i love you [lah] because you [ah] what~ whatever mean things that i think is quite mean and then when i say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and i really appreciate that some people kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini you know that kind of thing [ah]
terbawa-bawa terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah then after that they will scream in the pillow
o_m_g those must be the youtube commenters [oh] my god
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that i'm listening to macam apa yang kau berbual tadi
yes the the the punk (err) phase of our life
how did i get into the current music that i'm listening to well okay how did i get
roughly (um) you know (um) (err) as you know i'm working from home right now right so aku ada banyak time kat rumah then i could been listening to no at first i bought a i bought a guitar i don't know guitar apa nak beli you know this is this is a typical (um) you know typical if if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a guit~ buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just pasal aku ada banyak time and i just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes
yes [lah] as you know aku dulu main drum asal it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why i why do i feel that i'm interrogated [oh] ya you do
right
yang penting kau terror !wow! that should be that should be your next (err) malay album punya yang penting kau terror
dengar [lah] kita orang punya record baru which is called yang penting kau terror
ya dan sekarang aku main guitar and i have to say that i actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it it takes a lot of dedication nak kena invest kau punya time main guitar and you and i i have to say i start i started quite late [lah] i started quite late then after
i when when i get to know you again during the secondary school punya time at the point of [kan] kau dah start main guitar you know and all this kau dah start main cranberries kau dah ya you you were playing like bar and not not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and aku pula when i was in saint andrew's school [kan] aku belajar drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then bila kita masuk band together we had a few of our friends then kita masuk a few competitions which i mean not to brag but we got you know
yang penting kita terror yes just like your the name of your future album
yes correct so
talking about drums right you were talking about drums is it
guitar right [oh] sorry
(mm) that's that phase of my life
ya yes pasal okay (err) the reason why i got myself into the whole e_d_m which is electronic dance music pasal
at that point of time kita orang punya band dah tak ada lagi then after that kita orang decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know you know leading their own lives gedebak gedebuk so i got lonely as i usually would and i started listening to (um) dance music
some techno punya stuff some (err) defected (err) record stuff which is quite cheesy [lah] to be honest with you like (err) they they call it tech house tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor punya beats macam that kind of music so (mm)
so aku dengar (um) techno aku dengar tech house then there were few other house punya genres [ah] so they they had (err) like like like different
genres like sub genres [ah] within that that genres so i listen to specifically macam tech house deep house that kind of thing so (err) it got quite deep and then after that i started listening vinyl so i saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
(err) i had a i had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started d_jing then after that kita orang dapat a few gigs kat #sentosa# dapat main kat club gedebak gedebuk we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music i mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
in my in my perspective at that point of time i was like doing it
(err) because because right
the music is still strong i loved the music actually i love the whole production aspect kalau nak buat music tu i prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a d_j and to mix like
a d_j a disc jockey dia orang punya kerja ni is to mix (err) satu lagu dengan satu lagu
so dia tak ada stop [ah]
right correct
yes for so for example macam ada satu lagu if he's playing in turntable a right so that lagu belongs to an artist correct so from my (err) end of it i would like to produce my own track i i would love to have my music in the in the playlist
in a playlist you know because the whole thing about
(um) e_d_m or house music or that point of time it's just to get the the whole flow the whole energetic flow of dancing you know of having fun in the dance floor
macam gitu
(err) i would
lagu original it's prefer~ preferable [lah] you know you know that's the reason why like kalau nak have a band to play (err) like cover song i mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have (err) you you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so aku rasa that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya chord belajar dia orang punya style of music
correct (err) back then yes (err) but
in that kind of genre [lah] in that kind of context (mm) ya i mean the whole e_d_m thing for me aku rasa tak
although i did that for quite some time you know i think i did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya i was ya i was playing in like (um) in #sentosa# which is an outdoor punya outdoor like
(mm) rest~ not restaurant like a disco
disco discotheque mak mak cakap discotheque kau pergi discotheque tak [ah] pergi discotheque [ah] mak
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so i went to i i was the resident there for every sunday and then lepas tu aku manage to do my own company so i hooked up with (err) a friend of mine then after (um) together he was from america then we kita orang joined forces
(um) to create to have a company so we we brought a a brand which is from u_k the brand is called (err)
[oh] my god how can i forget this
(err) aku rasa aku wait wait sabar sabar aku lupa aku lupa aku lupa that was quite some time ago (err) so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then kita launched kita orang punya own party [ah] so then we had we fly in the we flew in their d_js to play gedebak gedebuk then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though i mean it's not music though that i created i created art not say i created i mean we we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment (err) value to singapore which which is at the highest standard (err) at that point of time then kita orang
buat duit apart from that you know we (err) charged people at the door kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat bar
so we managed to make (err) money then after that it went on for for quite some time then after that things got sour i don't want to go into too much detail dalam tu then ya [lah]
(err) now i'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing aku punya guitar
ya i've been listening to what got me interested with there's a lot of guitar driven bands
out there in the youtube world sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam youtube you know
even from back then [ah] radiohead [lah] you know you have your death tones you have your whatever band which is you know cool at that point of time so that has always been (err) you know i like that but i can't do that
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik
ya
be a good children
then
lagi apa [eh]
untuk (err) buka business yang
kita
that we work fishing prawn very very long time
(mm) ya
(uh) ya
i we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
s_i_t
(uh) then we find it
(err)
s_i_t dia punya
sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa canteen itu murah [lah]
s_u
ya
s_u_s_s
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
tak boleh jual macam ayam goreng
(uh)
ikan goreng yang goreng-goreng itu tak boleh
kita kena kurangkan minyak
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
ya [lah] tapi masalah dia
we cannot
hi~ no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so i i have to find the locals [lah] to work there
ya so
(err) yang
orang yang nak
bagi kita itu
(uh) dia ca~ dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak
tapi kalau saya ambil alih
if i take over
i need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing i need to
learn
macam mana nak masak
ya
ya boleh masak [lah] tapi
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall
(um)
mostly is malay food like #mee soto# #mee-rebus#
#nasi-lemak#
and those kind of things [lah] macam nasi putih nasi
lauk-lauk
so
(err) jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu [lah] baru saya boleh buka
(mm)
sebab because at schools they have (err)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
so kita kena jual benda yang sama
ya
so (uh)
orang yang nak jual itu
canteen they they cakap they ada
business lain so dia
dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ [lah] because
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other other business
then
belongs to them [lah]
ya
so tapi
tapi
sekarang now we are
searching for the suitable space [lah] first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
(err) good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
i would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mak~ (mm)
because
i
saya tahu [lah] apa itu kalau tak ada
tak ada kesihatan itu
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
duit itu kita boleh cari tapi kalau kesihatan tak ada
macam mana
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
ya (mm) maksud saya yang my first wish yang anak-anak jadi baik itu
bukan baik i mean it's baik overall [lah] it's good
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so kalau
awak ada apa-apa awak boleh cakap dengan saya kalau saya boleh tolong
mana tahu
ya so it's best either you share everything [lah]
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
[ah]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so what i i can ask you
i ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
meal
meal
[oh]
meal
(mm) my memorable meal
well
actually i cannot recall there were many
i think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that i had
no because i think it's a cycle we are repeating
you know we are keep having this (um) same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind i think
(err) tak ada [lah] tak ingat
(mmhmm)
smoked duck
dekat mana
(uh)
was it good
(mm) but i'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that i didn't
(err)
i didn't had before like
i will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish
and then i'm not a
person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat i mentioned before
ya (err) but if it's like fruits and vegetables i'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all i'm fine with that
ya but
with these variations i i i'm a bit like macam old fashioned [lah]
ya
(mm)
tapi saya pernah ingat dulu
masa saya pergi india dulu
(err) ada saya ingat ada satu pak cik
he likes to go for hunting he has a
like macam senapang [tau]
i don't know what it call the long one
sniper i think so yes
(err) i'm not very sure how it works
(err) tapi dia pergi macam
padang

you know paddy field
(uh) paddy field itu ada banyak burung

tobey
ya
bukan [lah] maybe that's what it's (uh)
(err) the maybe it's because the first one i watched
(mm)
(mm)
so (uh) saya nak tanya [eh]
so you after your sekolah [kan] after your course you want to work where nak kerja dekat mana
[ah]
okay
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
ya
yang itu hari (err)
yang sofian buat what internship itu bu~ it's research more to research right
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
you mean (err)
professors doing part time
they have other jobs right
(mm)
(mm)
to meet your mentor
who who is your mentor is it a professor
okay
(mm)
so you pergi
hari isnin
[kan] sekarang cuti sekolah
(mm)
(uh)
so how do you find your course (uh) is it you liking it
you mean your your a level friends
(mm)
tapi (uh) you mean
your f~ your friends friends who are doing the same course you mean
(mm)
(mm)
tapi yang you
(err) punya classmate yang dekat a level itu
ada ambil civil civil engineering
no bukan after a level ada your friends take the same course
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so (um) sofian nak
if if you are considering higher education mana awak nak belajar singapore ke overseas
okay
[oh] they have p_h_d and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how n_t_u they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
i mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
n_i_e
[eh]
tak boleh [lah] mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini then go
ajar budak primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
itu [lah] saya nak like i said
nak buka business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when i study the market because of covid
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
kalau tak another option would be like macam work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce ke
itu pun
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
dekat sini
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang
normal macam demam macam the normal you know cold flu things no i don't want that for free
tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit
(err) macam you know un~ unexpected
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
mahal sangat
so let's
(err) bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit
then memang orang itu dah stress because of the illness
ya so kalau dia tak ada duit
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so i wish
(um)
i wish [lah] if orang yang macam
[ah]
apa tak ada tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat
so they get i think government ada juga [lah] bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi i wish they
ya i wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
ya itu maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
tapi yang macam chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
lagi
(mm)
nanti kena
master
[oh] okay
itu satu (err) swimming sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar swimming
berenang
(err) is with is with a private coach
dekat
(err) dekat itu
(err) apa
#yio-chu-kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa-chu-kang#
ya sebab (err) coach itu boleh datang
(mm) dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ
ya i think #yio chu kang# or #choa-chu-kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coa~ coach is quite hands on [lah]
i mean (uh) last time saya pernah ada juga pergi
(mm)
dua tahun sebe~ selepas
(err) i mean (uh) two years before two years ago
tapi coach itu walaupun dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh lessons
tapi the coach is like (uh) not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven tapi each lesson itu
it's very
meaning i mean very (err)
ada dia punya itu [lah] result
so (um) berenang itu
(uh) so i i i i think i need (err) more practice
but
i think with more practice i can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
lagi satu itu saya
because sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima
so sekarang
like i feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so i want
rather then i do ac~ i i i want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
your you know like macam
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active s_g
ada pilates
is it with the equipment
pilates
[ah]
(mm)
satu jam is it a group class
is it good
dekat mana #jurong#
ya yang ini pilates saya bukan cari yang
just
(err)
yang pilates itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang
ada yang buat
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat itu
tapi ada lagi yang pakai equipments
just (uh) designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so i feel rather than
(um) the normal pilates i think i
i do this pilates [lah] i want to try but i haven't signed for the classes
ya
active s_g itu saya kena check kalau dia orang ada the same kind of pilates
kalau ada (uh) ya obviously i go for that
because private ones i think is quite expensive
(mm)
(mm)
active s_g belum
saya pernah pakai untuk swimming pool sahaja pernah
i mean the credit
no yang saya cakap itu dulu
dua tahun sebelum
itu dekat redhill
do~ (uh)
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so far [lah] because the coach (um) yang coach can only come there
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
ya like i said dulu punya coach itu
(um) i didn't learn anything from
the coach (uh) tapi sekarang punya coach itu
at least ada [lah] ajar sikit-sikit but i know i would i will take with some
practice
i can master the skills but not too fast for me
(mm)
yes
sekarang saya punya itu package remain one more lessons only
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
(mmhmm)
ya
one dish
(mm)
i like bread toast
no
but i like bread toast [lah]
i don't mind
but (err) only the down~ downside is that
(err) because it's all carbohydrates so i don't think i can eat
but if you if you ask me
no bread toast is just i like [lah] but not (mm) not i eat something that i eat rest of my life tapi kalau macam
(um)
i would rather go for something with proteins
like macam
chicken
or fish
ya i can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa [eh]
[ah] saya tak tahu [lah] awak
ya
maggi mee
(uh)
ya
fried rice
[oh] #mee hoon# #tom-yum#
okay
[ah]
okay
so how was the rice today (uh) the #mandi# rice
the nasi arab itu
ya smoke sebab smoke itu tak kuat smoke
the smoke is just like only on the surface
then it will you know dia akan hilang cepat
ya
itu bukan keras [lah] itu
bawah itu yang dah rangup
nasi yang dah
curry
(hmm)
ya tak tak tapi
i like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best (um) #mandi# rice i cooked so far
no i did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
(mm)
okay
(mm)
pizza dekat mana
pizza hut
!hey! which pizza you ate [ah]
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(err) tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of minyak sapi
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all minyak sapi or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
i'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion sh~ you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
you boleh you boleh letak rempah-rempah dia like kayu manis buah pelaga is
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak [lah] because it's only one cup of rice
so just one one will do one small piece of
kayu manis
buah pelaga satu cukup
then cengkih is clove
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
macam daun salam is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) you letak garam
(err) according to your taste [lah]
garam then when it when the
water starts to boil you letak itu beras
then you cook [lah] rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version [lah] there's many kind of
(err) nasi minyak you are talking about nasi minyak right
(uh) nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini
dia
ada letak
instead of (uh) instead of
all water they will mix with half half like susu cair
half susu cair half water
so what's that one and a half cup right
no nasi lemak kita letak santan
this is nasi minyak
ya nasi minyak you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit [lah]
(mm) then you boleh letak daun pandan daun serai
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also macam you boleh letak tomato
(uh)
you (uh) boleh letak chilli hijau semua [lah] then you put half half [lah] separuh
separuh susu cair
jadi tiga suku tiga suku
(uh) then the same method you put the (uh) garam
then you put the rice
the other one the taste will be mo~ macam kenduri punya nasi lemak [lah]
[ah]
ya
ya that one is more like (uh) is (uh) more with it goes well with like macam ayam masak merah rendang semua
ya ini nasi minyak simple punya so it goes well with (uh) curry chicken
ya curry chicken [lah] the best with potatoes
(mm)
can
no [oh] it's it's
it's easy to make
you then you can try to make tomorrow
i already to
it's not that difficult you just need one
[ah] onion that's all then the rest
ya you can use the rice cooker
ya so you try to make it so maybe you can kau boleh masak dekat sekolah

you still hype dia masih ada serious serious because right now (um) the movie just came out abeh macam
all all of us (uh) kita pergi tengok movie dia [kan]
there are some of our friends also dorang masih belum tengok
but they still do watch the anime [ah]
and also tak salah aku the season two pun belum keluar kalau kau belum
[ah] kau baru nak start the hype you still [ah] don't have to wait so long for the season two
but
but don't i don't know i i feel like you should wait for season two come out sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu season two possibly dorang akan keluar like
(err) cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
(uh) september twenty nineteen
ya netflix it came out [ah] slow but it came out came out right april tak salah april twenty twenty that's when the hype betul-betul naik [ah] [sia] and apa everytime
like (uh) there's some macam
apa [eh] i read cause i think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that [ah] the popularity really skyrocketed man and and also (err) dia nya #manga# because normally #mangas# like macam for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach (uh) #naruto#
dorang punya like the amount of copies that they [kan]
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
berapa lama [eh] tak salah aku one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay [lah] this is just a rough gauge all of them [ah] took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
untuk demon slayer for the #manga# aje [eh]
dia !wah! it's only four years [ah]
dah hundred and twenty million dah
[orh] ya
exactly
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[ah] at the sorry [ah] at the mountain right
[oh] ya
!wah!
so
does that mean [ah] in the future will be a demand also
with drums [ah] [ah] tapi pasal [kan] tu [ah] japanese [kan] kita melayu kita kita kompang
masuk masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya [eh] asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar [eh]
[oh] ya
[orh] ya that [one] is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six [eh] !wah! he's really strong
ya
such coward
!wah!
o_p man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
ya the like what they say [ah] apa ac~ actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how apa #gui# is [ah] as a person
but but
[ah] tapi
dia nya other than the anime
(um) apa soundtrack dia [kan]
it really blews me away [ah] blows me away sorry
because one thing about (uh) anything in general [ah] kalau kau tengok a show or something [kan]
it is more emotional kalau dia nya soundtrack is a very macam it's a good it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer sekarang the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa yang the opening
[ah] opening [ah]
(mm)
(mm) ya
ya
it's like (err) one thing good about anime is like there's no
[ah] pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of c~ certain events in their life
and pasal
(um)
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
that it becomes like everyday object everyday [ah] actions are sampai they don't know [ah] they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but !wah! it's
mind blowing [ah] legit
ya
ya
ya
(um)
(mm) ya
(uh) one piece
ya
[oh] ya
not too much
it's it's (uh) it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
[orh] ya
ya it has been i i mean i don't know if it's the usual but
for all the #animes# [ah] i watch semua ikut yang this dua puluh minit dua puluh minit dua puluh minit tapi ada yang
macam aku rasa like one shot there's this thing called one shot #animes# dorang usually macam forty plus minutes abeh dah tu [jer]
dia macam a short a short film [ah] kirakan but it the som~ sometimes like
orang fikir like [oh] the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the the quality of how you
tell a story in in a in a film is what matters [ah] kadang-kadang even like those thirty or ten minute films [kan] it leaves a very
(uh) everlasting mark in your in your memory macam tak boleh lupakan it's that good [ah] like the story storytelling even (uh) the soundtrack cause come on man [ah] without soundtrack anything will be boring [lah]
exactly cause that's why i i always [ah]
i always en~ envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for [ah] films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but i know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
[ah] ya
[ah] ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science i think i'll fail a lot of modules already
[oh] ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths i have to take [oh] wait no other than that got physics [lah] but that's all [lah] physics should be simpler because this [one]
its pre-calculus [sia] what the heck is that it's like a maths which i never learn before in secondary school
ya
[oh] is it the
the position vector [eh]
!wow!
it's okay man it's okay aku nya a math pun
bila entah [eh] macam there's this kind of stigma [ah] whenever you go to school or like university [ah] in that case
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
so whenever you go to university you have that curtai~ certain feeling that macam kau rasa kau rasa bodoh
[ah] i i shared this with my one of my friends [ah] dia pun tengah ambil university but i think is like n_u_s i think ya so ya [ah] bro that [one] is just that's just one person [lah] don't don't let it bring bad image to the school man
ya so (err) ya that's why exactly but okay [lah] the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you (err) encounter like many problem solving [ah] methods or like
especially kalau kau buat coding atau math [kan] there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where macam [oh] wait what's going on i don't understand [sia] and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not it's not the same as like poly atau atau secondary school [tau]
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me [ah] because one thing (um)
i'm a i'm an introvert so i don't really mingle much with (um) other people or like
(uh) actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
i don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
i know i have to try it out first to [ah] do it whether i don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes i feel like
like (mm) i don't want to tell people that i cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
(mm)
ya
sebab mak aku english teacher
(uh) ya ya
(mm)
that sounds
crystallisation thinking [eh]
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
ya and also macam being an introvert you you have this certain set of skill it's called (err) from what i learn in psychology like different people have different
(uh) soft skills that they're born with
like (err) apa tu there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is !huh!
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if i'm not wrong is skill [lah] but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
(uh) your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood [lah] in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own (uh) thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you [ah] in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
(uh) you you just you don't want to bring up the (uh) negative (uh) vibe when you speak up
so this the intre~ intrapersonal skill is for people whom i guess are introverts [lah] so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
[ah] ya
(mm) ya
macam apa [sia] dia ni like asal asal [ah] kecil hati exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like [eh] don't don't be so abrupt don't be so macam rude [ah] kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini [kan] the person who speak all those abrupt words or macam kasar [kan] dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam [oh] ni semua [ah] normal [lah] takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe] so i'll just continue with what i'm doing [ah]
(mm)
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
ya and and in okay [ah] in university especially
adapting and also apa [eh] wh~ what's that word again (uh) you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
okay
cannot
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
drop
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh] !wow!
!wow!
it's (uh) it's the same thing for my my school also cause (err) if i'm not wrong [ah] is (err) when you said academic warning right ya at that time also i think it is certain in all university [lah] if you never meet their g_p_a requirement after like every semester or something
but (uh) if i'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and i'm full time (um) if you are if you have a academic warning already
abeh kalau your g_p_a
dah macam
lesser than two point eight
then kau akan dapat suspension
suspension meaning
satu tahun kau
[ah] kau [ah] [eh] sorry
after one year then kau kena re-enroll
ya
(um) when you are in a academic warning punya ni [ah] ya
if you haven't get a~ academic warning then asalkan your g_p_a is not lesser than two point o or maybe one point eight then you're still save [lah]
[ah] ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that g_p_a to increase by a bit
ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam [ah]
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
[oh] [eh]
!wah!
[orh] okay i mea~
ada is that macam kau nya topic bukan topic apa module module is that module macam
(uh)
kau nak kena belajar pasal another language
like macam malay atau mandarin
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[orh] is it the same as macam
kalau nak berbual melayu
ada benda kita nak kena reverse the structure of a e~ of a word
!huh!
[oh]
ya
macam nak cakap
kalau english post office abeh melayu pejabat post dia dia dia macam reverse [ah] it's in that that way [ah] like buat orang macam confusing
but is it mean the same thing
prof [oh] professor
french
[orh] is it
pejabat post
ah~
geo~
[oh] like apa dialects [ah] slang slang
(mm)
[oh] i
[ah]
(mm)
a~ (um) is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also i mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in (uh) game design right but i think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is (uh) user experience in game design so what i get from that
is actually what you have been experience [ah] since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the macam
[ah] baru-baru punya module yang apa nak nak kena ajar like aku rasa for example like
(uh) in the market i guess one thing yang
macam banyak-banyak tukar is the job finding
kalau let's say (err) user experience [kan]
normally macam tak banyak kerja pasal user experience [mah] because it's not that known to be (uh) to be like a proper job orang fikir macam !alah! ni orang lain buat boleh buat [pe] macam it's another job
on top of the job that orang tengah buat but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object macam kau pegang cawan
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right abeh kau imagine kalau they handle ada duri tak comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics (err) e~ the the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though macam it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
macam kau tengah bad mood abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau kau tak rasa
[ah] [kan] so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this (uh) tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say (um) enjoyed the little hap~ happiness in life
because if you [ah] if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
like (err) happiness like for example kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja
dekat tempat kerja ni yang gaji dia bagi tujuh ribu abeh kau sekarang tengah kerja kat tempat kerja ni yang bagi kau seribu lapan ratus
abeh kau rasa macam [eh] how am i gonna ge~ get to that level so kau kau (uh) bertungkus-lumus kau (uh) cari-cari kerja banyak banyak banyak and that process buat kau bad mood
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
[ah]
ya
[ah]
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness [lah]
macam
some people dorang dah so into earning money
that their greed in~ is imposed onto them to make more money walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset macam [oh] since i have this mu~ much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that i have wanted since i was a kid
that means if i have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it (uh)
they imagine them like [eh] with this
i i'll look good [ah] like [ah] with a car like porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
(mm)
ya
exactly
but i guess (um)
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
(um) elon musk [eh] he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can an~ [ah] achieve
like kau imagine [ah] like he said in two years [eh]
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
[ah] if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when i was (err) i okay [lah] when i was kid you tell me this i'll be damn happy [lah] of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
[ah] their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation i think it's like our gen y
ya
[oh] [ah] sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely yo~ all the
cam rezeki akan di diberikan like don't focus always on the rezeki focus on like
what make things work in in the last time [ah] macam retrospect [ah] but for now it's more like
(uh) we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
i guess that's how human works
which is why i appreciate like all those people yang even though it's just [ah] comic books or like anime [kan] it brings certain joy to you like you feel you feel
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to [lah]
[ah] [ah] ya roller coaster
(mm) ya y~ you have to take a break [ah]
that's why i feel
[ah] for this anime macam all these [one]
(uh)
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
that's why like [ah] apa [eh] ya macam demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience [lah] the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
which is why i also like how (um) okay [lah] not demon slayer something much more loar~ large scale which is marvel
!wow!
marvel is (uh) huge scale of
all the things that you [ah]
you imagine it to happen
it's happening in in that macam [ah] alternate universe [lah] in a way [ah] that~ ya m_c_u marvel cinematic universe
so what i like about marvel is dorang they apa
dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam the movie walaupun that movie ada banyak orang macam superpower [kan] tapi dorang buatkan character tu macam he goes through everyday life as per normal but (uh) they somehow macam in a turn of events they stumble upon something which ma~ made them into a superhero of some sort even though ada orang dorang tak ada super~ [ah] superpower tapi a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something yang buatkan kau macam strongly
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero [ah] but with no actual superpower
(uh huh) game of thrones [oh] tak [eh]
[orh] ya
cool
[orh]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
the black widow and iron man started
(mm)
[oh] ya
gauntlet
ya
(um) assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
tell you about it like macam [eh] macam orang gemuk like they want to achieve being slim like have that f~ [ah] that the beach body
and because of that people like the the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like [eh] dah kurus [eh] [sia] baik [pe] but actually kau kau tak tahu like th~ the process itself buatkan kau nak slim kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam [eh] kau dah kurus [kan]
you'll feel good [lah]
ya it motivates you even though it's not it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal (uh) weight your optimal image tapi the
the thought of people macam dorang perasan like kau tengah berubah a~ a~ at least macam you looking more slim or looking more [ah] toned your body looks so toned then kau you'll feel better and it helps to
make your drive even
(uh)
higher
tapi i~ it's it's i guess this little happiness macam kalau nak go back to what i said earlier like the little happiness buat kau macam maintain your course cause ada orang let's say pasal yang language [one] aku pun tengah another language is called c sharp programming language
so that [one] (err) i'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like i'm not a person who is
(uh) good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
i have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements [ah] but in that case also like if you were to think about it [ah]
for this different generations like sejak okay [ah] this past few hundred years [ah] there has been certain developments in (uh) certain parts of (uh) humanity like last time there's (uh) ag~ agriculture industrial evolution [kan] then there's (uh)
now [eh] ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some i_t knowledge so i thought okay [lah] maybe
i learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam
aku nak keep up to date to certain things jadi macam i'm not
(uh) losing in the race for finding jobs atau (uh) skill sets so
aku push myself [ah] i push myself to learn the programming but sometimes kalau kau buat benda sorang like what i said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
so i
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make [ah] it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
(uh) it's it's hard [ah] is the most hardest thing for me
[orh]
i always i i try push myself with with that mindset because i keep on hearing like
a lot of peop~ there are more people that are saying like [ah] if i was younger i would have taken a programming course if i would've known that this will be very re~ relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course i there lot of times that i i feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be [ah] okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
i help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
[ah] [ah] too intro~ introvert that they wan~ they don't want to show their weaknesses [lah] there are certain people in in my course who are like that but i don't want to say any names but of course
(mm) can say [lah]
ya ya
especially if you okay [lah] probably yang buatkan kau malu is kalau macam kau buat buat buat abeh kau rasa macam [eh] ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku assume that walaupun susah but aku i can just google apa google is there for me to help boleh search senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
(uh) the the amid the google search yang kau buat
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work kalau tak [kan] kalau kau ikut [jer] it will definitely not work
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay [lah] becaus~ before
uni [ah] you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art th~ the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like (uh) you learn programming all this and that it's useful because [ah] we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
(uh) how good is a game and like what i said the user experience must be
(uh) good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
[ah] exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
(uh) biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun [kan] kalau kau buat game macam g_t_a five dorang main ke i mean
for educational purpose
ya like okay kalau aku [ah] nak aim for
apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar like tiga tahun empat tahun [ah] not not not not tak tahu belajar i mean tak tahu tak tahu buat math like aku bagi dorang game pasal math tapi [ah] dia nya macam quizzes aku bagi chemistry
lari [kan] that's why (err) that target audience is the most important thing when kau buat game macam untuk kau [eh] best [sia] game ni ada chemistry tapi kau tak tahu actually your audience is yang orang yang nak belajar pasal math
[oh] but okay [lah] cone
like iron man okay ni ni ni betul-betul (uh) off track
[ah] iron~ ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart [lah] like he might be one of the inspiration where aku will continue programming because
in in a way like m_c_u the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
scenario kalau orang betul-betul don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so aku rasa like programming is a
it's a good it's a
apa [eh]
ya in~ ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
[ah] ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth [sia]
that's why aku really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
that's why i also like marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years [lah] give or take
in
[oh]
ya
strap [eh]
[orh] [oh] ya
probably they
i mean they will have a controlled environment macam (uh) dia nya apa tu
apa tu [ah] udara udara dia macam ada dekat dalam this sphere abeh kalau ada ikut macam earth punya udara in~ inside that sphere aku rasa everything should be fine kalau orang kena tanam ke apa there might be a proper grave for them cuma
it's weird [lah] it it's weird [ah] cause tak pernah dengar orang [ah] [eh] mana kubur kau bukan kau [ah] mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa [oh] dekat mars [ah] aku nak merawat
naik spaceship but that is a possible future also like kalau let's say when elon musk dia cakap (uh) human will be interplan~ planetary existence in in the universe so imagine kalau you have your own spaceship macam kereta sekarang but kau nya spaceship kau imagine macam [eh] aku nak pergi [ah] moon jap kau nak makan [ah] moon burger [eh] boleh [ah] kita gi makan sekarang k jap aku ambil spaceship aku
ya abeh kau [ah] fly [ah] okay [ah] ni set [ah] g_p_s to moon then dia nya spaceship kau cakap okay (uh) ten minutes ride okay
abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang grab [pe] so kau call (uh) space grab
[eh] [eh] best [sia]
[oh] man i i don't know i don't know but it's not i think it's not light years
because i one light year if i'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no i don't i don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive [ah] to experience it
unless bila mars dah ada a way to like
persevere humanity to maintain young
[orh]
[ah] ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
[oh]
[a'ah] ak~ #akaza#
a demon
[orh]
[oh] ya mayb~
maybe the thought of that like macam aku tahu aku tak mati so buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua you become complacent
then kau complacent then then there's no progress in life [lah] macam semua dah convenient untuk kau [pe] or aku boleh [ah] aku boleh tengok anime hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati [pe] so takyah belajar [ah] takyah belajar apa takyah mandi cause whatever it is even even though i am smelly or even though how much i don't brush my teeth
i will still stay young [what] i won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
makes humanity not to deserve to have a (um) apa eternal life
[ah]
[ah] upper moon
ya
same
(mm)
ya i guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live a~ [ah] eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said (um)
wo~ the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
but not the things like macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam [eh] dia ni bagus [sia] okay dah tu [jer] [ah] abeh kalau macam for example kalau michael jackson
dia buat buat lagu semua macam okay [lah] kalau dia tak mati it's still there [ah] tapi bila he died at at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because macam [oh] a legend it has it is a legend because
(err) people who die i don't know [ah] this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die [lah] normally
ya
that's humans [lah] in a way [ah] that it's a beauty [ah] like when you die i~ you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know [lah] but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
[ah] set the bar
ya
so imagine if like [ah] the apa [eh]
[ah] wrestling or any any person in interest [lah] like [oh]
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already [lah] even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any (uh)
impact yet
the same goes for ni [ah] the the the football legend
ya #maradona#
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few (uh) weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
[ah]
passing
[ah] ya ya
it's like it heightens your
macam [eh] dia ada buat aku susah but
[ah] i guess you can say that
i i guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
