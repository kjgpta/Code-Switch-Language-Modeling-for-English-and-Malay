alright
alright #mahirah#
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
[ha] nampak
beauty in everyone okay this is a
topic ni berat [eh] topic ni is very this topic is orang kata very wide dia punya spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance tapi beauty in terms of everything not just
(uh) look wise tapi beauty in (uh) nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is memang kita boleh counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic i would say for the first
(uh) time kita berbual
so okay kita start gini [lah] [eh] kita start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay kau kau start dulu apa kau punya definition of beauty pada kau
yes
okay
[oh] that would tu bagus tu yes that that is bagus (err) bagus bagus
for me
for me okay ak~ aku
i don't see myself as kau tahu [kan] macam victoria's secret punya type punya ke lawa memang tak [lah] memang not even near that [lah] but because i i have my insec~ inse~ insecurities (um) based on appearance juga which itu pun is another topic [eh] kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu about me about
but but what can i say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble i think that is the overall beauty which
which people in our society is blinded by that sebab
standard kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
tapi for me beauty kalau kau lawa pun mana pun but if your if your attitude is macam gitu then
then memang you know what i mean
memang kit~ tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective ramai orang ada different punya perspective but we're gon~ we're not gonna touch on that but d~ we can just (uh) it's between the both of us what is our definition
boleh boleh
beauty in a long term !woo!
(mmhmm)
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so se~
(mm)
betul
[oh] okay for me my kawan the friends that i go like the friends that i cari atau dapat it's okay we we can talk about poly ya kita punya poly days is kita tak i i don't see like [oh] kau lawa i'm gonna be friends with you no no no no i woul~ never sebab
kau lawa i was going to say you no no no no i never sebab
i mean i don't know for me memang i don't see
like okay because you are pretty i'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome i'm gonna go to no i rather i rather not
go towards that sebab it's not gonna be a genuine punya relationship you know
sebab it's just gonna be
for clout macam you know you know some people (uh) there there is some (uh) cliques ke apa whatever in school yang macam okay sebab kau lawa kau popular i'm gonna to go to you because
i'm gonna get that that that popularity i'm gonna get that that fame dia ada attention so i think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is memang may~ maybe not because during after kalau your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person yang macam will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
macam for me and you [eh] macam this is kita pun semalam baru jumpa [eh] we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like kita punya relationship first first kita start from sec one
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and (err) (err) our friends yest~ yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward [tau] and that that is something that i see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever #inshaallah#
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what i what i see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
kita punya personality because okay imagine kalau the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine kita takde macam makan orang makan orang you know what i mean like like betray or
or jealousy no that it it is really a general rela~ relationship that's why i find that if you want to find friends in the future
tak payah cari beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any betul tak tu
apa kau rasa apa kau rasa
cerita sikit cerita sikit
(mm)
go towards the beauty or
[oh] damn
(mm)
(mmhmm)
like fashion wise you know is it [oh] damn okay i think i get what you mean some~ my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not i mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are (um)
(uh) handsome (uh) lelaki kat dalam my course yang baik yang humble yang tahu yang dia orang tak stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also (um)
(uh) girls that they they dia orang punya dia orang macam you know they have that that beauty standard [lah] dia orang ada that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are sombong they are arrogant you know
so so macam it's a
i don't know (err) macam for me that's not the right i mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say kalau kau lawa you should then (uh) take advantage of it like you know you should your personality pun kena bagus
sebab but but people people who are lawa usually you know you know dia orang dia orang i'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna ada that ego you know that ego that that it depends [lah] how you are brought up you know
which is (um) it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them [lah]
ya very subjective
(mm)
true true but overall selecting friends with with (uh) with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not (uh) it's not the right way to do [lah] i would say
so ya it's not
not just that [lah] beauty in terms of you know right k~ (uh) now we are all going to that stage of working [kan] it's always kalau it's always macam you see this (um)
if there's if there's a competition you know what i mean
not just competition but macam okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this i had experienced that macam sebab this person is sexy ke apa ada landed job
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
i mean that is for us yang mungkin macam of a lower standard
it's not it's unfair [what] because you should pick someone of (uh) of ta~ of talent of skills instead of beauty
(mm)
[oh] yes
pay plays an important role e~
(mm)
design
f&b
social service ya
true true
betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur [eh] i mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
tapi (uh) beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that (uh)
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari (um)
a a partner in life your (uh)
wh~ is beauty important macam appearance wise or the best is macam mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
(uh huh)
that is true of course of course first app~ ya you will see the appearance [one] or not
ya tu memang tu memang tu memang
ad~ ada yang suka cute cute ada yang suka macam e-boy e-boy
true true true true
(uh) no (err) not not not the first (uh) judgement because because first judgement memang is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but (uh) overall macam to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
me too me too
i think i think
okay kau okay kau kau share kau share dulu cause ni pun (uh) is an interesting fact
for me for me right i i got a
okay i will share you later you you share first
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
what's the point [kan]
true true i mean for me i think that is considered beauty sebab okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is no~ is nothing macam okay [lah] first judgement yes appearance tapi [kan] peop~ people say kindness is beautiful to me int~ intelligence is beautiful to me or macam
(uh) macam the the act of (uh) sharing macam
(uh) car~ caring the your you punya personality that is beautiful so
macam i think beauty [eh] is is
is again subjective sebab
ada orang [eh] they say macam asalkan kau kemas [kan] macam kau (err) you are clean you clean yourself macam it macam bukanlah you yo~ i'm asking you macam pergi plastic surgery to be beautiful no no i think i think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
(uh) i'm not i'm not gonna talk about myself (err)
but but overall macam the of how you take care of yourself macam for the macam kita how we how we like its like macam you know like we we kita basuh muka something like that you know
things like that this little things that will build up (um)
the sense of beauty sebab okay macam beauty [eh] is again macam very it can be very (um)
stressful for some people
sebab
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what i mean
you know (uh) i i got this macam macam experience kalau we we talk with our friends ke apa we always like ada juga topic topic yang macam ini maknanya macam anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of (uh) people
(uh) again it's it's about slo~ un~ (um) macam low self esteem you know kau ada face gitu tak aku ada i i have low self esteem you know cause i do have insecurities insecurities that macam to me i find that
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what i mean but it's hard to get rid of it
macam kau do do you have any like (um)
insecurities ataupun macam low self esteem towards this kind of (uh) topic
i pun sama
handsome
sama sama sama sama for me sama (err) like i think
susah [eh] macam
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
terdetik [lah] kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang very kita rasa macam [eh] !alamak! you know what i mean
ya
i i came across this one (uh) (uh) apa tu (uh) it's a meme [lah] the it's a kid the kid says macam the kid was saying (uh) dia like macam to god [tau] god (uh)
if (uh) can you make me (uh) beautiful because i don't think i'm very smart
okay but i think betul [lah] macam
for me pun ad~ times yang i i i would say to myself like
if i'm not smart then at least make me beautiful [lah] you know which is a wrong mindset sebab that means [eh]
i'm i'm okay this to me towards me i'm i'm scolding myself that means i'm trying to say that
[oh] that means when if i'm pre~ beauty
if i'm (uh) pretty i will get somewhere i would get (uh) at least a modelling job ke apa you know at least i have something tapi
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
tapi sap~ okay siapa tak nak lawa [kan] siapa tak nak handsome buat apa dalam dunia ni
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
(um) tadi nak tanya tanya seribu question boleh
yes yes
yes
[oh] !wow!
girls or boys
i think [kan] for me okay kita kita perempuan [kan] but i i think (um) generally generally speaking [kan] i think it's the girls is it but not me [lah]
subjective subjective but but i think [kan] it's more towards the girls sebab [kan] kau tahu [lah] macam we have like boys and girls is different [what] kita punya how we hangout how we
ag~ again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
pergi towards that that
that apa tu tujuan like okay i'm gonna find this kind of clique
but
to you apa to you which one for you
ya
physic~ really physic~
practical
(mm)
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also [lah] you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which macam for for girls maybe some of them will talk about [eh] look at that i mean [eh] macam [eh] yo~ have you heard this about i heard about macam some of my friends (uh) classmate dia macam [eh] kau tengok tu [eh] kau tengok dia ni [eh] kau tengok you know they we they are always macam
you can say (err) comparing [eh] comparing
(uh) judgy but
that's kind of the topic yang
for you know me and you kita tak kita we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then (uh) (uh) most likely is the
kaum wanita [lah] it's always kaum wanita
tapi ya ya but (uh) (uh) (um) to mention macam orang yang tak lawa
tak but it's kini it's how society pandang you know what i mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know sebab this is how society looks sebab to be honest who started this thing called macam
(uh) okay (uh) kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this (uh) or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing mesti ada dulu maybe in history ada [jer] yang macam
okay kalau you macam ni i you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with (um) you can say ni lumrah manusia [tau] you know kau tahu benda ni macam this human standard the world doesn't do this [tau] it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually kalau kalau we all treat people the equally (uh) got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having (uh) insec~ insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem sebab it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
macam okay i'm not gonna i'm not sebab you get it's subjective it depends some ada some parts of the world takde macam gini but some parts some of the world
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
that is very macam sebab it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning [what] that's why ramai orang macam ada yang every article is that people suicide you know
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
tak payah cakap pasal you macam gini [kan] it it can be because maybe sebab (uh) you are having this disabilities which i i very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people i mean they got they they never do anything to you [what] betul [what] macam
dia orang tak kacau kau apa or like they judge you base on your (uh) clothing ke based on your i'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can (uh) about also about also macam status
hierarchy system macam kaya and poor
this kind of thing is what
it's all lum~ lumrah manusia it's all (uh) human standards
which i think is
is is tak berapa bagus
betul tak
not just beauty [tau] macam pasal poor and rich pun boleh jadi problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people i've seen (uh) kau tahu [kan] macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak [kan] macam budak budak ada yang kena outcast [kan] you know what i mean
this one is is this this kind of thing [lah] that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what i mean
[oh] dear i think i heard a dysfunctional something [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
functional [eh]
[oh] ya
that macam (uh) the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what i mean
ya comp~ competition (err) competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that (uh) after this dysfunction but i tell you a bit macam betul [lah] like
there there will be a president there will be (uh) our manager there will be our the boss
takkan semua sama right pekerja then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work [what] because
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
true true true so memang ini
lum~ lumrah [lah] [eh] memang memang it's the world [lah] it's just it evolve like this [lah] to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be (uh) plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay (uh) dunia hiburan
about okay (uh) western world atau k pop [eh] macam for example that kind of thing
usually yang lawa [jer] pun yang disanjung disanjung disanjung
usually it's it's gonna be the pret~ the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be (uh)
[eh] actually no actually no i think it just it just involve in the korean punya
the k pop world you know what i mean sebab in western world we don't look at beauty [what] we we we judge based on (uh) music wise kalau kita suka kita suka macam for example like
(uh) there are (uh) idols macam mana [eh]
macam okay (uh) like
tak i think macam it's different kita tak boleh compare we cannot compare like western punya industry like the hollywood and and also k pop sebab k pop i i it's always gonna be the most handsome idol atau the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
yang lain semua you know especially when you're in a group of (uh) like ch~ of kau pernah kau pernah (uh) come across this article tak dia macam there's this one idol dia punya member tak berapa lawa [tau] macam
to me it's fine [lah] but it's ada sikit macam different daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa then all the all the macam the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is tak tak not of a pretty tapi is in the middle
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
so i think that is also rabak [lah] to be honest
[oh] my god like
[ah] memilih kasih padahal sama group [tau] padahal they are in the same group
to me i think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead [lah] like like why sanjung (uh) idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada [jer] yang news turns out that [oh] this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesn't (uh)
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
yes you said it betul apa
(uh) same like macam
macam you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish tapi okay but see this is how beauty
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side (err) but the the the the negative side about
beauty [eh] macam
the look at the people will just support this (uh) this the group of
based on their
(uh) sexiness ke based on their face ke or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards (uh) bad punya
okay not i'm not just talking about the k pop there i'm just talking i'm talking about okay perspective as (uh) the macam those those fans yang sanjung sangat [kan] it's not (uh) it's not it's not a good habit for them [what] sebab
sebab right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like macam harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
so that is the negative side [lah] about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
macam kau tak payah ada beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know i mean
tengok [jer] macam (um) o~ oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the lawa the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that (uh) hosting punya and she can be successful you know what i mean
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way [lah] but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
yang benda apa tu yang benda
yang benda (uh) success
(mmhmm)
true true
it also goes with macam top (uh) fashion wise you know what i mean
macam kau tahu [kan] dulu (uh) okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like (uh) sloppy
macam t-shirt and cause that's what i i do sometimes you know but and then kita pergi kedai mamak something like that right
kedai (uh) #kopitiam# or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think macam they they will look at us like [eh] dia ni biar betul you know what i mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where kita kita i'm gonna feel macam
(uh) it's okay (err) but like [eh] like it's i'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
tapi get it it's it's how era goes you know sebab zaman dulu imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right dulu time maybe like early two thousand
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what i mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example [eh] and then you call you wear (uh)
a dress with heels to a #kopitiam# people will look at you macam [eh] you biar betul
lain macam but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
(uh) think macam [oh] kau lawa macam it's fine
so see how this (uh) the the era macam how (uh) move [eh] you know what i mean
lain [eh] which is weird [eh] macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir !wah!
as time goes by
as technology becomes more macam
(uh) better and more (uh)
orang kata apa lagi gempak then
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay (um)
jap [eh]
(mm)
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
!wow! okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what i mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it (mm)
true true
[oh] yes
but you are not a hipster you know what i mean (um) ya ya ya
tak tahu no no no no no i'm not talking about you as in macam those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters dia orang nak step [jer] macam they just follow the trend you know what i mean
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
i think saturated
i think there is like macam photos trend i guess kita kita use simpler simp~ (uh) simpler terms [eh]
i would say today this
(uh) of (uh) twenty twenty of the twenty first century
as you know macam around starting to see because here i feel it
it's not (um) it's because (uh) as technology evolves we evolve
you know what i mean sekarang (uh) is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is (uh) macam instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what i mean
(uh) facebook twitter youtube
(uh) this kind of thing (uh) macam pinterest (uh)
dulu tumblr okay tiktok sekarang tiktok [kan]
sekarang tiktok where
the you you i mean you we see everyone's punya life you know what i mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols ke your punya favourite punya artist (uh) kim k ke whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
t_v you know what i mean so maknanya
due to that that's why (uh) people are like following macam okay macam e-boy e-girl you might not be an e-boy e-girl tapi you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
tapi to me i think
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because i wanna look cool i think that is not the right thing (err) you know what i mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like suka dia punya style macam some people you can we see [oh] i like i kind of like this style i want to try
ya go by all means tapi you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya macam that is that is not the right way sebab macam kau kena genuine with yourself [lah] macam
imagine you are not like that right tapi sebab kau nampak (uh) your maybe your cliques are all macam
(uh) going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you coul~ if you (uh) if you just change your clothing then it's fine tapi you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing kalau if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good (uh) circle of friends that is a good company tapi if you start to macam okay maaf cakap [eh] this can be very sensitive sebab imagine if your circle of friends (uh) macam smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right tapi you buat
because you want to fit in then i think you shouldn't (uh) people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right macam you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in macam
why i mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
with people macam mana [eh] i i say you don't need to get okay macam mana kau nak get this thing
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a comp~ (uh) company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
(uh) stage you know what i mean
so macam you know like (um) you know they say there's a saying macam (uh) everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like macam macam mana [eh] like
(err) macam the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset tapi you you don't
(uh)
have the same people that will hold you back
but because everyone's macam kau
needs a level up you know what i mean macam level of for the good
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
tak bagus [lah] tapi macam like see this is how (uh) trend setting macam
fashion wise (uh) people are now using (uh) fewer are following the more of the k pop
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it tapi if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later tapi if you follow that kind of group yang buat benda tak elok then (uh) then you should
you should have your own pride [eh] macam you know what i mean kau punya pride kau tak payah follow orang lain punya orang lain punya instruction ada betul
boleh boleh boleh shoot [jer] shoot
go [jer]
(mmhmm)
value is it popular popularity (mm)
(mmhmm)
self love
pandang rendah is it pandang rendah you look down on them [oh]
okay for me
as long as you know
where you stand macam mana you know what i mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead tapi kalau you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's sebab you nak ada you nak ada friends you know what i mean like quotation macam you nak ada friends punya pasal then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good (uh) there is not a good tujuan sebab kalau kau really nak
i mean you know some people macam for me no [eh] macam for me i got this thing where
kalau aku takde kawan then i'm not gonna i'm not desperate for friends like i just i i mean you know there are some people
kita nampak i've i've i've seen this
where
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they dia keluar from the group [kan] dia keluar from the clique and then dia cari orang lain immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much macam you like like tak bagus [lah] i i rather be alone you know what i mean i i rather people see me as alone
and i have my own (uh) pendirian daripada
i i think (uh) i need to find i need to find a friend because (uh) because people might think nanti macam i got problem
but i mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that (uh) circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find (uh) someone that really is genuine in your friendship
same goes like your question tadi whether that loner is degrading themselves no i don't think so sebab if the loner if that loner sometimes loner tu feels that
there's nothing wrong (uh) he he or she is of a good (uh) direction even if the person is alone go ahead i i woul~ kita support aku support tapi kalau
sebab you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on [oh] kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish [lah] i think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know macam they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
sebab if you want to go for me [eh] aku aku i like to keep my circle of friends close macam just a small circle of friends that i really call true friends you know sebab to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what i mean and is it gonna be beneficial macam mana [eh]
ka~ you know kawan kosong and kawan that is really true
ya so back to your question where kalau the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you it's hard it's hard to say macam for me you know i just say but if i were to
to be in that position then maybe i'll have i'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and i will be very depressed full or what~ whatever right
tapi what i i can advice macam
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
so go ahead like (um) move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
kau kalau kau macam mana
yes i i still remember our first our first

macam !wow! [lah] you know what i mean
there are some macam kau tahu you know mira filzah tak
okay #mira-filzah# is the (uh) pel~ actress in malaysia
dia punya beauty [kan]
and her personality [oh] my god dia full package you know she got the personality she got the great voice dia punya voice [kan] lemah lembut [kan] and then dia pun lawa dia dia okay
dia tak lawa lawa [tau]
but her lawa is very sweet type you know what i mean macam kau like sedap mata memandang you know what i mean macam you you you can just like look macam
that kind of beauty aku macam respect [sia] aku aku aku tabik
aku tabik
full package full package
!wah! that is good that is the best kalau you've you got the full package you know that you are beauty and then you are humble about it !wah!
that's a good recipe
kalau kalau western pun kau kau handsome tak western kalau western hollywood style
kalau aku
kalau aku siapa [eh]
okay we we okay we we don't know like their personality how [lah] but but there we but we appreciate their dia orang punya beauty
you know what i mean
yes we appreciate kita tak macam
jealous or judge you know like [eh] rambut kau lawa tak tak [eh] no no (uh) when when we judge is because kau punya character
like like you you are you you you are pretty but then you are like very snobbish or like you are very arrogant and that that is when we like macam !alamak! come on [lah] you waste you waste your beauty
why waste your beauty but you know some people don't know that macam
like macam you know what i mean it's it's how you are brought up juga [lah] how does everyone
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay role model to me
in my family i i'll have to say my mum [lah]
my mum is someone that
she's beautiful to me and her character macam yang moth~ macam motherly kind of (uh) you know what i mean of how she brings me out aku
if some if some if someone that
of a role model like !wow! like like macam
macam kita kita we wanna be someone like that you know what i mean
we wanna be someone like that that's that's what i see macam
and and how dia macam ajar like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
although that she's tired but she still
macam ajar then !wah!
(um) tak payah cakap pasal beauty [lah] it's macam dia punya attitude wise you know what i mean
ya so role model
the is that tapi kalau macam if you want to say like like western punya or like macam barat
(uh) pelakon ke apa [kan] then i would say #neelofa#
#neelofa# #neelofa#
is the ya malaysian punya actress host (uh) business woman sebab [kan] (uh) kalau kau tak tahu [kan] dia buat this brand apa yang neelofa punya tudung and then she's she's she's successful sampai pergi (uh)
milan (uh) to the the business berkembang
like real be and and she's very #muslimah# also so i thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
she is a great (uh) host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty i think she's thirty right now thirty one or something dia masih belum berpunya she's still single but her driven of (uh) being that success both dunia and akhirat aku boleh cakap
it's it's like !wah! macam
it's something that macam you god bless you you know
ya i take that as a as a
(uh) role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and (uh) of a islam (uh) muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing apa tadi kau nak cakap
#wallah#
betul betul betul the i mean the the the life the hereafter [lah]
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
(mm) (mm)
ya tu [oh] my god singapore living ya
(mmhmm)
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is !wow! i think memang it's very rare no not just both tapi your character pun baik your personality pun baik
those who have that
i have the most the utmost respect the utmost macam
role model [lah] i think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man yang macam you know that you have okay for the guys handsome (uh) bekerjaya and (um) (uh) apa we can cakap apa faithful is it faithful and then (um) of a good personality then
memang susah nak cari but these are the people yang macam you risau tapi again to those yang kita okay kita boleh ran~ ran~ (uh) rumuskan [eh] sebab we got like a few more minutes tapi (um) what i can say is that we shouldn't just (um) we shouldn't just
(uh) okay what's that word [eh] i want to say that this kau tahu [kan] macam kita kita jangan just tengok yang lawa kita just tengok yang handsome you know what i mean we we don't we don't (err) okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance sebab
it will just make you rasa diri you yang kalau you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so i feel like we atau whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down [what] like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this macam successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself kalau just you know what i mean like
(um) like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
betul you know what i mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of (uh) just be humble be kind i think kalau at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character betul tak
so just ya just be on that don't worry kalau
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same [lah] just human being
ya
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly macam choose to that but slowly slowly i think i think as long as you macam you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know bila
whatever you have would be taken away you know what i mean
so then you just be humble [lah] macam
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself [lah]
(mm)
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no (uh) okay how about before that we say
(err) the one thing we regret
you know what i mean macam we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then baru kita move on to ten years down the road what should we
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
!wow! that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
i tend to look down on myself
very low
macam it it it has come to a point where
macam because of beauty [lah] because of like insecurities and like low self esteem i tend to like
i i think myself ni macam takde value
and it has come to a point where macam whatever people take one for me aku macam mengalah aku like okay give in give in give in cause i felt like
like i should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
to have like prioritise in me sebab i i tend to like
to like macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang [seh]
you know what i mean so it has i should be more macam have that confidence which i i aku tu tu last time [eh] tu last but right now i have i work on that and it's it's i find that
(uh) re~ the respect that you you're given by society that is more
so to the next ya (uh) future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road apa kau punya advice
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
[oh] message to [oh] okay okay
[oh] okay that's good that's good
(mm)
true
true true that is that is important and macam to just have that little selfishness in you so that
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued [lah] in this world into serious [eh] for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
ni is important betul okay
ellen punya ellen put aside [eh] tapi tapi
betul this is my pendirian i know where
and i have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
higher status kau manager your kau they treat me they treat us macam kita ni beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what i mean so i aku macam to me i would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day aku
have my own (uh) business or i i'm (uh) i'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever [lah] bigger title whatever
treating people nice is you is a must sebab how can you judge sebab i got people around me macam they they judge okay for example
kalau kau punya job (uh) macam (uh) cleaning wise ke apa [kan]
i mean you shouldn't judge
kau why would you (uh) i've seen this this is another topic (err) like for me okay i just share a bit of my intern [eh] i was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because (uh) kita they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like (uh) kuli we are like beginner
kita macam baru masuk industry then they they they bully us they they not just (uh) okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means i deserve that treatment tapi if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like macam kita sampah or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists i i got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then i felt like [oh] my god you you you you forget where you where you start you kau kau dah lupa diri [kan] this is what happen when kita lupa diri so i i i just want to advice myself that [oh] my god please
#nadia# don't ever lupa diri sebab one day kalau i get that extra money ke i get that extra title ke i might forget about myself and people below me
bad which i don't want that to happen and
because i myself experienced it how bad it is and i know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future i advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know bila this (uh) blessing will be taken away from you you know what i mean that's (uh)
that's a wrap
we shall end this okay #mahirah# see you in the next one
alright one okay one two three kita press [eh]
one two three

i don't know if i got tell you before like i keep forgetting i think i told i told or some shit but like me me and this girl right we met in (um)
madrasah [lah] like i think primary two but she was like one year older than us so like is in the same class but she's just one year older then her abang also inside and her abang is like
okay we're like two thousand right she's ninety nine
then like i think her brothers like ninety eight i think but then we are all in the same class so i'm just like so confused like like i ask her like why are you older but in my class then she say [oh] cause like
my parents register late now i didn't know madrasah like if you register late they will put you in primary one so like you can be old and be like in primary one also
then
then i knew
i also don't know [sia] but like that madrasah doesn't exist anymore so like
i don't know
it was like long long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years
but we were in the same class
ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
naik
this is at the you know masjid #ghufran#
the in #tampines#
it's in #tampines# the masjid in #tampines#
ya then after that
then my mom found out like
[oh] (um) this girl her name is
mum is actually
my mum's j_c friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like
friends
ya so like me and we like
grow up together [lah] like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so i was like primary two primary three
[eh] ya ya something like that
ya
ya but they weren't like very close so it's like i think you know [eh] it's like (um)
if me and
[oh] it's like if you and (err)
how to say [ah]
[ah] it's like you and like
(uh) got kids and then your your kids and kids
like become friends
and then like you become closer to
no no no but they're closer than that
i don't know [sia] okay like i give up explaining but like whatever yeah they're like quite close [lah]
then [ah] like you and the other your class punya
yeah so
ya ya ya ya ya then after that
[oh] my god i miss her ya okay anyway then after that right
stop laughing then after that
then (um) so like
we grow up together [lah] from like primary school madrasah then after that we go to like you know like like (um)
they have like the #macam# kids alive teens alive tweens alive
kau tak pergi madrasah [eh]
kau tak pergi madrasah
[oh] my god you andalus child [oh] my god okay so like okay let me explain [ah] like when you go to madrasah right like at at a masjid
they used to have like madrasahs
like
let's say okay let's say you go to a madrasah in (um) masjid right like dulu dulu punya format [kan] is like madrasah #macam#
(err) it's like literal school but just madrasah like you got exam and then like got report card semua then like they band
ya ya okay so basically it's like an andalus [lah] then then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session [lah] yah so like
i think
i think like
the first few years was
(um)
like afternoon session or whatever [lah] that's how i know like that's how i know a lot of people in the in the #tampines# area who are like malays cause like i go to like this masjid punya madrasah and then like
cause you mix class every time [what] so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
(err) the primary school like when i was in primary school right they created this #macam# new syllabus abeh like is everything #macam# in english [ah] english [ah] then like #macam# tak ada exams everything is for like
(uh) you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand malay or anything
ya is yeah yeah so cause dia dia nak #macam# like
(um) integrated society or whatever so they so they like abolished they abolished the madrasah the madrasah punya system so there's no more like exam or anything cause we actually had a chinese girl in our class
and then like she kesian [sia] all the textbooks all in malay abeh dia tak faham like she was just like so confused and the only thing she could can understand ya the only thing she can understand is the arab cause like
the teacher teach in arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in english and the textbook is in arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows chinese
apa kau okay maybe cause like he learn cause like n_s what then n_s
like s_c_d_f banyak melayu [kan] but then i don't know [lah]
yeah
you know that time we go to his house for raya right then his nenek ask siapa tu then after that he just shake shake he just like !huh! he just like shake his (um)
like shoulders then i ask you understand malay [meh] then he said
(err) i don't know [lah] but i just anyhow just give her response then she just [oh] okay then i'm just like how you speak to your grandmother like that then then after that he say [oh] [ah] usually when i go to my grandma's house right she will give me food then i'm just like (um) sedap sedap sedap
yeah it's basically ya food related
i don't know i don't even know if he knows lawa
but he listens to malay songs now
tak faham [sia] aku tak aku pun tak faham bro just don't ask me
okay so so this girl right okay the chinese girl is named then this girl she
(um)
she did she got transferred out like after primary three she tahan from primary one all the way to primary three bro then after primary three right when they introduced the alive thing then she transferred to alive so there's like kids alive tweens alive teens alive then youth alive so it's like technically like
(um)
kindergarten then primary school then secondary school all the way until like you finished poly or whatever [lah] then
then after we finish our madrasah
then me and went to
teens alive
[eh]
is it teens alive [oh] ya ya ya secondary school is teens alive ya then we go to teens alive right together with her brother and then like coincidentally
(err) her mum said [oh] i put her in the sunday class cause like confirm secondary school saturday nak kena balik sekolah punya so i just put her in sunday so she can go on sunday then my mum was like yeah yeah i put her in sunday also so like we just ended up sticking through like four plus
two

ya she was like
[eh] ni blah blah blah blah mat
(um) mat selenger blah blah blah blah blah
ya then after that everything then like [oh] my gosh then she told me this like funny story also
like when they were dating right like he wanted to watch a movie like they wanted to go watch a movie after school then like he took a bus
from his house woodlands i think all the way to
s_r kat mana [ah] #serangoon# [ah]
[ah] then he took a bus to like kat luar s_r_j_c [lah]
then he said [dah] [dah] [lah] he lambat for one hour you know
and then like he say he nak terberak
then she say how about you go berak first then you meet me then he say tak nak tak nak tak nak cause like nanti lambat then she just like (uh) okay then he ask
so ya then after that he say
(uh) your school punya toilet boleh masuk tak cause like he want to berak kat dia punya sekolah then i'm just like
berak kat kedai kopi [jer] [lah]
[kan]
ya so like the funniest the funniest thing is right he like
the the funniest thing right he keep begging and begging and begging her to let him go inside the school to berak like as if like she's a security guard or something then after that he dude he terkencit kat dalam his seluar bro
yeah
(mm)

uh-huh
[oh] my god ya you know (um)
[ah] ru~ nya adik [kan] i think like when we were in j_c nya adik was like dating someone who's like
much much older i think she was like i think

and then
and then like (err)
they they started a joint bank account cause like nak kahwin
[a'ah]

bank accounts cause we know we're gonna get married and that one is like the money for them to use like #macam#
no then they broke up
dude like they didn't even last like more than one year i don't even understand
like he halfway masuk jail
then abeh like so like while wait so like i think like half of the relationship right was her waiting for him to keluar jail abeh [dah] nak [dah] nak
[dah] nak [dah] nak like almost one more month before he nak masuk
he nak he nak keluar then she broke up with him over like this like #macam# you know the letter they write to like prisoners ya then she wrote letter to him
and then say like [oh] (err) i'm breaking up with you cause like (um) i met someone else then i just like the
the fuck

is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
really
[oh] i don't like to work from home especially
ya so i work from home for macam
about one month
then i feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why i rather work kat
i rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different [lah]
ya
how long how long
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what i don't even do in my room you know i do at the living room
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
that's why i tadi i ask you to take a picture of your your work~ working setting
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah i will just like duduk depan depan t_v then my laptop
then my drink then how con~ how how is that
effective ya
(mm) it's not at all also
ya ke
[oh] my god and the
and he he is used to that
[oh] make the home macam office like that [ah]
[oh] then what your wifi around your houses [eh] around your houses around the house macam good [ah]
(mm)
and your room
[oh] okay
ya [lah] then how you do your work [seh] macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai zoo~ pakai pakai apa microsoft or
or
ya the google hangouts you they you never break out [meh] macam never lag or what
[orh]
(mm) okay so the experience is quite
okay [lah] for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
ya so now buat apa
back to school already right
[oh]
[oh] one more month !wow!
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
!wow! you got
two months of holiday [ah] not bad [ah] you
(mm)
[oh] you've been working part time kerja apa [eh] cause i saw on your instagram you work night shift all
(uh huh)
like what
why
but you are still working [what] okay [lah] tu means you [dah] survive sikit
spent too much on what
[oh] how much you earn [ah] that that that job
(mm)
hundred per
[oh]
ninety nine
per night
!wow!
okay
kerja apa why you never explain
[oh] pack apa
makeup stuff
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga [kan]
[orh]
kerja kat mana kat warehouse [eh]
#tampines#
!huh! then how you travel [seh]
ibu cik nya rumah
i~ #yishun# correct [orh] so you got straight bus there [lah]
technically [lah] a bit [lah]
lama
compared to staying at hou~ [ah] compared to where you are now until
(uh) at ibu cik house [lah] the difference right
(mm) okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience [what] you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
one week and then you cannot tahan
(uh)
it's just too fast paced [ah] macam (mm)
ya one day berapa
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two k [lah]
(mm)
!wow! not bad [ah] you q_c
do you know you know in cause i did packing job also but the best
(uh) the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the f~ in the emtire human line
if you are at the first first person [ah] then paling senang
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up [what]
[ah] [kan] so if you are the first person it's the easiest job [ah] but quality check a bit hard [ah]
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy [ah]
i did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
macam from
(err) we start at about nine [kan] then we need to
pack for [eh] no we start at about [oh] macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so i usually need to scoop the [ah] the rice is either you
(uh) scoop the kuah then after that you #kiap# the container then you
then total the whole day must i don't know what's the target [lah] but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
[ah] pack kat kitchen [ah] so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas [lah] then when you #kiap# the container then you also will #kiap# your finger [lah]
bla bla [lah] then lepas balik
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person [ah] so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
kat mana kat
the industrial area at #woodlands# there [lah]
(mm) so they needed manpower (uh) so they asked manpower from my company so so ya [lor]
(mm)
yup my current wor~ company [lah] so this this this the the the the workplace that i work for
i mean the the packing place yang i kerja is (um)
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them [lah] (mm)
(mm)
ya [lor] so that's why i whe~ when i ask you how how was your experience for the packing i understand [lah] what it means when you say fast paced
express gila [lah] especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat [seh]
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa [seh] kerja malam
[oh]
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience i mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can [lah]
no [ah] you will learn [one] usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
and the pay is quite good [lah]
three k [lah] three k for i don't know how many weeks of working [lah] so ya
ya so kerja apa
[oh]
kenapa
[oh]
so you what you
[oh] okay okay can
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
then kenapa you leave
[oh]
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest pa~ packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup [one]
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy [one]
you just sign up only
(mm) then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
[oh]
[oh] but night shift though
(mm)
okay then kerja ini kat mana
[oh] dekat [lah]
technically [ah] what time start
pukul sembilan eight thirty
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight a_m
so eight to eight (err) eight to eight [ah]
[oh]
okay [lor] can [lah] then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
(mm) i understand
how's you and andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
(mm) !ee! i ask you first how's you and andy
you've been closer right every time sekarang i always saw you and
you and andy on instastory
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
[oh] okay okay okay okay
[oh]
that's why you guys spend time together
(mm)
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when i see your instastory macam [eh]
andy andy andy but then got one time no andy at all
kenapa
apasal [seh]
[oh] i mean
[oh] gitu [eh] macam mata merah [ah] kirakan
like jealous ke like [oh] i have a boyfriend but you don't like (err)
[oh]
but you always prioritize your work from what i see also
you i think you know how to balance so they have no say
ya ya ya it's how but good thing andy faham [lah] that's the thing
understand each other
meet tapi masih berbual [kan]
like on whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
good [lah] good [lah]
(mm)
not talk
(mm)
well good [lah] good [lah] at least
in in this relationship the two of you
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
bagus [ah]
ya how long already [ah]
what
three years
not bad [ah] three years [ah] this is this the longest
(mm)
i actually forgot who is he but ya i understand
okay i cannot recall
i okay okay i think i remember i think i remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay [lah] actually i don't know if you realise anything on my instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you li~ like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya [lah] because his side he don't make it he don't
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
(uh) his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya (mm)
ya so sometimes when i see you and andy i'm like !hais! [eh] cause at least sometimes andy will show about you then you will show about andy that kind of thing
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
(err) me and him are dealing shitty stuff now [lah] so ya
together and individually so macam okay [ah] let's say [ah] so [ah] cause sekarang dia [dah] o_r_d right
do you know what he's working now
(mm) you have no idea you never follow him on instagram [ah]
[oh]
[oh] that recent stories dia tak appear [lah] that kind of thing okay okay
cause [ah] dia sekarang work as financial adviser
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya insuran~ so he's an insurance agent
so under a_i_a but (uh) under a_i_a there's a sister company called
m_f_a_g
so (err) basically how to plan your financi~ how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
(mm) so okay [lah]
(uh) you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat [ah] itu [jer]
[ah] so so he invest i mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified f_a
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start s~ selling insurance or any plans
(mm) so that is his career so his career now [kan] dia [ah] dia
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people [kan]
ya so you will meet new people of many age~ of different ages (uh) different character
(uh) gender and everything else so macam
okay [lah] i get his point where i get where he's coming from
so (um)
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
i
kita is fourth we're this october we're coming the fourth year already
fourth year in the relationship
ya ya so [ah] so macam macam mana [eh]
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his n_s pun pernah happen i don't know [eh]
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
okay so okay [ah] now i explain to you what happen
so (uh) basically dia dia bilang me ha~ hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me [ah] [oh] (um)
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu i thought
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like (uh) means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing i thought that was it you know
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling (err) bad
get it so means [ah] means [ah] like for example i'm hans and
you are the first the new person that i met right
then i don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about #lina# that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so i told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his n_s
his n_s dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for s_a_f
[ah] so that is the first time it happened
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
!wow! macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay [lah] sakit hati tu sakit hati [lah] tapi at least
[ah] it d~
saki~ it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
ya but that someone that v_c lady dia macam
not interested [lah] because that v_c girl also have a boyfriend
vol~
no v_c is (err) volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for s_a_f
[ah]
so
okay so when it first happened i take it like okay never mind
okay i do have my emotional (uh) breakdown [ah] i mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his n_s
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my me~ no [ah] like
memang dia o~ they know each other on phone i mean they know their phone numbers so
hans until talk to her on the whatsapp [lah] like
like made a move [lah] macam message [lah] message the perempuan nak nak know better
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating [lah] but but but but
i don't i don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay i let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct [a'ah]
so during n_s is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
kelakar [kan]
[kan] (uh)
ya
this is what i'm trying to say [lah] don't know why until i hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good [lah] macam macam he he he he tell me things like (err) i want to explore he don't want to feel
like limited talking to new people
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
jumpa orang baru
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
betul [lah] ya [lah] professional that part it is [lah] but at the same time dia nak
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is (um)
(err) way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the yo~ he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say [ah] this is me [ah] this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
i said that thing tu juga i said macam i ca~ i say to him [ah] i also can say the same thing to you [what] but i choose to focus what is in front of me
i said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
faham tak
let's say if i leave like for example
if i leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit [lah]
so ya !hais!
no i don't know because
from the start of the relationship i got even i pernah bilang you [what] bila kita nak
together remember we had this night calls
i tell you that hans really want this relationship to to end up (uh) like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why i'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me [ah] if you ask me now why are you still with him
then i i then i will reply you i also don't know
so ya [lah]
like that's why when you things like (uh) on twitter will say this and that right you w~ you wait sometimes you need to leave you mu~ you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
[ah] i've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know [lah]
boleh [lah] i mean you nak comment pun comment [lah] because honestly
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with li~ like endless
ya so so macam
that's why i was i was quite impressed with how you andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but i cannot do on my own thing because i'm already
i've already so called shaped my life around him get it
macam okay
macam dependent [lah]
not exactly [lah]
bukan macam okay so
i don't see
i don't see other things i don't see other parts of my life without him get it
ya [ah] so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
is i don't have my own like self goal
okay
i got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
it's stupid [lah] tapi macam
yes sure up to you s~ you can go ahead and share
(mm)
(mm)
but you you do try to recover after that right
(mmhmm)
(mm) ma~ [ah] that's the word make up
(mm)
ya [lah] faham [lah]
ya [lah]
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
[kan]
dia belum n_s [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] faham [lah] but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
(mm) (mm)
with him
(mm) at least at least a goal with him [kan]
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
get it macam
we like i say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like (err) am i getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe i don't know but
for me now with han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
ya so now i'm just like
(uh) like that ya so
i'm taking day by day but really i feel that at the end of the day maybe
i don't know [lah] i really don't know i don't know whether kita are compatible or what already [lah] because dia memang [dah] ada other mindset juga
i
everyt~
met his parents
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no [lah] because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of hans
han~ his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time hans' father also said don't make her just like a
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu th~ but the (uh)
!haiya! ya [lah] the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether i'm hurt and stuff
it has been weeks already [ah] so if i cry now also macam
it's just tears [eh] macam really legit [sia] so macam ya [lah]
so well i'm just updati~ updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no hans already now you understand [lah]
tak apa (uh) it's okay not to make assumption [ah] but
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
my my type my type right
my type right is if i break up with somebody i want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
(mm) [eh]
like
[kan] [kan] s~ so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him o~ with him right
(mm)
ya so but this thing is special case as~ i told hans the same thing if i ever break up with you i will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree [ah] dia cakap
di~ (uh) (hmm) no he i don't know dia cakap (um) why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just (um) be friends
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if i cut ties it means i have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's hans i might
i might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu (mm)
so far so far during this period right
where (uh) like
i (mm) only just now i met him [lah] after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then i asked ada siapa ad~ kalau ada hans i say to them i tak nak join
(mm)
so ya i'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that i've shared there's no bad guy
in this story [lah] okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because i i'm getting hurt
for no reason i could actually just leave
ya i could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants i can i can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is i choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see i am aware [sia] ch~
(err) like i don't know a week ago maybe
(mm) tapi ya ini susah [ah] susah
he's
i know i understand
!hais!
!hais!
no
i want to tell but i don't know how to tell i want to tell also but i don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
i i hint only [lah] i hint to my mother only [lah]
macam
she she sense it [lah] so macam (mm)
i don't like to tell cause i just don't want to (uh)
the group of friends yang i bilang pun macam
i think i tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why i'm feeling like this during work time so ya [loh]
so this issue macam i really tak nak bilang orang but
on my instagram i think people can like [oh] okay hans and #lina# is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
(mm)
ya tak [lah] i think pasal i'm just too macam
too f~
i have fallen for him too hard that (uh) now i cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
i still stick i can say that i'm quite a loyal person [lah] but
ya [ah] so ya [dah] itu [jer] [lah]
that's my that's that's what i'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my instastory and more to green colour right
[ah] it's just me expressing my emotions
(mm) and and now i'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
!huh!
ya it affect
kadang kadang [seh] dalam kerja so macam if i don't have any ideas right like for example if i zone out [ah]
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in i need to talk to that guy then when i need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me [kan] [ah] what time you sleep and stuff right
when it first happened i've been going home late from work
so i left work i left office at about twelve
twelve a_m tahu
sometimes i habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu i'll just hang out talk i just like (err) but sometimes i have zoom meetings so macam
okay i do zoom meetings at at the office then i just chill then wait a bit more then i baru balik that kind of thing then once i go home
i'll just knockout [ah] so knockout about maybe sometimes if i decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him i'll sleep like i'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but i sleep as late as three but the next day i have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing [lah]
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
tidur pukul tiga bangun pukul lapan
then
then it affected my work in terms of productivity [lah] i lupa benda i forget things i forgot what to do and shit
and i really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so (um)
so ya but i'm catching up on my sleep already [lah] so that is good enough
(hmm) ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand [lah]
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya i think i don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
[ah] your rumah macam tukar hari hari [seh]
ya ya ya ya
then ra~ ray~ before raya i think i went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
ya your kitchen got the vine right i saw your instastory what
cree~ busy [seh]
it's only your room tak involved [lah]
ya i can see that
but at least you got a working space [seh] that is good that's what i need [eh]
but the thing is i don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya (mm) me an~ me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
we just need a different type of (um) router ya
because this wifi sucks you okay for example [ah] kalau sekarang you co~ go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
ya
[kan] that's why i rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
i always do outside kalau tak i'll just do at other places
(mm)
ya means we need an addi~ additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the t_v
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
how many wifi you have at home
[oh] you have two
one is at
(mm) so you are connected to your
parents' [one]
(mm) patutlah boleh [lah] gitu ya then i need to pasang one more [loh]
(mm)
ya
tak ada [lah] but
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know i
i now conduct workshops via zoom
(mm)
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy [kan] no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got zoom meeting zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
like on the same track check in apa task you buat [ah]
macam gitu [lah] penat [seh] so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay i tell you now [ah]
(err)
mo~ i and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one (err) some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at m_s_f to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
(mm)
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
[ah]
(uh)
(mmhmm)
macam gitu [lah] ya ya ya correct correct ya
no jus~ just now [one] is because i had to do a trai~ a mini training for this up~ [ah] tomorrow's training
ya
(err) at pukul sepuluh no worry [lah] can can
ya so ya [lor]
then anyways so i am starting a~ another job again cause i was just
i was like quite happy that i i'm out of the community club
then on tuesday i am back i'm going to m_s_f
[ah] ya is to i'm going to do some homeless job you know as in (err)
(err) inspe~ macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless [ah] i don't know [lah] apa [lah]
merepek gila [ah] because i mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
pay to maintain the mon~ the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just covid things [ah] it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
(uh)
(mm)
[oh] so you your pay macam mana bila internship
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
!huh!
your i_t_e is
!wow! ya it's just it's just poly things poly memang
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why i never ex~ like you get to experience i_t_e internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
is it tak tahu [lah] sekali five hundred juga [eh]
as an intern
it's okay [lah] you already pass through the (err) internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
[ah] then go ahead bro ambil [jer]
being what broke [oh] you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go
september ap~
ya you're graduating april right
ya then after that you can decide bila you nak continue degree or
ya
or you can take a year break and work then go and study or you can study part time and work up to you
you're you're the type yang boleh belajar [what] i'm not so
it's your choice
(mm)
but what degree you want to take same similar or
similar as your the things you are doing now or
or you want to try something new
business [ah]
(mm) explore your options ya
ya [eh] not bad [seh] you went through like different certificates [seh]

me
no need [lah] [ah] no~ now i'm like thinking nak ambil h_r ke tak [ah] tapi tak apa [lah] no need [ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] that is because they have the knowledge
they don't just like assume [oh] i am from h_r
then they treat you like shit ya
ya i'm thinking of that [lah] but tengok [ah]
i got no motivation so ya
okay
[oh] [eh] [eh] (err)

talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
by fifteen minutes and today i decided to wake up earlier so i won't be late
but dia datang lambat
ya he started fifteen minutes later [what]
(uh huh) because some people actually know how to be on time you know

i take a like you know those people keep taking the aesthetic boomerangs so i try to i try to be aesthetic as possible but i'm just
cannot make it [lah] cause it's just me
and then he will !wah! tempat ni kat mana [seh]

he said it in malay and then
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
his the way he converse in in malay is okay [lah] but it's quite limited
but i don't know why he suddenly replied in malay but (uh) (um)

(err) he like he usually he will start off the conversation by talking about school
so dia macam tanya [eh] this week intern apa [eh] this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
[oh] and then (err) i will reply [ah] this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern

tak tak tak (uh) this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after

if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive [kan]
dia tahu [pe] aku ada mata air so why would he even try
i told no i didn't tell you i was overthinking about it
and then my my replies to him
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly i am the most boring person in the world and i aku tak suka social interaction
what
when when do you even reply or message me on instagram there is like the no
no no you only always reply if i message something inside the instagram [ah] direct message group with #jannah# and all that
kalau if
[ha] i don't want to talk about this anyways back to the story back to the point

then he said !alah! university kalau university pun (uh) he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it !ee!
k k kau suka dia
no i i have a resting mingles face you know
tapi but we are the same height [what]
okay okay okay let let's not talk about this let's not talk about this it's a very sensitive topic okay
[ah] ya ya can you please tell me what happened i want to know nak tahu
notice apa why [ah] why [leh]
ya ya you don't have much friends
what what
!huh! siapa yang reject kau [sia] i mean you're like damn pretty
okay i want to know what happen
you went on a date with someone and i didn't even know
aku feel so betrayed
it was just an outing sure [lah]
(uh) west siders what is it with you guys
jauh [pe] orchard is so far
kena~ kenapa dia block you babe
maybe it's the jokes that you told him
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
or is it had no [ah] there was very no offence stupid
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
ya
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau [dah] nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
i think i think you kau ada cakap telegram [oh]
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
it is what it is
ya
actually [ah] i have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together [lah] so sejak kecil until besar
tapi [kan] the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
[eh] no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what i notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so i think it's like secucuk for you [lah]
no but you like you like guys who are older what you don't like guys who are younger than you right
adik-adik ya stop it [sia]
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then i know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu [ah] yang i can recommend to you
no i i told you [what] he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like i kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so (mm)
(mm)
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
i don't know
(um)
ya i faham i faham
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
but that kind of person susah nak cari [seh] because like nowadays guys are just
the most meanest guys are like very very mean and like the most nicest guys are like too nice
bye bye and (uh huh)
he's more on the mean side but there's like
no he's only mean to other people
i don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
(hmm) i know actually now right is actually so hard to find a partner that is truly down to earth for you and really down
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
act~ actually (uh) after the truth or dare game right i thought dia
tak suka aku because like i feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
that's what i felt ya because that time when you know after that they ordered mac right
and [ah] i wanted a straw or something so i said [oh] !alah! can you pass me a straw i don't know why he like he just ignored me
then i am like wasn't the tak [oh] is he not at me
ya [lah] tu
she loves loves me
!huh! i don't think it was love yet because at that point of time i think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia [seh] ya
ya and then [ah] he was actually low key hoping to get back with his ex but then his ex was just like [eh] i don't know
ya
yes yes there was the story then [ah] you know then after that i teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch [lah] and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh i think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then [ah] kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then [eh] his ex nampak [lah] then
(err) his ex message him and ask i thought i thought there was still something between us
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up [lah]
exactly
like
exactly there is my point that is what i mean
but
ya ya
[ah] aku just tak suka when like (uh) apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan i mean just make it clear [lah] that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
what
it's not just
how will wait so the guy is gay
[orh] okay okay [dah]
for years
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air [sia]
i mean i don't know that guy
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because i don't even know who he is so
(mm)
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
[oh]
(um)
ya
like kau orang are just platonic friends [lah]
the mata air dia just have issues [lah] i think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan #yasmin#
ya
i don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look [ah] the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah [lah]
speaking of the office you know my sister [ah] i told my kakak about (uh) all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
maybe (err) your boss should hire a cameraman and then like cameramen will like every time when there is a fight in the office
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then (uh) dia akan (uh) bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should (err) the office two point o
ya
well anyways i didn't tell you about one of the main drama in my intern office
so basically [kan] [ah] logistics and accounts just cannot get along for some freaking reason and then
aku is the middleman because i'm the intern and i'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then so i have to be the middleman so for finance i have to scan (err) purchase order and invoices
and then after i no i will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
[ah] after i scan and then i will pass to the finance person [lah] and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku [seh] this one you pass back to (err) si logistics dulu then i'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau [pe]
(mm) it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
(mmhmm)
(um) i i get what you mean though because macam [oh] at n_u_s
speaking of work also you not because of the covid kita kena work from home
so i have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja i will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and plus i'm still new to the system
and then [oh] and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
(mm) i mean [ah] almost hari-hari [kan] my boss will tanya everyone [oh] what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty a_m sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
[ah] my office hours is nine thirty to six thirty
[ah] you end earlier [what]
about one hour
lima belas minit
ya
from
(um) #kim# #yam# road nak pergi #sengkang# okay [lah] and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit [oh] my goodness
so tiring
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so !huh!
what topic though
j j
[oh]
#jannah#
!wah! so jangan [lah]
is it #jannah# dari mata air
kau tak [eh]
who who who do you have in mind to be #jannah# mata air
but
honestly i cannot wait until #jannah# kahwin though because like
i will feel so happy for her macam yes
i know right
any guy yang dapat #jannah# is a very very lucky guy
is it
no because you kau tahu [pe] i don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
!hey! what do you mean by that
no my cousins
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like i don't think #jannah# will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have [ah] girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and i knew #jannah# tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
so like scrap that
it has this is a very hard thing to do
[kan] saya ni like #shaza# really shaza pula jap i mean you deserve the best also but #jannah# also like deserves the best
why (ugh)
we
we all deserve the best
feminism and empowerment [oh] my god speaking of empowerment do you hear about the u_s elections
it's so merepek
did you know did you know that kanye west is really running for president
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
ya
you know actually actually [ah] u_s should take notes from singapore and make voting
a compulsory thing and not give them a choice because that i see
orang dekat u_s dia orang like [oh] have you registered to vote
i mean you have a choice to register or not
ya but
to get whether you get involved or not in politics
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
so like
you get what i mean right
yes
[oh]

woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers

ya call for equity
ya cause it's like
no no no no not not financial management it's (uh)
macam
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time [ah] seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence [ah] this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
these (uh) but this other person cannot see so if you give both of them
ya actually i know
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind

it's the same [ah] the makan all like sama the menu and everything all
[a'ah]

i think normal platter like say chicken chop [ah] only four fifty or what
with two sides
(uh)
what's that chicken chop
(mm)
(uh)
tapi
ya ya ya that's the thing about school (um) food i feel even if the price they say not say
(um) cheap or what right my portion is like still worth way more worth than what you are getting outside
[oh] it's too much [ah]
(mm)
no no they don't
ya ya ya
this is where kat koufu
[oh] sebelah japanese shop that [one] [ah]
[oh] okay i think i know i know but i never eat never tried it
[oh]

[ha] play [ah] more you can play more pub games [ah] i feel bots like no point [ah]
because all the toxic (uh) opponents or teammates right
it's because your op~ team is terrible that's why you feel like opponent is good
sometimes serious [ah] especially the filipinos and the pinoys in dota !wah!
damn toxic man they like i don't know what they doing most of the time
then they will just start blaming you all these kind stuff but entertainment also [ah]
[eh] walls aku merepek [sia] like try to download all sampai sekarang tak boleh pun

[ah]
ya ya ya
that's a like chakra
(uh huh)

(uh huh)
[orh] so like leceh [ah]
[ah]
then after that you got to wait until the thing will recharge or what you gotta hunt for the reason the resin
[oh] i see i see
but like
ya ya
so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
(mm)
ya right right right
the best so far
one of [ah]
[ah] better than runescape
[ah]
ya confirm laze [ah] after a while
ya ya
maybe [lah] perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but i think they earning a lot [sia] this game it's like available on all platform except like console [lah]
console also ada
!wah! gila that means like it's quite a lot [ah] this
you can whale on #genshin# also
(uh huh)
!huh! !wah! this crazy [ah]

so you think this [one] more
you know money intensive or maple
[ah]
do you even spent money on games
[oh] tapi m_l punya skin is like one-time kind of thing right like you purchased once then you can use all the way
[orh] okay ya okay makes sense
(uh) berapa yang
[orh]
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
[oh]
ya ya ya
[eh] semalam you tengok bola the #bayern# dengan #atletico-madrid# game
[oh] why [eh]
how i know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
but the game gerek [ah] the game
#bayern# very sick
ya ya okay
ya i know stop back forth back forth [ah]
(hmm) ya each to its own [ah]
esok buat apa
[ha] when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
!fuh!
when's the last time when's the last time you went
[ah]
berapa lama [eh] kena book in advance
[oh] so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
(err) they you know kasi chance (uh) to (uh) other people [ah]
cause your name busuk already bin masli</p1> banned
and then esok tak ada apa-apa teman me [ah] pergi tengok kro~ (uh) what's this kerusi
[eh] rasa
can [ah] try try
you know the apol chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like secret lab then royale ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then apol
ya here it quite prominent [ah] and like
they really build up their name [eh] you know like
those dota players e_a players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) secret lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands i would say
pricing mahal secret lab paling murah four nine nine [sia]
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise i mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality p_u leather like they add in all the other i don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why i'm deciding [eh] i want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the secret lab chair
than [eh] apol is three nine eight
ya
similar tapi (uh) apa ni secret lab ada five years warranty apol dua year [jer]
so i'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya ya
no [ah] it's like covered a few stuff like you know (um) for secret lab they have this tear protection thing so where like if the material kalau terkoyak-koyak [kan] kopek-kopek then after that
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
tu [ah]
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
i
tapi air tumpah tak damage apa you can just straightaway lap the thing then the water is gone already
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is it is
ya
tu
ya aku nampak i saw that [one] basuh the lantai then all the stains all just come out right
that's true [ah] coke like damn sweet [eh] i i'm not a fan of coke [ah] it's too sweet for me
[ah]

(mm) seasons the blue colour [one] right
hijau [eh]
that's the green tea ice lemon tea [eh] is it
ya that [one] not bad because dia punya ice lemon tea flavour in that tak tak as strong [ah]
sugar
ya
ya i agree i agree
[eh] wait seasons
[oh] i think i got i think i never try seasons (uh) peach tea before [eh]
[oh] no i don't think so [eh] the i can't recall
maybe [ah]
[eh] so bila nak beli ni table tennis punya racket paddle
(mm)
(uh)
!alamak! pergi club room [ah] you cukai the paddles
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
[oh] like as in you just lepak tak belajar this kind of stuff
because you got the mindset [lah] like you know there's a
relax corner in school
potong kaki [ah]
ya
ya true true
(uh)
i also finding [ah] i want find like (uh) you know like stable kind of part-time
tapi cafe
ya exactly cafe semua gaji like they don't pay you that well then at most kurang-kurang
and nine dollars [ah] if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want f&b you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time i told you marche
then like a bit more established kind of (um) eatery
but banquet malas [sia] bro banquet kerja lama kena diri then like it's not my thing [ah]

ya ya #sheikh# ya okay i tell you about banquet the #sheikh# and this another friend [kan] dorang kerja banquet lepak [lah] because dorang dah kerja lama so they got a lot of seniority
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so this #sheikh# and the my this friend right step manager dorang tak buat kerja just like manage them tell them what to do then lepak so basically for like let's say maybe ten hours of work right they only do
dua dua jam tiga jam
tapi dapat gaji for the whole thing then they just lepak makan
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already [ah] that's why

it's like what's the valorant

okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like pubg but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
i plan to but then tengok [ah] dulu need to work [ah] then like don't have much time to play games this [one] now dota also i don't really play that much
ya
p_s five i don't know [ah] i never see since the pre-order part
i think no [ah] like they still publish [ah] it's just that it's out of stock on the main (uh) website if i'm not mistaken
gila gila [kan] right
pasal kau dulu budak-budak town east [kan] p_s one p_s two
[ah] but you don't actually own you didn't own one right
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
[oh] i understand they control with the time guard [ah] ada time limit all these
ya
ya ya funny [ah]
!fuh!

i see
but all the while you did well not
above average [ah]

[orh]
yang gemuk punya [kan] bukan yang slim
[eh] don't terasa [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] wasted
okay [ah] p_s_p was short-lived also [ah]
it
it's good good actually i quite surprised the thing (err) like just die down like i thought it will be a continuation but
i think p_s and
say again
ya no it's because the sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that [ah] p_s_p vita
[ah] vita vita
p_s vita that that
part of i mean that that series was like the downfall i feel
then just nice d_s came up also then people just i don't know actually i quite surprised why d_s became popular
because of like pokemon and what
tapi macam tak necessary [kan] dia punya touch screen and all
i think
(mm) i think the main appeal is just because d_s can support the
(uh) what's pokemon games people literally buy d_s just to play pokemon games
ya even switch also switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya i don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
macam minecraft [ah]
but it looks like minecraft is just i don't feel appealed in playing the minecraft kind of games
ya ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick sick
or is it just to garner the support of like i don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad
that's why every single move they made it's all got (uh) impact they want to achieve you know
!duh!
(uh) not !duh! [lah] but like possible
fortnite aha bro [eh] you never play fortnite [ah]

no plasma it's plasma something [ah] i forgot what's the full name tapi the game play macam
this you (uh) you and your friends are like ghosts investigators or something
then korang (uh) kat korang trapped in a room [kan] then after that kena cari clues on how to solve a crime or something like that
then like ghosts will just appear all that kind of stuff

just
in school
one very funny fellow [ah]
ya
then look at him now [ah]
family man
!hais! time pass by so fast [sia]
today
nothing much [ah] i tadi cause i got sekolah [what]
so it's just school from home [ah] h_b_l sekarang
so
in the morning i just stay at home
just listen to lecture
pay attention sikit sikit
then
after that i stay home [ah] the rest of the day
lazy [ah] but nothing to do [ah]
i want find job [eh]
part time [ah] now still schooling [what]
but then cause my fridays free [ah] so i got nothing to do i thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
but then
malas pun ada
i don't know [ah]
[eh] i wish [ah] can go back there
kat sana kerja dah pu~ punya [lah] senang
thirty
tapi
like
it's legit [seh] it's like you never do guard duty before right
a
like when i do there is like [leh] really i work for two hours then i rest for four hours
but then my rest also dorang bayar
then
but then s~ s~ dorang tak nak ambil cause i still schooling [ah] then they say like apa ni
they want people that can commit more days
means
ya
but actually last sem
aku actually boleh kerja [sia]
cause last sem last semester is everything was h_b_l
so i can h_b_l while i was working cause it's four hours rest [what]
then gitu duit masuk so senang [ah] but then wasted [lah] i never think of it [lah]
#al-ameen#
i not sure [seh] i think around
i think until two a_m three a_m like that [ah]
if i not wrong [ah]
ya
dah lama [ah] tak makan sana because like
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy [ah]
diam sudah no [ah] i mean like
if if i'm not exercising already all the more i shouldn't eat there [what] correct or not
ya diet [ah] if cannot cannot exercise then diet [ah]
but i think i want to start back soon [ah] exercising
but hijrah barang lama [ah] now the people there all
extreme [ah]
he he he
#faiz# #faiz# lagi extreme no i think #faiz# is like the epitome of extreme you know
(mmhmm)
but then i don't know [leh] like i feel like
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if i go gym all [ah]
(uh) since i got the height already right
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya [ah]
ya but
the effort [ah] and like
i don't know [eh] i feel like going gym
but gym just very intimidating [ah] like aku rasa macam
seram [ah] like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
okay
tak tapi
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
like
i don't know [ah] like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
but like if you see orang gemuk [kan] orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua [pe]
so but that stigma also like
i don't know [ah] later people kat gym tengok like [eh] try hard [pe] this guy
a bit
a bit #paiseh# [ah]
but i feel like if i don't start like
forever [sia] macam gini
[eh] you know i i looked through my gallery right
like
last time during n_s
i skinny [sia]
okay
not not not skinny [ah] i'm i was skinnier
like i was still big but like
at least i looked proportionate [ah] like don't look so bulat
i think hundred and four [ah] (uh) last time i checked was hundred and two
then these days i want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery [ah] for the
weighing scale
so now
i just take as my weight still at hundred and two [ah]
i don't know [eh] my
cause since after n_s right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five [ah]
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
no not really after b_m_t [ah] after b_m_t still got a lot of outfields semua [pe] so we still keluar banyak-banyak
so
not say maintain [lah] but (uh) after b_m_t can order in already [what] so i always buy #nasi-lemak#
makan banyak [ah] cause of
ya
then it's cause of n_s [ah] always order in asyik beli [jer] then sekali
like before i know [ah] like towards the end of n_s [ah]
dah getting rounder [ah]
cause army [kan] army the the longer
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
the superiors all will be [ah]
ya
so towards the end is like every week
i eat #nasi-lemak# i eat fatty bom bom
[eh] fat~
fatty bom bom free [ah] i want to eat [ah]
[eh]
watch your language man
woodlands have at #marsiling#
no no no no no no it's (uh) you know where #marsiling# m_r_t is
it's it's opposite #marsiling# m_r_t [ah] but not to the polyclinic side [tau]
you know you know #marsiling# got new shopping mall the where the police post is
rumah ella kat mana [eh] [oh] ya ya ya correct correct correct
(uh) (uh) rumah ella
kat belakang [ah]
towards the m_r_t tracks
like from rumah ella you walk to m_r_t tracks
then there's a coffee shop there [ah] fatty bom bom kat sana
[oh] ya ya ya
but what's the difference [seh]
[eh] it doesn't make sense [leh] i mean like okay like kau tahu (uh)
like fatboy's and fatpapas
that [one] is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
but then in this case like abang gemuk and fatty bom bom no difference [what] both halal already [what]
so like they tukar nama for what [sia]
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name [mah] it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know [ah]
but
that time also ada [ah]
so like like when i go #lia's# house senang [ah]
like if got feels for fatty bom bom [ah] it's just like
think like if we grab like twenty minutes sampai [ah]
no no no it's not at #afghan# there it's at
(uh) kau tahu #dunman# sec kat mana
ya it's opposite #dunman# sec [ah]
then #lia# my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
[ah] dekat [ah]
malas [pe] dah cakap malas nak exercise
like really like it's it's like
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
#yio-chu-kang# to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far [ah]
may half half the journey [ah] from #yio-chu-kang# to your house
ya but like macam
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
confirm malas [sia] nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars [ah]
the
(uh) #tampines# [one] not so bad [eh]
i know
usually me and #lia# buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
but that [one] tengok [ah] kalau
if only kalau ada discount [ah]
usually i get the
cajun cajun [eh] cajun cajun chicken [ah]
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
i think i prefer rice [ah] the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
(uh) then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that [lah]
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken [ah]
i never try abang gemuk before [ah] so cannot say [ah]
fatty bom bom or fatboy's
ya
depends [ah] some
you know some of the hawker centre [ah]
the western shop got like secondary school feels [ah]
#idah's# kitchen
i don't remember [sia]
is it the one the the thai shop take over [ah]
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
[oh] [oh] [oh]
i that [one] i thought that [one] is korean food [what]
[oh] i don't think i ate there before [ah]
now they got new [one] [ah] at koufu
but a bit mahal [ah] that day i eat it's like six ninety
that kind of price [ah]
(uh) the
the whole range [ah] like you know chicken chop (uh)
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff [ah]
tapi macam
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it [ah]
pasal dorang ba~ dorang bagi banyak [ah]
tak tapi even though the portion worth [kan] but i feel like it's like two people portion [ah]
macam
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
usually they give like half bowl like that right
but over there they give the full bowl [ah] then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
koufu you know where the (uh)
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
i think new [ah] the shop dulu takde [ah]
but i not too sure [ah] maybe
i don't really remember [ah] because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
japanese shop [kan]
[eh]
how [lah] i want to get better at dota [sia]
no [eh] but i play
i play public game like macam
always kena thrashed [ah]
it's like
if i get toxic opponent [eh] like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good [ah]
maybe [ah] maybe also
but i don't know [ah]
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental [lah]
i don't know [eh] like
i don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh [sia]
like
the #genshin# impact also cannot right
but okay [ah] nevermind [ah] because #genshin# like you can't really play with friends [ah] like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode [ah]
like it's more to like main sendiri
then you just explore the world yourself [ah]
then
apa
i mean like now i toned down i don't play as much anymore [ah]
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
like the call it resin
so
you know [ah] so like (uh) this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge [ah] like i think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by [lor] then it recharge slowly
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do [ah]
so it's mostly a waiting game [ah] like you finish
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu [ah]
i don't know [sia] i see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
l~ like like really the game play is
fantastic [ah] phenomenal
but
i would say [ah] m m_m_o_r_p_g i've play [ah] so far
tapi
better than runescape [ah] tapi
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
like kau kena tunggu [ah] resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
ya so it's more of a waiting game [ah] so like as much as i want to do a lot of things i cannot
i think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term [ah]
ya true [ah]
[oh]
console pun ada
p_s_four ada
ya like i saw on youtube got the whales [ah] they spent banyak [ah]
dude gila mam~ like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
they spent like
like empat ribu lima ribu
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
so it's like really luck based [ah] tengok [ah] your luck macam mana
i think maple [ah] cause this [one] is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me i never spend money but i'm still
quite far in the game already [ah]
like i i complete all the story mode already
pernah pernah [ah] m_l [ah] last time i buy the skin
ya ya ya it's like dota like that [ah]
so macam i bought their equivalent of the battle pass
i think i paid like lima belas [eh]
fifteen then
so i just complete the tale like until the max then i get the skill already
then after that i don't spend money already [ah] like
wasteful [ah] spend duit kat game
ya some more it's like
ada [ah] additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
like
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat [ah] like you need like
an advantage is advantage [ah] but like they make it minimal [lor]
so tak rasa sangat
(uh) (uh) kau macam tak you like don't know me like that [ah]
since when i even watch soccer
(hmm) sejak bila
sejak bila aku tengok bola
i don't know [ah] like
i never i've never seen the the
what's the word [eh] the
the attractiveness of watching soccer [ah] like it's just
so slow
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
[a'ah] tapi tapi bola macam
you wait pass pass pass i don't know [ah] maybe just not my thing [ah] i guess
diam sudah
[eh]
tomorrow tomorrow i got no school [ah]
like i book my solat jumaat tak dapat
dah lama [sia]
wanted to book [ah]
tapi tak dapat [ah]
(mm)
since the booking start i never i never kena dapat i think cause i always book late [ah]
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up [kan] then dah tak boleh
dah tak boleh dapat slot [ah]
i really not sure [sia]
i think the same week [ah] on monday i think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
i think now is five weeks [ah]
or four weeks i not sure
so like let's say i do today already right
[eh] i do tomorrow already
then (uh) aku tak leh buat for the next five weeks
[a'ah] so other people can get [ah] but some more aku selalu tak dapat [ah]
it
[eh] i think they blacklist me already
tak tahu [ah]
tak nak [ah]
tengok kerusi all
where you where you (uh) where you plan on getting
apol
(uh huh) i only know se~ i only know secret lab [ah]
(uh) and s~ streamers (uh) aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini [ah] secret lab [one]
but then the pricing [eh] similar [ah]
paling murah
asal mahal sangat [sia] it's just a chair right
like
tak [ah] tapi tapi even though
aku bayar banyak-banyak
but
i'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself [what] like it's not genuine leather right
it's p_u leather you know p_u leather actually murah [seh]
[ah]
tapi
tak tahu [ah]
(uh) five hundred dollars on a chair
kerusi
(uh huh)
i mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar [kan]
!huh!
worth it [ah] got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site [what]
sama [ah]
i mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
ada koyak sikit
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya i think this [one] must ask [ah] i think if
if really one for one exchange worth it [ah]
every other week
kau ambil pisau kau potong [seh] already
[oh] really [ah]
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but wh~
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah [kan] coke
like you know coke is very very corrosive right
that time that time siapa [eh] tunjuk aku (uh) i think
#achap# [ah] #achap# tunjuk aku the video
orang pakai coke
untuk cuci toilet
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya i also
i've never been a fan of fizzy drinks [ah] like even time hari raya [kan]
like
(uh) okay usually guest just [eh] (uh) tuan rumah dorang selalu just tuang [kan]
f&n [pe] f&n is like the standard [ah] the (mm)
my my nenek punya side more of coke [ah] so they got like
they got like a lot of coke
like one one what do you call that [eh] (uh) basket
not basket [ah] they got like one they got one but container full of coke
then another container is all just (uh) apa ni f&n
s~
ya hari raya
so if i go my nenek house
it's really just gassy drinks atau teh
so for me i'm more like ice lemon tea
like you know pokka ice lemon tea gitu
ya different
syrup also not a big fan [ah]
i think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established [ah]
like pokka seasons
seasons (uh) (uh) the ice lemon tea is the blue colour [one] but they got the
apa [eh] the other one yang [ah] the hijau [one] the hijau [one] sedap [ah]
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea [ah] but the blue colour [one] is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness [ah] ya the sugar
tak tapi the best [one] i think is the seasons peach tea
seasons peach tea but susah [ah] nak cari like everywhere i go like most most kedai tak jual [ah]
i don't know why
seasons not pokka
it confirm pernah it's the orange colour [one]
but sekarang susah nak cari i think they stopped production already [ah] i haven't i haven't seen it
for for a while already [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] (uh)
wait from where
wait i still looking for a job [ah] dude
takde takde ga~ takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
i think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so #lup-sup# you know
haven't [ah] but i heard they going to open already
so i don't know [ah] i just scared
macam repeat
like history repeat repeat itself [ah]
lik~ (uh) ya that's why
then macam
tak [ah] tapi sekarang not that bad because like
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like i think i'm not able to
to bond with them as much [ah]
so maybe not that bad [ah]
but then [eh] you got #lobang# for kerja or not
ya but like
i don't know [ah] like i want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
in the one that pays well [ah]
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet [ah]
okay [ah] honestly [ah]
aku tak pernah kerja banquet
that time you work [what] no [meh]
yang sebelah yang sebelah hard rock cafe
[ah]
(uh)
[oh]
#sheikh# also work kitchen [ah]
[oh]
the one a
[eh] but that [one] also see your manager also [ah]
because
ya cause (uh) my friend from n_s dulu kerja
it's not really banquet [ah] but they set up for the banquet people [ah]
kat
#shang# shangri-la
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
(uh) like the table chair stage semua dorang set up
then usually it's for like reception gitu [ah] wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just tunggu for the event to finish then they teardown
i think so like who
[oh] yeah yeah yeah but
but dorang punya is more for ini [kan] is like
like apa ni concerts semua [kan]
[ah] ya then this [one] is only for
like wedding reception only [ah]
kat shangri-la that that type
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager [ah] so
the manager is like #sheikh# and that [one] also
(uh) like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay [lah]
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much [ah]
he just delegate the work semua then duduk goyang kaki goyang [ah]
ya
ya
then i don't know [ah] i think everywhere you go i think as long as you make friends [eh]
ke~ kerja senang [ah] tak yah buat banyak sangat [ah]
[oh] ya but marche tak halal [lah]
[eh] jangan gini [ah]

ya
#rehan# why #rehan#
nanti nanti nanti there he sn~ he sniff all our cigarettes [sia]
[ha] funny guy #rehan#
[eh] then how later later want to play dota
i play for a while [ah]
(uh)
i want to get better don't know
tengok [ah] nanti i play for fun [ah]
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish [kan]
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress [ah]
valorant is not [sia] actually it's quite realistic [what] is like same as almost c_s go but
only the suit like a bit
[oh] (uh) kira [kan] macam halo kind of graphic [ah]
[eh] how
are you are you buying the p_s five or not
sch~ busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang p_s five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell [eh]
[oh]
i don't know [ah] like semua orang like rebut nak beli p [eh] actually not ya i don't know i never see the hype of console [lah]
ada [ah] main [ah]
like when i go to my apa ni cousin's house
(uh)
ya like the first console i owned was p_s_p
(ugh) cause okay
aku dari dulu [kan] like
when i growing up like i never had all these things cause
my parents macam
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing [ah]
so
like
i didn't have much distraction other than computer
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
ya so
dorang like cakap okay (uh) #haris# (uh)
kau main twenty minutes
then after that [eh] you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so i only got my first console after my p_s_l_e
[eh] [eh] no primary five exam primary five exam i got all a
ya then my
my father [ah] my father cakap like [eh] #haris# (uh) okay [ah]
they never even tell me you know cause i always tell them i want game boy i want game boy
not really strike a deal [lah] like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three [ah] so like i never really believe them [ah]
(uh) wouldn't say well [lah] like
so so [ah] a a b b
like a b b b
like i would say it's ave~ okay [ah] above average [ah] slightly above average
but then
i think primary five i don't know [ah] one day i just come home [eh]
suddenly like everyone kat (uh) kat luar then i was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the p_s_p
then turns out one was for me [ah] one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted p_s_p i wanted game boy [what]
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
[eh] cik if you want to buy game boy
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no [ah] but wasted [ah] cause my parents bought p_s_p when it first came out
so it's p_s_p one thousand
[ah]
dah [ah] tak [ah] tak yah panggil gemuk [pe]
[ah] ya so
like
i think a few months after i got my p_s_p the slim [one] come out
the once the slim [one] come out semua beli [ah]
ya
but then that the closest to console i got [ah] p_s_p
ya but actually the games there quite good [sia]
ya
d_s [ah]
i think d_s take over [ah] the market
p_s_p vita vita p_s vita ya ya ya
downfall [lah] ya
then i
but i
i think
i think it's cause it's different [lah] like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
ya it's like
just want to show off features [ah] ada dual screen kind of
[ah] that [one] is a pokemon brand already [ah]
until now right ya switch
no but switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
got other games [ah]
but quite popular [what] aku tengok banyak orang [sia] main
ya don't know [ah] mayb~
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked [ah] don't know [ah] this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing [ah]
ya
the (uh) he got post on twitter [ah] i got see a picture of his (uh) like office like that
i think
publicity [ah] like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that [what]
got a rea~
probably that [one] also not he play [ah] maybe his p_r team play for him [ah]
ya
!hais!
tak pernah [ah]
[oh] okay okay faham faham ya
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice [leh]
like i okay this [one] is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular [ah]
until now i i looking to play it again you know but tak [leh] jumpa [ah] it's called what is it called [eh] (uh)
adventurer concourse i forget [ah]
it is [ah] it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
(uh) medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself [ah]
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war tak pernah [ah]
total war is what [ah]
is it
[oh] no no no
ya apa [eh] got once got one game quite sick it was on steam bro yang
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from [lah]
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so i forget [ah] (uh)
i !wah! i forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side [ah]
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
(err) (uh) quite cool [ah]
i forgot what's the name of the game [ah]
apa [ah] nama dia
plazma burst
(mm)
isn't that just (uh)
escape room
[oh] [oh] is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
and then there's a ghost chasing you
[oh] is it
i'm not sure [ah]
#farid# all [ah]
skipper
#aiman#
#aiman#
[oh] i don't know [ah] i never see [ah] they post on twitter [ah]
i never see before [ah] #ipin# i only see him post m_l punya video [ah]
okay [lah] not bad [lah] he was top top in singapore [ah] one point of time
for one hero no cause in m_l is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak [kan]
then your
m_m_r for that hero will increase
[ah] so like (uh) he play this hero i think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again [ah]
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore [ah]
for me the best i got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands #yishun# ya
i they don't have singaporean server i don't know
i think it's (uh) asian server [ah]
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak [ah]
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you i think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
ya for other country is by state so like #johor# macam #johor# will be
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in #johor# top in #selangor# top in #sabah# that kind of thing
ya that's why
i think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
singapore is one state [ah] singapore is a state [what] it's a state country right
(uh)
out outdate outdated information [ah] that [one]
okay i can say also [lah]
!hais!
(mmhmm)
how you know
of course [lah]
(mm)
the malay [eh] actually this [one] i can ask my friend [lah] you know #khai#
[ah] she very interested in like malay culture and all that [lah] so like
okay [ah] for me i find it interesting also but i not so into it sampai
i do research on it also
on it but #khai# like he can tell me like

he travel with (uh) columbus
around the world
so [ah] he say it's a malay it's a malay guy [ah] that travelled with columbus to find out that the world is round

so macam like the
(um)
malay heritage semua [kan] dia tahu [ah]

the different type of culture semua
quite cool [eh] actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
(uh)
how to say [eh]

cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel [what] in the end
so like if you
that [one] i not sure maybe now cause he quite big already [kan] maybe he can get sponsors [ah] but at the start i'm pretty sure i think he buy himself [ah]

so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff [lah] like his knife semua bagus punya all like

the knife all very nice and very sharp

that [one] quite ni [ah] he but that guy keluar [kan] #samurai# sword [ah]
to potong someone
okay
ya i'll open the prompts
okay
then to start with the first question
granted
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
okay i also wait you think for like one second
[oh] cannot [lah] that one is too gila okay maybe i start first
okay
if i got three hajat the first one would be i want to talk to my kucing
cause because i just like like every time i always like talk to my kucing and then i i become like a gila person and i like berbual merepek i legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if i if i can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
(uh) (hmm)
but macam fun [lah]
!alamak! if macam tu then
i will be so scared
[oh] [oh] in the in the bathtub is it [oh] you
(hmm)
but i want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
ya
you say something
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) ya ya
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
what would it be
ya ya
ya actually
like kalau i'm given a chance to travel back right i want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya
ya ya ya
ya i tak nak apa tu i don't want to travel to the future
cause i takut that if i see macam what my future is
and then i'll be scared to i don't know go to the future or
macam i risau [lah] that my what my actions will
will affect the future
[oh] ya that's true but okay example [lah] if if in the future i see that i become doctor and then abeh i i don't know i
okay no no no change change change okay in the future i see that i'm some~ something that i don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then i'll be like [oh] okay okay [ah] try to like then i'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like i don't know then it will affect my like what i'm doing right now [lah] and then macam tak ada thrill if i know that in the end i'll become doctor then
ya
then i'll be demotivated to study cause i know my future like okay [lah] later i become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
cause i think i'm smart already or something
ya
tapi fun [lah]
okay next wish (hmm)
i want to [oh] if i got a power
i want to
not need to sleep
ya but as a wish [lah]
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that [oh] kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
you'll sleep for twenty years or something cause like eight hours of twenty four hours is like one third right
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup [lah] tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then i fikir also like betul [lah]
but if i tidur
sikit sangat also i also ngantuk
i not sleep at all
okay ya okay
ya ya i understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
[oh] ya [hor]
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
ya ya ya
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
i can
ya i understand
(hmm)

okay maybe that wish not that good
you [eh]
[oh] without gaining weight [ah]
[oh] i faham
[oh] [eh] best [eh]
ya
that's nice
that'll be good for me also cause i
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh i think i think
i think really i got diabetes
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes [lah] okay not my ayah my ibu
ya i a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah [lah]
cause life

i don't know why everyone say indomie so i like [oh] [oh] okay okay sama sama [lah] indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
the flavour
it's like lain sikit
!huh!
[oh] [oh] [oh] that one is #mi-sedaap#
i think
#mi-sedaap# they legit like tak lokek their bawang
it's so much
but their bawang a bit macam
weird [lah] cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's i don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
ya and then i don't know i'm eating what also
[kan] maybe it's like bawang but
apa tu
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
[oh] i tadi i eat (uh) #briyani#
okay [lah] tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
ya
ayam
daging i don't like
!huh!
what the wait they jual where
(mm)
we're still talking about the wish right
i i want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
or what they're thinking in general
ya
i feel like pelan-pelan i will i will adapt to it
i don't know
[oh]
[oh] ya
you know what i'm thinking of
and like what you know during the time i go up to to to #aqil# to ask for the gambar
and then imagine i i tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me i'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
ya
(hmm)
actually takde power yang
yang i don't know
that's good [lah]
maybe is
is ada hikmahnya that
you don't have powers
sebenar ada hikmah
(um) ada udang sebalik ini semua
ada udang di sebalik batu
(hmm)
apa
okay
[oh] (hmm)
same
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
chickadee
tak pernah [eh]
i don't know i don't remember
cause
i legit tak pernah dengar
if me
if my time capsule
okay if my time capsule i will have
apa [eh] let me think
(mm)
maybe pictures
okay no no no i really like
okay wait let me think
(hmm)
i don't know [eh] time capsule
[oh] ya
[oh] ya (hmm)
but actually sometimes
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik [lah] if you don't already have it
(mm)
you want to
move to another question
okay
(mm)
what is the one okay wait i read in malay also okay sabar sabar [eh]
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
it's like the most pettiest thing
okay i can i think of one
alasan that is paling like is okay
okay
i can think of one alasan that is very remeh
and and it's okay
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah [eh] tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham [kan] ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek [lah]
[kan] [kan] macam nak sepak [jer] [kan]
[eh] but sometimes right they actually like turn out to be annoying [lah]
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
(mm)
macam menyampah
(mm)
[oh] [oh] ya #allah#
that one legit
!wah! that one i tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
you want to move to another question
okay this one like fun
(mm)
[ah]
apakah genre drama atau rancangan t_v yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent (um) drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
(oo)
(mm)
i think i faham a bit
is it macam
[oh] it's it's not like action [lah]
[oh]
(mmhmm)

okay for me [kan] like a recent okay a drama okay a genre
okay it's not really gen~ genre [lah] but okay as you know [lah] i suka like #anime# like recently like i watch a lot of #anime#
and
i think like
the reason
like why i like #anime# is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! i don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu [lah] but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya [lah] like #anime#
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham [lah] it's like
i don't know if got
okay but
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the #anime# their their plot macam very exciting and very fun [lah] cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
that you can you can do with the plot
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
ya
and their o_s_t !wah! very nice
(mm)
[kan] macam
(mm)

(hmm)
actually growing up is a (uh) is like growing up is a little scary
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat [lah] kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
(mmhmm)
(mm)
apakah sesuatu yang anda harap percuma

so
i had to focus [ah]  macam
every weekend i book out right  aku terus macam malas [ah] just
like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like (mm)
don't know what to do [ah]
okay then once my
that (uh) batch  habis okay that batch finish
then i was like okay [lah] i need to do something [ah] the deadline coming close
okay i start i do i do all the needed documents
i print (err) not print i search for all the
(err) (err) what what all the
courses that i whatever paper whatever certifications that i got i
 cari [ah]
i dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig
then (err) they want us to submit that online
okay so (err) at that point of time i applied for two course
which is one is the course that you're in what is it [ah] what is it called
okay okay so i applied for the is honours [kan]
okay okay
ya so i applied for that one and then  macam
like okay [ah] maybe one application or
one choice a bit too little [lah] so i choose one more
ya but i only applied for one
like i think
they gave me four options or six option i cannot remember but
i don't know i and [ah] [eh] is it i don't know okay okay
so i was like okay (err) maybe i i put two [ah] so one was
infocomm security then the second [one] was
(err)
i think some design or
i_t course [ah] i don't know it's related to i_t but  macam they asked for portfolio

that (um) the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about (err) entertainment or something [ah]
they requested for a portfolio because  macam they want to see what what i have done
back (uh) any  macam past experience or whatever
so that i can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should [ah] so
ya that was when i realised [ah] so
what i did was i
like (uh) screw it [ah] i don't want to apply for this course then i delete it from my option
the moment i delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then i was like [oh] okay
ya i only applied for one option [lah] i only put one choice
second course s_i_t [ah] [ah] infocomm security
is the [one] i'm saying [ah]  macam the editing or (err) digital entertainment or something like that

that lady was like [oh] (err) are you still are you still in n_s are you still serving

was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
(mm) !huh!
!hais!
you know you know my my  encik wanted me to extend six months [eh]
i was like nah~ nah~
the the amount of work i have to do
two point four
three is that [one] is before (err) [ah] c_p_f but six months is a very long
think so i don't know [lah]
no but the thing is i don't i don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing [ah]
[a'ah]
i would extend if i'm doing like admin work [ah] honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months i'd take it
i would not
[eh] i would not think twice
(err) i i don't like my  encik (uh)
i just
i just don't like my  encik [ah] that's all
ya serious [ah]
one last talk
[oh] i see
[oh] [ho]  dua jam
[oh] i see
 kau punya
 kau punya boss  apa umur
okay [ah]  muda [ah]
 aku punya kau kau rasa aku punya berapa
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
 apa otai [sia]  orang tua
i see i see
no [lah] okay so (uh)
 kira i don't like working with my  encik [ah] it's just like  macam
 kau bayangkan
(err)  kau kau ikut apa dia orang dia suruh kau buat tahu
okay then  tiba tibs
ex~  dia tambah lagi dia tambah dia tambah dia tambah tambah tambah aku [dah] tak boleh tak boleh tahan [lah]
then  macam
when we expect him to cover for us [eh]  macam we do what he expect us to do
and then
there's a second layer so basically  macam my  encik is my first level
to [eh] no sorry my p_s
is my first level to le~ to complaint [lah]  katakan
and then followed by my  encik
and then basically then go up to o_c [ah] so there's this
thing in s_t_s [eh] there's one more layer in between my p_s and my  encik which is that directing staff
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
(err)
(err) expect a lot from the from us [ah]
basically so  macam
s_a_r standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he ex~ they expect us to be there before that
i don't know
[a'ah] ya
and okay so you know how in
(err) b_m_t they say [oh] okay (err) the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the [one] doing all this (err)
all these checks right correct
(uh huh) okay
so we also have the
 macam what's
we also had the schedule [lah]
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
(err) the [one] that we don't like [lah]
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about (err) the duty (err) is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
for example i have five sergeants one person will do the check for that day or for that morning [ah]  katakan
then
so this directing staff came down he was like [oh] (err) what time already i was like !huh!
what do you mean he's like (err) why i only see one sergeant why i don't see all the sergeant here then it's like !huh!
what you expect [sia] you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check [ah]
you get what i mean
ya [lah]
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check [ah] rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like [ha]
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
check  gitu something like that [lah]
so we're like (err) when when i going o_r_d it was like [ah] don't care already [ah] because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so i was like i don't care already [ah]
ya
i mean i i just worry for my
under studies [ah]
(um)
okay okay
what you have done [lah] [ha]
sometimes like i think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
[oh] don't have [eh]
okay then i guess (err)
(mmhmm)
okay [lah] but okay that
and he still cannot
(mmhmm)
last week
that one your problem [ah]
just say that [lah]
[oh]
(err) you feel bad for him [ah]
okay [lah] okay [lah]
your brother [ah] your brother [ah]
i guess ya
 aku lain aku everyday [jer] stress [ah]
i have to
 kau imagine okay  kau imagine (err)
let's say okay you you're taking this batch for one month
like then (um)
within that four weeks there is a few weekend correct
are are you di~ being disturbed on weekends or no
sometimes [ah]
then for me if i am every week every day
my phone will ring my phone will message got ping [one] confirm i tell you vibrate or whatever [lah]
everyday will do and everyday !hais! th~ that's why i'm getting tired of it
example like (err) interacting with
well
i have to deal with forty two recruits
[oh] then (err) the the recruit asking me if i single also that one s_a_f [ah]
is it
serious i got
like (uh) no [lah] no no no i got one i got one guy during my n_s right
he he was in a relationship with one other guy pin pin in his
in his (uh) vocation training
okay so what happened was (uh) they broke up
they broke up and i was and i was the direct (err) seccom
so ya so like i have to  macam
coax him [ah] like [oh] [eh] don~ don't like (err)
(err) feel bad [lah] don't don't think like it's the end or something [lah] whatever
then finishing the course [ah] he come to me he say sergeant single or not what the heck

make it make it more unique [lah] like more us got more personal touch you know
like let's say (uh)
it's more of a mix and match kind of thing it's like
and not
