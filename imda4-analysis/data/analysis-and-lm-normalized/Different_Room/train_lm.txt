okay
alright boleh
boleh [eh] okay so basically aku tanya (uh) whoever living at my place first to do this [lah] cause i thought need to do at my house
then i aku call siapa #ham# boy dengan (uh) i they technically live near my place [what] so easier so i call them dua dua tak nak buat
i actually [oh] my god i forgot to tell ham he told me (uh) dia nak fikir dulu
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but i mean come on [ah]
i rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what i mean
because
i'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
[ah] nanti kita sign up then wasted tak dapat macam mana
so i say that to him [lah]
no is based on macam first come first basis
(mm)
okay basically (err) my friend hantar aku ni okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
so they were looking for people to debate [lah] like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
[ah] i'm not sure whether per debate or what because i mean i love to debate [what]
so (uh)
sekali suddenly she just sent me this [lah] so i actually thought this was a debate
[ah] so aku so i ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then i [ah] call you [lah] (uh) i was looking for people [ah] macam #ham# boy
(err) i
actually one of my friend who stay kat
rumah
[ah] very near right tapi dia tak nak
like i don't i don't get some people punya mindset macam
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
tak [kan] satu jam pun tak boleh berbual
you know what i mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
sekolah amacam
(mm)
seriously [ah]
okay
okay we don't talk about h_b_l [lah] [eh]
h_b_l is (err)
that's yes correct that's the main reason why i left
(uh huh)
[ah] right
that's the thing [ah]
[oh] my god teruk
merepek no no no seriously
even
but government allow sport activity [what]
[ah] actually aku call kawan aku ni pasal
bukan because the thing why they don't want [ah] ask you first is because you live very far away i thought you need to come and to my place
[ah]
so i call this guy he's known for speaking [ah] good malay
(uh) to mix we always mix
[ah] always any conversation we have automatic kita selalu mix gini mix gitu mix gini mix gitu
[ah]
[a'ah] it's very standard [ah]
(err) okay so three wishes
i would wish
to have (err)
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me i'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay [lah] let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
i would wish
[oh] my god
you know what
kita tukar question [jer] [ah]
tukar question
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
(mm) [ah] okay okay
so
let me guess kau kene kerja for
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
settle down relax there k dah settled
something like that
[ah] alright alright alright alright i understand i understand
me
basically right if i were to follow my dreams
i would drop my (err) future [lah]
basically my livelihood
because that k basically i really want to
[ah] be a professional sports player
okay
(uh huh)
a professional sports player maybe soccer football k we talk about soccer [lah] cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
(err) but the thing is if at this age i were to like you know try
maybe i'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then i'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if i made it big who's gonna before i make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe i want play in a england e_p_l who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
[ah] so before that success i have to
the risk basically my parents money [lah]
[ah]
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific [lah] but
singapore soccer is a no no [lah]
even ex players also tell me is i don't know like for leisure leisure okay [lah] tapi nak
commit and [ah] macam apa
all macam #haziq#
[ah] that's a bit unrealistic the passion is (uh) actually is that i understand i used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in singapore using that kind of (err)
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life [lah]
[ah]
alright
sorry
[ah] true true malaysia pay better
(um)
[ah] but then nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita [lah]
but i mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower [ah]
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me i would love to teleport [ah]
anywhere and everywhere
!wah! so i don't have to think about being late
so i don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late [lah] i don't want to be late [lah]
ya so for example [ah]
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine i aku dah kat rumah
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
the fifty nine second aku dah kat rumah
(mm)
no
i mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but i am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically i'm i'm watching [ah]
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about [lah]
[ah]
so they talk about du~ the dulu orang turkey macam mana macam mana dorang settle hal
(uh) rumah tangga
(uh) musuh
cucuk belakang and all [ah] [oh] my god i tell you
it is an emotional story
(um) sad
berbual pasal sedih ada
marah sampai nak bang table ada serious serious it it was all emotion
but
no it's a series series
(mm) but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
(hmm)
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay i i don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
[oh]
i think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
i will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically i got first in class [ah] in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke i didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so i got first in class so i got confident so sorry primary five primary five
so primary four i was like you know competing with this guy that guy macam the race to become first in class [ah]
then i got first in class again in primary four you know
then sekali come to primary five dah kerek [kan] two years in a row [ah] don't need study [ah] #lepak# [ah]
it's time to blend in because i i won't i didn't blend blend in well (err) in primary school
[ah] because
(um)
how to say [eh]
i might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no [lah] i mean that that's the problem [ah] because
back then
if i didn't i hadn't had this issue and i didn't i wasn't arrogant
i wouldn't have (err) you know
instead of the okay sekarang kita dah first in class [eh] kita focus [jer] how to be best in the cohort
i was like there are these people dislike me i want to blend in with them
so aku start bergaul dengan dorang be like them
#lepak# kat luar [lah] [ah] tak belajar after p_s_l_e oral
dorang semua balik
aku main catching
[ah] prank orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari you know
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
[ah] play soccer at the void deck all [lah] so
i will change my mindset [lah] but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
kalau
kita punya
past tak terjadi
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing i'm like if i could turn back time would i turn back time
but if this didn't happen i wouldn't be like this you know what i mean
yes definitely
because
i hate this [ah] cliche phrase
but as annoying and cliche and you know like jijik as it is
it's true [ah] what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
i mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example [ah] that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like !wah!
i'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
i still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song [ah] [kan] maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone try~ i'm like no i'm not gonna listen to it
[ah]
tapi kau tahu apa lebih teruk tak
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders [ah] basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start [eh] you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song [ah]
old town road
so
i think i've not formerly i was i listen to it because [ah] there was this video playing that song [ah] so like [oh] not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
i go search old town road k [ah] i put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
i removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song i'm like
it's in my heart i'm like excuse me
kau zaman bila ni
you know but i'm like [oh] ya [eh] nice song nice song [ah]
so it's damn annoying [ah] actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
i'm i'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the d_j [lah]
yeah [oh] my god dorang punya cara berbual
okay [lah] okay [lah] we cannot throw shades [lah] okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
(mm)
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter i feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
(um)
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries [ah] will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
some (um) country [ah] they w~ you need to pay first know walaupun berapa critical apa dah nazak ke pe you need to pay first before the surgery happen
(mm)
ya
precisely
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's a sensitive (uh) topic
okay
let's see next question [eh]
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do (mm) very good question
ya we k basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
like dulu punya time [ah]
macam yeah people work work but they work for
for k for example orang dulu we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds [lah]
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
(um) rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
let me phrase that ya what apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need [ah] okay i want a
iphone
because it's the best
and [ah] okay basically iphone is good [lah] those who have it is good but i want a latest iphone because a new one just came out i wanna keep up with the trend
(um) shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which i can get for ten dollars at #pasar-malam#
and then
shoe (uh) twenty thousand [lah]
you know [ah] off-white with gucci and maybe versace
yeah
my pants i would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
i also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
[ah] bought a very expensive car [lah]
(uh) so recently so i was like
okay
so
they are like [eh] you know this pe~ this and this bought this and this i'm like [oh] okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money [lah]
you want to show off
and all
give me their money [lah] i can put to better use
okay [oh] yes sorry
(mm)
(uh)
aku rasa
dia punya masalah yang betul [kan] is actually apa [tau]
life hidup
macam life is so simple
but people just live to complicate it
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind ada je masalah
[ah]
so i guess this is the challenges in life you have to face [lah]
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do [lah] right
alright next question
[oh] this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
everyday activity [lah] bukan kerja ke apa macam k for me
for me eating
like
if i'm full
and i don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours [oh] my god
[oh] my god i can't imagine it
i think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
i mean k
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good i can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if i were to eat a very nice food right
nanti muak [pe]
and what jelak sama [jer] [lah]
yeah
ya so like
like they say [ah] everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
[eh] kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi [tau] pasal sekolah
i guess so i was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different [lah]
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically i went to queue for guess guess
what would i buy
yes burger
i was dreaming of the burger but i was thinking the burger in the dream
macam apa tau dia punya ayam doesn't look good dia punya telur doesn't look good
so i'm like [eh] so there's now two shops [eh]
yang mana lebih sedap which one looks more appetising because for me
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if i were to try new food [lah] outside food the look is so important
(mm) (mm)
and
(mm)
is that even a question
of course i would come unless i got n_s [ah]
hopefully
[oh] you know what i just want n_s to come [lah]
(um) next month
yeah
if you are wondering why i'm looking at the right right
like you know i'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
(err) [oh] okay okay [oh] okay okay
okay (hmm)
[oh] okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone [eh] sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
(mm)
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
i mean it's true but for me i i guess i guess in my opinion
i feel like i have a
intuition that i can read people face so like i know [oh] muka gini [ah] gini [ah] orangnya
some people just ha~ the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah i guess i i implement that to people face [ah]
like [oh] muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini [oh] macam gini [ah] orang dia
okay i wouldn't say expert because
(err) i mean if i say i'm an expert that will be bragging right
so tak [ah] so basically i can tell you two experiences in my life which i was wrong
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right [lah]
because
i see him i think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so i guess in a way it's it's right but the one i'm wrong is you
i expected you to be a super mat rep
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on [lah] it was like what blonde
(err) perang perang [kan]
so actually !alamak! confirm mat rep [eh] fikir dia siapa [sia]
then i was like
[ah] see [ah] this [one] [ah] i_t_e
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when i got to know you all you all are the best people in i_t_e
you have to admit [ah]
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
like for example try what we do go to engineering course i think the apa the headmaster apa
course head [eh] apa
[ah] the h_o_d
[eh] don't do this [lah]
you know what i mean you are like come on [lah] you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but #kena# our h_o_d
you wanna get expelled is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but did you do it
yes
i knew it
but i mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
kau confirm menyesal sikt kenapa #hamizan# tak ingat
no comments
(um) okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
i
(um)
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything i hear everything i see is in my head
i want to that kind of memory
(um)
can [ah] but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is (err)
skill [eh]
what skill [eh] apa kita boleh buat let me see let me see
maths
[ah] i am good at cracking jokes
i already master that since i was like primary school so
but maths [ah] maths [ah] like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of (uh) discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate i calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me [ah]
[ah]
i straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this i want to have it in my head
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what i mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
itu penting paling penting paling mustahak
yes
okay
aku tengah tengok dia orang punya question
it's good [lah] they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
!alamak! cannot search [ah]
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
i mean i heard of it before tapi macam
actually i heard but i don't know the meaning [lah]
k retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events [oh] basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay i got one
so me and cyprus skip class kau tahu [kan] cerita ni
and terjumpa fabian
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would i mean i didn't laugh but inside my heart i was laugh but after that when i leave the office i also laugh
but then it's not funny [lah] okay we skip class
then you know his (uh) dia punya cara marah macam mana [kan] see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding [ah] a serious scolding [ah]
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
i deserve the scolding
okay but
i gotta cheer myself up
takde [lah]
[ah]
i mean
it's hard [lah] it's hard
yeah
damn but
[oh] my god i miss class
ninety percent of people i miss [lah] definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it [lah] [eh] let's not throw shade to people [lah] [eh]
but [oh] my god i miss our i_f_t class with
(uh) #ham# boy
s&w
(uh)
you only spend time when [ah]
actually you only spend time when we going home so i miss going home with you [lah]
like that we really sit down and talk
[ah]
[ah] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
i mean i was [ah]
i was always with cyprus and at that point of time i was like you know researching about laptops [lah] ni [lah] tu [lah] ni [lah] tu [lah]
[ah]
so i mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time [lah]
[ah] definitely adalah orang nak beli laptop so i can m_s them like bombard them
[ah]
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were o level students correct
you were you were you were right you were o levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
(um) graduating from secondary school for o levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or j_c correct
so okay [lah]
maybe o level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science i don't know what else okay
(err)
ya okay then you have to go to i_t_e okay
then from i_t_e where's where's the next destination
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a apa
e_a_e
so aku macam [oh] my god
i when i never study i get this but when i study
i get zero point zero two
points better like apalah nak jadi
kenapa [lah] hidup macam ni
you know what i mean
but
it's for me is merepek [ah] like i i can't believe [ah] macam
k [ah] kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk poly [kan] what what's the point
[ah]
and i have better options [ah] i have better prospect so
obviously [ah] kita macam you know what
if i'm gonna go this way
kita punya pathway macam gini [jer]
but if i choose another way i got better potential so i did the right thing but was hard thing to do [ah] to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
h_b_l
because i hated every moment of h_b_l
one week then i didn't come for another one week
ya macam is merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit [jer]
you know what i mean
abeh kalau kat rumah i mean k fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that [what] you know what i mean
like giving
precisely i aku it is
i find it super merepek
so it it made me like [oh] you know what [ah] so tiring [ah] malas [ah]
[ah] tak leh [ah] tak leh [ah]
so
true [lah] true
yeah
abeh come by my house [lah] one once in a while
i really busy but if you come i can make time for you because k basically right now i'm more free [ah]
cause i'm laying low a bit
[ah] i'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things [lah] in the future
(mm) so you can actually come down
dah kat kat mana
three more right
(mm)
alright alright i wi~ i will look forward i will look forward then j_b will be here for
!huh!
[eh] #kim# cam
pergi j_b pe #ons# see you in five minutes five minutes [eh] #toa-payoh# to woodlands
fifteen minutes fifteen [ah] serious expressway
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) in singapore you wanna rev come on [lah]
you throttle abit beep
#kena# fine
why your apa engine so loud
okay
let's see
okay okay okay
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
(um)
let me think [ah]
yeah i never heard of it before tak pernah dengar
it it seems good right
[oh]
i wanted to
like you know my friend buy then i get the free one [lah]
kau tahu aku punya orang singkit sikit sikit [jer] singkit dia
but you have to apa
apply for like you need to queue wait for like six seven hours kenapa
kenapa [ah]
what happened
[oh] your wifi seems abit bad [lah] [eh]
okay [lah] i think we go next question [ah] it's a good question
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
okay we we apply it to ourselves [lah] [ah] not to other people [lah]
what would you rather have
yes
kalau kau tanya aku [eh] (mm)
okay kalau kau tanya aku this about
now i'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen i mean i'm still my teens but
when i still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because i could go far
i really could go far but
like that [lah] this i guess this my fate [lah]
so if
in the past yeah fit body now [ah]
whatever god give me i'll take [lah]
like (uh) whatever it is [lah] good looks fit body
but now i'm going to n_s so i guess i have to choose fit body again [lah]
like know because i_p_p_t
if they give us like pre i_p_p_t before you masuk right
dorang kata if we pass we get two months off know
siapa tak nak
[ah] but [oh] my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but i'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like i don't play
hyper transport
and even if i do play right the roads i play are very
suit to my body [lah] like
okay for example kalau soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
we don't need upper body strength
kalau basketball [oh] definitely [ah] you need upper body strength [ah] but that means
like i pay for competition semua
kau tahu kawan aku suruh buat apa
#izzul# kau jangan pass kau jangan shoot [eh] sorry sorry sorry
you don't pass don't shoot [eh]
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because i'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying [lah] because
fastest
sometimes means the best but i'm the fastest but not the best
no no no k basically in basketball [kan] kalau kau main
if you look at the oppunent team [eh]
the best is usually the fastest
[ah] but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe i'm the fastest but i'm not the best in fact the worst [ah] offensively
[ah]
so
but i have to keep up with those (uh) because yeah basketball is technically new to me i started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
so my game i_q and dorang punya game i_q tak sama definitely they are better game sense than me
okay that's one
so i'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
not to my knowledge macam
dorang buat ni aku tak boleh counter
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then i still can't do it because i'm just not (um)
used to it [ah] like i'm not exposed to it [what]
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question i've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
c_d
for me
n_y n_y_p punya nasi ayam
dengan dorang punya sayur
for the rest of my life bro
tak kira apa-apa [lah]
frugal [eh]
the one near the bus stop to go to i_t_e
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro i add extra chicken with veg~ k
i bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in singapore
your house [lah] because free [what]
right
[oh] n_y_p chicken rice for the win bro
funny [ah] you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore !chey!
[oh] i mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice i will probably get scolded by my parents
but i don't mind
you know because (uh) you have to understand in singapore susah nak dapat natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
chicken
beef
[ah]
correct so parents aku suka apa [tau] they like (err)
#kampung# chicken they make sure it's from a
not say #kampung# [lah] but you know #kampung# means they bring it up naturally
[ah] it it it you don't have to worry about the
others [lah]

ya but i don't really like curry noodles [leh]
i think the
(mmhmm)
no but i feel like the idea of curry noodles is
atrocious
i think the idea of curry noodles is bad like imagine you lemak letak cili api and then you letak
#mee# #mee# dalam !ee! like
yah i mean pasta is okay [what]
no pasta is italian noodle
abih kan
kalau takda kalau tak boleh makan rendang tak boleh makan

[oh] okay [lah]
then what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
what is the most pettiest reason that you macam
satu orang buat kan like like kalau dorang buat then you macam tak suka
macam you don't like [ah] like like it's like you're petty like you really macam nak tempeleng gitu
i think right for me right !wah! i don't like kalau kalau dorang gedik
kalau perempuan [oh] my god kalau kalau like any if i see this minah [eh] this girl come up to me macam
cakap like
[eh] punya [lah] !ee! macam nak
macam nak lempang je [seh]
like i want to hit her i want to like !ee! like !ee! ca~ can~ can you not be so gedik a not
betul tak
and then another thing is like kalau dorang macam
like dorang macam step step
dorang macam world [lah] world [lah] macam
macam world [lah]
like dorang macam they're like
(ah) (ah) (ah) macam dorang bebual terus macam [eh] aku aku like aku pernah [seh] pergi kat sini pernah [seh] do this do that macam like
[oh] i got like hit up by girls at this club you know macam
like
[ah] macam macam big macam world [ah] world haprak gitu [ah]
ego
cuba try cuba try
(mm)
ok [pe] i think beta is still ok [what]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] macam dia macam like [oh] like like [ah] ape tu
okay [lah] okay [lah] i kind i kind of understand [lah]
macam like i'm better than you tapi actually tak [lah] tak [lah] better sangat
macam i more better but then actually you not that better [lah]
okay
you ask me what question you want to ask
you you
okay
kita party [lah] [sia]
i think i think right i think
i think kita
kita macam ape eh
kau tak payah kerja kalau we don't have to work right
and then
what do we do i rasa we enjoy
kita party
kita macam buat hal masing masing i think we will achieve our dreams [ah]
i think that is for sure macam
we don't need to worry about
bill bill yang nak bayar ni semua
you know
so if you don't have to work
kalau we don't have to work then don't basically macam
the only reason why we work is nak dapat duit kan
so if
we we don't need to get the money to pay our bills then
i think
we will just
buat hal masing masing [ah]
macam
we achieved our dreams like we macam finally enjoy life why what what i would say
then maybe the whole world won't be so capitalistic
yeah
consumerism consumerism
yeah
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
tak ada makna [ah] gitu
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
macam tak ada makna meaningless [lah]
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
tak ada challenges [ah]
(mmhmm)
betul betul
(mmhmm)
abeh kalau
like if you drop
everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
risk
that is so true though
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
i think for me
(um) i only risk
failures [lor]
[oh] i risk time
basically time [lah] i think yang the most issue for my
side is time because i feel like
macam tak cukup masa gitu
because i'm really so old you know like twenty four
abeh macam
ya but the thing is to me then then again age is subjective what people think that twenty four is like [oh] nothing but to me i rasa macam twenty four is like [oh] my god i don't have time anymore you know i have like six more years until thirty and then what am i supposed to do next i mean i kena kahwin kena beli rumah
and you need to like
like
you know you have to get your dreams in order basically [lah]
so macam like
to me the only factor that i rasa that i'm losing right that i'm risking is
failures and time because i don't think that i have the time to macam
gagal lagi
like (ugh)
it's so sad right
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but at the same time macam they still like if to me that those are like lucky people macam dorang macam
bertuah [lah] to like you know at least hit at least find something that you know they're good at even if even on that even at that age
like even though dorang [dah] macam tua tua gitu macam forty plus tapi macam masih dapat
dapat buka apprenticeship
dapat
buat ni semua like
not everybody is that lucky i guess
(mmhmm) hard work is also another thing
(mmhmm)
but at the same time kalau asyik asyik kena
like do you think you would actually have the strength to like not give up anymore
macam like if you always like you know kalau you always work work hard je asyik asyik work hard abeh lepas itu macam
macam tak ada tak ada luck like people don't like it's just not your bidang [lah] it's not your industry
like you try so many things macam you try masak you try restaurant
retail abih you try [ah] apa lagi [ah] en~ engineering abih lepas itu
you try hairstyling also
and then you find out that like [eh] you found nothing like everything in the world you try and that like
you don't know you nak buat apa
(mmhmm)
true [lah]
at the same time also you feel like like
(err) there's also there's always new things to discover i guess
so macam you'll never run out of things to like
explore and try
(mm)
(mmhmm)
betul juga [ah] betul juga [ah]
what you say ada ada sense
if you had three wishes
what would you wish for
no but if you cannot do that
kalau you cannot minta for like more wish
okay so my first wish i rasa i would be eternally rich
i will i will ask for a never ending fortune
so i can beli anything that i want
you [eh]
ya ya ya
world peace !oof!
now you making me feel inadequate
inadequate
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my second wish
(um)
probably that
we may be looked as equals
macam at least macam treated as human beings [lah]
at least macam in terms of salary in terms of of the will
kaum lelaki tengok kita basically i just wish for like you know equality you don't look at us as like object
yeah basically
but the thing is memang betul [lah] darjat wanita [dah] naik [kan] memang tinggi [lah] di islam tapi
entah macam kadang kadang kawan kita macam
tradition you know tradition sucks man
they suck balls
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
break out of it right like it's so hard for us to like break out of tradition because it's already been part of us for so long like since kita kecil sampai sekarang [dah] besar [pun]
kalau kita nak macam you know like cakap example like wedding my friend
like ask ask my friend was like saying that like [oh] [ah]
they are going to like make a big hotel wedding because [ah] suami dia is apa itu anak seorang
like he's the only child so
they want to buat besar besar because they are only going to have one wedding ever
so macam
kan membazir and then like to her she feels like she don't need [lah] because most of the people she won't she won't even kenal
you know
and then at the same time macam in at the same time you so you follow [lah] if you mampu ke tak betul tak
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
yeah
just the
just how society
look at us
basically [ah]
like their requirement to like [oh] for women to be considered
(uh) ideal matches to be kahwin
to be married off
and then they don't put the same on guys
must be soft spoken must be so macam
but
like girly you know you have to like
be
motherly figure
cannot cry cannot be emotional
you have to be strong
(uh huh)
society is definitely the problem
ok then your second wish
meaning
(mmhmm)
(mm)
basically you just don't want to regret
like you just want to like be confident of your choices no matter what you take no matter what you what no matter what you did
is it
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
but i think for me [leh] (uh)
so far no matter even if i had bad choices right i feel like i am generally pretty satisfied with whatever i choose [lah]
like
i mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story [lah]
at the same time you know i'm glad that like you know i went over there macam like
is a is a lesson to learn
yeah i like like went through whatever yang kesakitan all this nangis nangis kat sejadah ni semua macam
is at the same time macam you do have like some of this
regret macam [eh] kalau aku tahu aku tak pilih dia aku tak cakap yes kat dia macam
but at the same time if i didn't go through that i feel like
i wouldn't be this kind like i wouldn't be myself i wouldn't be the person that i am today
so to me i don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
okay for the third wish kan
kita kena make it a fun [one]
kita kena macam as merepek [ah] tapi macam like
like jangan serious sangat [ah]
because like that okay i think my third wish i would
[ah]
wish for
the skills of
every cook in the world
so kirakan i can masak any makanan that i want
entah [eh]
i also didn't know like it was one of my choices [lah] for me to to
right right i think so too i think i will be like but the thing one thing i don't let is to ikut recipe
i for me i don't really macam i tengok recipe i look at the ingredients but i don't macam ikut one tablespoon
(uh) one
one pinch of salt all this kind of thing i tak ikut
yeah
you know i mean agak agak is like fun [leh] it's like (oo) you know you are making a portion or you like making something like [oh] it's a hit and miss like [oh] if hit
today then like okay good for you if it doesn't hit then okay then next time i know that i have to put more gula and stuff like that
frenzy it's like a it's like a trouble sho~ it's like a to me it's like macam like that time i masak sambal tumis telur [eh] sambal tumis like mixture of sausages
lobster balls meatballs dengan
sotong ball
so i literally right
buat sambal tumis tapi [kan] tak ada bawang merah tau like there's no onions
so i decided to use bawang putih
and to me because mummy kata
bawang putih is like a good alternative and also like you know bawang putih is more flavorful macam kalau you masak nasi goreng if you don't have bawang putih it's fine you can just use garlic garlic is important [lah] basically
so i use garlic and i put like five cloves of garlic and it was to me it's a bit too much [lah] because you can literally rasa the garlicky taste
and then i did macam lada kering
and all that jazz and then after that i tengah masak kan
and then i was just like i feel like dia punya
bawang putih punya taste macam still overpowering you know
so i letak sugar and then it was like (uh)
doesn't really hit the spot
and i try to put a sauce and i try again and it was like okay okay is kinda there
and after that i put stock because i mean m_s_g m_s_g makes the world go round
so i put m_s_g then i put kicap and then i put (uh) it was like a it was like a frenzy [ah] it was like a
like a carnival like basically macam
i just i just whatever i can think of right i just campak kat dalam
(mmhmm)
yes imagine you ask me for rendang
i can cook any rendang you want rendang #johor# rendang #penang# rendang #sarawak#
anything bro
italian rendang you want the crispy rendang
what
ren~ run run there
rendang and yes i want (uh) the skin of the chicken is not crispy you know
then what's your last wish come on make it fun
(uh huh)
!ugh! serious nye
so serious [leh]
ya [lah]
arts everywhere
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but i feel like there is like a steady growing of like
appreciation so far macam like singapore nights festival all this
(uh huh)
ya we know you know i know everybody know but nobody want to like say about it
like nobody is like is there
but nobody wants to address it like can you please stop
singapore stop stop it
ya

unusual
(mm)
to be

how unusual is unusual
[oh] my god that's gross
(um)
[oh] i think for me is to
control my period cycle

like my cramps
and my power is to just like okay
today i need to feel pain so i'll be like okay pain meter let's go to a hundred
and the next time i'll be like okay today i feel like i want to chill chill a bit
so macam
turun a bit the pain threshold
yeah
but sometimes you just feel like you need to feel the pain like you know you rasa macam
sedih macam sedih nak mampus gitu
my super power would be able to
manifest anything that i want from thin air
from thin air
macam like i~ if i want a sandwich i get a sandwich if i want airpods if i want a pair of airpods i get airpod if i want a laptop i get a laptop
if i want money i get money

#toph#
ya the earth the earth girl the blind [one] her jokes everytime
her joke she's just like [eh] see and then it be like [eh] what i don't say anything then she's like ya
exactly
like her jokes are like one of a kind [lah] [seh] like

tomorrow what are you doing
tomorrow is sunday what are you gonna do
you got some work to do
(oo)
ya same
same with me
!huh!
i rasa tak keluar tak tau ah
i think so
yeah definitely we have to do my work i have to re-upload my
i re-uploaded my first two decks already i'm working on my third deck
for f_y_p so macam tinggal
tapi monday i have to like upload
(err) five more
and i'm way behind to be honest
(mm)
i mean macam i have a lot of pages a lot of a lot of development which is good but i'm technically in terms of the number of decks that have i'm far behind and i have two more weeks to complete fifteen decks
and i'm only at deck three
everybody else dorang tak macam explore tau dorang macam just do one that one that one that one that one that so macam
i don't know how they can just like not explore [lah] i i like exploring i like to macam
yeah i like to macam
if i see something i want to develop a bit more and more and more macam you know let it let it branch out
i see it so it's gonna be this if i see this it's gonna be this so macam
it's a bit hard for me i guess
yup
cause it's sunday kan
tomorrow's national day
o_m_g
happy birthday singapore
majulah singapura
but i feel like this year macam i don't think they th~ they should actually have
national day [seh]
exactly
ya the idea is just
merepek ah like who comes up with this stuff
like
like who would be appreciative of
hearing jet planes flying over
ya like are you dumb or you dumb like
fathom how dumb that idea is
it's so stupid
otak letak kat juboh
ya but at the same time and then like you you then dorang kata dorang nak do salute [eh] for nurses
ya but hello raise their pay
yeah they deserve more i mean like
instead of just
claps and you know singing home and then like bonus macam at least just increase their pay for throughout their career
cause i believe our healthcare system like earns a lot of money
especially nurses
yeah
exactly
worst [eh]
[oh] my god
[ah] vegetables
you know i don't like vegetables what are you on
#taugeh#
i think my my answer would be #taugeh# the worst thing to have buy one get one free is #taugeh#
i mean
why would anybody want more #taugeh#
like
that whole idea is just
tak masuk akal
!huh!
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
!wah! she power [seh]
no i don't think i'll become that kind of mother
hello i eat a lot okay
i eat fried potatoes
potatoes
!hey! i eat baby carrots
i eat lettuce
ya ya then i mean they're not raw or they are already cook is just that
you know
ya macam sausage all this kena potong potong kadang kadang pun i macam makan
like you cut right than you just sneak in a few slices
and that's what i will do
that's what i will do
[oh] my god i feel like eating corn beef you know corn beef
yeah yeah yeah
sedap kan
[a'ah] [seh]
ya but i guess i mean we're here for a good time not a long time
i mean that's my motto here for a good time not a long time so i'm just gonna enjoy whatever i have
whatever i can get whatever i can eat and not worry about the percus~ what not worry about the
pr~ percussion
repercussion
isn't percussion like a a music instrument
!oops!
bodoh
ya repercussions later yes like diabetes or something like that i mean like i won't eat so sweet [lah]
what do you think about bubble tea
can you do you think you can live without bubble tea
a need
ya to me also like i can like live without bubble tea
[ah] actually also it's been like
two weeks since i had my koi ovaltine macchiato
bubble tea
[oh] damn that was long
yeah i wanna eat
now i feel like drinking
yah
you weirdo
you need at least one bubble tea a month
that's fine
okay [lah] is it bubble tea or macam boost
kan i think so i also prefer boost
yeah especially the gym junkie cause you got protein
i like the protein
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
ya [lah] cause of the protein
i think this is where my extra mass also come from
but you know sometimes i like to just buy the kid size
because like i feel like the original is too much
ya then sometimes you just feel like like example macam you pergi interview that time i gi interview then after that i just
want to buy boost tapi i don't want so big because i want to go for the interview but i want something small enough to like
drink it so i bought the kids one
and it was so nice it was so cute i like cute stuff

(mm) sama sama
(mm) [ah] understood understood ya cause (uh) macam for me [kan] like (uh)
i don't enjoy anything online at all from [ah] daripada lectures
to like (err) online exams no no i'm i'm like not a huge fan of all this online stuff at all i hate it i really really hate it
really i cannot i feel like (um) like like very unproductive it's like (err) no no is is (err) don't even don't even get me started talking about it cause like really really really really malas
malas abeh [ah] tiring lagi so macam
i was like
[ah] really cannot i really cannot cause i'm type of person [ah] who like (um) prefers everything like to be there in the traditional way [ah] right like physically seeing your lecturer lecturer and then like taking down notes physically
like like i can't can't do i can't do it i can't do the virtual thingy i really i really don't find it like (um)
productive at all for me throughout the whole semester
what about you what about you
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) it's
still not the same right
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
abeh like (um) macam mana [ah] your exam punya like (err) format like how how was it like it's it's online right so macam like how how did it go
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
[eh] but serious [ah] forty eight hours
[oh] my god
(uh) (uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) !wow!
leceh [ah] leceh
(mm) okay i see i see [eh] (uh) but forty eight hours forty eight hours is really long [eh]
(uh)
[oh] for mine like the maximum like the longest longest exam that i had was like [ah] twenty four hours [ah] so i cannot imagine like forty eight hours was like !huh! forty eight hours lama gila
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
like the questions banyak ke like were there like a lot of questions
!wow! five sections
(mm) (mm) (mm)
lama
(mm) not really ya it's it's not clear ya it's not clear at all
ya
no difference tak ada tak ada difference
like why you using serious tak dengar
try [ah] cakap something
ya is it wha~ what you using
(mm) cause it sounds like (uh) (err) dia macam tak clear sangat so like try it's ya like i cannot really understand what you're saying ya
(mm)
(mm) that's why
okay never mind
can [lah] but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
tak faham
sangat what you trying to say ya
like there's like a bit like
blur blur sikit
anyway right (um)
[oh] for me [kan] [ah] yours is like forty eight hours so is like mine is mine mine was [ah] twenty four hours tapi like the lecturer lecturer like give like specific instruction [tau] like the instruction were like very specific so
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
eleven questions and then lepas tu (um) the eleven questions tu like [ah] the marks were different [lah] for each questions the marks all very different like some were three marks some were two marks some were ten marks like the maximum was like ten marks [ah] so like (um)
[ah] for like for each question (err) (um) my lecturer specified [ah] like (um) berapa banyak words
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then (um) [ah] she also specified [lah] like (um) the (uh)
number of references needed like how many references needed for each ya so it's like like some some of the questions i feel like (um) macam [ah] tak make tak make sense [ah] cause like (err) questions two marks [jer] atau three marks but like (uh) dia nak
dia nak (um) the words like limit dia like two hundred fifty like can you imagine like a like a two or three marks question with like a minimum of like hundred fifty to two hundred fifty words
it's quite a lot actually ya i mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like i would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard [ah] i i don't know it's like (um) it's the questions were not hard it's just that i find that (um)
we had to like really (um) arrange like how do i how do we answer it like to meet the requirements so it was like (um) time consuming [lah] [ah] which explains why maybe she like kasi us twenty four hours untuk buat
ya
eleven essays
ya twenty four hours eleven essays i didn't like tak tidur cause like ya i mean it's not that i didn't take breaks in between [ah] but then i did take a lot of breaks in between to be honest
cause like
cause
ya ya i did i finish way earl~ way ahead of (um) the the the the submission period
[lah] cause i cause i honestly feel that (um) the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what i mean ya
ya and then then nanti last last you'll be like rushing rushing and then like (err) everything is like all over the place then you'll be like panic and then like you know and then like for i like what (um) like for for me that the twenty four hours (uh) punya exam it was like macam
(uh) it was penat [ah] but then like
but then like (uh) how do i say this dia macam
you you
the questions were okay like just now i say [kan] it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like (uh) my back was like crying for help
my back crying for help and then ya and (um) like mata sakit and everything so macam (err) no it's not very like ya it's the worst [ah] i would say the whole the whole
ya from from i think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all i i feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your (um) attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like (err) i don't know i just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse [eh] and then like (um) like like like (uh)
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay i exp~ like i like same as you [ah] i expected like worse cause i feel like (um) some of the modules they were like quite (uh) heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like i i i've i was like very very (um) drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like (mm) like i was quite satisfied with (um) my results [lah] cause
i think the i think the lecturers are being (uh) quite lenient [lah]
like if they weren't lenient maybe i would don't think boleh lepas
ya ya
ya
cause like you know you know there are times like (um) (uh) like i i attended like online lectures but then like macam like i was there but i was asleep
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[eh] you know what was funny i i've been in the same situation
ya ya ya serious tak bedek
all okay cause i had this like (um) [ah] i ada kelas ni eight thirty [tau] eight thirty a_m in the morning so like
i mean being at home obviously your macam sleeping schedule semua all over the place [kan] like you just like you will sleep at like three a_m like two a_m like very late lepastu like it's a struggle to wake up in the morning obviously so like ya but then like even though like (uh) (um) the what apa nama dia
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
ya so i didn't want to like affect my attendance so like like every time like eight thirty a_m i will wake up just in time like for the lecturer to share the like google meet link [ah] i would join lepastu the minute i join and then like right [ah] terus i i would just go to sleep
and then every time when i wake up the class is done like the lecturer is not even there anymore then she left the google meet and i'm still there i mean i i honestly think (uh) i bukan sorang cause [ah] when i woke up then i will see like two to three people
in in the google meet and i'm like okay i think we are all in the same boat ya cause no i i really feel like macam
cannot [ah]
i really cannot i mean physically physical classes eighty thirty i really feel like it's already (um) not a good idea to like take up eight thirty classes [ah] apa lagi [eh] online like tak boleh !oi!
so i'm like virtually i'm there but i'm really not physically i'm just somewhere else
[eh] tapi lecturers you semua like
they were were they like mostly lenient or like they were do you had like some macam trouble juga with certain lecturers
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(uh huh) (uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) faham
[ah] cause
for me like [ah] for me right (um)
most of my lecturers okay [lah] i i guess like they are trying to make it things easy for us and also for them i mean it's it's two-way [kan] macam if they make things harder for us it will be harder for them also so it's like they were trying their best i guess and cause it's semua benda macam very baru untuk semua orang
i think everyone macam masih nak adapting to the whole new situations so it's like (uh) i i appreciate that (uh) lecturers i macam they were they were okay [lah] but then i did have macam trouble dengan some
lecturers [ah] cause like i don't know why [ah] tak tahu kenapa [ah] tapi like i ada satu lecturer ni she was like (um)
i don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
i mean ya i don't know i don't know why [ah] cause i've i i i don't (err) i don't macam i tak i don't really like her style of like how she organises the whole (um) the way she conducts a whole the whole class it's like
(um) cause it's online [kan] abeh macam she doesn't
she expects us to (err) macam
gone through everything i mean technically of course we have to go through everything on our own mostly like have to do our readings and everything i mean faham [lah] we have to do that obviously but then it was like i would say like ninety percent like the whole coursework that ninety percent had to be depended on ourselves
ya so macam it wasn't helpful [lah] she was expecting us to only come to her only bila kita ada questions so it was like very hard for me like [ah] apa [eh] like macam cause especially i don't have my books with me so like
i i left my books in malaysia we had to rush back to singapore like during the m_c_o so we didn't i didn't have time to pack up whatever i need so it was just like take whatever i whatever i needed and then just balik singapore but then like you know so i had i had to leave my books and i really i really i use my books for references like to do readings and everything
ya i mean cause i i don't like i don't like online i really cannot like absorb things online so i prefer like reading like physical books and then like extracting the like macam apa tu the points and everything but then my lecturer was like
she was like as like for like every week
[ah] dia akan cakap [ah] apa tu
dia akan cakap okay this is the topic we're going to [ah] this is the topic that you have to you have to read any questions ask me and then she would upload right upload like pre-recorded lectures with slides but only like
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
on our own so macam i was like [ah] it wasn't like helpful at all i was like i didn't understand like a lot of things and then like i was like having trouble then i tried my best to like find resources online whatever it is [lah] to to understand to faham [kan]
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy (um) course so it's like i i feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students [ah] i i honestly feel that way i mean
i i understand that she she wants like kita nya level to be like of really university students tapi macam
[ah] in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful [lah]
i mean cause cause she makes everything a bit complicated like the whole process of the whole coursework it was like very very leceh like from the from the submissions and then to the assignments like she was like very particular about a lot of things they were macam banyak gila benda nak kena like we had to follow hers her format
and it was very very leceh and then like
it was very leceh and then time consuming and everything so and then it was group work and which is wors~ which was worse cause (uh) (uh) i had to handle dengan all those (um) group members who are just useless
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
working team members which was hard [lah] cause i mean you know assignments are like supposed it's very heavy and it's supposed to be like macam equally divided [kan] tapi like like the pressure was more on like the lesser lesser working members the more work needs to be done right for each member
so i was like [ah] it was very frustrating cause like for me i don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
like i feel that i don't know i i'm just like (um) malas [ah] want to layan like
like you know all these drama so i will just be like i do my work like whoever wants to do it do it and then we just proceed if people care enough they would ask the progress [ah] of it but you know some did some did not so it was like [ah] whatever like really i don't care cause for me i care about my grades like you did dorang tak kesah then dorang punya pasal [ah]
but then like for me like i really i really care about my grades so it's like for me i don't want to deal with like such like such group members so is like [ah] whatever [ah] suka hati [ah] nak buat pape pun boleh [lah] ya like ya it's like
like apa tu
(uh) apa nama dia like you know like bila physically like with physically it's very hard to meet up with group members like what else online right it's worse
especially when like
(um) like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating [kan]
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
(um) and then (uh) like for like certain my other lecturers like they they decided like like yours [ah] similar to yours like dorang kasi kita choose (um) nak apa tu nak individual atau group work so it was like okay [lah] i i honestly prefer individual assignments so i don't have to like deal with anyone you know you just get to settle it on your own
ya ya ya
ya ya ya i mean
ya ya ya i mean it's your own your own (uh) i mean it's kind of scary [lah] to do be doing ass~ assignments like individually tapi macam you know it's much easier cause you get things done faster i mean not faster faster but you know what i mean [kan] like faster in terms of like you just have you just you just do it on do it on your own don't have to like go having to ask or like you know divide work and everything
ya ya exactly exactly exactly ya it's all like on your own so macam settle [lah] senang [kan] habis cerita [eh] but serious i'm not looking forward to the upcoming semester or the summer semester cause i'm taking are you taking the summer semester
[oh] dah start dah
[oh] okay that's early i mean
we just finished exams right

tengok [jer] check [jer] it's just like see just see [jer] like i i'm i do i would i'm not really active [lah] in terms of like posting stuff [ah] but i'm very active just being online and like seeing like post by other people [lah]
not like really really must those people who really post like stories like every day and then like have those like really small dots on their i_g stories tak [ah] i'm not like that just that i just like enjoy like watching stories of other people then like macam look at other people's posts and then stalk people
not really stalk but like macam look at their profiles and like you know random stuff like really random stuff
i don't know is it
ya ya ya ya ya ya
like macam
i don't know [ah] it's just very fun to like read people's like thoughts for me [ah] macam i really macam enjoy macam baca baca tengok
like it
ya ya ya ya tapi like macam it just makes you like macam talk to yourself like macam [eh]
like [eh] interesting [eh] [ah] macam you know got those kind of things like is
sometimes people like express their opinions like openly [kan]
which like macam i really like ya i mean i really respect those kind of people cause i'm i would say i orang dia i'm very i'm kind of very i very opinionated actually it's just that i don't really express it out openly
ya i mean ya i mean when i do i do [ah] but i don't do it like all the time like when i really have things to like really express it out i would tapi macam selalunya (mm) no that's why i really admire people who really can talk about things like especially macam
[kan]
ya
they will just
ya ya ya exactly exactly
[kan] [kan] [kan] [kan]
ya
ya ya ya
[ah]
(uh huh) (uh huh) ya ya ya ya
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) ya ya ya
cause like
macam apa tu
like you see when like people really like speak up on like (uh) like current issues like i i really really want to like i really wish i could macam kadang-kadang macam [eh] like !ee! i really like like at the back of my head [kan] macam there were like a lot of things [tau] i really want to say a lot of things but then like i macam [oh] like (uh)
it's like ya i mean i know what to say
okay [what]
(mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya cause for me right (um) i i i sometimes that i really i know what to say i know what to say it's just that i don't know if i will be able to word it in a way that people understand where i'm coming from you know
[ah] (uh) ya exactly so it's like especially when when things are like like all these sensitive issues right i really wish kadang-kadang i boleh just cakap [jer] tapi
(mm) i really can't i really can't i don't know how but i really can't cause
i i feel that (um) my knowledge or like current issues it's not like i'm not fully equipped on that like i'm still like i still it's not i'm not i don't like (um) follow up on what what's happening [kan] tapi like i feel like
no matter like how much i'm updated with what's going on i feel like i'm still don't have enough knowledge like like the lack of knowledge in me to really macam go out there and speak up about things like this [ah]
i really i really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like i mean especially when people like (um) people reply and they have like (err) like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a cer~ they will somehow have like a certain discussion
like between like another user and then it's like [oh] no i would i will never do that i mean even though like
ya ya ya i mean like for me macam kadang-kadang like i feel i takut kat walaupun
my my twitter is like private like private account tapi
!huh! tapi i i i feel like macam like even if i were to tweet it out like i i i will just so scared of being judged even though like my my followers are actually quite limited [ah] tapi you know you just have that like fear of people like judging you even if it's not judging you people i i'm i'm afraid of people having like certain like impression of me for having like certain opinions on things you know
[kan]
ya exactly exactly
ya ya exactly [oh] really i mean then
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah] yes yes yes
ya i mean cause ya cause things like this like you really need you really have to know your way around words [kan] like you don't want to macam you don't want people to misunderstand what you say at same time you don't want to hurt their feelings
in a way you know you you just want it to be like a general kind of like (um) discussion like a healthy one [lah] like you don't end up being like ya you know end up like in like fights or whatever i don't know it's just really cool i find it like macam very cool for people to be doing that
ya ya i mean they are very percep~ receptive receptive they are very receptive [ah] so macam okay that's good that's really good then that's what that's what i find very interesting about twitter [ah]
ya ya i mean
i mean i i find out a lot of things from twitter twitter is like my go to i would say macam go to newspaper [ah]
apa
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(um) sometimes sometimes
sometimes memang (mm) (mm) sometimes memang tired [ah] actually we would like sometimes you feel like something it does get overwhelming to me tapi
(mm) cause you feel that sometimes as much as you enjoy reading like people's opinions right you feel that sometimes people are just like the the opinions that you read or whatever tweets that people tweet right it's sometimes if you feel like they screaming at you i don't know sometimes i feel like everyone is being too expressive about everything
sometimes for me ya like it's like [ah] sometimes i feel like [ah] i get i get tired sometimes i get tired so like you know sometimes you just have to like (uh) just take a break from it but like it's still like you know a few days and then like [oh] okay can can already [ah] then you know activate back and then like okay already
ya cause i feel that sometimes like as much as there are a lot of like healthy discussions online there's still like those people who like to force the opinions on other people which is of course not healthy like you know and these are people like you find like
(uh)
penat [ah] baca dorang nya tweets
it's like (uh) like i mean
ya i mean like sometimes you like i mean i get what you want to say but then sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that people won't like have that same opinion as you you know
you know
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya ya ya
ya ya
i think it's just how it is right you can't you can't get like semua orang to agree what you what you what you have to say it's just the fact that you know when you like express things out you have to like brace yourself for like you know back lashes and everything cause confirm have one
[eh]
what
what
my instagram

i feel like i i as much as macam i respect orang lain punya way of using social media sometimes i rasa macam people exposed too much and i don't want to know faham ke
(mm) like i mean as much as like suka hati [lah] you nak buat apa dengan you punya instagram tapi sometimes know what they share sometimes buat me uncomfortable so macam i sometimes tak nak tengok ya so i macam okay ya [ah]

[oh] my god how cannot
no i mean
okay i mean okay [ah] i think for me right even if you want to keep things like quote unquote macam traditional [kan] i would at least use email [lah] you know
i mean
you know letters really take a very long time and it's like all the way to #medina# so macam !wow! for me i'm i'm very impatient person so macam
but that one email [lah] i cannot [ah] letters
like kira macam you know it's like kira macam you have to really
tulis a lot of things you wanted to to really really update you know everything in like one letter then you have to send it all the way
i i think it's cute [lah] but then it's just something that i don't think i would i would want to go through
[ah] i see
(err) okay okay
i mean they they macam taking it taking it slow [ah]
right taking it slow faham faham
[oh]
!huh! what that's not taking it slow !huh! serious
it's so weird
it
[oh] okay okay okay [oh] that's even more traditional
[eh] but but like personal question personal question
perso~ per~ personal question personal question
like
macam would you
would you like if macam let's say your parents nak matchmake you would you would you like be open to it
if [lah] if
what
really
like your your current love life
you would or you wouldn't
[oh] wouldn't
[eh] okay okay interesting interesting
but then okay okay okay okay okay i mean look okay if you were to change the situation [kan] macam for example
since you cakap you ada someone already like kira you are seeing someone tapi like if you were to change like the whole situation for example (um) if you are done with your studies [kan] dah habis belajar then like you not dating anyone
would you you would [ah]
you would [ah] okay interesting
(mm) (um)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
faham
really you ask before
!alamak! tapi nak cari dekat mana
really [oh] my god
!alamak!
faham
[oh] my
okay understood understood
(mmhmm)
you will be open to it [ah] interesting interesting (mm) i don't know cause
!hais! i i feel like
for okay bila comes to like my love life right i i'm the type of person yang if we vibe we vibe [ah] so if like from the start if we can't really click then i don't think that that's like hope in it so i will just like you know what it's not it's not happening so ya so to be matchmake right (mm) i think for someone like me it's gonna be hard [lah] it's gonna be very hard
ya cause
i
[ah] i lebih prefer things to be like to happen like naturally
i mean i mean i know [lah] like macam like when it comes to like matchmaking like it's like it it takes time you have to like get to know the person and stuff
which macam i am open to like getting to know people but then the the hard part is like is like when you when you really get to know the person and everything it's like it's it's a whole new thing where you will have to decide whether like is it really going to work out or like you know those kind of thing so macam
so macam i don't know i'm so like to answer your question i tak sure [ah] whether i can actually
go on with it or not it depends who depends on the like candidate that it's been picked for me but then again like [ah] similar [lah] to your parents my parents tak macam gitu [ah] so ya
dorang macam [ah] cari sendiri they don't ya they don't meddle with my love life
i mean i would say my non-existent love life [lah] as of right now
so ya
maybe maybe maybe if i'm like desperate enough then maybe [lah]
maybe like really like reach a certain age then i think i should get married and i don't have anyone then maybe [ah] i will resort to that but like
(um) i nak [lah] tapi you know i feel like i've other things to settle think like love is like the last thing i would want to think about [ah]
like i think i have other things to like think about like right now like like i need i need to figure out what i want to do with my degree
and then you know from there on like more on like working on myself first [lah] then i can think of like things cause like i don't know like to have like sekarang to have love life like right now
it's like (mm) not much ideal for me [ah] cause i feel that i don't even have time for myself like i'm just so busy with school so like to to have like someone in my life right now it's like (um)
ya it's not that it's going to distract me [ah] it's just that i don't i don't know if i can actually fully commit to it you know
ya it's more of that cause like you know obviously school would come first i just so busy with school i'll just be so caught up with school i don't think i would have time for my significant other if i were to ever have one like right now
ya ya ya ya that's why so (um) malas [lah] also like
(mm) cause like i had like previous like history with like bad breakups so it's like i really malas and tired want to like start again and to to meet someone new no i don't want
ya ya ya malas [ah]
i really don't want i just macam (uh) like i would
i would just like i like currently just enjoy that like the apa company of like my friends regardless of gender [lah] like whatever guy or girl just like enjoy it being friends (mm) but nothing beyond that i hope
ya for now for now [lah]
but we're like what like what age like do you think you get married
(mm)
do you have an aim like macam at like age apa umur berapa
[ah] after your studies
like twenty three
i thought so too
i thought so too
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] jokes on me right jokes on us
no like i'm finishing my studies and yet
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
i think
i think everyone would think like macam they would get married like after their studies no like everything will be nicely like arranged but right now i'm like
i'm like entering final year and like look at my look at my love life it's just crying for help so it's like no i think (um) if possible then i would say i would give myself like hopefully the next five years or so
minimum
like maybe to build like my career first and everything then i can think about other stuff
cause like i think to just have degree is not enough so like i feel like i need to like (um) [oh] like what do i say how do i say this macam build up build myself up more in terms of education baru macam stable
to have like better jobs and everything [kan] to have like like a proper stable career then like then then can [lah] then boleh [lah] then can [lah]
[eh] it's good catching up with you though

(mm) ya you know when you don't have like classes
[ah] [ah] [ah] betul
okay then bye take care
bye
it's so long since i've seen you
so how are you
[oh] really
how is it
[oh]
[oh] !wah! not bad [sia] the job like quite chill for me i've been like searching for jobs because like susah [lah] like i don't know if what i should do with my life right now because i i'm contemplating between like design atau like just a normal working job like not design related
so ya because like i i wanted to go uni right but i didn't get in so i will try next year but for now like i need to find a job so is quite difficult [lah] because of the pandemic also it's like (uh) it's like very limited with the jobs so (hmm)
[oh] [ah] cashier job
[oh] that no that one temporary i mean they did ask me to extend [lah] but i it's not something that i want to do for like a long term you get what i mean ya ya cause like cause i work you know at n_t_u_c there right like as the cashier so have to deal with like a lot of like like for you [lah] your one is also elderly right then
ya we also have to deal with a lot of elderly like for example like [ah] we got n_t_u_c we got the you know the senior senior discount right on like certain days so i think it's ya no no no it's (uh) like (uh) for the elderly citizens like those sixty years old and above right if they buy their groceries on like for example wednesday they get a discount
so ya then sometimes some of the elderly like they confuse with the dates of bila nak apa itu bila nak bila got the discount right so (um) sometimes they will pick a fight [lah] but like (uh) (uh) i'm used to it already they will be like [eh] today don't have the discount [meh] you sure or not ya then i like (uh)
ya so that's why i'm not working there anymore because it's quite difficult
right [oh] really [ah]
as in she working [oh]
[oh]
ya [eh] she working as cashier also [ah] (mm)
[oh] my god kesian apa like i okay [lah] because my one like everyone was very nice though like all the (uh) aunties were very nice to me and like all the manager and supervisor they were damn nice like ya okay except for the weirdos but like because
(um) i think i got make like a few mistakes [lah] once because i was just new what then i like had to do the cashier all by myself right because usually at the start right they the aunty will be beside you to help you so like after like a few weeks right then [ah] you have to do the cashier part alone
so ya then i got make a few mistakes like like something to do with the money [lah] i mean ya then after that (uh) the manager and the supervisor didn't scold me so i guess that's good like they were very nice about it ya even though it was ya
ya [lah] we need to pay back ya we need to pay back but like below five dollar don't need to pay back but if above five dollar need [lah] ya but so far never [ah]
[oh] ya got this one point of time when i was just new then like i was doing with the aunty [lah] so apparently like i think i miscalculated [leh] then got like a shortage of like ten dollars you know like ten dollars or more
ten dollars more ya because i think was fifteen dollars so five dollar offset right and ten dollars she need to pay well i i was supposed to pay [ah] cause i think i was the one that did the mistake [lah] then after that my aunty insist that she will pay for me so i felt so touched by her ya because they they're all very nice there ya ya i think it depends on the outlet [lah]
ya
[oh] my god
[ah] so nice luckily the uncle
ya i also got something like that because [ah] in n_t_u_c we got the self self checkout right that you know the counter so there are times when you know some of the customers right dia orang tap they tap the card but then they never like wait so they will just leave
so ya i don't know if it's like some of them may be on purpose or what [lah] but okay maybe there are others who really not on purpose then sometimes the card will have a error like they will say try again or payment not accepted or something so that means
like that means the apa itu the the money didn't go through so ya then ya then most of the times right we have to chase after the customer and then sometimes right we cannot even like sometimes if we lose track of the customer then we are the one that have to pay for it because if we don't like
[ah] pay on the spot right then the machine cannot use like ya so that's why is like we have to be like attentive [lah] also but also some of the customers like i think [ah] some of them are like purposely like never pay then they just walk off ya
ya ya cause some some of like okay [lah] the one that time cause i work with sophia right then she had to pay like how much [ah] eighteen dollars like she had to pay ya because the customer walk off then like she cannot find a customer
ya ya luckily only eighteen [sia] imagine if the person buy like hundred dollar plus or what !wah! that one is like is like one week pay [leh]
[oh] ya okay i wanted to talk about the the ya wait what's her name #fadreena# is it #fadreena# so you met her from c_c_a right the try out
(hmm)
[oh] no okay wait so my friend [ah] i don't know if you know her [lah] is she's the one that wear the hijabi she i mean hijab the she's my secondary school friend [lah]
so apparently she and the #fadreena# they are in the same course i believe it's ya same course but they are not classmates [lah] so apparently (uh) my friend she went to japan that exchange program with the school right
then lepas itu (err) this girl #fadreena# (um) i think she was like alone on the trip or what so like my friend and her other friend right they like okay [lah] i ask her to come join her also i mean join them as well so at first it was like okay [ah]
then after that the few the next few days [kan] (um) the #fadreena# was like getting close to my friend's friend so like there were times when they would just like she would like go into the hotel room right
and then asked the friend to like teman her at her room cause her room is like not the same as my friend's rooms so she like sleep separately [ah] then after that right my friend was alone [lah] like she was left alone [lah]
then like [ah] the japan trip also like she was the #fadreena# was like very like i don't know like the vibes of her was very off and then like they cannot click because i think also #fadreena# like i don't think you know her much [lah] but her personality quite strong
ya then there was this one point of time i think they were like making fun of each other [lah] #fadreena# and my friend then because [ah] then like she they i mean she said something hurtful about my friend like say (uh) i forgot what [ah]
like she say about my friend's height because my friend is very short [mah] so she thought said about the height then obviously my friend hurt [lah] then she my friend like we like how to say [ah] (err) like she kena back my she kena back #fadreena# then #fadreena# not happy so ya and then after that like it wasn't like their relationship very like (ugh)
very bad from then then [ah] [oh] ya recently cause that time i met with her so the my friend #naziha# right she said like the #fadreena# sent her a long long text
saying like (um) what [ah] why you go around behind my back saying about me and all that when the last time they talk right was like two years ago because that that the the japan trip was like two years ago [mah]

(uh) (uh)
then which one which one your most favourite [ah] mana satu
(mm)
ya ya alright
me what school
now i in s_p [ah]
singapore poly [ah] that's
(mm)
my course [ah] my course is (uh) d_m_r also known as apa (uh) marine engineering
like dia macam (um) okay so basically
like my job progression [kan] lepas
(err) apa (err) diploma [kan] is like working either apa the sailing or or at a shipyard gitu [ah]
so like okay so
(err) for like my third year [kan]
okay for third year aku rasa (uh) aku what [ah]
need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job [ah]
so like
so like (um) for me i i pick the shipyard job [ah] because i heard of like very good like (uh) what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing [ah] because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing (uh) bila kau sail [kan] (uh) macam
enam months like that
six month gitu [ah] away from your families [lah] which i don't think i personally think i cannot [ah] you know
ya that's why [ah] cannot [ah] you know
for me i don't know [ah] we usually we like homesick [ah] you know so i go
on overseas
but it's definitely something aku macam look forward to [ah] like in in the future [ah] gitu
[ah]
then also apa [eh] s_p d_m_r okay (um) apa dia [eh] [oh] okay
c_c_a
(uh) i haven't pick yet [ah] any c_c_a yet
but like i planning to [ah] so now apa [eh] (uh) my first year [kan] [ah] i only got to like try out the different c_c_a [ah] so like we all can like
apa choose [ah] the diff~ diff~ various types of sports or
club activities [kan] so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
kat sekolah we you can choose [ah] so i for the fir~ for me i pick the apa floorball [lah] like something new [lah] for me like i never try before [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
apa [eh] (uh)
okay [ah] i find floorball quite interesting [ah] like
quite fun [ah] you know enjoyable your [ah] kawan kawan you know quite fun [ah]
but like honestly it's not something i like [ah] as a sport [ah] you know if
apa sport i prefer
[ah] apa [eh] okay s_p got offer quite a few sport [ah]
you know you got apa soccer and basketball got tchoukball gitu
but i i don't know [ah] for poly i maybe won't pick like apa [eh]
(uh) sports c_c_a [ah] i will definitely choose something else [ah]
maybe like okay so for s_p they got clubs [ah]
(uh) clubs as in macam
okay so you know got different schools right
got like the engineering dia ada punya business
then you got my school [lah] called s_m_a the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs [ah]
so my one is (uh) s_m_a club
then macam
i was planning to join [ah] in the first year tapi
apa [eh] (uh) tak dapat like you must go for apa
(uh) interview [eh] (um) when you first join then they prompt you to join then i apply [kan] then i went for the interview
like i talk banyak tau
i like talk a lot for the interview but then i tak dapat you know
[ah] that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then i like !walao! [eh]
[ah]
ya that's why
but hopefully if i tried apply again dapat [ah]
[ah] that's why (mm)
ya ya true [ah] it's okay [lah]
sports
clubs [ah] i think clubs can [ah] but i think you if i not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you s_m_e you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can [ah] s_p so possible
kay
so like for you [kan]
your school what what course you take [ah] for you i know you are in year one but what course [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then what are the modules you will like learn
like for your course other than like programming gitu
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) okay
[ah]
for me personally [kan] (uh) i enjoy the apa workshop [ah] not for like year one
because i apa secondary school i pilih [ah] what as my elective i pick d&t okay design and technology [ah]
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me [lah] cause i got experience in secondary school [kan]
so like for me is (uh) is fun [lah] cause it's actually something new [ah] some s- some of the what (uh) workshop practice or something you like welding (uh) you got the two types of welding macam gas welding ngan apa
arc welding [ah] something new [ah] then i macam lepak lepak you know
but (err) on workshop cause i workshop [ah] aku rasa macam four hours [ah] gitu
[ah] like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is (uh) about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get a [ah] you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun [ah] for me
really enjoy [ah] cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun [lah]
ya
ya
then okay for my course right (uh) they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like (uh) different kind of apa [eh] dia punya skills [ah]
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three [ah] is where like the interesting part [lah]
cause no no no before the internship [kan]
(err) apa they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like dia macam ada
what [ah] the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine (uh) fuel system you know so like for us (uh) students right before we go for internship right you must understand [ah] all these kind of (uh) machinery how it works
cause if we just go for (uh) what [ah]
if you just go for interview [eh] no sorry my bad but instead of interview apa [eh] (uh) internship when you go for internship (err) what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what i mean
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills [ah] before our internship
[oh] what also [ah]
[oh] ya there's one interesting thing i i learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this (mm)
[eh] they have this like a room a chamber room if i'm not wrong is the
(uh)
(uh) purifier room okay purifier room is macam like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right (err) you are given if i'm not wrong is part of a test [ah] it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like (uh) as the water level rises so it's about five minutes [ah] it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
if i'm not wrong kita will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the wat~ okay eventually the wat~ water level will rise [lah] but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast [ah] ya
ya
ya that's why
that test [ah] honestly i haven't experienced yet [ah] cause i only year two now [ah] but something i look forward to [ah]
but for me because i choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me [ah] cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly macam like inspection you know like okay as
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or (err) what you call the inspector [lah] so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
i'm looking forward to like go into [lah] like that [ah] ya
ya hopefully [ah] (mmhmm)
not bad [ah] not bad [ah]
ape benda like other things i do other than in school [lah]
kay for me right apa [eh] (uh) in my free time i like to game you know
spend a lot of time playing game [ah]
but then like okay okay firstly i start when i game right (uh) i start off with mobile gaming [ah] then i started moving to apa dia punya competitive scene [ah]
(oo) #shiok# [ah] i tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two [ah] then the prizes macam (uh) gift card vouchers so like as a student i wou~ i would not want to miss out right
gitu
(mm) so something [ah]
something to kill time also [ah] in secondary school you know
then for you [eh] your free time what you normally do [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what s_p got any c_c_a i join right then for you [eh] cause like you know you are like
(uh) year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any c_c_a for your poly have or not
legit [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(oo)
(mm)
so okay [ah] based on my experience right
if okay i think you should honestly go for the trials first [ah] cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a c_c_a like promoting c_c_a for you to join right so you go see [lah] which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you i i personally i know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
ya so you obviously ada experience [kan]
so maybe you can make it to what (uh) #temasek# poly (uh) floor ball team [ah] who knows [ah]
ya who knows who knows but i know the t_p floor ball team very competitive [ah]
know
(mm) can [lah] you just you just go for it [ah] dulu
see which one you like the most y'know
[oh]
today [ah] i just finished my
last paper you know today
[ah] okay [lah] because like semalam i got study like the whole night you know like macam two a_m
(uh) got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one p~ one two hour paper
[oh] my goodness legit
so much to study
okay [ah] hopefully hopefully [ah] hopefully hopefully can pass [ah]
but then [ah] after the paper like
at three p_m gitu i went for an appointment [ah]
for what [ah]
it's for like
how should i say macam
for my
infection [ah] or it's like how to say it's like a pimple [lah] you know in a sense and it bleeds [ah] so i have to go for appointment [ah]
check up first
and i read up ya it it's very painful and very itchy you know
but then i read up [ah] or on this right it's actually called the pilonidal cyst you know
and it's like ya is what very pai~ what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then i read up read up then they say apa [eh] (uh) it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so i immediately have to go down for consultation [ah] s~ so like okay to~ i pick today's date because i thought like apa [eh]
(uh) it's a weekday and there will be there won't be a lot people [ah]
but then when i went there [ah] my goodness
like legit a lot of people [ah] i tell you !alamak!
legit all the makcik makcik atuk atuk !oi! all queuing up [lah]
!wah! then i have to wait you know for like what one hour for my turn [ah]
i register then i have to wait one hour !alamak! no
then you're so crammed you know
[oh] my goodness
some reason i thought week day three plus
nobody will be there [what] right but then got a lot of people [ah] should have picked another day
the surgery [ah] okay so like kay just now i went for the appointment right then the doctor right keep
advising on the surgery
like okay [ah]
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery [ah] cause like i'm only eighteen [kan]
then like it will affect my future [ah]
cause whe~ this surgery is it's like
quite risk [ah] quite high risk [ah]
have to like what cut open that [one] put me on anaesthesia
gitu then
once they cut open they take out the apa
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
(uh) pull a skin
macam a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
so i cannot imagine [ah] [a'ah]
[ah] confirm painful [sia] legit
but
ya i think it's like two months from now [ah]
if i'm not wrong [ah]
ya man
ya hopefully [ah] don't know [ah]
i quite worried also [ah]
like you know might affect you know
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya hopefully [ah] why need to happen [ah]
ya
!wah! honestly right i just i just worried man
cause i go in only they got like a lot of doctors you know i think there was about
three doctors in the room [ah] then they wanted to inspect the you know you know
the wound
then i like quite scared [ah] then they start pinching pinching the wound then a lot of like the
apa [eh]
the fluid [ah] come out then the blood all come out then i damn scared [ah]
it was damn painful [ah]
for some reason i don't know [ah] damn worried [ah] but overall okay [lah] i i
in two months' time i have to meet the doctor again at hospital you know maybe go for the surgery [ah]
[ah] don't know [lah]
whatever [ah] okay [lah] good good [ah]
ya i also cannot imagine [sia]
(mm)

like for this semester one [kan] (uh) i have this (uh) project called s_i_p the module name is s_i_p which is apa [eh] (uh)
so~ social innovation project [ah] (uh) ya
so like (uh) we all macam is
i think combined with
(uh) different types of (uh) people from different courses [ah] so like
(uh)
(uh) two from d_m_r then macam two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for apa (uh)
to do a project together so basically this like
what s_p is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry [ah]
so s_p equips you with this kind of skill [lah] but let me tell you something [ah] i do not like working with this kind of people legit i tell you [ah]
cause like (err) it's damn #rabak# i tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like !walao! [eh] why why got so much workload [ah] [ah] i don't want do [ah] like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
[ah]
like this
ya
[ah] then okay okay this [one] [ah] it happen like
macam a few weeks ago before our final group project so like (uh) it was during (uh) hari raya haji right
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal [ah] for our presentation slides
then these guys right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to (uh) help them with something and present then when i tell them macam i say i cannot [ah] i like damn busy today i got my
my hari raya hari raya haji i need celebrate [ah]
then
[oh] then they say [eh] why like that we you the only malay just come [lah] then i say how can like that i holiday [what] hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then i got damn pissed off you know legit
[oh] my god then i just say i i don't i don't give a shit okay legit i'm i'm not coming then they was like complaining [ah] keep swearing to me i i don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school des~ designs right
they should know the different type of apa
(err) the type of programs dia punya different types of software [ah] to do like animation ke
or like do some drawing design [kan]
tapi [kan] i tell you [ah] these guys [kan] is even the girls tau
they diorang semua they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when i come from engineering you know i have no background knowledge of apa different type of drawing you know
[ah] !alamak! legit i tell you i don't want [ah] but it's okay [lah]
ya but overall i think it's a good experience [lah]
s_i_p cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together [ah]
and also ya it's good [lah] so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made (uh) okay you know for our project our aim right
is to help people with depression you know so like apa [eh] (uh) we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
to help people with depression intregate~ integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if us~ usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely [kan]
[ah] they are like damn lonely right
!alamak! why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
more with macam (err) people [ah] online people online [ah] like strangers you know not in not strangers [lah]
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use [ah] then we decided to come up with something interesting for them [lah] cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
(uh) our the depression app [ah] counter
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing [ah] like apa the apa the
pikachu [ah] pokemon go you know or not pokemon go concept ya
ya
then our app also ada you have (err) what [ah] you have the therapy consultation tab
kay so what's so special about this tab right
(uh) when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app [kan] they can (uh) what [ah] (uh)
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual a_i controls right so when they talk then they type right say (uh) how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
(mm) it's it's quite cool [lah] honestly
and also (err)
you can also prompt for
(uh) real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one inte~ (uh) what (uh) questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what i find quite cool [lah] ya
ya (um) and also for our app right (uh) we also put what [ah]
(uh) since like most of us like like to game [ah] like we
most (um) people like to game like they download apps for what
(uh) games right
for most people right then
[ah] our app introduces like some mini short games [ah] so you got heard of (uh) what kind of games [ah] (err) like fun run have you heard of fun run
[ah] fun run like the that one
the run what i say
so~ some mini games [ah] like also we put (uh) animal crossing [ah] concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
(um)
games for the user to play with [ah] which makes our app interesting [ah]
ya a lot of people [ah]
(mm)
ya so our app
since our app is based on (uh) like i said the apa [eh] the macam pokemon [kan] like the virtual pet right
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins [ah] basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to macam what i decide to do [ah]
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
so like the shop right we also have a shop [ah] the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put (err) like the what [ah] poke food poke food includes like the apa
[ah]
what ramen or some like cookie [eh]
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of pokemon [ah] which is i think quite cool [ah] so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so i think it's like something like
people
will look forward to [ah] ya
forward to ya
so that's about it [ah] for my s_i_p module interesting [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya ya
also got one more got one more if i'm not wrong (uh)
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two [ah]
ya semester two [ah]
it's called (err)
c_p_r [ah] communicative i can't remember [ah] what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
macam
(uh) improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach [ah] like one of them is [ah] time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance [ah] it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right [kan] do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what [ah]
what's that [ah]
[oh] your interview skills [ah]
for interview
he teach us (uh) the basic questionnaire [ah] like how to prep ourselves for interview
(err) what should we ask during an interview you know how to properly answer an interview
so i think is quite that [one] [ah] manageable
[ah]
ya
ya
so i respect [ah] s_p for doing that
y'know
cause like usually my inter~ what when i go for interviews i rarely aku macam (uh) rarely know what to say [ah]
gitu
like i always stutter you know but like how in the future how are you gonna present yourself like why why would the company want to pick you over other people [kan]
so you have to present yourself better
so which is what thi~ this module is teaching [ah]
how to how to out
outstand [ah] among the other other interviewees [ah]

ya but she do two k though i saw i saw
ya but i feel like same
but i feel it's a bit flex though cause that time the hater call her onion nose then now she really have to come back with new nose like i can afford it gitu tapi dia senyap [jer] [sia]
[a'ah]
ya that's why
if only !wah!
[oh] ya by the way you know rachel got new boyfriend already right
ya [oh] you met him in real life already [ah]
(uh) cause (um) ten august [lah] she ajak me my boyfriend go double date with her then we sewa kereta all this then cause she plan to go the escape room then i like [oh] okay [lah] on then share the sewa [lor] ya
[oh] but then (uh) i don't know if she tell you already but then the guy is wait what i want to say [ah] the guy tak salah dia punya ex masih nak berbual-berbual dengan dia lagi masih message whatsapp whatsapp dia habis rachel dapat tahu then that time she very angry cause the guy didn't tell her about the ex still messaging him
but apparently he said it's one sided [lah] cause the person keep on message but then dia tak layan sangat [lah] cause the girl very toxic last time ya that type i hope he's good to her [lah] not like the the #cheebye# #kia# ex
(uh) the ex is our age but she looks twenty five
ya legit legit (uh) next time i send you the her gambar very
[a'ah] betul betul ya
ya he haven't delete then he also belum delete the insta story all these then i tell rachel [lah] [eh] you better be a bit careful [lah] maybe he lowkey also not over her then she's like [ah] ya i will [lah]
but she say she confident that he will choose her over the girl [lah] cause the girl very toxic like don't the girl always every time must only keluar with her only he tak boleh keluar with his other friends she tak suka the other friends also
so macam like everything must be with her only that type that type of girl ya
weird [lah] [sia]
ya
(uh) (mm) true
did you see the shoes that he buy her the three hundred dollar one
[eh] salah the shoe was ya about two hundred then he also bought her another three hundred dollar marc marc jacob ke apa wallet then aku macam !wow! untung [sia] kau finally you get a man that treasure you [sia] then she's like ya i know right
ya
ya [eh] you know about the olivero also right
he we~ he weird he cannot move on over the fact that rachel already got new and better guy
do you are you in
ya and his wedding is supposed to be this month [leh] august [eh] that's why i was like wh~ the fuck
ya ni lelaki dah nak kahwin tapi masih nak emo emo over another girl [ah]
ya
did you see his close friends the latest one
the one he post something like (um) nevermind even if i'm sad i will just let them be i think he was indirectly rachel and the new guy [sia] then i show i screenshot to rachel then she was an apa [sia] dia ini ignore [jer] [lah] sudah weirdo [sia] #rilek# like he obsessed ya that's why
his soon to be wife
then what about your friend the toxic another one
a movie
tunang
(mmhmm)
for me [ah] cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you o_t o_t (um) and is very the timetable very #rabak# so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy [what] so i'm like just go for the n_s guy [lah] he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then i feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why i have to go through this again bastard [sia] the guy can could've find someone better [what]
then
what she want to do now
(um) i think she know what to do already [lah] just dump the new guy [lah] sis from what he sounds like macam buat pakai only like only use her when he need money all this then
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex [lah]
cause he doesn't sound good
i think my boyfriend would beat him up [sia]
then
how did the new guy react
(mmhmm)
okay
then tell her find new guys block both of these two
but i think right your friend loves all this drama and attention that's why she's doing nothing to stop it
but okay [lah] no [lah] i mean for like girls normal [lah] they like cause if two guys fight over you who don't like siapa tak suka i also like
if a lot of guys fight over you [oh] wh~ why like so flower like that
[a'ah] [seh]
[a'ah] [seh]
but then she not stress [meh] from all these drama
[a'ah]
yes we are like the one watching the drama not in the drama
i watch but halfway i stopped cause i waiting for the last episode
i waiting for the drama to complete then i watch everything one shot
[a'ah]

habis ini macam !fuh! like so intense
[a'ah]
but very sad [eh] cause their rating only five percent [leh] in t_v_n
like their highest was five point seven then aku macam !huh! why is such a good drama having so low ratings i think for koreans they don't like [lah] cause mental health is like a very touchy issue [what]
(mm) [oh] this one is online [one] [ah]

and [oh] ya anyways at my workplace got this weird pakcik [lah] [sia] cause dia apa itu he is like the senior worker there and then he work there for like over ten years already and then after that dia macam like i think cause he's divorced so dia macam desperate sikit then every time got new girl right in the workplace
he will target [lah] [oh] but he never target me [lah] i think cause i'm malay not chinese so dia macam tak interested then but then dia annoying gila cause dia suka kacau aku dengan lagi satu co-worker aku ini like [eh] #su qi# why you why you never go out with #ho-tien# [ah] the other guy name is #ho-tien# [ah]
why never go out with #ho-tien# [ah] why you always [ah] eat alone [one] [ah] then aku macam my problem [lah] [sial] why you #kaypoh# mind your own business then after that [ah] semalam cause dia supposed to kerja then after that [ah] [oh] ya back story is he like to
[ah] d_m this girl my other co-worker named annie but annie tak suka dia [lah] annie macam tak layan [lah] but then dia macam despo despo nak as~ dengan si annie ni then dia d_m d_m [ah] whatsapp whatsapp tapi annie semalam tak reply aku rasa dia online tapi tak reply habis lepas itu dia rage quit

cause even if the vaccine come already the job market is still #rabak# though means maybe when we twenty three baru we find a proper stable job or like twenty two
then some more they say the airline industry will only recover in twenty twenty four so we can only travel properly by twenty four years old i want to cry [lah] [sial] lama [seh] by that time i'm like almost thirty [eh]
[a'ah] [sial]
ya that's why
five years
our
ya that's why
[a'ah] [seh] [oh] ya my boyfriend say even if the j_b border open right now quite risky to go also cause the people there confirm like macam the jobs very low then people there are like desperate so must be careful of your belongings cause they might rob you
cause before covid already got a lot of robbery case now confirm higher some more they see singaporean got money then snatch away your bag
!huh! really i thought that one u_s_a malaysia i think need [ah]
i think they like don't care don't care like that [ah]
sama [lah]
just like the donald trump say right (um) there can be no coronavirus cases if you don't get checked
then aku macam [sial] [lah] dia ni bodoh [sial] bodoh [sial]
same
!hais! itu [lah]
same that's why i think he's just rich [lah] that's why cause he own a company [what] like he own the golf club also
ya he got the trump trump golf club or something [oh] and you know fun fact when he go visit other countries for like conference all this he will only go to his own golf club
so like so like he earn more [lah] you get it because when he go to his own that one then the his other like guests like this will also go with him [what] so more business for him [lah] in a sense
kedekut [eh] [a'ah] calculative [sial]
itu [lah]
dah [lah] kedekut bodoh pulak itu !alamak!
ya now the country is like whole ass movie [sia] like parody movie like that
!huh! that long [meh] i think two years ago [what] no [meh]
[oh] four years
(ugh) #rabak#
#rabak# [sial]
ya keep on every month also got new drama from him
okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
i definitely eat rendang
yes
cause
rendang actually that's a good question why tau because
i selalu makan rendang
when
hari raya but then mak mak
mak always masak like anytime she wants
so when she everytime masak i everytime makan and i love the taste of rendang
so i makan everyday [ah]
and like you~ you know i have i've ever gone
dua bulan makan rendang straight
not really [ah]
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if i were to eat
rendang with rice today
maybe in~ for my breakfast example then maybe petang makan with roti then malam makan dengan noodle
faham
yea
ya [lah] ketupat is the best [lah] definitely
you put serunding !oof!
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
!huh!
what
why
[oh] okay
actually kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan noodles and like
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
you had lemak cili api pasta
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle [what]
besides
you know the
#lanzhou# beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes !oof!
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah [oh] my god
you know just now
tender
sendu sendu apa
sedap je [lah] cakap
pekat
sendu lain [lah]
sendu lain seru pun lain
but
the what reason
pettiest
(mm)
i
i can't think of one yet you go on first
[oh] my god is that your
macam step know it all [ah]
kan
kirakan the big shot [ah]
actually i i cannot i cannot stand
people yang ego
they are like
how i say [eh]
they
well i had the answer in my mind but i don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no [lah] i mean like i'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
so macam
i just can't stand kalau orang nak macam nak step besar [ah] nak step orang yang nak step i really just cannot
kirakan dia champion [ah] kirakan dia champion
ya so like
(uh) actually
more better lebih baik
bodoh
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
[ah] this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
astaghfirullah
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya capitalism is an issue
i
it consumerism yes
i i feel like i'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
then hidup tak ada objective
tak ada makna ya because for example if someone
right now in the world when there are doctors b~ especially this kind of (uh) jobs doctors so if no o~ they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also i would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah (uh) that should be my answer but if
work in terms of because orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
ya so macam
[ah] so macam buang masa [ah] hidup
betul tak
that's what i feel [lah] because that's why i say this question is quite
i'm on th~ on the fence [ah] on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would i miss
well i'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly i'm risking my financial future
doing the job that i'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so i'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion i drop everything i ha~ i have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
(mmhmm)
yeah i get it
yeah
i i get where you're coming from
but there was an article that i read about
this guy who was forty five years old
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed banyak banyak industry he dah masuk he fail banyak
but then
at forty two [eh] forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
and then after the dia [dah] buat the apprenticeship dengan tattoo artist dia buka kedai dia sendiri
at forty five and kedai dia successful
so
i understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but (uh)
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at [ah]
(mmhmm)
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
(mmhmm) but the moral is don't give up [ah]
that's i think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
i mean
what do you mean by that
well i think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
you rasa you
dah puas with the thing you buat [kan]
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
if not sampai bila bila pun kan you tak akan
dapat that this is the life that i want
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like i said [ah] everything you explore
on after the next day
all that thing yang you dah explore remain inside your body
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at [lah]
(mmhmm)
i would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
!wow! okay
okay
that's the first wish [eh]
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when i say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when i say world peace that's what i meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this [one] it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
(um)
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
ya because when i learn a lot of this traditional stuff kan you know i did all traditional stuff
and when i learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
and susah untuk kita nak
ubah pikiran orang
yes
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
yup
i think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
i think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
that society punya ape tu what do you call it requirement
the society's
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
[oh] yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions i take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like [oh] my god i shouldn't have done this i should have done this instead i should have
i don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
(mmhmm)
i mean
that's good for you [lah] because i hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me [ah] i just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
apa
yeah you go first [ah] i tak tahu apa nak
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook [oh]
why didn't you take culinary [eh]
i think you will like breeze through that course easily
[oh] okay
because melayu always masak with agak agak
so it's nice when it's agak agak
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
(hmm)
yeah
precisely what i what i i said [lah] it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
i want the rendang italian
italian
rendang
rendang
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
i wish for the arts industry to

no no like because that's what i really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well

then at least you know where to you know who to run away from
ni hundred need to lookout ya you can see it it's gonna be huge
this
imagine you get you a hundred lipas !ee!
and horses [eh] imagine you close your eyes a hundred horses even though it's more
horses
[ah] come on you know what i'm gonna choose
doctor stranger
!duh!

yeah yeah kan i cakap
because scarlet witch is too strong for him
but this doctor strange i can go into places i can look at places i can look in the future i can look in the past i can go back and do this
there's so many things i can do
ya but i know what to do
if you i know when you gonna die
ya so like like that that that scene [lah] he went through with how many only fourteen million plus
timeline and there's only one that worked and he knew what to do
to make sure that one work

that
that aura that i bring when i'm serious it's very intimidating and
feels
for people is not approachable
that's what i got from people

(mm)
okay it's one hour already yes we did it
!yay! okay bye bye
bye
hi
hello how are you
okay okay
okay beauty in everyone
(mm)
(uh huh)
okay okay
(uh) definition of beauty [eh] okay
(uh) personally i think i don't have any good looks
so beauty to me i would define it as personality and manners adab [lah] adab e~
what about you like what's your definition of beauty
(mm)
(mm) insecurities
(mm)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) okay look before kita start [kan] (um)
okay like for you do you think beauty
(uh) okay macam mana nak cakap [eh] (um)
beauty in the long term would you ya would you for example would you friend someone who is okay because for beauty some people define it as good looks but then good looks to me (uh) i i see as a short term thing
so macam (uh) sebab kalau kita lawa pun macam mana
ten years down the road bila kita dah ageing then you know it'll be no longer as beautiful as you were
ya ya ya
ya okay so my question is like do you think (um)
(um) macam for example friendship [lah] macam kita nak buat kawan baru [kan]
would you yo~ would you go for that beauty in the short term basis or a long term basis
(um)
okay
(mmhmm)
true true true
attention ya
(mmhmm)
(um) true true
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(err) tahu tahu
#inshaallah# tak
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm) like
true true true
okay (uh)
okay okay untuk aku [kan] because poli poli aku [lah] macam what i can observe was from my course most of them most of them like
macam mana [eh] (um) define
(uh) for my course okay because my course
my course banyak cliques [tau] then (um) in the year one ya during year one we have this orientation [kan] so macam ap~ apa aku observe [kan]
they the popular ones they tend to find they tend to clique each other so like popular what my definition of popular is dia orang popular and then they are
they are very loud
ya they are very vocal [lah] then and they have good looks also so
macam for me (uh) in my course most of the cliques yang macam the big cliques right they tend to loo~ i mean they are closer to people (um) they
they are closer to people that macam ada good looks semua so macam
ya fashion wise also [ah]
e~ yes
(mm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
(mm)
ya true
(um) ya true
so it's very very subjective [lah] in terms of macam mana dia orang select (uh) friends and ya and how the friendship last till
ten years down the road ya
(mm) true true
yes
competition
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(um) okay
(uh) for working life [eh]
i think
it's subjective also because if you were to join in in the beauty industry then i think like good looks is the first ya like first priority that they will look into then followed by talent
but then like if we were talking about like general industry so macam teaching ke (uh)
ya design ke ataupun like social service ya f&b also then i think what is for me if i want to be an employer then i would first look like experience and like how willing is a person
to how willing is the person to work in my company
and then beauty is like
it depends beauty macam
i don't know like i don't really place any priority in beauty
ya (mmhmm)
(err) yes yes
ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(um)
beauty in appearance or mindset personality wise
(uh)
okay like i think it's natural for humans to like
the first the first glance ya yes yes yes
but i think that one also subjective because some people they they have this they like certain (uh) like macam for example for female right they like males macam
the lelaki yang ada certain features so ya so it really is very subjective but for me
(err) yes
okay so for me appearance or mindset in a partner
aku rasa macam are we talking in like first first
first time impression or
[ah] okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh) i think will be mindset slash personality wise
(um) like kau nak share
(uh) okay okay
okay (uh) okay untuk aku [kan] macam if i want to find a partner
then i would say beauty in their personality and mindset sebab macam
(uh) for me i place i i put more priori~ i mean macam macam mana [eh] my first first
how do you say it macam
(uh) for me to identify that person as my partner in the future i would (uh) my first check list is like mindset or personality so macam ya because macam
macam mana [eh] kalau kita (uh) kita tak
apa kita macam
we are into only the good looks then like i said macam in apa ten ten years down the road they will also age then they will no longer look the same so macam to me i will look more in terms of the long term
cause long term aspect [lah] so macam mindset and personality so macam personality and mindset is something that your bring (uh) macam mana [eh] it's like since yang kau dah ada personality and mindset also so it's like how how how your personality and mindset (um) like
macam mana [eh] what (uh) your personality and your mindset is what attracts me most rather than your goods (uh) rather you~ than your looks because for me i emphasize on the personality macam like for example ten years down the road [kan] kita dah macam dah kahwin semua habis kita when you have your children then like if you
don't have good personality or mindset then
ya like what's the point of the marriage ya
(um) intelligence
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(err) you groom yourself [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay (uh) firstly memang aku ada watak a lot of insecurities and low self esteem
then secondly macam
if we if you were to put me in a room where there's a lot of like pretty pretty like girls and or or we we are we like the most most like insecure person [lah]
ya that
(uh) memang high punya
dia lebih lawa [lah] [ah]
i hate
(uh)
(mm)
ya okay the
(uh)
okay no before
before we go to the next question i want to ask macam
okay okay best ke dalam topic of friendship [kan]
macam kau rasa
friendship bila kita buat kawan (uh) buat
buat kawan for the first time
do you think girls or boys place more importance on the good looks
when making friends for the first time
(mm)
(mm)
subjective [lah] also
(mm)
(mm)
to me (uh) in terms of boys or girls i would say girls sebab macam
i don't know whether boys i mean they do have insecurities and all but they place more on like macam their
practical the~ they're quite practical
macam the friendship is base more on macam
like like you can even see like the conversation between girls and boys boys mostly macam i mean
not to generalize [lah] macam like boys they generally talk about like
(uh) apa macam like topics that are not so emotionally involved i would say ya
is
(uh) ya
comparing ya (mm)
ya better
(mm) ya should we move on
(mm)
beauty standards is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
yes
(mm) suicide
(oo)
(mm)
(mm)
ya i think (uh)
(err) yes yes
(uh) yes
(mmhmm) yes
(mm) actually for that topic aku pernah [lah] belajar [lah] in aku punya course if like
(uh) if there's a term
(uh) if i'm not wrong the term is dysfunction~ dysfunctional (um)
ya dysfunctional (um) (um) ya so it's basically like the society is not
macam what we think is a society it's not like (um) good but then it's still functioning so
(uh) it's it's rather it's rather to have that society like even though the (uh) beauty standards or the socio~ socioeconomic status is not
macam is not on the same same bar but it's still functioning so it's still called like a dysfunctional i~ it's it's called something functional something [lah]
rather than to have a society that macam everyone is equal but then it's not functioning in terms of macam they are not hardworking or they don't have any high hopes ya
so i think ya
yes yes any comp~ ya any competition also
ya yes yes yes
ya i'm not really sure what's the term [lah] but ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
any any drive to move forward
true true
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] dear
(mm)
disanjung yes yes yes
k pop
(mm)
macam content is it the content they deliver
(mm) ya
yes yes i agree
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
(um) biasness
memilih kasih
true true
yes
(mm)
[oh] ya
they they apa tu they are attached more onto the expectation rather than reality
ya true
the negative [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
true true
true
(mm) true
oprah winfrey (err) okay
(mm)
true true
about
what's the to~ what's the topic again
success okay
success also (uh)
ya i think in the if you want to be successful in the long term then it should be your skills your experience
other than beauty beauty as in beauty good looks then
(uh) no i don't think in the long term you be as successful as the one who have (uh) experience and skills
fashion
(uh) ya
(mm)
yes yes
lain macam extra
(mm)
okay (err) then our us okay about the fashion thingy right
(uh)
okay so now
let's move on to the fashion side so ya okay so for fashion like
okay so for fashion (um) back in those days macam nineties eighties [kan]
macam the fashion do (um) i'm not really sure because i don't live in that era but like the fashion (mm)
(err) yes based on pictures also [lah] then yes it's very laid back and macam
like i'm i'm not sure whether it's true tapi macam aku nampak dia orang macam tak terikut-ikut dengan dengan the fashion trend you know so macam dia orang tak terikut-ikut and then it's not like everyone wears the same clothes wears the same clothes types and then as compared to now macam
we have like the (uh) what the term e-boy e-girl then the (uh) then the what type of new dress macam hipster hipster so macam
i know you know i'm
(mm) hipster
ya just to fit in i would say
(mm) so macam
like do you think the
the fash~ no (um) the fashion macam mana [eh] do you think the fashion style and fashion trend is more
macam is more very very common in this era as compared to eighties nineties or fifties or like do you think they are both the same regardless of the era time so macam do you see the word saturated so everyone wears the same clothes and all
okay okay can can can
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] yes social media
(mmhmm)
pinterest
tiktok yes yes yes
(um) yes
(mm)
(mm)
ya you just like the fashion
(mm)
(mm) ya true
(mm)
just to fit in yes
(mm)
(mm)
(err) okay
(mm) it's the influenza
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] pasal journey is it
[oh] i know i know (err) if you want to go [eh] if you want to go far you go by yourself something like that ya
(mm) yes true
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
rethink
okay so (uh) okay this might be out of topic but
you were mentioning about like (um) like okay it's not really related to what you said but i think there is some relevance but you (um)
apa tu macam (um) right now (uh)
they soc~ soc~ society sees one sees an individual who is always alone
as someone who is below below societies (um)
esp~ macam mana [eh] (uh) so if you so the current society sees someone who cares like who does like self
care then self love and everything and someone that is very like they are an alien so because society now is macam kau ada banyak kawan then you are in a big group
then you are seen as someone who is (um) ada ada (uh) ada value [lah] then ada macam ada tempat dekat society but someone macam just dia macam apa seorang
then dia macam pentingkan not really pentingkan diri as in they know what is the what they want in life and they they have like self love and self care [lah] so like what what you think of like sub~ (um) this society standard macam ya
like being in a big group is deem as (uh) your offer value rather (uh) offer value and then for someone who is who is (um)
who is individual who is alone
(uh) seems (uh) society deems them as (uh) the weaks (err) yes the weak ones
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(um) ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) ya
yes yes
yes ya
(mm) yes yes
(mm)
yes commitment
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
true true true
(um) okay personally because i am an introvert so it will take me very long time it will take me very long time to open up to new people [lah] especially so
our first friendship is yes yes yes
it will take a lot of years right
ya
that was jodoh [seh]
(mm)
we friends or what
seven no six set to i think you know two thousand fourteen
we ngam-ngam
it has been
roughly six years [kan]
ya
ya no beauty no standards
ya
ya
true true
(mm)
and i think for our friendship also (um) we are not that judgmental like in (uh) between ourselves so macam
ya and our friendship is focus more of like sharing and kita macam banyak advice each other so so like it's really something
ya (mm)
true okay
ya friendship ya
okay should we move on to the next question
okay (uh) okay so we have this task like
the negative side there's so~ (uh) society standard then we share our own like experiences then now we shall like focus on beauty itself [lah] since beauty was so macam
ada ap~ okay (uh) ada kebaikan dalam kecant~ kecantikan kecantikan yang terlaung
it could !aiya!
(mm)
they got the face and the attitude right
(mm)
yes #mira-filzah#
(mm)
yes yes
[oh] ya
(mm)
(mm) so it's like full package [lah] macam good looking very humble also
but
but i heard okay so that one is (um) macam kita kirakan macam (uh) role model yang macam
some~ someone who is (err) so macam mira filzah dia macam act~ actress [kan]
western [eh] (uh) aku tak berapa tengok
(uh)
western actor or actress
(mm)
yes yes
(um) mostly character
ya
ya
yes yes
(mm) okay then for ni kirakan kita ambil contoh dari macam (uh) pelakon penyanyi semua habis kalau macam in your own
macam those not as
those not popular [lah] so macam kawan kau
ke or like someone
you like within your family i don't know
(mm) like who who is like
a role model to you obviously
yang macam dia lawa and very like lemah lembut and all
(mm)
(mm)
(err) ya
#neelofa# isn't #neelofa# like malaysian
[oh] yes yes
(mm) yes
(mm)
(mm)
yes
it's something macam
ya it's something also like i think youth nowadays
motivation [lah] yes
(mmhmm)
ya macam (uh) [kan] cakap pasal (uh) apa tu
deen and deen and dunya so macam apa tu dunya means like world [lah] so macam
dunia tak di akhirat [lah] so
(mm)
so macam aku rasa macam sekarang like budak i mean not to generalize okay but like budak-budak sekarang is more
ya like now more of like world
aku rasa macam sebab macam singapore [kan] dia (uh) nak tinggal dekat sini memang mahal gila apa
so macam the focus more ya the focus more is on like the world [lah] instead of like the the (uh) afterlife
(mm) so like i
ya so like now now now is like very rare to find like those yang macam dia ada dua [lah] so macam dunya and deen
yes
(mm)
(mm)
(oo)
yes
yes yes
(mm) true true
(mm)
so like more macam be comfortable in your own skin
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya sure okay so kita tinggal like a few more minutes [lah] so like i would should we end it off with like a one message to our future self
so like about beauty you want to share first
regret [eh] [oh] okay
(mm)
okay so aku start first [lah] so regret aku is to be the beauty standard so macam dulu (uh) secondary one primary six semua [kan] aku macam very (uh) very insecure [lah] sebab macam
kita ada influence dengan k pop apa so macam kita nampak !woo! macam lawa [seh] and kita pun tengok kawan kita pun macam lawa lawa semua i mean kita macam tengok diri kita sendiri macam (uh) we are not there [lah] so macam ya so like what i regret was like (uh)
like aku terlalu pentingkan like kecantikan dari luar instead of dari dalam ya
(mm) so what's your regret
[oh]
i think it'll be conflict or selfish [lah]
[oh] yes
true true true
(um) then jap
ya
like i think message something like to to remind you during your apa macam (uh) bila hari-hari yang kau perlukan kata-kata semangat [lah] i would say
so (uh) for me five years ten years down the road
(um) the priority will be (uh) ke (uh) work live and
i think pressure in terms of like macam kahwin ke tak kahwin ke macam marriage [lah] so i think
(uh) my message to be (um)
i think the pressure will be more bila kawan-kawan kau dah start to slowly get married so macam you'll feel very pressured so (um) my message would be (um)
to to emphasize to place the emphasis on your own life and and what you are you want to achieve in this world and the world after instead of looking what and not be influenced heavily by your surroundings so
it's really it's really what
your heart and your what what you really want [lah] instead of doing something that the p~ the people around you
ask you and pressure you indirectly to do so focus more on yourself and say cause macam to to to learn to prioritise
yourself and be more selfish like easy ya
(mm)
so ya
ellen degeneres
(mm) true true
(mm)
(mm)
do ask ask to do macam-macam
(mm)
yes
ya okay then we shall end this recording here
alright thank you
[eh] hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
(mm)
ya
iphone eleven dalam one thousand plus [ah]
so if kalau tambah plus atau yang [eh] sorry iphone pro [eh] iphone pro dengan iphone pro max
yang tu kena check dulu like dia punya harga berapa
ya
the same
have you checked
[oh] so i think tengok tempat dia plan [jer] [lah] tengok macam mana dia punya plan dia berapa gigabyte
berapa incoming call free semua like
dia punya specs [ah]
(hmm) tengok benefit benefit dia
[oh] okay
ten gigabyte [kan] per month okay
but currently you use what phone currently pakai phone apa
[oh]
ya ya
(uh)
ya ya our saudara
ya around there two thousand sixteen i think ya
four years [eh] but i think you just bought [kan] iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade [eh]
[oh] still iphone [lah]
[oh] but i think recently you bought [kan] a new phone
!alamak! drill [ah] buto sorry sorry pause
yang iphone eleven tu (uh) you plan to take which plan
[oh]
ya
unless you have wifi [lah] at home you already have wifi [kan] or
ya
ya
tu full price [ah] no contract [ah]
[oh] actually iphone seven also not bad tapi i pre~ i would suggest iphone eight [ah] because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone s_e [ah]
i think tu paling terbaik [lah] kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan iphone eleven is really good enough [ah]
iphone s_e the new one i think is this year early this year twenty twenty
ya so that one that time was during covid [kan] so sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab
iya [lah] sebab covid [kan] so not to get more consumer to buy the phone [lah] at a cheaper price ya
even [ah] android phone pun sama [lah] like google the new google apa pixel [kan] they they make it cheaper [lah] but i think the specs wise of course it's a bit kurang [lah] compared to the previous one ya
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
must check the new iphone s_e s_e right jap [eh] let me check [eh]
there's about four point seven inch
it has a better bionic chip the apa it's i think it's similar to iphone eight design touch i_d
so i'm not sure if there's a face recognition [ah] i don't think so
ya they are still selling i mean (um) you must check you must check takpe [ah] ustaz tengah check
takpe [ah] ustaz kena check dia punya iphone punya iphone store
let me check
there's no more [ah] sorry they don't sell anymore [ah] iphone eight
so i think they replace with iphone s_e starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but i i'm currently using iphone eleven [lah] so i think for camera wise if you love the camera [kan] take pictures all i think iphone eleven is good enough [ah] iphone eleven (uh)
not too sure [ah] cause i never use iphone eight before iphone eleven [ah]
iphone x [eh] iphone x jap jap jap there's a face i_d iphone x_s x_r
ya !alamak!
who
[oh] our ni [eh] parents [eh]
i think biasa [ah] mum is sleeping then i think bapak baru balik ya and
siapa
[ah] bapak kerja [ah] dekat ni [lah] iya dia kerja ni [lah] hari ni kerja [pe] hari ni hari rabu [kan]
tak [lah] i think he working three times a week
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off [ah]
i'm not really looking to job search yet [ah] cause i'm doing freelance [ah] so i have several project to handle for for the app development
i think by end of the year [lah] i try to finish this projects and without expecting much [lah] i think i think the most important thing is experience [ah] and the skills that i will acquire ya
tu i think paling penting [ah] so like macam nanti (um) once i've started working
once i start working [ah] i'm more prepared [ah] prepared than ever
kalau tak nanti macam before this kerja macam tak prepare sangat setakat apa
macam relax relax tapi nanti end up macam tak belajar apa-apa macam cause
i think it's a bit hard [ah] because once you already
apa start started working [kan] you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing [kan] so you need to
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test [ah] they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills [ah] you have the knowledge
for coding [ah] ya so basically it's not that hard [lah] because really we can just (uh) search up in the in the apa
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
[ah] ya
ya ya some some some apa some company [kan] they
they know [ah] whether you you've you search online ke tak [lah] cause they cause i think the most important i don't think is the first interviewed i mean the coding test is not really important [ah] it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
and they will ask you like on the spot [lah] like how do you solve this [ah] [ah] this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem [lah] i think that's the most important
then i think it's also not the answer that is (uh) that is important for them i think it's like how you
how would you explain to them [lah]
ya
it's more mostly interview skills [lah] that
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice [ah] you need to really improve on it [ah] then you have higher chance to to be apa to be offered [lah] by the company
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
[ah] monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast [ah] (mm)
the expected
[oh]
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you [lah]
[oh]
jangan kena pijak [ah] gitu
i'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the i think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
[oh] okay okay
ya
ya
betul betul
tapi like looking into like contract or apa
(uh) full time ke part time
ya
tapi kalau full time pun there's a lot of expectation [kan] macam
[oh]
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
tapi n level start sama time [eh] dengan o level
[oh] okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
tapi [ah] the
ya tapi the condition sekarang condition sekarang macam mana dia punya covid dia orang ambil o level december apa this covid kat
[ah] the
tempat dekat rumah ke dekat examination hall
ya
(mmhmm)
but dia orang ambil same timing dia orang ada own shift ke apa atau it's just one time
ya
betul betul
(mm)
(mmhmm)
microsoft office [ah]
okay okay
[oh] ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed [ah]
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is (uh) i think
[oh]
(mm)
faham faham faham
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically [ah] system engineer [lah] you are looking to that position atau you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of dia punya ni [lah]
ya over work [ah]
ya
ya
yup understood
ada macam macam
software engineer ke if
if it involves coding like for example i think most of the data science they need coding [kan] they need like
python or
or
ya i think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like i think if you learn like commu~ the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like s language or like c plus plus
but it's still i think for like c programming is basically is
readable [lah] you can still read the code [ah] like for example i think the lowest like out of the worst i think like s language until
involves like how
what is it
macam mana nak spell f o r t l a n
[oh] okay okay [eh] never heard before [eh]
even though i am a computer science
c hash [eh]
i think it's called c sharp [ah]
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually c hash is it is a c sharp
ya so basically all these programming i've learnt before [lah] during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so i think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know [lah] this kind of
apa skills [ah] like
mostly low level [lah] like c sharp python [eh] sorry c sharp (uh) what is it called [ah] ya c plus plus
pearl so mostly because i think it's much more stable [ah] than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
for example apa [eh] okay name like
i think it's like flutter dia ada own language which which covered dart [eh] dart ya i think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is apa go golang [eh] golang
ya golang
ya g o l a n g
golang also is like basically is like
like owned by google [ah] so they they have their own language they make their own ni designed by them
so i think mostly the their syntax is like similar to c
ya which is more structural typing [ah] more structured
ya
(mm)
how do you spell logs
[oh] log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya ya
ya r_c_a
ya
ya
i think
yang tengah [ah] siapa yang tekan biasanya the manager [kan] the apa (uh) the business punya side the project manager dia orang akan tekan [kan] this apa
faham faham
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
betul betul
ya nobody use [eh]
[oh]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but each country like they have their own server ke atau they have their own
means like singapore have one server so lain negeri ada their own server ke
atau combine macam asia
[oh]
[oh] okay
abeh sekarang like [ah]
like
you know macam covid pun is getting better [kan] singapore
malaysia pun like they they do open the border [kan] to singapore [kan] macam only for those yang business
apa
[ah] green lane semua
so for the purpose of those yang ada rumah kat sana [kan] dia orang boleh ya for us i think we can't [ah] sebab we are going there basically nak apa
nak cuti [kan]
actually boleh balik [ah] because technically she is ni [kan] she is not singaporean [kan]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
actually i'm not sure like our cousin yang always (uh) who are staying there [kan] who are staying there #syakilah# #iman# do they dia orang boleh datang sini ke
unless dia orang ada they ada kerja dekat sini [lah] dia orang ada kerja [kan] atau rumah kat sini [kan]
#clementi# house
ya because they are
[oh]
ya true true
but you never con~ never contact them
but you haven't contact them [eh] like never contact them
the malaysia people [ah] the k_l [ah] all our saudara kat sana
[oh] cik rozi lama tak call [eh]
yup true true
#alhamdulilah# dah makan dah i think
mum cook apa kari ayam so we just ate tu [lah] we just ate the
(uh) the rice and
kuah apa kari [ah] kuah kari and i just cook telur sikit then makan
tapi tu [lah]
i think i need to start learn i need to start to learn cooking [ah]
but it's a bit hard ya it's a bit hard
i prefer to cook alone [ah]
ya
[ah] that one the smell nanti apa
iya [lah] bau dia [kan] nanti tu [kan] nanti iya [lah] tutup tingkap
tutup pintu semua
but i know [ah] i know how to cook macam like simple simple [ah] like usually i cook thai food [ah] sweet and sour fish
and #kai-lan# ikan masin
baby #kai-lan# ikan masin so macam setakat ikut ni [ah] ikut youtube and
ya kadang-kadang beli kat ni fairprice
nearby [lah]
giant so just beli apa
barang-barang semua dekat ni [ah] barang-barang kat giant and fairprice
kalau ada takde [ah] just find a replacement [ah] macam
that time takde ikan apa [eh] ikan tenggiri ke apa [eh]
so (uh) i replaced it with ikan apa nama dia
tak tahu [ah] nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin [ah] macam ketul-ketul macam cube ikan cube
throw the like it's just
simple [lah] dia punya masak it's not that hard [ah] just ikut dia punya youtube punya tutorial
ya not much
[ah] boneless and dia macam i think it's dried [ah] dried food dried fish
ya macam you you macam very dried [lah] dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat
ya it's not in the fridge [ah] it's like dried [ah] dried #ikan-bilis#
ya so macam like it's in terms in the form of cube [ah] cube then with that cube just [ah] letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu
once the the fish dah tu [kan]
dah lembut [ah] baru tu [lah] pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak baby #kai-lan#
letak kicap oyster sauce so once dah
dah panaskan i think like
five to ten minutes dah siap
but for fish i think it's a bit troublesome [ah] kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa make sure letak dengan tepung [ah] tapi dia punya sauce senang nak buat [ah] sweet and sour sauce
ya
ya you you need to get the fish ya fried first [ah]
dengan tepung
ya
it's homemade [ah] homemade ya
ya
ya capsicum
tapi tu [lah] i think this is like the starting point [ah] cuma macam nak i think i took me awhile [ah] like i think what i cook at most one hour two hours very tiring macam you need to macam
potong ni [lah]
i think the
ya true [ah] barang-barang dah siap if someone already did that for me [kan] senang [ah] i think my life will be easier
cuma itulah you need
ya
but also maid also it's not that cheap [ah]
cannot cannot like that [ah] i think most women nowadays is they prefer to work [ah] [kan] but depends [ah] [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so take turn [ah]
[oh]
tapi boleh ke macam tu
ya
tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada agreement dia is just one house [kan] the maid
the agreement biasanya one maid macam
jaga one house [kan]
okay
iya [lah] iya [lah] of course
ya for weekend [ah]
ya usually once a week [kan] like sunday
[ah] iya [lah]
pause jap [eh] pause jap
but if the maid macam they have their own tu [kan] kerja timing dia [kan]
like
ya sunday off
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day [kan] except malam [ah] [kan]
ya
dah berumur ya
ya of course
(mmhmm) betul
(mm)
ada [lah] dekat fairprice fairprice fairprice punya online
ada [lah] sometimes i think
that time i saw like macam halal punya daging [kan]
ya really ni [lah] dia punya which section [eh] the section yang ada frozen food
ya it's similar [ah] same as when you go to grocery
ya
actually i saw this youtube video [ah] very interesting dia macam v_r punya shopping
tapi i don't think singapore ada [ah] dia macam like i think in america ke apa [ah] which country atau china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop [kan] there'll be someone who welcome you pastu [ah] you using the v_r [lah] i think it's a like the device [ah] you need to buy the device v_r device
then you are like it's like shopping [ah]
[ah] it's a virtual [ah] everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real [ah] i mean impossible [ah] but its similar [lah] it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
if if memang ya stock finish of course the thing is empty [lah] dia punya ni [ah]
it's the same as you are shopping [ah] it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually [lah]
ya very interesting
tapi it's very hard [ah] like i mean the software wise like
ya i think like imagine like walking [ah]
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab [kan]
why
iya [lah] iya [lah]
access to shopping mall [eh] is it
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
but i'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally [ah] i'm not too sure [ah] there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but i never try v_r before [ah] i never try using like v_r i i don't think so i tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
berapa
of course [ah] dia punya price mahalnya it's like you're playing p_s four punya v_r punya tu [kan] console
(mm)
ya
but i think can be solved [ah] like technology wise macam they keep changing [kan] most like it's probably [ah] i feel very interesting like how
like especially this covid times like how technology they try to change [ah] macam in terms of like the new normal
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
like dulu takde [kan] i think previously my company my former company dia pernah offer [ah] work from anywhere so one year macam they give like seven days [ah]
ya
kat rumah [lah] you can can stay at home or go overseas apa
[ah] ya [lah] as long as you do something [lah] usually the manager will ni [lah] the
the manager will ask [ah] like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint [ah] sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya
[ah] you also need to be involved in like zoom zoom meeting
you need to be apa
[ah] ya [lah] my company for~ former company use zoom for ni [lah]
for presentation
ya of course [ah] i think they are going to make one in singapore [kan]
dia punya
ya
[ah] but i not too sure [ah] like i heard from the news ya and they were hiring [ah] (mm) i think a lot foreigner [ah]
[oh] ikea [ah] i don't i don't think so actually i don't buy like
macam container [ah] nak letak something container like small [one] [ah] ya but i think [ah]
tak tahu [ah] hari tu my friend tanya nak pergi ikea ke tak dia ajak
so maybe i might go with him [lah] i'm not sure when maybe next week
which one the restaurant [ah]
of course [ah] open [lah]
but they limit [ah] they limit like
ya they they limit ni [lah] the number of [ah] customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure berapa [ah]
ya they make
one one table [kan] like ya seat of four or seat of two
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those yang one person [kan] they will sit at the seat of four kan nanti macam they don't apa utilise the space [ah] they don't make use of the space
then end up macam the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time [lah] kalau weekend [kan] in #tampines# [kan]
ya the queue selalu panjang
nak control [eh] ya ya
ya couple family [kan]
ya
ya
[oh] counter table ya
[oh]
(mm)
ya betul
ya yup understand
not too sure [ah]
[oh]
shopping mall [eh] is it like shopping mall
[oh] okay
ya ya
open concept [ah]
it's like open concept [ah]
(mm)
ya
[oh] ya ya
(mm)
[oh] iya [lah] iya [lah]
(mm)
ya
(mm) truth
(mm)
ya
ya
ya i think it's a bit tu [lah] a bit
it's a bit scary [ah] kalau if
ada orang break the rule apa [kan]
like actually you say you heard places yang some
restaurant or bar [kan] they they have a lot of
apa dia orang kena ni [kan] kena warning [kan] because of this thing [kan]
like the customer tak ikut ni
ya
ya [lah]
of course [ah]
n_e_a ya
(mmhmm)
ambassador
ya
[ah] true [ah]
i think just make sure like everyone just follow [ah] cause now nowadays people like
ya [lah] you see like in at sho~ apa shopping mall like it's those crowded [kan] nowadays macam susah nak control [ah]
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya i think they will just monitor [lah] this apa maybe there's someone
watching the c_c_t_v ke apa [kan] they have their own
ya ma~ maximum occupancy also but i don't think there's sensor there's sensor yang
macam detect
ya
check out [lah] don't check out [lah] ya it's very difficult to ni
to keep track
auto check out
i think possible [lah] just that location wise is a bit some [ah] some ya ya true [ah] some some [ah] some might be insecure a bit [ah] like
to be in track [kan]
trace i think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya i think it's battery i think a lot complain
about i think regarding the the battery [lah] dia cepat habis [ah]
ya definitely [ah] bluetooth ya
through the app
ya i think in the background it's still running [ah] it will still run ya because it need to keep checking [kan]
like the the nearby devices [kan] siapa yang
i'm not too sure [ah] i think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise [ah] so i think they need like support of
(um) google and apple [kan] to ni with the android dengan i_o_s phone
i think so [ah] i think it's just the bluetooth [ah] like wha~ because bluetooth will detect the nearby device [kan]
ya this is not this is not easy [ah] because because i think they still updates [ah] they're still updating they are still improving
for apple [kan] and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone [kan]
or you still stick with ni
google
[oh]
android
(mm)
[oh] google home ya
ya
ya
who
google home okay
ya
(mmhmm)
yup correct
ya
[ah] ya ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
i think so [ah]
i think this is still depends cause google home [kan] they detect ni [kan] the surrounding [kan]
the microphone is how far
berapa jauh
as long as jauh [ah] microphone dengan i mean dia punya google home [kan] ada microphone [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
i'm not too sure [ah] like like what will be the reply like [ah] macam de~ default like
[ah] there's something
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya maybe [ah] maybe ya ya the default punya default
[oh] iya [lah] iya [lah] ada off~ offline data [lah] persistent storage [ah]
ya
maybe you can try like alexa ke
like
ya amazon products
ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
i al~ i think i not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
tapi but then it just think of us like their lagipun singapore is moving into smart nation [kan] so at certain points at certain [ah] zone for example i think #punggol# ke #sengkang# [eh]
like #punggol# [kan] there's there's a lot of b_t_o flat [kan] so i think these flats dia orang ada their own smart punya apa devices [ah] macam [ah] smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart [lah] basically so bila macam masuk bilik
i think not too sure [ah] like they have their own ya they have their own brand [ah] i'm not not sure what brand is that [ah]
maybe maybe they collaborate (hmm)
i think there might be [lah] not too sure like
for example smart light you enter a room [kan] nanti dia macam the intensity akan increase [ah]
as we walk into macam tu example [jer] [lah]
so tak payah tekan butang ke apa
i think they have [ah] macam
ya macam ada sensor [kan]
[ah] iya [lah] iya [lah]
ya ya ya true true
and also i think most of the things in our house [ah] like t_v or what like
ya
ya because
because now like i think the manually the manual one i think we saw in different country [kan] dia kat india [eh]
they use leg
pakai kaki untuk tekan butang dia
[ah] pedal pedal ya so they have to use
(uh) our hand [lah] our hand to press the button
ya there's some country use that [ah] macam pedal ke apa
ya
i think in singapore ada some building [kan] dia macam like if inside the lift takde button
only kat luar [jer]
#paya-lebar# ya i saw i went to #paya-lebar#
[oh]
ya ya
betul betul
(mm)

(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (hmm)
(mmhmm) true true true true true
i mean to me it's good in a way like (um) all the lessons are pre-recorded so like i mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to (um) the recordings [lah] because like if we ya i mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching [ah] like ya as you said [ah] traditional traditional methods are the best [ah]
but then ya obviously but then i mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like !aiya! i app~ appreciate [lah] they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like

and all right ya [lah] i really appreciate that part ya
(mmhmm) i mean
okay it's really draining
(err) cause like the
the usual physical examination like we had the the ya i mean usually we we (uh) our exam punya duration would be like three hours right

ya (mm)
ya but then i mean like if if they were to shorten it i don't think i can finish in time [ah]
tu [lah] like (err) initially i was like
(um) ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us [lah] (err) beforehand she was like (um) ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like !huh! really forty eight hours then she she she was like

so ya so when i'm given the question then i was like
okay now i understood why

ya they they they they ask us [ah] like (um) are you guys okay
(um) ya like (um) if you i mean you know some some wouldn't be okay with like having group assignment right
cause like due to i don't know maybe different time zones or such so they like give us like (um) options if you want to do like if you want to go for like individual (err) individual or like group assignment [ah] things like that [lah] so like they like i would say they cater and acco~ accommodate to us [ah] to our needs [ah]
but then ya she mentioned [ah] like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so
but then ya then there's there's this lecturer was like
[oh] they usually ask us to tell the students that it's

i mean like to go lenient on them [ah] but then she she like somehow like rant to us ranted to us [ah] she was like but then they never
(uh) take care of their like the the the lecturers [lah] like cause they are also like going through new things right like to have like a full-fledged [ah] online classes is equally like very (uh) what difficult for them [lah] basically

(uh) cerita dia like it's about (um) cerita dia it's about like (um) this person
(uh) she okay it's about afterlife [ah] basically
so it's like they haven't offered the heaven or the hell kind of thing ya so it's like the good place i mean in a sense is like the heaven and the bad place is the hell
so ya so she realised that she's bad and she's placed in the good place then she was wondering [lah] like
[eh] aku selama ni (err) dekat dunia aku aku
buat jahat [jer] tapi kenapa like ya tapi kenapa like she's quite dia macam like she's she's asking herself she's questioning herself like (um) tapi kenapa aku dekat the good place like shouldn't be ya macam like tak ke patut ya [lah] tak ke patut aku dekat the bad place ya but then turns out that

tak nak cakap
earning

[a'ah]
yeah it's true especially in singapore [lah] to be honest
that's why it's better if you migrate [lah]
exactly that's why not many people migrate to malaysia already

it is what it is yeah
unusual superpower [eh]
any superpower
okay [ah]
aku would want to be invisible

then they bury it at one place that they only know that kind of thing
okay then what's the answer then
when is that
[a'ah]
(uh huh)
yeah yeah
overconfident [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
but it's like a natural thing [ah] for kau [kan] and some it's honestly called talent [ah] to be that smart at that young age

[oh] okay actually i kind of get what you mean cause i'm i'm like that type also if like people overhype one song too much before i even hear it and it sounds decent enough
aku still wouldn't hear it [lah] to be honest cause
apa
yeah yeah
[oh] yeah yeah yeah
[ah]

honestly say honestly say
i swear ya we can talk better let's be honest let's be honest

okay one thing that i wish was free
(err)
aku feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
it'll be hard [ah]
transport
just free transport for everybody
it would cost a lot of but then the thing about that is that
a lot of people will take more transport then it will be over congested
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially kat singapore [kan] kitanya country small
unless other places but i've heard like some other countries also like actually provide free transport
i've heard
[oh] mak yes
yes yes [eh] actually that's very good points [ah] [a'ah] [sia] healthcare
(mmhmm)

wait that's the sad thing plus also it's not really a guarantee that they will do a good job [kan] that's another thing
no offence but like don't want say shade also to other countries but most of them also a bit (uh) corrupt [eh]
low-key kalau ada [ah] [eh]

(uh) covid situation now
i wanna say it's getting better but
nah it ain't it's i feel like it's getting worse to be honest
exactly and the fact that macam mana [eh] all those dormitory workers
they are like legit trapped inside so
i mean okay [lah] our cases gone down
but it's just sad that they have to live inside there until aku tak tahu bila
yes
i mean i don't wanna make it dark [ah] but
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
actually that's what they should do [sia] after like phase two pasal kita semua quarantine kat rumah [kan] and shit
then you slowly move to phase two which is yang kau cakap implement tu and then slowly gradually macam sekarang [ah]
tapi sekarang tak lepas phase two [jer] semua orang keluar
but you know the problem now is also pasal
older generations them and their phone tak payah cakap [ah]
aku pernah experience like customers old auntie [lah]
boy how you do this how you book
(mm)
pioneer generations
(mmhmm)
so like older generations gain priority
then the newer generations need to book
that kind of shit must
actually kind of true because you know our technology is getting more advanced [ah] so might as well everybody learn this
yes
(mmhmm)
[ah] true [sia]
i mean
kau pun heard [ah] the reason they
open phase two early
pun is just cause the economy is dropping that's all

[oh] my god ya okay so i ended up buying the gold [one] apparently on apple it says gold but then actually it's rose gold like she's like gorgeous and she's obviously rose gold not gold so i don't know whether people are blind or something
i like yeah she's gorgeous
what about you what have you been doing baby
tu perangai lembu
you didn't do anything the entire day so perangai lembu [lah]
perangai what
okay perangai babi then
[orh]
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like i don't know whether is i mata potek or like orang apple mata potek i do not know like i genuinely don't know
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought macbook air
cause she's airy or what
(err)
i don't know i upgraded some shit and i don't know what
so like around one seven
so now officially girl girl is broke i [dah] tak ada duit i nak #makan# pun tak boleh you know i was like thinking of buying like
some
sushi for two dollars and i solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and i was like i think the uncle was just like
i thought he was like thinking i'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then i proceeded to take a two dollars sushi i was just standing there just like
should i buy should i no but i'm broke i'm broke i have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then i want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah i'm like (um)
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
i had always had money then after that when i realised that i wanted to buy the a new laptop
then i just set aside all my money and then i started
working to hit one point seven so at the start i think i had about one k already then i need seven hundred more so last month i was broke to get that seven hundred and then now i got the seven hundred then now i'm broke cause i have no money at all you know what i mean
i was
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke apa #lan-jiao# kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa
but i had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so i am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day i was
(um)
going to
i don't know who i was meeting
then
lepas tu i
i remember like
this
i don't know why i like just suddenly i was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by admiralty then i think i saw somebody who looks similar to him or not i just don't know so (um)
so
since i don't know whether i got tell you this story [ah] like since
(um) primary six
right since primary six i was primary six okay like i will like dulu [kan] my mum pakai tudung
so like dia pakai tudung then kalau dia nak potong rambut [kan] nak kena pergi to somebody's house you know to tutup aurat and all that [lah]
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit [lah] but like raya have to go to their house cause it's like some nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya some shit [lah]
so it's like super complicated then my mum i don't know how she just
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once i started like to pakai tudung in primary school my mom brought me there [lah] instead of like the normal kedai barber and all that
then since primary six up until last year because covid was this year what so up until last year i will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
since fucking primary six sampai last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to jadi dia punya
daughter-in-law dalam bahasa melayu apa
yes okay i keep on forgetting that word obviously menantu material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her menantu for god knows why like i'm so messed up i'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her menantu you know dulu right when i was like like twelve nanti benda dia #macam# kecil [jer] [ah] #macam# she will be like
[orh] like what do you think of my anak like that like nanti aku duduk like dia kasi aku #makan# nanti dia cakap you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
even though i have a thing for chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a malay scale if there's something like that [ah] give me a malay name
kay let's just use
!hais! neither do i but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name [ah]
so his name is
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is something
ya i think
like it's a long name [ah] but let's just use a generic one [ah] then after that
so
(um) she like ask me like what do you think of then i'll be like like apa kau merepek like that is your son what am i actually supposed to say you know
then after that like i will just avoid the question just act blur #sotong# and all that all [lah] i don't know what i will do [lah] i cannot really remember
then after that like i don't know about you [ah] but i don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right i go and salam dia punya mak [lah] cause like i don't know why
then i have to salam the mum then
everytime she asks questions like do i have a boyfriend
or all that i will let my mum talk [lah]
then i will just never talk to the aunt even [eh] the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
i salam dia nya mum and then straightaway dia punya mum was like
(err) kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua
then i was just like
!huh!
!huh! sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila i'm like fucking nineteen and i was like
(err) i'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau and i was just confused you know i was just like
number one
lady hold up hold up i love it that you love me so much like thank you i sayang you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point i have never even spoken
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that i have never even said hi to
like hi like i don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri and then like he's never there
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then i'm just like i obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like i've never even spoken to the dude before and i don't know why
i thought about that because i think i'm just dreading next year raya and then that is one of the things that i'm dreading [ah]
how i cut my hair
[ah] the last time i went to an actual barber
like i tudung and all that
ya so after i told !huh!
no after i told my mum that i was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since i went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like i don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six i'm kinda traumatized is how many years already
cause every year i go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do i have a boyfriend what do i think of her son kau nak jadi aku nya
(um)
men~
menantu ke tak that that happened last year [lah] but like you know it just escalates to suddenly i'm the menantu that's all
i don't know baby but what about you do you not ever had harassed
like i don't know it seems like
yeah i even
ya [lah] it's not considered harassed [lah] that's true
but like
[kan] i don't know it's just like a melayu nya thing
like makcik makcik be really all up in your face be like kau nak jadi aku punya men~ (err) menantu ke tak
like how do they actually
judge you
per say you know
like
for my
my situation like i actually
they don't even know anything about me other than which school i go to i don't think she even knows what's my favourite colour
and what is she judging me as like on judging me on
when she wants me to be her
menantu like girl girl doesn't like to cook i like to bake but i don't like to cook
is that a good men~ menantu quality like

[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
#serangoon# [a'ah]
okay
you're already late
okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to berak then you don't want to berak first and then it's just like
confused
apa yang dia nak ni
!ee! [oh] my god dude
i don't know nak cakap childish ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham [sia]
like first of all you are like freaking like twenty something and then you want to berak abeh kalau kau nak berak pergi [lah] cari toilet yang kau nak pergi kacau kau nya girlfriend cari [kan] toilet buat apa #siak#
[oh] my god okay okay i also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
(err) one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently i met her so it's going to be about two months but not really (um) i heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know i was like thinking
kay wait kau nya boyfriend jumpa mak kau sebab #macam# kena caught is it like like terserempak kat some~ somewhere then she's like no
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then i was like
lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang suggest and then she was like ya and i was just like
!huh!
and then apparently like this coming okay i mean today is what day friday so apparently they say either saturday or sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been toget~ they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
#lan-jiao# i've been together with a guy for one year my mother tak tahu [sia]
and then this one
ya and cause he's chinese but like
i cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
actually i also tak faham [lah]
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like i'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify i tak nak main main okay and then suddenly i tak nak main main equals to you kena jumpa mak i
so like i tak faham girl girl tak believe it
even if i start dating like while lo and behold
i go and date some malay guy i am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like i don't understand
how does this work
i just tak faham i was just like
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
was the one who told my friend like [eh] i want to meet your mak
but like one week into getting together though
i don't know
i just tak tahu
like just touch wood [lah] imagine if you don't
like he's not the one that you marry and then korang like !wah! full blown invested like i don't know [ah] i i was just confused i never would
have gotten together in the first place [ah] of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also so
#aip#</p1> what's up
okay cool
!huh!
what
what
!huh!
wait what i cannot even comprehend that
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend lepas tu buka bank account
sebab nak kahwin like they actually like
kumpul duit
nak kahwin
are they still together
to get out of jail
[ah]
because i met another person
like the effort
i don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
i don't know
i don't know man
[oh] ya [sia] like i don't know recently like
i i get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
dulu i would do it dulu i was that kind of girl okay i wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
in but i would like
want him to tell me like !hey! we're gonna be in this for the long run [lah]
so okay so
(um)
there's this one friend of mine
like
(um) her name is
then like
[ah]
[ah] yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day [eh] this year and like we are gonna plan for it [lah] like they actually have a plan like a future has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby i love you i love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
(um) she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
[oh] i hope it's going to be you in the end or like i hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing
and then she got so sad
and then
she got so sad that now she wants to try a fucking keto diet
sebab dia nak kurus
she wants to try let me reiterate and repeat these again okay she was so sad that he doesn't want to you know like
give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
and you know dapat
that body goals i don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya i just that's why i was thinking like i get her point of view like i get it cause i really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time
because you love them that much but then like if you compare it like five months and five years is two different things [ah]
no i just got blocked nose
i don't know why
suddenly like throughout this thing suddenly got blocked nose i don't even know why
but yeah there's that
i just like
[ah]
ya so the next time asked me to drink there you better bring your ass down
and then if texts me i'll let you know
there's that
there's so much
!huh!
apa
[ah] ya that's why how to go drinking i ask pay [ah] my daddy
he my zaddy
[ah]
tell you so messy perangai everybody semua perangai #macam# [sial]
(uh) [ah]
[oh] yeah how's your work
like when are you starting like are you not gonna start work
(mm)
!huh! so you are actually not working yet [lah]
kat mane
ya ya ya you told me you told me
solid [ah] four dollars

[oh] yeah talking about your madrasah
i never
at the start i went to a masjid madrasah for awhile only like
before andalus i started in primary one so i think when i was like in kindergarten like for two years i was at
masjid #ahmad-ibrahim#
have you heard i think you've heard about it before no
yeah
so
(um)
the baju is green colour and then my tudung is yellow in colour so maybe that's where my name like nyonya telur came about cause girl girl imagine with that circle face and then the yellow tudung really not cute
but okay so the only thing i don't even remember going there you know but the only thing that i remember [oh] my god i love my whole story is that right
i came back home
one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
the sekolah is in the middle of like a hutan
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
(um)
one day i went back home and then i just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
i'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old i went back home i was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku you know it's like maybe i don't know
but like they went right
my yayi and my mum pergi [ah] pergi to the masjid and then after that they actually like found out the per~ the guy that kiss me
was like a family friend
it was so messy and then like i was just like i don't even know how he looks like you know sekarang i cannot remember like i cannot remember anything
then like
i remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
they will just say you know lelaki yang cium kat madrasah
[ah] then i was just like
you know dia literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but i don't know who he is i've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my nyai will like talk about it to my mum
somehow
it's so weird so it's kind
i cannot remember but the only thing i can remember is what my mum is telling me which i did
to tell her which is just i just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama [ah] ada orang cium kat pipi and then i like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my nyai to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a #ulu# place
then when like i was maybe i pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my nyai
and then i was just like
it's damn weird
ya so ya there's that so i don't know about you but girl girl got kissed at the cheek when she was five
i hate myself so much i was such a hoe
at such a young age
i cannot believe it ni perangai
bakal nak jadi men~ menantu orang you know this is the perangai that it perangai
you know
ya i almost said mertua this is why i cannot be nobody's menantu when i cannot even say menantu correctly

ya like why are you putting words into my mouth like what do you know
whether
apa yang dia nak ni kenapa
asal dia tak happy [jer] ke or what like what what's going on like is she not happy or like

so like ya in conclusion you really attract toxic girls
or friends i guess
okay that's a bad thing to say [lah] how are you supposed to make friends if you don't want to tell people
about
the things that bother you
but then really though like genuinely you really attract
really bad people but then we are friends so i don't know what am i saying about myself
i like

ya tell her the tea that she's gonna get next is me sitting on lap to beat the bitch up
to make
ya but there's that
!wah! shit [sia] i'm still damn salty about it like can you believe it sampai sekarang [sia] i'm just like so tilted

i'll be okay
i will forgive and forget girl girl
will not
succumb to being such a big bitch
i know right

no way
it is [lah] ya i guess for the price also
true
location penting but
you know where else can you go in singapore anyways [kan]
i see [ah]
(um) well technically #bugis#
provided let's say there's no more covid there's no c_b [kan] macam we can still go down and like there's a lot of eateries museum
(um)
it's walking distance to plaza sing
there's cathay
what okay
i guess if
yes that's right
[oh] no i i don't i i i'm i'm against that sentence that you just said
!hey! okay firstly it is not a sports mall a sports mall is actually dekat #novena# which is to velocity
right secondly it is a mall for all ages and all people from all walks of life so kalau let's say you're a foodie there's lot of places

cause of covid yes
!aiya! ya my one of my friend pun tried to go up there dengan kawan dia juga then macam [eh] okay
it was closed
hello what does that even mean
(mmhmm)

there's laws
exactly ya
but actually kalau view from the top of parliament is actually lawa juga cuma i think only special people or special circumstances allows you to use the drone macam gitu ke
yes yes yes
(mm) okay
#istana#
but !wah! kalau
your drone kena shoot down [seh] kalau you fly
yeah
right right okay (hmm)
okay [lah] interesting first one is safety wise another one is i don't know what is the other reason my my mind is suddenly blank
security
ya that's one thing
(mm) betul juga
okay
(mm) okay anyways
talking about staycation
i just read this article (um) one of the big hotel chains also tak ingat apa nama hotel itu [ah] so they are offering
daycation which is like twelve hours then you just pay at a discounted rate
it's a big
i think mandarin mandarin i think
ya tak ingat
it was on the mothership article

tak ada
from like c_n_a or straits times
tak ada
do you think mothership articles are like legit and kita boleh percaya
are you serious
(hmm) macam
like some some
what i feel is that the mothership feels like sgag kind tapi they are more seniors i tak pasti
but since you said it's they're government backed like okay
ya
okay that's new something i learn (hmm)
is this going to be a funny answer ataupun serious answer
[oh]
okay i'll make a guess mungkin sgag
sgag makes memes
mothership don't
what do you say to that
(mmhmm)
but i hear a but
no but
ya cause you're one sided is
you're one sided you see
i saw some
true
well as compared to my point of view macam i follow both sgag and mothership on their social media so
some
sometimes i do agree with sgag
so
so
no biases on that part

then i had to go out and then (uh) to my relatives house
so
[oh] ya we were talking about the online thing then your online classes yang photography videography itu how is it going
[oh] no macam mana itu
anyways
i understand
i feel you i'm feeling it right now
ya but come on [lah] like okay five years of working and suddenly you start back school it's going to be a bit weird
tapi
pray for me please
exactly exactly betul itu
(um)
anyway machine ini dah dah
apa
spoiled and karat yes
it's creaking and
it's
it's making sounds so you know
i don't even know
honestly i don't even know what is singer oil and apa benda itu and what is the usage and function of it
ya because my childhood is spent like playing around on land and on sea not doing anything
[oh]
ya
[oh] i know why i tak tahu ini benda cause i don't sew and i tak tahu macam mana nak jahit
is that that could be the reason [oh] okay
!hais! mana [lah] tahu cakap pasal childhood did you
grow up most of the time in the west you did right why am i asking again ya it's always been in the west
actually me too
(um) (mmhmm)
serious [ah]
ya
never ever your family or parents wanted to or any
[oh] !wow! !wow! i tak cakap #yishun# [seh] i wanted to say to the east or the south
you know what i mean
well now that you what
(uh huh)
when was this
right so maknanya you were about primary school
[oh] okay that you were young wait tapi please explain to me how you know about this information you were so young
you boleh ingat sampai sekarang seriously
!wah! good job
is it the one yang brownish in colour like brick walls
no
in between #changi# prison [oh] okay maknanya
that building that land is is been there for a while [lah] macam you know
since you say you were still young
so
does it look old
ish from the outside
!huh!
dia dah (um) refurbish and upgrade is it
interesting okay
live
[oh] okay
is it due to cost and expenses
do you want to talk about it is it even sensitive okay
i mean but [oh]
principles so i guess we can break it down to priorities also [lah] like
they are raising you also and they're still
early in their marriage days
(hmm)
you raise me up okay sorry suddenly reminded of that song
i understand
you were saying ya okay priorities [lah] in that sense
like getting a house
(mm)
yes yes
where in the north
in the north
!wow! in the north
ya i suddenly remember
[oh]
okay that's very nice of h_d_b
(um) when i was in school macam doing research on like economists and economic crisis
ya when we're younger there was this thing happening macam at that point of time we don't feel it [lah] obviously cause we too young
to experience it tapi
ya it's so interesting
but i guess it's a silver lining right like you know the way you guys are now anyway so macam more comfortable
i mean everyone has hardships [lah] but
it's like this is a life that's comfortable for you and me and ya
for you sorry not me why why am i in your picture anyway for you
okay
[oh]
it's always been in the west nice
schools in the west
for life there's right
natural right
okay wait but
but i guess
ya do they still find it macam alien when you
travel to other parts of singapore macam cause you don't know the place well and stuff cause for example like me [kan] kalau
i drive up to the east especially for with myself or with myself pula on my own
with my parents et cetera macam it feels very alien
i pergi tempat lain gitu it's not somewhere that i'm comfortable with actually unless macam
i have people who go with easties that go with me to that area
what do you think
jang~
just #sembawang# [lah] in the north
(mm)
no other places in singapore make you feel janggal like out of place except #sembawang#
that's true
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya that's true okay
(mm)
you miss those days
like ya
like in i_t_e you were a bit mature [what]
as compared to secondary school i guess
macam you make your own decisions and stuffs
i don't know
like no one like memories right what do you feel
(mmhmm)
(um) ya
of all your
of all your education
levels like what period in time of your life macam you
you you you
feel #shiok# most

i'm just looking at the list of things that i made to talk and the top of the list is holidays and what we miss about it that's the first thing that popped out of my mind [oh] it is don't tell me you tak rindu ke
at all i mean (mm) (mm) ya the cheap stuffs i think
setuju it's
it's more of (um)
it no matter how the short getaway is like
you literally just nak leave singapore just for the sake of it after all this
after all this is over like like we can go out [lah] you know
rehat and relax at the r&r
no [lah] come on [lah] i still remember bila you go you went to malaysia with your family then suddenly last minute
your mom decided to do a sleepover there
[kan] macam out of the blue there was one time
(mm)
it was impromptu for your family [lah] at least
and then macam you guys didn't have clothes additional clothes ke something like that
it was very improm~ ya
i think you were
let's see
ya [eh] cannot be n_s days you not so fit during n_s days i don't know
wait yang
(um) ya (uh) i think in your early twenties [ah]
okay okay okay
(um) [oh] my god
right #putri# pacific okay okay is it the one yang betul-betul nearby where's where's the woodlands causeway itu
[ah] right right right cause mostly singaporeans would go through that way anyway
what !wah!
no i mean kalau dia orang buat polls and and surveys confirm will boom cause over there you tak payah bayar
(um)
i am certain maybe i_c_a has done up something along those lines
ya (hmm) so ya
that's the thing about your family sometimes dia orang boleh just do impromptu stuffs
and i'm very surprised
it's in~ it's interesting
yup
for me right
i just want to get on the plane
i know it's very
i think so
i'm (mmhmm)
honestly [kan] i'm kind of prone to a bit of sea sickness
even though you know i do a lot of water stuff and diving but still the thought of getting on the boat for forty five minutes to an hour consistently ya
tapi okay [lah] option one will be plane option two will be car option three will be ferry
ya
and you know i don't really like to drive a lot so kalau you know someone
drives me and we go up
to another country okay that's okay
malas girl you
highway tak (err) there was one time we went to #desaru#
(uh) it was my previous car
[ah] and then
ya just drove sikit [jer] it's just a short distance
(um) and then apart from that i've never driven overseas except for when i went to u_s in the snow
remember ya i told you
that was scary man
legit macam snow and driving is no easy business of the sleepy roads and everything !wow!
it's
ya
and (uh) it's (uh) wait left left hand driving also no joke
abeh it was
snowing very hard sampai kalau you stop at the traffic light [kan] there's no one go on (um) to the front mirror
and then you need to macam every rental car they provide you with a shovelish kind of thing
to wipe the mirror off of snow
ya so if you don't move you will get drenched in snow
interesting
ya i know right
ya but good good memories [lah] no matter what
i hope one day i mean all these will go away [lah] inshallah you know just dua for the best
amin

!wah! is everything online cause i saw one of your instagram posts
(hmm) maknanya
[oh]
wait do they charge people steal to like watch online ataupun everyone can just login [oh] so there's kind of like how does it work do they still have the panels thing and what what happens actually
the
also like the actors will be in their homes and stuff
then
i see i see okay interesting
yes it is
(mm) anyway because i think (um)
because of this covid tak ada banyak wayang movies yang keluar right so macam there's no point interviewing having a panel also
(um) okay
no
it's like (um) remember i told you i was watching
the (uh)
[ah]
roald dahl the book [ah] some actors that read the book online and then they have (um) charities and donation drives all this from reading the book [kan] ya ya so one of them is james and the giant peach
and another one is (uh) one the first harry potter book then like the actors of the movie or like random actors they dia orang baca buku itu
online ya
ya to watch actually cause it's on youtube
#taika-waititi#
then
you so funny ya allah macam (ugh) [eh] dia dia dari new zealand [kan]
so !whoa!
he is from new zealand
so he ya he has a slang and everything
australians australians ya they have a thing
something going on between them
ya
tapi macam it's like thank god
for him in in the cinematic industry also creates the good vibes as a director and an actor also
abeh dia boleh buat suara dia macam (mmhmm) mandolin orange [oh] ya that one mandolin orange was the last
i see
jojo rabbit is not so recent also [kan]
ya last year okay
did they win something
think i
can't remember
nomination [eh] okay
i think so too
!hais! funny guys
talking about funny guys just now dalam kereta i heard the national day songs ini on warna
on warna of all channels
tapi honestly after listening to the game [kan] macam okay
it's kind of like a nice beat to it sometimes like someone that's not very musically inclined can get affectionate to that kind of genre
ya
so
but still i don't like it
tomato
(mmhmm)
what you think about
you know why
pasal we grow up in the era where all the songs macam
stand up for singapore those kind
so you
we tend to compare with also [lah]
like
kids who are born in the year two thousand onwards or something like won't
understand
i don't
ya
!oops! but i
our asses off
talking about n_d_p i i missed the deadline to collect the bag i think
so tak dapat
so
almost there ya i know right
ya
[oh] !wow! we kind of made it
hello
yes
okay
so
!hais!
there goes our effort early
anyway
just
find something new then
okay [lah]
then [eh] i kept thinking about the hotel semalam
no [lah] as in for a staycation it's a nice place actually
although
not much that you can do in that #bugis# area
(mm)
ya [lah] kalau macam #fullerton# or #marina# bay sands at least you boleh turun and do some shopping
and not to forget
#sim-lim# square
the
the i_t mall that replaced #funan#
so lousy now
how can you turn an i_t mall into a sports [ah] (ugh) i have no words for this
velocity
[eh] no i am just kid
yes [oh] the other time me and kevin we tried to go there tapi i think dia tutup
[oh] is it is it that's why
dengan kawan dia mesti nak cium-cium ni
no [lah] the view up there is nice [lah] if only you can bring a drone but sadly you cannot cause parliament betul-betul dekat sebelah
parliament no [lah] not not that nice i think clarke quay is still nice pasal singapore river
and maybe #istana# lawa
ya you're not supp~ you're not supposed to fly like five or ten kilometers away from either these two places
maybe it's public safety and also like i think government property privacy [ah]
but which which hotel is it that's the problem you don't remember right
was it or only on mothership
dekat
(err)
surat khabar tak ada
as in like
facebook article
yes [a'ah]
i see
i think mothership is endorsed by government
i think so
(hmm)
(hmm) i believe so
do you know what's the
difference between sgag and mothership
no idea
mothership creates good content
mic mic keep drop no but just
no but
they just make more good content
mic drop
no [lah] just cause they came up with the singaporean dream game
[meh]
(um) i don't think so i don't know [lah] see [lah] if not because nowadays i think we are more interested to play checkers
(um)
well wak wak is i mean he's a champion at checkers then also is my mum and my uncle
yeah
no [lah] nothing much to tell like i keep losing to them
in malay they panggil dam [ah]
(mm)
[oh] my goodness you're almost twenty eight years old you tak tahu chess
well
now you're today years old
chess ke the checker board
(uh) he doesn't have but we have
you never see before right
yeah
cause it's in the storeroom we didn't have a
the chess the the pieces so we never took it out
do you know how to play dam
wait
play dam or play dumb
excuse me
it's twelve forty three in the morning
so
how is it
okay alhamdulillah
and now we're back
a cringe
hi
yes
[oh] yes
so basically
what it is is
you
instead of putting it in
all the boxes it at your side [eh]
apa dia buat is
you need to put the pieces
alternatively like if you are putting it at on all the black boxes put it on all the black boxes only don't need to work on the white
(mm)
yes [eh] but you can use either one [ah] either the black or the white [ah] but you cannot put on both colours
no if i put it on the black boxes you put it on the black boxes also
(mm)
and in chess you can move i think quite a few directions but for checkers or dam you kena move diagonally
but you can't move back you can only move forward
[eh] chess
[ah] chess
!alamak!
chess i'm not too sure
but diana i think
chess you can move like
front i think
or diagonal
but for
dam you need to move diagonally only but you can't move back
yes something new every day
then you start crying
[oh] !wah! [oh] !wah!

(um) iphone eleven know got sale [ah] macam tak sure kalau (um) the plan worth it or not because now my plan i think is (um) twenty five dollars
(uh) no contract [ah]

(um) ya but then
the new plan iphone eleven so you pay about
four hundred dollars
but i think minus fifty because got voucher
(um)
every month
pay fifty five so it's thirt~ almost double [ah]
okay bottom western epitope so calculate (um) mahjong
macam wasted [kan] gitu so calculate (um) macam
what okay two years [eh] so it's two years times fifty five dollars
(um) so that means i one month macam about extra thirty dollars then kalau dua tahun
times twenty four months [kan] about extra seven hundred dollars [ah] [kan]
but iphone eleven (uh) how much [ah] iphone eleven now
ya the lowest one [lah] i think thirty two g_b
okay
(um)
nanti [ah] nanti tanya bapak (uh) i think he he save a voucher or what
ya i check a bit the difference is about the incoming i think free [eh] same [ah] same (um)
twenty g_b i think
but for me i i use only macam ab~ about ten g_b gitu [lah]
[ah] tak banyak [ah] [ah]
i think
maybe less than ten [ah] maybe seven also
phone ni six s plus [ah] i think since (um) which year [ah] since twenty sixteen (uh) remem~ remember that time we go which wedding [ah] #medan# [ah] #medan# ingat
a southern or northern her window kaliyah asean
[ah] s~ siapa namanya kahwin tu kak lia [eh] kak lia [kan]
[ah] #medan# [ah] that time so that time i think [eh] that no that time #medan# twenty seventeen twenty fifteen [eh] tak tak sure [ah] twenty sixteen [kan]
(um) ya [lah] almost four years [ah]
[oh] no i don't want upgrade it's maybe four years [ah] macam gitu [ah]
[ah] that's why
[ah] sorry again
the lowest the lowest macam fifty five dollars [jer] yang the next expensive one is i think eighty [kan] something like eighty [ah] ya but i don't want i don't need the what data what for~ thirty g_b all this thirty g_b
tak pakai pun [kan]
[oh] but but that time [kan] that time i per~ pergi tu apa (um) challenger [kan] iphone seven
is two hundred and seven two hundred and eighty dollars i think seven [ah] but seven also like
also present #lobang# [ah] no haunted
[ah] no contract
but
no but
s_e bila dia dia [ah] bila keluar [ah] when bila release
[oh] [oh] k then
but the specs (um) similar to (uh) yang which iphone
actually ada ada iphone eight plus tak ada [kan]
[oh]
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight
[oh] masih ada lagi [eh]
(um) mana yang lagi mahal (um) iphone eight or
(mm)
but
iphone eight iphone eight ada tu [kan] face face i_d [kan]
i think iphone ten pon ada [kan] (uh) face i_d
ya but now starhub plan [ah] the iphone eleven is cheaper than iphone x
ambil iphone ten [ah] pelik [ah]
no what are they doing
dekat rumah
ya
[oh] (uh) today pergi sekolah apa
bapak
kerja [ah]
[oh]
[oh] so how many [ah] dua kali [ah] one week one week dua kali [ah]
[oh] then (uh) how how's your job search
then (um)
you k so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but i heard
actually now [eh] all the interview [ah]
the developer they [eh] you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
[ah] interview maybe yang second time [ah] second time dia orang suruh ambil this kind
this kind of coding test [kan]
[oh]
no i mean (uh) bukan yang bukan m_c_q [tau] the the one at (uh) what you call that
the the you must type the code inside
that one you that one tak boleh search apa online
i think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
(mm)
okay
(um) tak
so actually i i think you know right this monster dot com
[ah] i think they really keep calling you know
yesterday there's ada satu interview [eh] recruiter [kan]
it's like
what's the word [ah] macam
very pushy [ah] so like
like you know like you ask them to call back [kan] abeh dia cakap [ah] no only two minutes macam a bit annoying [ah] you know
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
[ah] what is the maximum [lah] the so called maximum but i think
i think better try to be firm [ah] [kan] because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
i mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit [ah] pointless [kan]
so like
be~ orang melayu cakap (um) jangan apa
[ah] i forgot the word lowball [ah] something like lowball [ah]
no no value [ah] [kan]
but like the des~ destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
most of the job dia orang cakap !aiya! it's like contract it's not really [ah]
it's not permanent [ah] but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
that is that makes sense [what] kalau tak no~ nobody will also macam
be eager to you know (um) ya
join the company like this
[ah] mostly
full time but because sekarang [kan] i teach tuition [kan]
so tuition
but ya that's why
no but tuition only left lagi dua bulan [ah] until (um) october [kan] o level atau n level [kan]
so that time middle of october [kan] so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months [ah] [kan] so actually
last week i just start (um) this new student [ah] budak melayu [ah] budak apa n level [ah] n level dekat #bukit-batok#
i think one or two weeks before [ah] two weeks before
but there's n level there's n level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right [ah] so
i think the normal acad or normal i think
but i think normal tech is the earliest [ah] maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same [ah] one week difference i think
the normal tech
!huh!
ya
no i think now they they make more centres [ah] i think they i think dia orang there's no way they can do in a big hall [what] [kan]
because like the hall
it's like a big group [ah] then people will walk past the same place right
so i think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
then yang students yang lain all pergi normal classroom [ah]
i think same time [ah] the the whole singapore mesti same time [what] kalau tak later how to know that you know
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better [lah] until october
i think part time got got a a lot job [ah] macam yang this (um)
kat mana [eh] (um)
data entry [lah] you know those
just typing on excel [kan] basic [ah]
[ah] office [ah] and typing or sending email those basic admin work [ah]
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some i think you see the job description [kan] is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some i think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said (um) they said okay monday to friday the timing is (um) i think
about five p_m to ten p_m [ah] or four p_m to ten like five hours [ah] or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
for part time mesti commit
(um) for two to four days a week
then when i say okay i only can do weekday then the person reply (um) sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear [ah]
ya as long like okay i think there's two right so i'm not developer [ah] so
for me best is (um) data analsyt atau business analyst
atau system analyst [ah]
like but mostly mostly also must support [ah] because my the thing i don't like is the support evac
kena twenty four seven support
sometimes middle of the night they will call i mean they call you up phone phone support [kan]
so phone support is a bit too much [ah] you know
[ah] that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
it's like like to me not much difference right kalau work from home then
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
i think python macam python for me is okay [lah] because it's a
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable [kan] it's a it's it's python programming considered high level [kan]
actually high level is the the code that macam can be readable [kan] so kalau macam if a human being baca the code
(uh) they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
(mm)
[ah] there's this code thing called fortran right betul tak
it's called [ah] fortran
a n ya
then what ni apa this there's this language namanya c hash [eh] apa c hash [eh] is it
is it c hash or something hash
[ah] c sharp
!huh! golac
g g o l a c [eh]
[oh] golang
but it's (um) the pace is what like dia ikut which (um) which language
(mm)
okay then
because
i don't really like to like build you know macam build all the app
building [kan]
or web development
i know how to like maybe like s_q_l all these [ah] data and then maybe
a bit of support [ah] the support kind of role [ah]
because like for me last time i work in a bank [kan]
ingat tak (um) during the year twenty
twen~ twenty nineteen [ah] twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen i think ya
[kan]
that time i work in a bank [kan] so
my job mostly like s_q_l [ah] then investigate [ah] gitu
so (um) laymans [kan] the back end [ah] so
you know logs [kan] you know logs
l o g s [ah] log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
[ah] error error dia akan email [kan] so times ten [kan] times ten
go to back end and then take everything out [lah]
then investigate maybe s_q_l or something
(um) the front part is a investigation [ah]
like macam need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
r_c_a but the it's like ticket [ah] like they say what
support and ticket and then
(uh) raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close [ah]
then last what you call that analyse [ah] whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite (um) interesting or it's it's quite a
like enriching to do this kind of work but yang tak suka is the i really benci is support twenty four seven on the phone [ah]
how do they expect you call me at four a_m right and then i can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because i'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called (uh) run the bank [ah] not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means (um)
it means that the the app is ongoing [ah] you understand like it's not a project [ah] that means the project already finish that means it's live [ah] live product being used by users [ah]
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china (uh) u_k all this so the timezone all weird weird [one]
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so u_s time is twelve hours before us [what]
ya then their working hours until our six a_m [what] so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues [what] i think there's only one period that
the like not say down time [ah] macam
low low what low traffic [eh]
[ah] nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven p_m [ah] because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right ja~ japan all ahead [what] only u_k [lah] then u_s just wake up [what] that time
because u_s there's two countries new york [eh] no two states
new york and where [ah] san francisco right l_a [ah] l_a l_a
no don't i don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server [ah]
i don't think so [ah] or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have i think but
like u_s because it's only a singapore company i mean because the bank is local bank [ah] our local bank so ya u_s the business not so much [ah]
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this [ah] this basic functions [ah] [kan]
[oh] they call it the green f~ [eh] green lane [eh]
but but
we cannot go right
nenek boleh pergi balik [ah] nenek
ya but somebody must handle that [what]
(um) i think tak boleh [ah] but [eh] but dia p_r right yang syakilah iman is p_r maybe [ah] i think
they can come
[ah] they they can say [ah] ya they can use the fact that their house right at #clementi# need to do something [ah] right collect the mail the mailbox [ah] because
[eh] i i think already six months they never collect the mailbox i think berlambak [ah] mail dia
(um)
but the the tenant [kan] you know the [eh] now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail [ah]
who
okay
no [ah] [oh] auntie i always just say cik cik rozi [ah] cakap something [ah]
cousins (uh)
they i think busy also [ah]
then dah you all dah makan belum
but
it's hard you know why because
i think i think the best time to cook is midnight [ah]
semua tengah tidur [kan]
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
tak dia punya ingredients [kan] beli kat pasar atau (uh)
!huh!
(mm)
so there's money
you mean the ikan is the the one that is boneless [eh]
it's not in the fridge [eh]
[oh]
if like this to i mean the sweet and sour fish i think
(um) mesti
fry the chi~ [eh] fry the fish first right
ya the sauce right then pour on top [kan] just just tuang
i think just but the sweet and sour you can make [ah] macam mix and match
apa apa ya like
tomato semua [ah] tomato (um) pineapple
[ah] capsicum sedap i like i like the capsicum
i think the it [ah] the the the prepa~ preparation is a
the yang makan masa [ah] [kan]
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife [ah] hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid [ah]
but it's it's good if you have a maid [ah] but
for for us actually if let's say our our family [kan] macam nak ada maid [kan]
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
kalau siapa dah kahwin [kan] atau like we have our own house [kan] maybe separate [ah] let's say i
or maybe i thirty five year apply for house [kan] so one maid right (um) share our #woodlands# house
they maybe my future house or your future house [ah] so then like the maid right
no i mean like one maid [ah] because like the maid tak payah just stay at one house do all the work [what] because sometimes mak ada nenek ada [kan] so maybe can
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else [ah] like
ya i think someone call but i ignore first [ah]
(hmm)
ya
no but i think
internally [kan] if
the maid is okay then we we must bayar for the transport
and maybe give them time off [ah] [kan] kalau
i think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off [ah] right
i think it it it's not about legal or illegal [ah] because (um) as long the maid
tak complain atau tak
feel macam pressure [kan] we we like they call it give and take [ah]
don't over over work the maid [lah] kalau maid is okay then okay [what] you know
!huh!
normally the maid off sunday [kan] one day off [kan]
ya
this one maybe we can plan ten [ah] next time because bapak [kan] dah tua [kan] nanti mak
like at least like the maid boleh masakkan actually the best [kan] the maid masak
right because if the maid masak right then we just need to buy the stuff [ah] then sekarang
tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh just order online [kan]
but any online pasar or not macam pasar food [eh] buy meat or chicken ada [eh]
but fair~ i mean like the betul punya pasar online maybe maybe
no because fairprice jual beef tak [eh] because beef is very hard to find right
but i think n_t_u_c they're a bit
[eh]
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map [kan] is fixed [ah]
but what you see in the v_r is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual [ah]
ya then if the stock finish
(um) macam mana the person tahu
[oh] !wah! cool [ah]
[oh] no [oh] but v_r means the device [kan] then the the user mesti jalan to
so call move [ah]
i think no but
i think i think [ah] singapore difficult because you know why or not
our our house all small [what] america everything is so big [kan] i mean america everything you see dia punya rumah besar-besar or i think european some also the house big [kan]
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental [ah]
but the device is (uh) quite mahal [kan] i think thousands right
the but i think the hardest part i think is the interface [ah] the mapping [kan] the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue [ah] [kan]
so seven days tak payah pergi kerja [ah] just somewhere else [ah]
but they they can they will monitor your work [ah]
[oh] ya [ah] stan~ standard meeting [ah] [kan]
[oh] last time that time zoom you all also use zoom [ah]
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people [kan] du~ during the covid
really [ah]
!huh! they going to open h_q here [ah]
ya but singapore smart [ah] i think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues [ah]
[oh] good [ah] [ah] are you b~ buying anything else from ikea
ikea the foo~ the food open or not [ah] now
ya
[oh] open already [ah] i don't know [ah]
itu hari cakap open the ikea but [oh] but now open [lah]
half [ah]
i think half of that
[eh] i think because i think
su~ susah nak apa kita
[ah] predict the people [kan] because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
[oh] actually don't but i think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those (um)
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what [ah] counter counter you know counter table right i think overseas a lot [ah] like last time i went i went exchange also same [ah] i i
because most people will eat solo [ah] because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so nobody can meet their friends to eat [what] so they just have to eat cepat-cepat makan then ba~ then just balik class [ah]
so
the counter table is like just one person [ah] then you face the you face nobody [ah] like you know face like a the wall or something [ah] so it's like against the wall [kan]
[ah] actually they should make like that
but that that time weird you know [ah] dekat mana [eh]
apa nama kedai dia yang mister you you know orchid house dekat #serangoon# gardens tu
orchid house the the indian food macam mamak [ah]
mamak food
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
al-azhar gitu those kind macam woodgrove gitu [ah]
#serangoon# garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor [lah] you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting [ah] like like #al-ameen# at our place the the woodgrove [kan]
ya open concept [ah] like is is like sheltered [lah]
there's a indoor and outdoor then i think that time covid
phase the first week of phase two [kan] atau i think i jumpa my friend during the phase two second week [ah] [kan]
phase two is about nineteen june [kan] so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june i go out my my friend makan dekat tu [ah] orchid house
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person [ah] then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side [tau] that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
pelik ke so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird [ah] [kan]
so that means like the four of you [ah] or three of you [kan] will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know i don't know what they are doing [ah] but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then [ah] section off like one table instead of six right become four [lah] you know
i mean they can do that [lah] but i think
maybe today they change [lah] because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
mesti customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else [kan] because
because of the apa seating arrangement
or if they more than five
and some people they apa like they in a group [kan] say eight people [ah] four four [kan]
so i think recently there's a news [ah] then they like to inter change like i think they
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then bersembang [lah] dengan kawan-kawan [kan]
but i think
but must pity the the business owner [ah] for because actually right like m_o_m very strict [ah] i mean [eh] it's it's not m_o_m the n_e_a [kan]
(uh) m_o~ [eh] it's n_e_a so they are very strict [ah]
so
i think some of the
(um) i heard the store owner [kan] atau business owner d~ dia orang call the
n_e_a [kan] complain [ah] like [oh] call police [ah] i don't know what they call [ah] they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually [oh] at first maybe they ask them to go out [lah] say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
but sometimes we think [oh] it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you tengok news
another search [ah] you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy [kan]
ya i think maybe like they have a counter [lah] like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't [ah] what you call that scan out [ah] checkout from the place
[eh] but do do you think it's possible [kan] kalau dia orang make a g_p_s system [kan] means by far away then they auto checkout
g_p_s [ah] if the person off g_p_s then tak boleh [ah] [kan]
ya the the app apa what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
!huh!
[ah] trace together [kan]
[oh] that one
it's good [kan] macam but if that one you off g_p_s or you off data cannot right
[oh] because of bluetooth [ah]
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at a_u
ya
[oh]
so like between [ah] android and i_o_s they also know what to do right
ya
(um)
may~ maybe i_o_s okay or maybe i change to google [ah] [kan]
i don't know [ah] because like maybe i want to try google [ah] but
because i have the you know la~ last time i buy the macbook air [kan]
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini [eh]
actually that one bagus [tau] pasal you like [eh] !hey! google then the you can play spotify
you can play (um) i mean you can play the [eh] what's it called [ah] the radio station like singapore radio station
[ah] live streaming [ah] as long you got wifi [lah]
so actually from the wifi [eh] but actually dangerous [oh] i realise [kan] they recognise our voice [oh]
the google home speaker [ah] i mean the pe~ i mean google home [ah]
because right that time [kan] my friend [kan]
k because my my friend he dia pakai google home [eh] google phone [tau] so i use apple [ah] but the that time i stay #punggol# also share with him [kan]
so
i ask google [ah] using my voice [ah] like when is my birthday or what is my age [ah] something
then they know [ah] cause i think like google gmail [ah] all this something
so like they know (uh) something like my birthday or my name [ah]
then because my friend got google phone right
so he use the the what google assistance [eh] yang cakap the voice [ah]
[oh] there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker [ah] the google home speaker [kan] then he ask (um) like what is my name or something [ah]
then the google know that it's him then say his name
[ah] or birthday [ah] [ah] i think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess [what]
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person [what]
[ah] so a bit scary [lah] i think but i i heard like i saw online that you know like community [kan] instagram or something [kan]
dia cakap even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
[ah] macam macam mana nak tahu [ah]
no i mean macam mana nak nak tahu that whether they are listening to you or not
but if the wifi off [kan] but k let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
i mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device [kan]
so will it still listen
no i think if let's say [oh] but i think google [kan] macam mana [eh] if you like ask question [kan] like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say (um) [oh] sorry we cannot
(um) connect you
to the
but default [ah] but if you ask like questions like (um)
something basic [ah] like (uh) what time is it maybe dia tahu [ah] kalau tanya something like (um)
[ah] offline what do you call it offline data [ah]
what basic basic functions [ah] [kan]
ya
it's good [ah]
that time i went that time i went exchange
because i think america amazon they use amazon [what] a lot so
my friend [eh] my friend singaporean [kan] but then he dia study full time dekat pergi luar u_s_a [ah]
then dia punya apartment [kan]
i think because they also got money [ah] so their apartment like one room one bedroom [ah] so like those studio [ah]
then dia pun ada alexa i think now alexa better [ah] because
got how many version [ah] i also don't know [ah]
smart home device [ah]
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven [kan] like is there a brand for smart oven now
[oh]
[oh]
got smart shower or not i don't know
[oh] but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there [lah] because later you go toilet
do business also cannot i think maybe they have a touch screen [ah] i don't know
or voice [ah]
[eh] but that means right covid better [what] if let's say because of covid right the hygiene [kan] then i think maybe future [ah] singapore the lift also maybe smart [kan]
or lift system
i think can make right
[oh] the base i mean there's a pedal [kan]
i think that one bukan maybe thai~ that one is it thailand something [ah] i cannot remember
[ah] the [ah] the dekat mana [eh] [ah] this place [ah] that time i went interview #tanjong-pagar# go it's called what guoco tower [ah]
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working [ah] so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens [kan] too many screen one is left one is right [kan]
so when you tap [kan] dia dia tahu which which place to go to [ah] like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down [what]
because you card is only one level [ah]
okay can you hear me
ya i can hear you clearly
we're talking about the cake jadi asal dengan cake tadi
ya
ya i saw the picture then after that you terus tukar daripada gambar jadi message from gambar then it become a message that is where saya macam
(mmhmm)
so that that was the part when i actually [eh] [ah] you ask you ask me cake because you didn't men~ mention macaron lagi so it was just cake
but i i didn't know the the macaron was choose [a'ah] sebab tu saya tanya
(mmhmm)
but she didn't say what [oh] it's a mix [eh] macaron dia mix colour [jer] [ah]
is it [oh] you can choose different like i i g~ i i don't eat macarons always so saya a bit lost
is it
tapi flavour no no no awak macam banyak-banyak flavour does it incur cost ataupun sama [jer] harga
[oh] okay i thought macam
[oh] it's not like semua satu satu satu macam (err) what you call it alternate macam selang-seli [ah] tak [eh] okay okay
mana dapat contact
[orh] abeh dia punya review is good
so the cake tak sedap [ah]
abeh the thing is kita tak boleh try dulu ke abeh macam gini a bit

(mm)
so that is cake that is done dah habis
for what
!huh! i don't apa yang two hour frame (err) saya tak faham
two hour time frame i think in advanced for them to get there i think [oh] okay i think i saya rasa they need to get there dorang nak kena stack up nak kena susun they need two hours for it to get ready so that means dalam macam they need to be there by six or something like that by seven they need to do the susun [ah] that's why they need two hours just in case tak it's a buffer time
okay [ah] i i could be right betul saya rasa ada chance betul
but because usually cake tak akan datang terus dah diri gitu they need to susun letak and then they macam ci~ ci~ [ah] tu [lah] [a'ah] [ah] (mmhmm)
cause i saw the message your mum macam nanti letak something decoration or something like that apa tu dia nak apa
dia nak apa y~ y~ your mum nak suruh macam jangan plain gitu [ah] so ada ada decoration
(mmhmm) (mm)
okay
biar [lah] by the way tadi #nabil# call call you first [eh] dia call you first is it

so anyway yang tadi dia cakap (err) dia kata kalau i think i think the ambassador tanya ke apa he say just tell them they are part of the crew [jer] he will also say [lah] they part of the crew that's what he told me (mm) so kira it's like macam we have to be on the same page [ah] dia cakap gitu [jer]

to i think talk to m_o_m that's why [lah] that's why he he i think he made
[a'ah]
ya [lah] fifty at one time so that means somehow pasal i think most of the venue don't want to take the risk fifty fifty fifty pun still t~ the same people [pe] keep coming [kan] so i think most venue don't want they just do fifty [jer] so i think #shah-ibrahim# somehow
but but because that time tak silap saya dia cakap adik [eh] mak dia pergi maknya #firdaus# ni went for the wedding one of the cousin wedding it already happening [lah] #shah-ibrahim# allow macam said [ah] (uh) the mum saw dia punya invite is i think about a few hundred so ada orang ambassador [eh] no i think orang m_o_m or ambassador is down there to (uh) overlook kat depan [ah] he standing in front [ah] ya ya ya ya ya correct correct correct i think that's i think that's how he managed to convince them [ah] as in okay you can see at how we provide [lah] i think that's the procedure macam gitu
is it
(mmhmm) (mm) ya
dia datang (mmhmm) (mmhmm) tapi memang

(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya [ah]
i was
i know i remember but just i was i was doing i was writing down something dah
what else [ah] what else [ah]
[oh] yes tomorrow need to start that gop~ s_g cam s_g cam ya need to try out both the s_g cam is at your place [what] yup
one is at the bicycle
the stand what kind of stand table stand
tripod st~ small tripod stand small [tau] very small kecil punya kecil betul-betul kecil for the s_g cam [ah] [kan] ada dia ada yang
ya u_s_b okay i think it can
use the same wi-fi to sync i don't know need to try i i i need to google i need to do a bit of research i don't know need to check cause from what i saw yesterday was using u_s_b but then probably boleh pakai on wi~ by wi-fi kalau by wi-fi that means boleh gerak orang just hold dekat [jer] anyway it's really small kecil gila so it's easy [ah] to hold it kalau tidak orang pakai chest pack [ah]
okay nevermind i i i i figure it out i'll i'll look because yesterday i saw the video already
tak pasal you have to face it have to face that's why dia punya screen face us macam very awkward awkward [lah] you have to see yourself i don't want
that now but like abeh laptop dia the thing is the laptop is big you have to keep shifting around orang leceh [seh] nak pegang kalau benda tu kecil dia boleh pegang pakai tangan and then just turn left right turn left right [jer] which is more better rather than you shift the whole screen every time just to adjust angle
(mmhmm)
ya i think it it can work i think okay look i need to i t~ ya that's why i said we we need to do we need to see first [ah]
work from home and then besok i got one site pukul tiga
tak [ah] sekejap [jer] pergi site
saya saya pergi site survey that's it takde pergi office
ya [lah] about one hour nya tempat pasal ni bukan really pasal dia re~ macam just resurvey w~ kita dah ada barang tu just need to shift it somewhere a proper location like in another location [ah] (mm) (mmhmm)
ya ya should be sempat [lah] it cannot be that long
nangis lagi
sama macam #fajr# juga i think it's just a stage where
(mm)
tak pasal tangan mak kakak i think tangan terus pump jadi tahu i think you can never spare the kid
(mm)
(mm) tapi bukan
i think bukan pa~ pukul sampai sakit pukul just to [ah]
kaca~ [ah] even even even macam just just to cla~ macam sepak pakai tangan pun litera~ macam just like that just dia tahu dia [eh] kena jadi dia tahu [eh] sakit okay so stop [a'ah] [lah] (mm) bukan sampai [lah] dera banting takde [lah] not like that
anyway tadi yang the video i send to you was too long
[oh] that's why you said it was too long but but actually it's quite good [lah] it it gives macam ustaz tu used to i went i used to went for his classes last time
ustaz #madarrus# he used to be in singapore now he's i think at k_l (mmhmm) (mm) so i went for his classes last time ada cerita juga [lah] cerita dia so anyway he's quite good honestly kalau tanya saya baik so the the sister ask you saw the question right the sister ask about men
not being good leaders that kind of thing [ah] and then he he agree to it [lah] and then he explained why maybe the reason why things happen men nowadays boys nowadays doesn't turn out to be macam have a leadership have leadership [ah] responsibility like old people dorang [kan] ada responsibility it's just that nowadays we are okay [ah] simply put i also understand [ah] dia cakap macam nowadays (err) parents okay macam dia cakap parents usually perempuan takpe tak boleh balik lambat perempuan very strict semua tak boleh ya dia macam partly part
exactly pasal la~ dorang apply to girls that's why tu dia cakap and then
(mm) then yang itu that's the problem pasal i think believe dulu orang kampung macam macam mana pun nanti kalau orang-orang lama pun [ah] nanti macam mana pun they will still start teaching the boys to tak responsibility kau nak kena jaga adik kau macam gitu
(mmhmm) [oh] ya ya ya
exactl~
macam !wah! bagus [pe] kau bagus macam the the the biasness [eh] biasness
tak tahu [ah] i think sekarang happening to us is the modern and then we are too exposed dengan
ya [lah] western it's come from western that's why dulu orang kampung dia cakap budak-budak lelaki they they they become matured faster pasal the dad i i think the further the behind part they explain a lot of things [ah] macam tha~ it the mother also play a role dia kata macam not to strike not strike fear [tau] macam to gain respect for macam the mother hold the status of the father macam make the status among the the children they fear the father fear the father macam respect [tau] yes pasal dia cakap macam
(mm) abeh yes dia kata macam dulu orang cakap bapa balik [jer] tak payah bapa cakap balik nampak bapa balik takde tunggu straightaway masuk rumah punya bapa tak payah tenung pun dia step tak nampak [jer] automatically come home you know pasal automatically the father have this respect already abeh macam the mum dia kata hold this status macam okay ni bapa kau punya cawan kau jangan pegang macam ini pinggan bapa kau punya kau jangan makan dari bapa kau punya pinggan macam the mother als~ so dia macam keep dia gitu [tau] so dia kata the father is the leader of the family and the mother is the leader of the household and children macam gitu so but overall it's still the father [ah] so dia kata nowadays even the father lack that macam i don't know what happened [lah] but then dia kata the fathers just lack lack
abeh dia kata yes [ah] tu [ah] he was talking about that also that was that one thing also
then then he said then he also mentioned mentioned this thing [ah] men have ego and men always wanted to be needed faham [kan] wants to be needed
yes that's the thing perempuan asyik i want i'm independent dia kata tak boleh the the rule of a man is to be needed kalau kau take away that he's not needed dia a very yes that's one thing ataupun dia punya ego mati nanti dia terus macam abeh dia kata that's why a lot people fall into depression pasal guy not needed women are independent dia cakap gitu that that's the tapi it's a this is the theory [ah]
dia kata ya
but
yes that's what he said
dia kata tak the thing is y~ macam dia dia kata ada there was this one person who came up to me ustaz i'm married i have children and then i i don't have a problem but the main problem is my husband dia cakap gitu so actually i can earn my own money but i don't need him but i don't know why i'm married lepas tu ustaz tak boleh cakap apa-apa i don't know why i'm married macam i think it's just pasal no the thing is she is a woman tak bukan tak sayang i think over time dia ada children dia busy kerja they live too long together you get tired of the guy get tired of the guy something like that
read what book
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
together right ya yes yes yes
(mmhmm) (mm) away
okay wait kalau you have a kids that means you separate from your kids [ah] just the two of
(mmhmm) (mm) then once a month just the two of you ya okay okay correct (mmhmm)
(mm)
the bond [ah] the bond together [ah] macam have adventures [ah]
develop again [ah] [oh] ya rekindle [ah] kira ada semangat membara balik
light up light up
tak okay [eh] i think it's easy to say the thing is it's easy to say [tau] but then kalau awak tengok [eh] the context of singapore in the context of singapore susah you see [eh] sekarang [jer] to survive some you you look at the household lelaki bini nak kena
ya ya ya [a'ah] [ah] i think ya [lah] it's about managing also ya correct you need to plan
activity [lah] [a'ah] ya correct tak payah spend money ya just to macam cycling i can yes yes (mmhmm) (mm)
tetapi [kan] (mm) tapi still and then macam this kind of thing is one of the thing tapi macam dalam every day tu macam kalau boleh macam dapat solat jemaah macam malam together that would be ya that that how the ya that that's how you [ah] (mmhmm) that's like how to
ya [lah] nowadays ya [lah] tapi mak cakap
ya boleh boleh tak salah [a'ah] boleh memang boleh macam saya solat jemaah kat masjid (mm)
boleh
(mm) can [ah] ya boleh [kan] dah cakap macam suami nak gi dia suka sembahyang jemaah kat masjid so just go solat masjid jemaah balik dia imamkan isteri lagi [ah] boleh no nothing wrong with that pasal isteri have to do her chores abeh dia nak solat jemaah [pe] kesian [kan] solat [lah] bagus think this kind of thing can can can keep ourselves
[a'ah] [lah] tapi pa~
hopefully
tapi macam macam #firuz# (mm) macam #firuz# he likes to solat macam #firuz# is see so far [lah] #firuz# and #amira# like to solat jemaah so i think they don't want to solat sendiri-sendiri so which is good also [lah]

kadang-kadang #firuz# bawa solat tapi #firuz# punya #al-fatihah# good [seh] saya kadang-kadang macam [eh] you haven't pray [ah] you pray on your own first lepas tu saya dengarkan [lah] i correct him then it's okay

(mm) we can't really go outside unless they are for like necessities and stuff like that ya rindu [seh] keluar dengan kawan semua especially karaok
i mean like for this current situation right now you can still go out with friends [ah] but to like limited places and with limited amount of people i think the max is like five people or somethin
(mm) like i say limited places sebab like some places pukul sepuluh dah tutup [seh] so macam
like there's lesser option for you to lik
(mm) choose from i gues
(mm
ya that sounds like a good plan tapi like as i said (mm) semua orang pun busy aku pun busy juga since i'm looking full tim
bu
if you really want to go staycation (err) you need to tell me earlier so i can like plan my schedule and take leave
(um) ahead kau nak pergi staycation (err
kau ada ke hotel that you find interesting at the moment like any kind of promotion that you see or stuff like tha
(mm) actually that place one pun bagus juga [ah] i went there for my friend's birthday bash that was like pre c_b period like before circuit perio
(mm
all i can say was that i remember the bed being comfy and i mean even there if there's like no pool right we can just chill and watch netflix and you know have food take away then we can eat at the hote
kalau ada room service pun baik juga
(mm) talking about #shangri-la# i came across the article dekat apa tu the smart local if i'm not wrong pasal the #shangri-la
they actually having promotion where like i think you have one day staycation from like ten to eigh
and you are paid seventy five dollars per adult and the good thing about that promotion is that you can have access to all the facilities [ah] mean you can go like if you like water activities we can go do some kind of lik
don't know the pedal thingy i don't know what you call that or we can just hang out by the poo
i don't know [lah] it's entirely up to you i don't know i also don't know when the promo ends also i aku rasa it's end of this septembe
tak salah aku [ah
kno
(mm) (err) i mean like if really cannot find a like we can~ really cannot go to shangri la there's other affordable hotels i guess if i'm not wrong you can use th
website agoda or something where you can find like a day hotel for you to hang out with my friend usually use that [lah] for like to sur~ surprise them for like birthday or something they always do that and (mm
what else [eh
aku dengar-dengar kau punya kawan pun kerja dekat #shangri-la# how was the place like i know my friend work there before but has
waitress waiter if i'm not wron
he said the food there nice [lah] but tak halal [lah
(mm) ya maybe we should [ah] but we really have to plan well i guess i mean kalau tak boleh staycation pun i guess we can do other activities cause like there's a lot of dessert places and also like food places we can visit i have a list of it [lah] maybe i ca
take you out for dinner or something you can jus
you know walk around singapore see the sight view or something but nowadays rain [lah] so i scared [sia
how to say go out later rain no umbrella stuck in rain borin
ya i remember pemalas malas nak jalan [oh] i remember that cafe i think it's like hot chicks or somethin
(mm) if i'm not wrong my date went there before and he said that is not bad [lah] maybe [lah] we should we should go there but you have to find a time when it's not crowded and a lot of people (mm) if you really want to go cafe and like you know do some kind of activities righ
aku recommend kau pergi i mean we we can go to cat cafe dekat rail mal
very cute kau boleh main dengan kucing while you like have your dessert or some stuff (mm) cause i saw this on my friend's instagram and it looks really cute and the price is also not so bad [lah] it's affordable and other than tha
i also heard about this cafe called the mind cafe but this one also like a lot of people has been going there and it's crowded so you really have to find a time where there's not a lot of peopl
the mind cafe is just like macam apa ni you go there and then you order some drinks and you can play games like board games and stuff like tha
seems interesting but that malay cafe that you're talking about sounds really shady asal pergi sana aku pun tak tahu
oka
of cours
(uh huh
(uh) (uh) (mm) maybe can ajak ayu also [ah] bu
you know me i'm still awkward with her right cause like i never meet her for so long i also don't know what is she doing with life also like the last time i met her was whe
i accompanied her to her job to sign up for a job at this hotel i am not really sure but it's near suntec city or something like that then that was the last time i really like go out with her other than that i didn't talk to her i didn't text her or whatsoever it jus
pelik it's weird [ah] i scared i'm awkward with her i mean you you're closer with her i guess i don't kno
(err
i mean ya [lah] aku tahu during secondary school i was a nerd [lah] cause i was really focusing on like you know finishing my o's going poly and shit s
i mean i had a fe~ i i mean i talk to guys during that period but i don't think dating was an option cause i mean you look at our school [lah] lelaki semua pecah [sia
let's be honest can't they're i mean they are not pecah but they're not like you know nice people so i rather not be attached to the
(mm) but in pol
(mm) i don't really ya [lah] i i never reall
post if i have any like relationship or whatsoever because i feel like there's no poin
like you know posting online that i'm with this person or whatsoever as long as like me and him know that we're dating and he knows them well to tell other people that he's dating to
i will do my part also i guess you don't really need to show everything online [lah] for me [ah] cause aku rasa kalau if show everything online nanti kalau kau orang break what what you going to do all the pictures will be gone and it's a waste of effort plu
i don't know i just don't like sharing much i like to keep it low key to me [lah] the lesser people know the bette
like i will obviously i will tell my close friends [lah] that i i'm in a relationship and stuf
but y
i don't know i just don't like sharing it's weird i i don't know how you all do it like kau orang just post pictures of each other and stuff like that i'll i'll feel weird doing that i guess it's just not me [ah
(mmhmm
#liyana# #liyana# whatever her name is sounds very familiar is it tha
th
i guess the brother of that dude who tried !aiya! you know the creepy guy who tried to talk to yo
righ
okay [lah
he's weird just just stay away from him he give me he gives me weird vibe
but i really hope that you will quit delifrance cause that place is very toxic and the management is literal shit i don't know what other nicer words to describe their management to their towards their employer [eh] towards their employe
cause it's really really bad and i also heard about your manager your manager i
is not a very nice person [lah] as i can se
and i guess those i really think that delifrance or any kind of retail workers are underpaid [ah] i guess like having like seven fifty per hour or eight fifty per hour is not that sufficient especially you're working like part time part time only lik
a few days you can come to work [kan] macam tak fair [seh] kau tak akan earn tak akan apa ni hold duit yang cukup untuk sekolah and for your own like needs sebab aku tengok kau design kau selalu macam
kena pakai printers semua untuk print kau punya project so tu semua pakai duit [sia
so ya please quit that jo
i mean the job is fine is just the culture there is ba
and i really hope this (um) new job will open more opportunity for you since it's like more in line to what you're doing for school right so you can build up your portfolio from ther
plus you have experience from your like i_t_e internship so that will be a good point [ah
(mm) (mm) (mm
!huh! som
!huh! someone got fired who [sia] siapa [seh] what happen i'm curiou
i mean she worked there for eleven years [sia] as a full time worker and the pay i
from what i heard [lah] last time when i use to work at delifrance also like is not enough an
tak baik [seh] manager too i mean she's doing baking [what] is she suppose to split herself int
two like i mean like b
apa [eh] orang kata be mor
flexible i guess like if she's really busy baking for the shit right i mean baking for like you know the breads and stuff like that then like at least her as a manager she can handle the cashier [what] tak salah [pe] asal dia macam gini [sia] tak faham [seh
[oh] my god i know my manager also don't really like her every time when she call my outlet right my manager will give that eye roll it's her again it's her agai
ya i think it's time to move on sis that place is toxic and she's toxi
[a'ah] [sia] i don't know why they don't want to increase the minimum wage i feel like it's not fair [ah] your like some people in certain cat~ category are earning this much and this much for like you know for their work i don't think it's sufficient for them to liv
on with that kind of salary plus (um) aku ada bilang kau ke tak yang aku punya matair sekarang tengah kerja temperature taking righ
dia punya his pay also got cut like previously it was twelve dollars right but now they cut it to eight fift
(um) i think ya eight fift
so he's like (um) i don't think i'll stay in this job for so long cause he say like it's very stressful [lah] because everyday he to fight people not doing the safe entr
and just now also he say got this woman not wearing masks and she claim that she's pregnant and she has a letter from the doctor saying that she don't need to wear mask wha
i i i don't i don't understand like i mean you're pregnant okay i get it but what does it have to do with your not wearing mas
it's a bit dumb so he like he was really pissed off [lah] like why do i have t
really face this kind of people like kesian [ah] juga cause of this like covid thing right so they had to hire people for like temperature screener but some people are jus
you know !wah
safe entry damn leceh [leh] !huh! must walk one round [ah] just to go to the entrance i mean like it's for your own safety also gila [ah
gila
no [lah] he finishing school already he's going n_s this year if i'm not wron
ya [sia] he so old but haven't go n_s because like he finish i_t_e [mah] and after that he has to go poly (err
ya [seh] if i was in that job i think i would fight peopl
i would legit fight them
gila [sia] this kind of people like tak ikut rules abeh yang like they they are they they are the one who's doing something wrong abeh kita orang pula yang salah but it is what it is [lah] what can we d
(mm
(mm) i mean i'll be busy with my school also [what] so it won't be such a big deal i guess i mean i mean like i heard stories [lah] n_s your girlfriend will leav
you blah blah blah but i don't know don't really like ikut sangat cakap orang
i mean it's your own relationship you know what's best for you and communication is ke
communication is key comprehension also key cause like some people can communicate but they don't understand so it's annoying (hmm) whatever [lah] it is what it is [ah
life will continu
in short overall everything will work out fine anyways aku dengar after your interview kau keluar dengan kawan kau [kan] pergi mana [jer] merayap [jer] kerja
you [ah] you have a nice guy for you but you don't want and i don't understand i mean like from your stor
like he pay for your stuff and he didn't do anything creep like that ustaz who is a creeper don't know why you go out with those kind of guys also those disgustin
then like you reject him like that then he just friends he's a nice person why don't give him a chance but i mean like you do you sis i won't have any objection i mean you are still young also you what twenty tw
plus sixteen ex is quite a lot so what does that mean he he matair for like two months habis tu break then another girlfriend is it sixteen banyak [sia
i see i mean like it's entirely up to you i feel like having a relationship right now also is not that compulsory or neede
just focus focus on yourself [lah] lagipun kau lagi muda there are other things for you to worry about like your school and your career there's a lot of things in front of you you have to achieve before you know finding the right on
but six years ago sixteen ex and he's twenty that doesn't corroborate sis i'm doing the math an
it's hurting my brai
but okay [lah] it is what it he is [lah] he have sixteen have sixteen [lor] what can i d
pelik [ah

age is not an issue [ah] because (um) kawan aku i have this friend [ah] my friend he's working together with me right no
he's twenty eight [lah] he's getting married next month and he was like sorry i didn't invite you cause like (um) the like he i understand [lah] because his (um) ceremony is just between his family so it's a very small kind of ceremony they just do it at hom
to get marrie
he say like he save money then i'm like okay [lah] go ahead no worries no not a big deal it's your day not my day he was like he was talking to me and my friend [lah
i'm twenty eight already and i feel like everyone around me is going to uni and even you all you all too he was like i feel very pressured to go to uni then i'm lik
age tak kisah [seh] i mean kalau kau lagi ada macam semangat kau nak sambung sekolah and you have the time why no
and he's like i'm scared that i don't have the money and the time because i mean i understand him he's getting married the marriage life next mont
but i tell him the more he delay the more he procrastinate until when [seh] dia nak ambil like nak finish the degree then he was like and i've i also advised him [lah] lik
money isn't really a issue if you really know how to save u
money and plus there are other helps for you to like take right you know like #mendaki# or f_a_s you can just apply it it'll be great help for you to like pay off your school fee
(mm) then he's like okay [lah] i'll think about it then like last friday i saw him taking out his freaking education certificate scanning so that's great that means he's going to apply despite being twenty eight it's not an issu
(mm) tak habis-habis go [jer] part time rabak

ya ya ya
yes that's right so that's why you've been talking melayu all the way [kan] [ah] so you have to you cannot dia macam nak kena ada sixty percent of (uh) i think it's lower
(mm)
ya
so apa ni (uh) so that's why [lah] aku rasa macam
[ah] aku quite upset with her cause she you know she just mentioned my name without apa ni
suka suka cakap aku ni macam dia cover up her sh~ her her apa
her story
to show that she's innocent yup
ya cause the person money one k she cannot get on the spot
you get what i mean
ya cause she also mentioned to the person yang dia punya husband is not working for a few months already
the the one who sustain the business is the one yang dia scam kita you get what i mean or not
dia tutup lubang gali lubang
(mm) but then she will buy time to refund
people like us
get what i mean
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
you think they know our face
at times at times dia bukan kat situ at times bapa her father-in-law dia mother-in-law dia melayu
and laki dia melayu
[oh]
(uh huh) dewa
[oh] do have it there [ah]
[oh] it's like a mini #geylang# [lah]
[ah] it's a mini #joo-chiat# [ah] mini #joo-chiat#
[ah] all the malay punya ni [ah]
(mm)
(mm) name
[oh]
when was that
when was that that you went to
[ah] that one her business just started on february [seh]
(mm) so maybe she but but the person who (uh) the the refunded yang one k tu dia pergi dia [dah] pergi kedai dia
she went down to the shop she saw her husband
ya she talked to to [ah] the person [lah] the #aminah# but she never talked to the husband [lah]
ya she was there
she was there but the second time that she came down it was the bapa mertua
[ah] yes so that's why she doesn't want to make a scene dia keluar daripada kedai tu dia tunggu si #aminah-muslim# ni dekat [dah] [lah] aku tak tahu nama dia betul #aminah-muslim# ke tak padahal dia put #aminah-muslim# aje agaknya
and then after that dia apa ni (uh) she buy time again [ah] buy time
she doesn't even have actually supposedly that time she have to pay seven hundred okay sekali terus dia cakap [ah] i only have se~
no she only have seventy dollars like what
i mean but but we are so lucky that we are we never take a lot [lah] [eh]
ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty
ya [lah] she scam another person [lah] babe she go and advertise she say who want to buy wholesale then people like us macam aku will go and message her and then she will say [oh] minimum this kind of amount thirteen dollars per piece you know that kind of thing
but then again i don't know i until when she's gonna do this cause
at one point she wouldn't have enough money to pay that person and then this thing would be big
betul tak
(mm)
three weeks yup three weeks before us this week is fourth week [ah] fourth month (uh) fourth week
(mmhmm)
[oh] in fact she (mmhmm)
ya ya true
then suddenly become her husband delivery friend whatever
then (uh) in fact (um) this #aminah-muslim# right (uh) the the other part~ the other party who was also scammed by her [ah] dia also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
but when ya when she when she messaged the supplier the direct thai supplier cause she is the one who gave #aminah-muslim# this number the contact [lah] so
the the thai suppliers told her that #aminah-muslim# tak order langsung
so which sources and then #aminah-muslim# #aminah-muslim# ni macam cakap (uh) please show me the message macam dia ada cakap buat apa aku nak show kau message tu [seh]
that's why
[kan] so she is going to go babe this kind of thing [eh] once you do this kind of thing [eh] maybe you get #shiok# with it [ah] you get carried away with this scam [kan] but the you still can pay is okay you know but once you cannot pay [ah] that's it your name will be viral all over the social media i'm telling you honestly
dia belum kena buku dengan ruas
dia kena buku dengan ruas [eh] yang orang suka kaki viral [eh] she will get it [ah] confirm
[kan]
that's why that's why macam kita have to apa orang kata ambil sikit-sikit [ah] cuma aku nak tahu juga si #lia# tu dapat daripada mana ni
(mm) [oh] really
where you saw outside or
(mm) that one is a love your style that one is love your style dia punya facebook
(mmhmm)
(oo) okay i saw the the advertisement also she have a few (uh) few (uh) apa ni baju which is the same
she selling at twenty two dollars or something like that if i'm not wrong
twenty five [lah] dia tu
but but but then again (uh) they take from the same supplier the one that i order [lah]
(mm) i hope this one is true [lah] at least we have a you know direct supplier yang trustable [lah] you know
i already told her just give us (uh) new design you tell us [lah] cause malaysia punya boleh dapat lebih cepat apa
(mm) i'm not sure tapi tengok daripada thai supp~ thai punya supply juga i think
ya that's the thing
[eh] have you seen that patchwork that retro patchwork yang the baru punya retro marble [ah]
i think you gonna like it
(uh) yang si #sadiah# tu pun bawa and i saw a few others yang bawa
this it's it's pleated but it's the same like marble design but the colours are more glaring yang dia ni pun ada tunjuk aku jenny ni dia ada tunjuk aku juga the colours [lah] but i i i feel like we already have the marble right right
also not sellable
ni pun tengok tengok ni [lah] babe tengok rezeki orang [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya ada yang big pleats ada yang smaller pleats
ada yang macam the quality yes ada yang termasuk
ya for me aku rasa yang macam ada tunic tu tunic is also considered as pleats [kan] tapi dia tak macam pleats sangat kau faham tak macam dia ada spread
(mmhmm)
(mm) baby will be sending on thursday night is it
and then this one i want to ask her to give me the orders by by tomorrow [lah] actually she already give [ah] later [lah] this wholesale [lah] i don't know she want or not
then thursday she have to transfer to me
[ah] ya but #su-muhammad#
ya like like real like that [ah]
(mmhmm) like ours [ah] like the ruffle dress i thought that would be a hit but then the ruffle dress is the most difficult to sell actually
ya cause i think the ruffle dress is pendek
[kan]
(mmhmm) no the side the mermaid part
but it's very very hard to sell [lah] i don't know why
just put it at #nina-sazali# it will be a hot kicks [lah] for us habis [lah]
[ah] like like ya
[ah] yes yes like natalie bella you see natalie bella she's selling the same stuff and then she put on influencer you know what i mean
so ya i think we need to invest [lah] but then again i don't see [lah] we don't need to take a lot of stocks [lah] anyway for me [lah] [eh] i don't really
[ah] like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever i don't have that dream to to make it into a shop macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke i don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead kau nak kena ada manpower
macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa you know just on and as and when
(mmhmm)
yes
true
defects
they will ask for a refund
ya so that's why for me when i do this (um) online thingy it's actually for for aku to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
and you know to to to run the shop
yes true cause my kids are still small i i'm i'm also working in the morning you see so i don't see maybe like flea market i'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off punya event
but if to to be in a shop everyday i don't think i'm looking forward to that cause that's not where i see myself as unless maybe i don't know my my son and daughter grow up
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) i did a flea market before
no
perfume
(mmhmm)
ya looks like it [ah]
but i think if you buy the garment kau tahu you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
(mm)
open and then clear ya it's just like our live [lah] sometimes i don't want to open this you know but then i have to open it
(mm)
ya
ya the man ya
ya but ya i think but once in a while maybe once a month can do this flea market stuff but not like every week you have to do this flea market i'm not into that looking forward to any like you know every week i have to go to a flea market cause for me is much more on you know home-based i don't know i mean some people have big dreams [lah] but i i don't see i don't know how about you
ya i mean i i love to go to a flea market but but then again like you said setup and cleaning up and then manpower i mean you have to have manpower for it [lah]
which is (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya about nine a_m
ya you know like the event in the make up you know like the what last time they always have this exhibition all [lah] what is it called
what is it [ah] expo expo all these [eh] bazaar is it a mini bazaar [oh] my god i i i i've been seeing i did a bazaar before [ah] last time i was working in the bazaar ramadan
making bubble tea [eh]
when i was a teenager i still remember that that bubble tea was a new craze you know that time i was in sec~ sec~
sec~ sec~ sec three or sec four [lah] that time
and it's very tiring [seh] it's very tiring [oh] my gosh
(mmhmm) boss
(mm) some more we will have to think of the money
ya true
so
(mm)
i think i think
ya rather than you have some live you see they have to go to the shop as well cause they have a shop so they do it in a shop so like i said i'm not looking i don't know maybe in ten years time maybe i don't know like what i'm doing right now is just for a supplementary to my income
berapa [dah] lima puluh ke kau [eh] fifty [eh] okay [oh] ya you're forty now [ah]
[eh] age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even #saadiah# [ah] she said [lah] next year kita buka kedai [lah] i was like seriously
dia nak boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big [ah] you know like inside my heart [oh] no way i'm not gonna dream that big you know
[ah] she wants to quit her job yes
but then again i i think that she is like what you know semangat lima minit kind of person
alright then after that seeing that art seeing that people can actually sell the dress then she suddenly twisted her her mind again fickle-mindedly wanted to sell dress again
(mm)
she offered she offered but i don't want
knowing her you see how different [ah] from that live with my live
(mmhmm)
anyway if i do for her it's i never come out the money [what]
right so she is the boss
babe the friend staying condo [lah] the friend shipped [ah] buy the stocks [lah] cause when i heard the live [ah] she said self-collect at #woodlands# not at #tampines#
so it's from the house
[oh] somebody is crying is it
[oh] kucing [ah] [oh] okay cat fighting ya
what to do [eh] cat fighting nature nature
okay so like like i said [lah] so i mean i'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but i'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like berkinja-kinja you know at the live she used my words like wanita lindungan kaabah all these you know and then but with me !huh! pening [lah] pening [lah] pening [lah] over here pening over there pening
ya
what
the other one is the lady's punya [ah] (um) dia punya apa ni [ah] anak (mmhmm)
so okay [lah] i hope this conversation doesn't leak out [ah]
no no but i'm i'm going to i'm going to give her back [lah] in her own time [ah] i don't want to sell for her anymore [lah] but i don't want to make it so obvious [lah] you know
[ah] ya [ah] but i don't want to make it actually in fact i don't after the incident
ya tak ada hati ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class [meh] cause i don't have any i got a condo maybe you get what i mean like for me [lah] never mind [lah] i mean we can find our own supplies i mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know memang we never come out with a lot of money [lah] but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can [lah] (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
true true we are you see we are left with only a few dress only like one or two three thailand dress [ah] i ordered five thailand dress now i'm left with three thailand dress
ten dresses ya and then baby will be twenty pieces right already a lot of people reserve
the the newest the slip [eh] the slip denim [eh] we we took the denim colour right the one in front
[ah]
one one person one person one who really wanted so i i already told her that one is the #saadiah# punya friend [ah] she wanted to buy she messaged me just now
yes i don't know she saw my post whatever [lah] so and then she said ya i saw your posting the slip top i said i have a few colours now [lah] i have the pink i have the maroon and the brown
but then she i gave her the whole picture with the new that one right then she show me that she wanted that denim [lah] i said okay [lah] i can reserve for you but i said i will only invoice you when my the item is in hand cause i don't want to people to pay first
nanti barang tak datang and then after that people will chase us i don't like all these you know i don't want to drama drama

[oh]
[oh] really
you should you should [lah] you are staying in #woodlands# [what] you organize [lah]
ya
[oh] !wow! your husband don't want you to be an influencer i mean i mean you know what when you do this kind of charita~ charitable work [eh] or you know like you make to save the earth save the frog save the animals you know that kind of thing save food you know i mean at the end of the day you're actually giving to (um) orang yang memerlukan the feeling of that to do this social work is very very apa orang kata ya it's very rewarding in fact it is
ya it takes two hands [ah] ya i mean but if you have a husband who is quite macam understanding that okay you're doing this for a good cause i mean he will let you go to do this it's good [lah] you know but i know that some people have different different perspectives of
marriage or you know how they want to control their partner [lah] or you can become the wanita lindung kaabah lindungan kaabah number three [lah] never mind [lah] redha redha
have but i'm not inside the whatsapp
for my new b_t_o my new b_t_o i'm inside the telegram
for the whole of #tampines# green verge
ya so because i want to know the progress of my flat right so [ah] it's still progressing (uh) now the buildings are building up
(uh) then after that it's already ninety over per cent progress
from the h_d_b you know there's a b_t_o h_q is it website ya (mmhmm)
ya (mmhmm)
ya but i'm only thinking of #alisha# i don't when i have to call up the school ya when [ah] i'm very confused cause i don't know when is the exact date that i will get the key
what should i do
she will be in primary darjah dia baru darjah no darjah empat [lah] [ah] darjah it's primary four ya
that's the thing and then i also was thinking of my workplace i mean this is quite near to my house my new house as well [lah] you know i have to take about four stops away from my new
ya but then again i also don't know when i'm moving right
get what i mean so i will start start off this next year if i haven't move out i will start off at this place
ya so i mean if you already start off at this place why why would you want to move out of to another place right i see first [ah] but then again it's quite near to my house as well it's only like three or four stops away
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but then i have to wake up early (mm) i have to wait for her
[kan] so i don't i don't know [ah] it's very stress [ah] fikir [kan] ni semua
true so that's why [lah] i'm thinking i don't know [ah] what should i do
i mean
it is it is a must for me to change the school to #tampines# cause it's better for her macam dia boleh rest after school cepat balik betul tak the #tampines# north is very near to my house
ya very very near
so kalau dia [dah] balik sekolah dia terus boleh balik you know it's very tiring you primary school primary four abang will be in secondary school so by the time i think he will be home by what four four p_m also now they all have extra extra activities after school right
(mm) (mm) (mm) so i really hope this p_s_l_e is really stressing me up also stressing abang up abang doesn't look stressed but i look stressed he was like saying chill [lah] mak i can do it
i hope so
ya he's very independent
ya so i hope
will be better [lah] you know
for for him this p_s_l_e coming
ya (mmhmm)
ya and our going to bedtime working in the morning tomorrow
okay
spinning
(uh) okay
okay
so
so i ask you a question
okay so nabilah how was your day
nice ya talking about it right
i actually like lupa
nak
apa benda
i lupa nak reply her
like i totally forgot about it i was like
okay i'm going to reply her after i makan
then like after i makan i was like
resting
then i totally forgot that she texted
then i felt bad then i told my mum about it [lah] i was like
[oh] the d_p is still convinc~ trying to convince me to like (um) c_a for her
tapi like i don't want then i felt like
i was guilt tripped
ya
that's about it and i'm excited for the zoom meeting
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
so let me tell you how my day went
so semalam like
i told my mum and my kakak was like
we're going out at one p_m
tomorrow which is today
cause like
we wanted to go spotlight and then we want to go b_h_g
but then
at
okay i woke up at eight
to like clean like cause apa nama dia (err) yesterday i spent the whole day shifting
my almari from my room to my guest room
then i was doing it myself i had to take out all the buku-buku
semua
berat gila
and then like i was too tired so
i continued today
ya so i woke up at eight when i slept at two
and then i shifted all the i i i simpan the book balik
then i fell asleep
and then what happened to the one p_m keluar you know what time we keluar or not we went out like
freaking six p_m ya
so we only went into spotlight and i told you about the patterns that i wanted to beli right
busy you know cause okay
i went to spotlight sebab i want to find
kain
for the inside layer for my mask cause i want to jahit for my
family members [kan]
which tak habis-habis
ya so i was trying to find a breathable kain
then
(err)
but my another
main thing that i wanted to cari was the
dress patterns [lah] the one that i told you about that i wanted to
make
[kan]
so
the first thing i did was
like find the kain
and then i was like flabbergasted i don't know why
but i was like super
anxious and then and then i walk you know like the entire spotlight
and i forgot to take the the pattern
and (err) and then like (uh) i tried to find the pattern then like i i i went around like the entire
spotlight but i couldn't find it
turns out it was like dekat dalam
an almari
like a drawer
like in front of a
counter
and then i was like a~ am i allowed to like just pull this out
i didn't know cause no one was attendi~
no one was attending to me [ah] so i just like
so i just like did it myself
ya that's about it i will show you but it will make like
sounds
which is
not ideal ya
ya that's about it [lah]
ya
ya
as~ tadi tadi while while bathing i was
hello
that's call cheat
cik saya nak order
nak order suji boleh
ya
tapi usually like people sell suji that
small [kan]
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
as i was saying tadi
like while i was
bathing
i was trying to think macam like
(err) when is a good time for us to record [lah] cause macam
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes i stay up until like five and stuff like that [kan]
at five a_m masih very very very memekak
like the freaking
am i allowed to say that !huh! like the the motor and the and the cars are like
memekak gila
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
but i think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
crowded here and because that time masa masa we shot at kim punya place
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet [lah]
(mm)
tempat jin bertandang
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
yang we went to jewel [eh] i think
i haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
(mmhmm)
was it
i feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with #irfan# #zahidah#
like all my close friends i only like keluar with the for like
once every
twice a month or something
like satu bulan [eh] no dua bulan sekali kind of thing you know
or like tiga bulan sekali
!huh!
[oh] [ah]
like two to three months seka~
ya
by who
blanks
[ah] ya ya ya apa
give it a listen nanti lepas ni
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
yes
i think the korean industry is kind of like macam
like it's quite
apa nama dia macam mana nak cakap [eh]
like hats off to them [lah]
cause i watch like the it's okay to not be okay [kan]
like
there's a castle in the
t_v series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
and it's damn big it's like besar gila and
it looks very
real [lah] macam
you know some some sets you know that it's a set [kan]
like you can know that
i i i haven't watched so i wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and i think
it's really
(err)
it's really
[oh] my god (uh) i cannot (uh) my brain is like fried it's really impressive [lah]
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big [lah] in the industry so
it's not really surprising i guess
that's why i like
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
i've never
heard of him though what's his name
i shall look him up
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts [lah] [hor]
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
[eh] buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
(mmhmm)
ya ya
makes sense food
oka~
[ah] !aiya! okay
so you know the one of the specs that i
pakai yang the one that i told you about hari tu that it karat
so the reason why it's
four hundred okay so ac~ it's four hundred plus for two specs [kan] sebab it's like one for one
and then
(um) when i was buying it i was like thinking kenapa dia punya
kenapa orang nak kena ada promotion for specs one for one like who would buy
one for one specs [lah] like at at that point of time i was like thinking
[oh] it's a good deal cause like macam
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free [lah] for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so (um)
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
(err)
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was heate~ a heated argument [eh] discussion between me and my
mum and my kakak [ah]
like we were like
patutlah dia jual one for one
sebab dia punya specs tak guna
like
then i was like lepas tu dia cakap [eh] cause like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
i don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that [lah] but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
your degree naik or something right
i don't know
is it just tak masuk akal to me
and
it all
like
ya
macam
i'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures [pe] ya like
who one for one
but i think like owndays
(err)
if you see [ah] the people who who buy glasses from owndays [kan] they also keep on changing their glasses
then my kakak cause my kakak was telling me [ah] that (um) celebrities who
share that dia orang beli their glasses from owndays like they keep on macam promoting owndays that means like
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it depen~ i don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
you can try off the shelves kind of thing and i guess that's why macam a lot of
glasses (um) spectacle shops are following s~ following it [lah]
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
i think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that [kan] usually [ah] specs
specs shop is dekat dalam the display then you have to like engage the
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
is on display everything at macam the racks then you just take and tak payah
tak payah apa nama dia
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
like the the shop that i went to dia
dia dia dia dia i sound like i'm singing [oh] my god
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try [lah] so that they can sanitise [kan]
and then
while waiting for them to fix my kakak punya glasses
i was looking at like other customers [ah] and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then i was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
i don't know [ah]
i feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when i see people going out in like
more than five
like berani gila
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also [ah] the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
don't really show they don't really report the exact number is because macam
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
they have to let the migrant workers work sebab of the number of attempted suicide cases are rising
ya
then i'm like
i mean i guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also [lor] i i mean
i wouldn't know but i suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
(mm)
ya
[oh] my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
[oh] ya talking about it
ya
talking about apa nama dia (um)
wanting to become a journalist right
i was exactly like you [sia] i was like in sec
two or three i think like
during my parents' divorce
i was like [oh] my god i want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
fight for women's right and all that stuff and then i masuk c_n_n then i was like what is all these two faced people
like writing
i feel like writing and radio is very two faced macam
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it [lah] ya
ya i mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but i think
like that whole thing
macam that
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype [kan]
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing [lah] like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
but then you only do a little like sikit
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like !huh! why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but i don't know about other parts of the world i guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
but like playing with stocks are like macam gambling [ah]
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
naik or turun
so you're like
i trust the economy
i'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
my nenek sheryl was sharing with me [ah] that like
i should do that when i work i should buy shares and like stuff like that
but i'm like
isn't that gambling
(mm)
ya
i guess it depends
on the individual [lah]
and their self control i guess
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and i think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
!huh!
i mean
hopefully we won't be penalised [lah] cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly i haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into [lah] to like read and then
i feel like i haven't been reading much i have been on tiktok
for the entire break
so my mind is literally macam peanut
it's this small like ya
i can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
ac~
ya
i feel like
and the
like i like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
macam there's there's there's there's a lot of like useful content and some merepek content
but i feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting [lah] cause like
they keep on
giving you
different (um)
different tiktoks everyday [kan] macam like it like within
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
nanti it will refresh like and then like you will get like a whole new set of like other stuff
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
and stuff like that and and like to reach out (err) to a bigger audience but macam
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why i haven't i haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
like i masuk also to tengok what people
no i masuk to tengok like people send me
stuff and then i'll be there for like half an hour and then that's all like i i can only like i used to be able to macam
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and i'm done
like it's get~ i mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing [lah]
like i keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
i showed you about the tinder algorithm
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(uh huh)
maybe that's why you've been seeing #jufri#
no
it's either it's either he's so attractive
or like
i have no idea
(mmhmm)
ya
also cause i go post
followed all your friends
ya
it's like if he if he cannot like get you he will try for your friends kind of thing you know
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
it's so weird
and when guys do that is like tak ada perempuan lain ke
like as in macam
like to me right it's like tak tahu malu ke like you already like cling onto like someone
like a family member and like people know you
and then you start to like
try everyone else macam
dude
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[oh] my god
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
i guess it's his kink or something
like indonesian girls
macam like common ya
ya
maybe they have like
an idea of like what
they are macam
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
!ee! i hate guys like that
(uh huh) like
[ah]
(mmhmm)
!ee!
suruh dia kahwin chef [ah]
and and the thing is
each like
apa nama dia
there's a lot of like male chefs as compared to female chefs so kalau dia nak kahwin kahwinlah dengan
ya
i mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
[ah]
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
(mmhmm)
like even if they don't have
even if they don't have like long term macam five years or ten years if it's if that's too long for them i feel macam
they should have at least like a one year plan kalau tak macam
what you menganggur
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys i
met before is those like
[oh] i don't know what to do with my life i will think about it [oh] serahkan pada like #allah# and that kind of things then i'm like
where's your usaha man like you can't just like sit down and expect things to fall down in front of you like you have to work for it
habis nanti like if if you say that
if you tegur them about it right nanti dia orang macam
[oh] or because you are too educated for me and all that kind of stuff like [oh] you're too ya i don't deserve you you don't
i don't deserve you kind of thing then i'm like
like stop putting your insecurities on me like
i shouldn't be like responsible for that [lah] ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
about himself
no [lah] i'm pretty sure you will find someone [lah]
maybe maybe not a #muzmatch# cause like i get it it's so hard to find
it's so hard to find guys who are like who are decent on the app like ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god
ya
but that's that's so shallow though
okay i say i say that that's shallow right but i'm guilty of that also
like but but mine is in terms of height
like
did i tell you
did i tell you
the first time apa [ah]
when i when i moved to telegram [kan]
[ah] he asked me [lah] [oh] what's your height
then i was like one six three you
and then
he was like i'm one six one
then me
who was like cause like his his profile he put there macam
his height in feet i forgot how much is it [ah]
then i then i calculated
i was like [oh] he is one eight one that's tall then i was like (oo) i'm going to talk to him sebab dia tinggi and then like i can finally wear heels if i date him
and then when he said he was one six one right i was like [oh]
okay smiley face and then
and then he was like i'm joking
then i was like [ah]
and then i whenever now like
now now whenever like we go out like sometimes we will talk about it then i was like i can't believe you lied to me about it then he was like
if if i was really one six one what what would you do then i was like
i i i don't know
i mean i will still talk to you but then like i will feel betrayed because you you lied about your height
ya it's so funny
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya i know how it feels
legit
ya
maybe like
other girls
ya other girls did it
ya
[oh] my god it's it's a technique i use to like make myself look smaller
but mine isn't bottom up because bottom up will make me look like super tall
so it's just like
like atas sikit
macam like a higher angle you know
habis macam ternaik sikit
is like that so i look slim
ya
[oh] my god remember what happened where we were trying to take your
c_v photo

ya

!wah! #hazirah# [seh
how have you been dah lama tak jumpa
ya it's been so long since i heard from you and [ah] [ah] i'm doing just fin
and yes aku currently poly year two right now and i find that it's so stressful coping with work and al
i feel like dying and i'm juggling a lot of assignments [seh] penat gila
right time management is like the main key of of everything and !wah! how do you cope with everything though boleh ajar aku some tip tak so i can be better like you since you already cope with poly for like wha
three years and graduate already no
ya aku lupa kau biomedical school it's more to science based as far as it's different compared to me and y
mine is like no exam or whatever just project after project and my course currently taking is visual communication but look at you now working full tim
and i think that if you can tahan i also can tahan with everything i gues
so since you the graduate righ
i'm curious what full time job you currently doing no
!wah! circuit period circuit breaker period also you need to datang kerja balik [eh
that's so shag you know since this pandemic like what ever since march or something it's like affecting everything well we at home watching t_v and just feeling like me myself but what to do right adult life and that's how you gonna face through out an
i didn't know you still interested to sambung sekolah which uni kau plan nak pergi you're talking about university right my sister also (um) currently taking part time in s_u_s_s in early childhood or something part time for like three months just to get a certificat
i think you can follow up like that too i gues
right degree lik
no matter what you take for example for diploma or something people will just look at higher certificate nowaday
and [oh] it sounds interesting though and i wish this covid thing is over so it'll be much more easier for u
an
i think you can cope [lah] knowing you for so lon
and time management is the main key like i said before and you know this pandemic i'm having online class and my eyes degree keep increasin
aku tengok [ah] kena buat specs baru ke tak since my nephew already broke mine which i just made for one month only and it's already broke i'm so sa
s
ya rindu keluar dengan kawan-kawan semua
and what's new right holiday we just sit at home no
can'
it's lesser things that we can do also now this covid it's corrupting everythin
(mm) why not we go karaoke or something and talking about karaoke i kinda miss how we all use to g
like back in secondary school but if you want to go out also limit also five people so it's kind of hard [lah] cannot bring everyone with us well i'm currentl
in my semester break for like a mont
and coming back school on the october eighteen or something nak pergi staycation tak since covid period have a lot of promotion vouchers et ceter
so murah sikit for us to staycation for like what two days one night typical and i really i feel like i really need a staycation since like overwork and shit and stuf
same goes to yourself i guess and sucks [lah] like i can't find anyone to go with me everyone is busy and all sedih [seh
ya i know you working full time so it's kind of hard for you to take off or something and ya aku dengar-dengar there's plenty of hote
for example (um) maybe we can do like it's a a three star hote
i'm hearing from my friend working at one of this hotel aku dengar the lyf #funan# hotel not that bad though a lot of my friends recommended me to go ther
you want to check the place out plus it looks like those kind o
korea hotel if i'm not wrong with double decker bed [lah] but don't have pool so i don't kno
maybe we can find something that affordable an
more fun chillax place lik
#shangri-la# #sentosa# ke apa
!wah! really that sounds nice since you've been to lyf hotel before so you roughly know how it's gonna be like but right you're right if we never get a hotel wh~ which come with a pool can just chill watc
netflix order makanan or somethin
like around town are
(hmm) but righ
i think we can just search mor
so that we know and plan out early where to go and suc
and yes i like water activit
and if i'm not wrong i think you got send me before the link like like there's kayaking swimming and all those fine things maybe why not we give it a go since like what seventy five dollar for vacation if not interested we can jus
apa ni (um
go staycation just chill at the hotel [jer] and since i'm single and you've got a boyfriend i just nee
a girlfriend to teman with me and layan my nonsense oka
(err) my friend say it's not bad though it'
it's like a #bali# vibe someho
where you can just chil
without anyone disturbing yo
and ya most of the food is not halal but if you don't care so just makan [lor
well you better like make time for me and plan this properly plus we deserve this staycation tak sabar nak jumpa kau semua [ah] it's been forever and you know just plan beforehand before everyone get busy agai
right it's been like rainy season also can't really do much even kalau nak tengok wayang sudah lagipun (um
there's plenty of movies to watch for example mulan or something an
ya besides staycation we can like what cafe hopping there's plenty of cafe in #haji# lane that we can try for example this apa ni
(um) new restaurant near marina bay and this #taufik batisah
apa ni hipster where they sell chicken and waffl
and many more that time i went (um
(um) cafe hopping with one of our old friend with #hidayu# if you can remember her we wanted to try the #taufik-batisah# cafe but end up it's like too many peopl
so we end up at this one random restaurant which call aline's cafe like a malay restaurant or somethin
no choice what some more i'm so lazy to walk around so we end up there the food macam tak sedap sangat they serve like what past
and the waiting time also like a bit slow so it gets cold by then i didn't really like tak sedap [seh] i had to go somewhere else makan you kno
but you know me i'm not a walking person s
i just end up at random place instead you remember about #ayu# righ
y
it's really shady honestly like it's only like the two of us in that caf
aku aku tengok tengok pun macam
why so #ulu# like tak ada orang masuk i would say only the two of us no wonder cause the makanan not that nic
what to do you know me i'm like lazy walker every~ everywhere i go i just grab or something i hate taking public for some reason cause i hate crowd
and ya [oh] ya the mind cafe i heard about it mo~ most of my friends been there before like kau boleh main game board [lah] apa [lah] but entah tak macam
crowded ke tempat macam gitu but takkan kita dua [jer] [kan] pergi sana
might as well bring the bring everyone is like so awkward only two of us are playing board board games
ya i'm close with her since i know her like what since childhood or something kau [kan] forever awkward in fron
people tak habis-habis awkward later you just froze there like nothing to say and just diam [jer
and ya maybe one day we can bring bring her along with us or just stay the two of us [jer
and y
anywa
i want to say that (um) since you in a relationship you just have to listen to your partne
right don't really have the freedom to do whatever you wan
but i don't kno
how is it like to b
attached by someone and knowing you right i didn't expect you to be the first one to get attache
cause i don't know back in secondary school kau those like nerd type of girl who don't really talk to to people that muc
then end up then end up [sia] [lah] perempuan ni ada matair [sia
i don't know how you do it like so low key i'm so curious like how you know what i mean i'm everything i need to post like social media so it's hard for me to deal with tha
ya i guess it's just not you i guess i don't know but it's true [lah] what you say like you don't really have to show everything online so like people macam apa [sia] ni perempuan buat kind of thin
(um) but it's nice to know that you actually grown up and you know like !wow! the new #hazirah# take over the worl
but it's nice [lah] lik
i'm glad that we still talking until today and boys aside okay the important thing that is me and you need to have a staycation so you better tell me i still got like a few weeks left before i'm bac
to school and i'm gonna be sad so book me early before i be busy due to work and aku pun and my own business as you may know my life is bus
same goes to yourself too and ya anyways you know my current job which is delifrance has been toxic so like two days ago i actually went to this interview wit
#diyanah# #musfirah# an ustazah [lah] basically like a islamic teache

then he booked this restaurant [lah] like he never tell me like what restaurant like he book like around five thirty p_m then like okay since we got the time only three right why not we just jalan-jalan around raffles or sunte
then he have no idea he tell me [oh] you want to go to museum i was like which museum lik
then we walk walk then we came across this museum i forget the name and it's free then we just go [lah
it's a bit boring [lah] just claypot and everything macam those #ulu# kind o
museum somehow tak ada orang [sia] aku tengok macam very kosong and all but ya we end up going ther
to waste time and (um) after that we walk walk walk (um
you know we actually walk from raffles to marina and all that's a two round aku pusing aku penat [sia] but i had a good time i mean getting to know someone new an
ya we talk and such then w
i was so malu you know i'm you know i'm always like that shy person who cannot eat properly in front of guys then ya we went to this restaurant end up the restaurant he took me is noosh restaurant i never been there before it's the first tim
then aku macam !wah! tempat ni high clas
i don't mind [lah] but ya i feel bad he paying for everything that day but (um) and ya we ended u
going there and i had pasta he also had pasta and we just talk talk tal
and ya we had a great time [lah] like no issues about him for him oka
plus can you believe or not he never go out with someone for six freaking years it's that long i i was like no you could have been lying to me [seh] enam tahun kau betul tak betul
then like ya he never go out with someone for six years and he got a lot a lot of ex [lah] like like sixteen ex girlfriend that was during i mean he is twenty six what do you expect righ
but stil
i don't know what to feel about him though but i don't know that time aku duduk dengan dia kat you know marina bay sand got good scenery so we just talk about life and (um) i forget what he say [lah] he tell i i told hi
(mm) what if i just wanna be friends with you then dia kata [oh] i don't know then aku kata i mean we just know each other so so i not putting any hopes [lah] i don't know his mindset was like (um) if you want to be friends with me (um) doesn't mean we have to talk everyday and suc
i mean correct [lah] i i also never text you everyda
but i didn't know he expecting more than as friends [lah] i mean he is twenty six what do you expect obviously he want to be more than friends [what] bu
i'm not putting any hopes or whatever [lah] i mean he is a good guy only you know me i'm very pick
so y
right sixteen banyak [sia] aku pun macam terkejut when he say that i'm like !wow
and the last ex was like six years ago and he told me [lah] his life is a bit special because dia perempuan baik punya [seh] because i don't know [lah] he say perempuan baik like he never do anything to her for six year
then it's hard for me to believe that [lah] takkan tak buat apa-apa [kan] bu
you know what i mean and ya then after that he tak apa ni
tak go with another one and he told me that he menyesal tak sambung sekolah because he stop at apa ni
i_t_e [jer] he's from he from apa ni nitec [lah] then you know the first batch of nitec at i_t_e_c_c or something then after that he go n_s then he wanted to apply for higher nitec [lah] but during that tim
higher nitec only full time [pe] so he can't cope with that dengan kerja sekali so he never take and now he working as a s_m_r_
i mean it's good that he already got a full time job but he planning to change [lah] because management pun teruk and he looking for like another engineering like macam aerospace or something since he from ther
and he also got some work experience to go with s
i just wish the best for him [lah] i mean ya you're right he is really a good guy like why not i give him a chance right i don't know i'm just scared to go meet [lah] you know my recent ex macam mana s
i don't know what to do maybe give me a bit more time because my life also sekarang messy so i don't want to put another person in into that like carry a lot of burde
y
[kan] it's hard to believe that he actually got sixteen ex girlfriend i mean he is twenty six so four years older than me (hmm) and ya you're right i got a lot to see first i mean i'm twenty two and i'm still schoolin
at the same time working but schooling is the main key you need to get the freaking diploma to get a good job but kalau ada rezeki
if i got the brain and not the #malasness# i will continue uni [lah] tengok macam mana cause my dad dream is to have their one of his child to go university but see how [lah
if tuhan apa mampu ni pergi uni [kan] but i don't know empat tahun boy but then aku dah umur berapa [sia] but you're right waiting for the right one to come maybe one day
kalau ada jodoh so y
ya age is just a number actually i mea
no matter how old you are if you got the willingness strength to study why not give it a tr
lagipun ada orang like on the thirtieth they took master and al
i mea
it's just the semangat that you have [lah] kalau nak sambung balik belajar and the minat kalau tak ada minat nak buat apa [kan] what's the point nak belajar nanti last minute #paitao
[ha] but right [lah] i mean happy for your friend to get married some more covid pun save a lot of money [seh] tak buat besar-besar !wah! really thoug
even though tak seberapa grand bu
asalkan kahwin [eh] but y
kau pun nak sekolah pun [kan] hopefully kau dapat [lah] [eh] sekolah apa ni s_u_s_s since my kakak ambil tiga bulan [jer] just to get the certificate why not part time ambil [jer] [lah
for the sake of the cert [kan] what to do go [jer] they say i think part time not as rabak
i mean i feel that part time is not that rabak [lah] just need to have time management and the #semangatness# for i
kau just persevere [lor] i'm actually hungry kau tahu [lah] aku badan kecil but makan banyak
[ah] i don't know i keep on eating [seh] today but ya just gave it a go [lah] no matter where you can be i can imagine #hazirah# working at the laboratory macam hit a victory of somethin
!wah! confirm !fuh! y
confirm like !wow! factor [lah] [siol] hazard head laboratory [seh
but who knows who knows what the future will head some more you still young and this working experience that you currently have also it's basicall
apa ni experience [jer] and you can use thi
thing to apa ni put at your resume so people know you actually work at this company and such so macam senang nak dapat kerja in the futur

belum the result only coming out (err) bulan depan there yeah
yeah my siblings say i'm a bum a home bum so i'm like okay tu pun jadi [lah]
yup
ya
(mm) if it keeps failing then what's the point of trying !hais!
yeah
what thing
okay yeah
no
yeah i mean some of the requirements also i don't meet [lah] macam what ada [kan] diploma [lah] atau experience [lah] then i'm like i don't have any
and this one part-time [seh] not even full-time yet
yeah then this timing also not a lot of people hiring
!huh!
no not a lot of places like hiring like proper part-timer they are looking for like those contract full-timers
(uh) i'm like it require three months aku tiga bulan [dah] start sekolah ape kalau gitu
!hais!
(mm)
(uh)
[oh] yeah yeah i saw
[eh] i play with me i will download it and then boleh main sama-sama
i don't i i (err) boleh boleh tanya orang lain
[oh] (err) ada [lah] or
yeah
yeah i think they will be on if they're free
yeah
(mm)
(uh) that's true
(uh)
ya because they tengok a lot of tiktok and then like there's this gamer she played with a group of friends so funny i like i want to try nak cuba
[oh] yeah yeah
[oh] yeah that's right
[ah]
[oh] my god it's like okay so i watched his tiktok of the like they play among us right he's so funny this intruder you know what's david he he swipe the knife right then after that got someone coming into the area that he killed a person then you know what he did he just press press press dia punya butang after that he hide the body behind him
then the guy just continue walking
yeah like cause i was like that's genius
i mean if
yeah they said if the other person actually went up to him confirm get caught already then i was like !wah! very lucky
[oh]
(uh) yeah yeah
(oo)
i think it's more interesting than mafia game [lor]
(uh)
[oh] yeah that's (err)
(mm) betul !wah! i miss playing night games with people
yeah
yeah that's why they say what ruins friendships small uno atau among us then i'm like
it's always so funny
yeah
(ugh) same
nope
bukan tak boleh tak suka ada beza
(err) all meat but i can still eat daging lembu yes
yeah because daging lembu selalu macam they have this smell
yeah yeah and then tak boleh tahan it's really bad for me especially like when my parents cook right then i always make a big fuss right i hate the smell
(mm)
i mean tak boleh predict [pe] so
then he will be like what !huh! who are you
yeah especially since (err) nanti the fish will macam bau ja hanyir so people don't like fish when they're pregnant usually also yeah
i mean (err)
i mean (err) i mean if you want to eat fish when you're pregnant is more unlikely
[oh] my gosh
(uh) yeah yeah
(oo)
[eh]
nak but then
bila nak pergi what's the plan
(oo)
twenty eight agak near [lah] kena check again
(mm) okay
okay yeah my poly friends also dia orang selalu nak jumpa habis tu macam tak ada benda lain nak buat ke they all already start uni
tak sekolah lain-lain [seh]
(err) i think different different courses (hmm)
entah [lah] dia orang nak jumpa makan [lah] nak jumpa belajar then i'm like kau semua belajar benda lain-lain abeh nak belajar sama-sama
yeah then macam guys move on
that's why then i macam !aiya! whatever [lah] it's up to them then next week [ah] minggu depan ada orang nak jumpa then they were like [oh] kita tunggu untuk carea to like give when she fr~ free to meet then i'm like
yeah then [eh] i just open the chat habis tu i [kan] i just say (mm) (err) you guys go ahead i'm not free
i mean yeah but like i don't have
yes
yeah
then the makanan they all want to eat also selalu dia orang nak minta makanan i tak boleh makan
then i go they change the plan then i feel bad [what] then it's like (uh) just go ahead [lah] without me
yeah
(um) yeah then but it's like i don't know if i mean your group of circle then you naturally gravitate to food that i cannot eat i think that is very alarming to me
yeah cause dengan our secondary school friends kita tak ada macam masalah macam gitu [pe] selalu it's very easy for us to settle food [what]
yeah then is don't know [lah] is that time like i think after school we all wanted to hang out then they were like [oh] let's eat umisushi then okay aku tak boleh makan
then they were like never mind [lah] you just sit here first then after that we go somewhere else that you can eat then i like
yeah it's like [oh] let's go out and eat together but then in the end you never show something that we can eat together right habis tu buat apa nak kata kita makan sama-sama
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
same is like they
yeah i understand it's it's like when you meet dengan dia orang it's supposed to be enjoyable but when you meet them then at the end of the thing you're just like penat [seh] why did i go out i regret going out of the house
[oh] my god yeah
exactly [oh] my god (ugh)
but how [seh] that time i topped up twenty dollar then i think i only went out like four or five times only then finishing then i'm like !huh!
(err)
yeah
that's like
(mm)
(mm)
i think so like that like that's what i remember
i mean
boleh experiment then you see mana satu lagi murah
then it depends on your station also [lah]
(mm)
(uh) yeah #aigoo# [dah] [lah] tak ada kerja habis tu bus fare pun mahal !hais!
[oh] i was so con~ confused by it i i didn't do the survey dia punya yeah
i think it's a very how to say [ah] first world problem i feel
(mmhmm)
right yeah
(mm) yeah
that's true
i
yeah i mean it's very different perspective of problems [lah] like for us our problem is that we cannot get on the bus but for other people it's a different kind of problem like before we had the wheelchair accessible punya bus how do wheelchair people like get on the bus
exactly then that's why i think it's considered a million dollar like idea i guess to have those wheelchair friendly buses
then i'm (mm)
no no you can
cause even for like macam orang yang tak boleh nampak like visual disability they have new apps macam the what's that they say like you can take a photo or something with the handicapped phone then they help you read out the text or something like that
which is
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah
(mm) that's true
that's why it's like if they didn't have a guide dog how do you tell if they are someone with disability
(mm)
cause even for my school cause #ngee-an# [kan] ada that dialogue in the dark so we have the what's the term called the sight disability pun i there was this period of time i had like macam a_m class right then every time if i reach school dekat this certain timing i will see that makcik that cannot see then i will help her but she will need help to cross the bridge
yeah it's not like they cannot survive without help it's more of like
yeah
yeah it's sad [lah] because they if you were to compare our levels of convenience with them is very different
(mm)
yeah but i know their other senses will be heightened [lah] like if you cannot see maybe your hearing and your smell are stronger but it's not easy
yeah so i was like (hmm) i wish i was smart
yeah
yeah
forest fighting
oh forest no tak dengar [eh]
bagus
!wah! was the forest fire macam bad
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
[oh] my gosh why apa gunanya gender reveal seriously
yeah
it's like why why must have fire
there's no other word for it
(mm)
[oh] my god can you imagine me
my parents thought i was a boy then when they give birth it was a girl yeah they really thought i was going to be in a boy it was so funny
like
[oh] that one i never ask so yeah
okay maybe i should ask is !wah!
it's !wah! ya
so funny
it's like
it's like a sike [eh] like [oh] it's a boy [oh] no it's a girl sike
i think gender reveal parties are very i don't know it's so over the top
it's over the top yeah
it's macam
pakai banyak sangat duit habis tu tak it doesn't add any meaning to anyone's life honestly it's just
yeah it's
i guess maybe we have different values like untuk kita if you have a child is more of like between yeah it's a blessing it's between your family you and your husband
i don't need to tell my friend who's a friend of this friend that i have a baby who's a boy and it might not be even accurate so
yeah i'm like (um)
[ah] yeah
(mm)
yeah yeah
(mm)
(mm)
eighty
is that like your commission or like your pay
[ah] yeah yeah
(err)
i mean you can't do anything if no one comes in
(uh) yeah
(mmhmm)
(uh)
[oh] my gosh
then
then then it's like should i be sad that there's no customers or should i be glad that there's no customers
(mm)
very easy money
(hmm)
i mean that's considered one of a good like working days i guess
(uh) yeah
that's true
[oh]
[oh]
!oof!
(uh)
!wah! [ah] speaking of kelly and her mum the cake that she (mm) baked untuk your birthday !wah! i still think of it sometimes
right i'm still amazed that she did it [eh]
you are the one who made it
like
(uh)
i mean
(mm) understand
[ah]
(mmhmm)
yeah yeah yeah
yeah cause i mean i think the cake macam dry because [dah] simpan satu hari [pe] [dah] potong then you give it to them the next day but !wah! the whipped cream i was so amazed cause selalu whipped cream [kan] diorang buat cake is either macam banyak sangat then too sweet or like the whipping cream macam how to say ya macam berminyak is that the word like
yeah then is like you're like (uh) what is this [ah] then you scrape the frosting off
yeah
yeah that's true
that's why when we were bringing the cake in it's like !wah! kelly the cake is so pretty
yeah
yeah don't cause you messaged me habis tu you messaged dengan orang lain [kan] and we were like (err) dia tak [kan] beli cake [kan] like (err) (err) (err)
that's why when you asked me kalau nak cake then i like i like cake but kalau aku bilang aku nak cake nanti kau beli macam mana
(uh)
yeah
no she panic cause yang when you were working together yang ada satu hari ni then after that kita send message then you pakai dia punya handphone [kan] then dia [eh] guys #nisha# pakai aku punya handphone then we were like [oh] did she see the chat
yeah when you guys were working
!aiya! [lah] but it was just you know in case
then
yeah then we ni we panic right then kita tukar dia punya group name it was supposed to be like what about thirty first then we changed to orientation twenty twenty
right
yeah right i felt smart
that's why
and then i was like (err) what's kelly's (um) faculty
and that's how we were discussing what to get for you
yeah
you know the round card right okay sorry side track but you know b_t_s released (err) !wah! you know this whole week i think everyday right i think four days in a week right it released new merchandise then that one i don't care never mind
then they released like (err) new like product live for their documentary like their staycation documentary then the
yeah [eh] i can pinjam you my account to watch
cause yeah cause this one kena bayar
it's it's super hilarious macam you you boleh nampak their innocence as normal people and not like it's so funny
(err) sekarang [dah] ada empat if you want to include macam behind the scenes ada lapan in total
ya it's the weverse the the the the new fan cafe that one
yeah yeah it's so funny [ah] (ugh)
no no i was talking about the merchandise yeah right the cawan was okay this time round the merchandise quite cute yeah they got cawan i was like
is is like your cup nya design is like rounded at the bottom and then the colour is green
in the soop
merchandise you can just google
yeah i think they're trying to bring in money [lah]
a lot you know they are re-releasing the you know skool luv affair album the repackaged version
right i was like [oh] okay no no no no no i don't need
don't tell me i don't have the money to do that this month
right it's (ugh) and it's not very like macam merchandise is you
yeah
yeah that's why
!wah! you know the only time yang diorang letak diorang punya muka right the i think is the u_s merchandise i was like nampak macam dua ribu tiga belas
i mean if you have the self-confidence and the self-esteem to wear it out go ahead girl or guy or whatever
(mm)
yeah they picked a very pretty shade of green then i was like genius
(mm)
!wah! yeah
b_t twenty one is like the success is you can't even compare [leh]
it's
even people who are not their fans right see it and like [oh] is cute buys
[oh] i didn't know that okay
(mm) i see so many youtube videos of people like they are not b_t_s fans but their room is covered in r_j punya bantal [lah] dia punya soft toy then i like
yes an~ and it fits the aesthetic
(mm)
[oh] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the the #chibi# the tiny #tan# [oh] my god [oh] i wanted to get their things and then after that aku nampak dia punya harga dengan dia punya shipping fee then i'm like
sudah
(ugh)
(ugh) don't even get me started on shipping (ugh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
!oof!
dia punya shipping macam boleh beli tiga dia punya product [tau] i was like (ugh)
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
if
yeah that's why when i renew my b_t_s membership right the membership kit is like twenty s_g_d then after that i checked out right dia punya shipping the whole price went up to seventy then i like
yeah [lah] what's the point if i never buy the membership kit if i signed up
so i was like the thing i do for you guys
(mm)
what thing
[oh] no no no that one change already cause that one is diorang punya old style
you want to level up untuk dapat lebih banyak benda you must do the quiz and fill up the test
tak dia this one is more like accessible i guess but it's also scary cause people who are not their fans can easily buy and get in
tapi bodoh [lah] just tak you spend like ape thirty dollars just to kacau orang on the website
that's why it's like you the thirty dollar you don't want to use for other things
right !wah! the thirty dollar i think i can buy my whole new outfit that i've been looking at [leh]
well nak beli this macam sweater it's a knitted sweater [lah] then i also looking at this skirt
yeah shopee [lah] what where else can i buy i am not that rich
yeah (err) i think the skirt dalam dua belas dollar gitu
yea yeah
yeah then the sh~
tak it's just i want to save up the money first
(uh) yeah
because the shipping is only macam dalam dua tiga dollar gitu aje not much
yeah
!aiya!
okay can i will share to you
that's why and i feel bad for using fast fashion but is what i can afford so yeah
yeah cause macam it's not really like ethical i don't think is ethical like sourcing it's probably like those cheap cheap warehouse punya factory [lah] so yeah
(mm)
yeah
yeah
yeah
(mm)
yeah
okay
(err) i think
dah boleh off
it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say [ah]
how's your day
it's been like i started i pergi pasar tadi pagi after that
okay so was what happened okay i'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
okay so tadi [kan]
so tadi tadi
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday [kan] she tex~ i told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it i'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
#cheng-san# go and message me cakap
[oh] miss not happy i'm like okay so miss not happy then i told her already [what] what's happening
yesterday right
then #cheng-san# was like [oh] i think she wants to like
convince everybody i'm like ya i know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
it's quite annoy~ it's quite annoying [ah] pasal macam
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three p_ds
and #ming-gee# that's six people okay
and she's like [oh] some of them say they are open to it
(um) and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say [oh] they confirm don't want that three weeks i'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group [lah] if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya i'm just like
annoyed
but
i told her it's whatever [ah] kau boleh buat whatever you want to do [ah] kau punya pasal [ah] so
ever since then like okay i'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
i mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it [oh] so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her [lah] and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and i find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes i get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else [ah] like
kau punya pasal [lah] you know
you got your own issues then
(ugh) okay whatever
so i just like did it bye
good luck
ya but i mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a h_d_b right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do some~ thing
sub for school
where your ma~ malam
my mother is here ketawa
she won't stop
i'm just going to submit this time [ah]
then now she go
[oh] suji [eh] i ask [ah] dah tanya [eh]
i'll tell my mum you don't sell the suji first until
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
but then it's like this big and i'm like are you sure you want to sell suji that small
for like
a lot and then she's like i don't know
it's so funny [ah]
ya betul
[oh] she wants like the square one which i think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but i told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
[eh]
do not off
(mm)
honestly an issue in h_d_bs [ah] kau tengok [ah] dah pukul satu pagi
unfair i think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
i guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim #boon-lay# [kan]
man it's just generally quiet [lah] also
i don't know [ah] cause that time [lor] malam
the only night shoot i did
i can remember well was #syaza's# #syaza's# shoot
but #syaza's# shoot jingle was there
#serangoon# but the landed houses
i forgot that cats are like nocturnal
i swear
!ow!
but ya i'm quite nervous about thesis
i did like i moved my to dos
to this new app called notion !wow!
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and i've been using it for awhile
tapi i haven't really like used it fully because circuit breaker
then i moved it all on notion
and now i'm like a bit overwhelmed when i see my list
[ah] i don't know [lah] it's like i know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but i cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and i don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering i'm already struggling with one (uh huh)
it is supposed to be simpler
i got nothing to say [ah]
bila kita jewel [ah]
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday [lah] in school so ya
[ah] ya
once every twice a month
apa kau cakap
keluar ji~
okay [lah] itu enam kali [ah]
tu enam kali apa
dua bulan sekali
okay [lah]
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's i actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
i don't know it's very groovy
lepas ni so sekarang tak boleh okay
[eh] but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that i like b_t_s songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and i cannot figure i like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and i can remember like the words
not all also [lah] cause dia orang cakap macam terbelit-belit also still
so tak faham pun but
apa
i feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
kasih dengar the autotune
and i'm like
(mm) i don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like dyna~ scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
(err) my nub~ i think the only like studio that can fit that is neapolis atau infinite [eh] studios i don't know
but it was quite cool [lah]
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job k pop
like the hotel #del-luna#
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy i think like ten years ago he he's from i_t_e right
(mm)
this malay boy and he graduated i_t_e and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
and he went to korea without like any money or anything so macam
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many k pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
and he tak even go for like classes to belajar you know he just like
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya i think it's quite cool [lah]
i don't know
i cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead i'm like !huh!
maybe i should do that !duh! i will never do that
my social anxiety will be like [ho]
ya
but
it was an option [ah]
if we go korea but i don't think we will be able to handle dia orang punya
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
cause your your your heated my my i start first [eh] one for one [eh]
i don't know i always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
if you ikut macam the business like module
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent [kan] to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so i usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
ya the food punya
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya i usually don't buy one for one and i can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
i always buy things like notebooks for one for one
itu [jer]
okay you i know it's heated
depends i guess
just appalling ya
!huh!
are you sure are you sure
but on~ only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
macam you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
that was the deal that they had
but i don't know they have a good reputation [kan] a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
ambil and try
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like [oh] you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then i don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now i know they closed down the
tak bagi like anybody just masuk tahu so you have to like
queue to masuk
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty [ah]
i have nothing to say about that [ah]
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility [kan]
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are respon~ you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not [kan]
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
sakit everything they keep saying they keep separating
migrant workers and community cases like as if
satu is one species another one is another species
like it's the same thing both is humans
if there's fifteen migrant worker yang kena
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
they are exposed to tak akan migrant workers [jer] [kan]
obviously with everybody [what] with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
everyday macam add one two people like in the community cases [kan]
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
!aiya! it's so
shady
but we know that [lah]
but
but just what like
(mm) but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like i remember going to c_n_n thinking like !wah! i'm going to be a journalist
you know i'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
macam some kind of investigative like journalist gitu
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad [lah] like
we ha~ we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
and then we all will mati together
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
(mm) just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere !aiya! it's just
i don't know macam as we grow older i guess
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
what the world is then we get macam
[oh] okay this is how i'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
aku lagi penat daripada kau you know i did more things than you yesterday and i'm like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
i just want to say i'm tired okay cause that's how i feel i don't want you to feel
insecure for the way i'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like [oh] i'm more tired than you
so i'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
i don't know why but ya
i don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
i agree i was people
but that's not true
ya pasal [lah] penat
i don't know [lah]
it's similar i think
it's human nature
that's true
i started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
cause i don't know if i can do this anymore film penat [sia]
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them i met i'm like i don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what i mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
(mm)
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because i mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
there's this macam
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what i mean
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which mazhab you're looking at also
pasal if you're talking about
like kita punya mazhab memang we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
but we have no i~ firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so i'm going to keep my options open
there's other mazhab that's like
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
!yay! we love grey areas
!aiya! and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
like this idea of mazhab is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
you know
that's like my question because the mazhab thing came about because of
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
macam concerns [lah]
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
then is the mazhab thing going to change or what
because this is
islamic law [kan] but it's not like
a set in stone thing cause the mazhab thing was never like set in stone
until the scholars were like (hmm)
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like (hmm) we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
i don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
people there might adopt our mazhab punya practices
she will be adopting other mazhab practices and when she comes back here
then it's like (hmm) you know
culture changes also so it's like (ugh)
just
like i don't know i always thought about that i'm like
it's still going to change like
i think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change [ah] but
i'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end o~ like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
just about sembah this one tuhan
and believing in our prophets our rukun iman and rukun islam
and not
whether
touching a dog is haram so ya that's like my
thoughts of this so deep
macam over
moved a circle
really [ah] shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but i love tiktok
[eh] i spend a lot of my day talking (err) like watching tiktok
i don't know if you can tell
sometimes (err) sometimes i never notice then [oh] marina is like can you stop then i'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent i'm like no i just go
ya i forced her
i told her i wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am i supposed to send it to you i don't want to download everything i said that then she's like i'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like i got it
i made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
to be fair kasihan [ah] dia dia macam
sec one lepas tu kena covid terus tak ada friends you know she don't have proper friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
[oh] all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then i'm like it's the same with you [what] all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them [lah] and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move i said that
then she's like i will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
(mm)
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the tik~ the tinder algorithm
i didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
!wah! i don't know man
are you saying me and #juri#~ #jufri# have the same face
attractiveness level
!eww!
do i look like that
so i already quit
so so in a few weeks because i've been super busy
and i got no time to even look anymore and i feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and i'm like (err) so i just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app [kan] i i
at first i put my name
[kan] like my whole name i'm #nabilah#
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary i was like
this boy
just like me
and then i haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private [lah] and then got nothing
also cause i don't post but
it was just scary i was like !whoa! people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then i'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
!ee! that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
(ugh)
(oo) i have that family member
you know that family member i don't know if i told you about him but he got married already [lah] to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
this is like there is a goal punya cerita after that
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
and she had this other boyfriend and the boyfriend she was together for like five years tahu
so that's like
it's very long right i cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable [lah] because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
habis
the whole family was like [oh] dia dia minum arak dia pergi
apa dia makan drugs semua that kind of thing you know and then when we met him i was like he was crying
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch i'm like
[ah] you tak tak ada choice lain ke apa like
!ee! sh~ and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly [lah] actually he's worse than #jufri#
ya
i think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
you know i macam
like
are you okay
you know and then
(uh) but his
he's weird [lah]
i don't know i've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then i'm like i didn't know he was family
cause i see him like twice a year like
it's just funny [lah] ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that i knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child [lah]
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
that lady was cantik [lah] and she was with us for three years
but it was like damn disgusting
like kau tak ada perempuan lain ke apa that you want to go for this maid who doesn't want you back
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like !eww! like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and i'm like
i know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
!eww! no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the [ah] the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
i'm like kau dah tua stop it [lah]
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
[oh] my god
like
i thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
tak tahu asian pun boleh suka asian asian girls
it is funny [ah]
(mm)
i think he
he's crazy [ah]
[oh] my god that's that's like the fir~ the kind of guys that i will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
that kind of guys will be like [oh] nanti kita dah kahwin boleh masakkan i [lah]
masakkan i like some sambal goreng or something like that then i'm like !huh!
you think i kahwin ni mesti nak masak sambal goreng
kau kelakar ke apa you know
it's damn stupid
ya
i don't know
(mm)
it should swing that way
but i like male ch~ male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs i talk to are like
i will cook for you then i'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like i will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then i'm like [oh]
that's a good change
but i don't know
ya
[oh] my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like i i i [ah] ya
it's like i get it [lah] okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but i think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like [oh] i just
do like part time and
nothing much then i'm like [oh]
nice i don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
(mm)
banyak menganggur
like i'm sorry
i'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
i got to where i am
like i'm not saying you never worked hard but i worked for what i am and you know (ugh)
now now sometimes also i'm like
i don't know i find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if i really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which i obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
the i'll be like [oh] [ah] [lah] i degree tapi film [jer] film [jer] you know that kind of thing
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
(mm) (uh) you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
!aiya! and you feel shit~ shitty about yourself i don't know i hate people
maybe i should just die alone
good for you good for everyone i don't know
uneasy
kau thanks man
that is just not my style
!aiya! my worst match just for ego boost [lah] lately only when i sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about p_m_s specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which i kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
i don't look like that in real life (mm)
it's quite funny [ah]
there was a guy who asked what wa~ what was my weight
then i'm like i don't know if i should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how i look
and he's very curious because i didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell [lah] then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then i was like if i tell you
what are you going to do
if i tell you i'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
(err)
i don't know i think i will still talk to you [oh] you think
then he he left me after i said i was sixty
if you know i'm not sixty obviously
[ah] that's quite funny
i mean
(mm)
actually i'm the same [lah]
but i short lady [ah] so good for me
(mm)
i'd feel iffy about it [lah] but i i'll still talk you
you know i'm like i'm [eh] i'm short right
i'm let's be honest i'm short so i i always thought that
so the guy that i will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time i actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and i used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause i was like i don't believe him he looks damn small that's what i said
and he was small and
and i bet he was like !huh!
and i couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay i'm not thin you know
i'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and i'm just like okay
you know i almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then i i just like he was like nevermind i will pay i guess
and then
he look at me he look i look at him then he like
okay i'll i'll pay like half i'm like okay i mean i thought you're going to pay for your own ticket [lah] bitch
cause i think you should be paying for the ticket
i didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so !aduh! it's quite funny
i didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
i have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height
ya
he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
i was like
this is like a technique i will use i guess in the future
!aiya!
i lazy [ah]
ya
higher angle [eh]
is it i don't know
i don't have people to take for me like nice photos and i i cannot like pose also
so i feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when i never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
i'm not
insecure
[oh]
that's my only photo that i use for c_v until today because i don't have other photos
it's so sad (ugh)
ya
i have so many selfies
and then you can tell like the first like five selfies is like me like really want to perasan
after at the end it's like
like that
it's like it's like cheating myself like okay this how you usually look like
it's quite stupid [lah]
okay [lah] at least i rent a smart eight one [lah]
but he's damn tall [sial]
he's damn tall to me [lah]
you talk about him i'm like [oh]
[ah]
ya
kau gan~ [sial]
she you should ask him to like hold
sarah just texted me
then i'm like
ask him to ask him to hook up a camera and like take a picture of his view
it's okay [lah] he sees you like that [what] and he still like you so
that's all right right (hmm)
you you you know it's it's legit
i don't know i never checked she's like sorry it's a bad timing i know i think it's about me
i'm like !aiya!

before that aku kerja dekat utilities board</p1> [lah] (uh) it was ya you you know [ah]
[ah] bill air [lah] bill air
okay
so ya so that was my first job [lah] ever since aku o_r_d i i've i've been working there (err) untuk enam tahun [ah] so (err) so (err)
i was in the i was doing (err) project management in their construction line [lah]
[ah]
yes
ya i i applied for (err) i i was quite lucky sebab
(uh) aku apply kerja tu and (uh)
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response [lah]
and the
[ah] ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times [lah] so
[ah] apa ni [ah] aku kerja sana for enam tahun
then (err)
at at that time pun
(err) when i started
when i just got the job like six months into the job
then (err) i also i also same like like like you [lah] also thinking what should i do what's my career path because honestly speaking pun at that time bila aku apply itu kerja pun
aku aku ma~
it was just a job for me
dia bukan [ah]
(uh) it's just a job for me to pay the bills [lah]
and [ah] just to
to to to earn to earn money [lah]
i rather than kau dah o_r_d abeh duduk rumah tak buat apa-apa [kan] so (err) so might as well
i just took took up the job [lah] so (err) when i took up the job i aku got a lot of free time and aku pun look around aku tengok kawan-kawan aku aku punya n_s friends
most of them they further their studies
so aku pun fikir i think i should also do that tapi i also i also made a mistake
like aku like follow the aku follow the
(err) apa ni
like in a way follow the trend bukan ikut hati bukan ikut hati sendiri [ah]
[ah]
so or everyone's a~ anytime at aku was like saying to myself [oh] everyone's furthering their studies so i should also take up a further my studies [ah] i didn't i i didn't really (err)
dig dig dig dig about it
i was like okay [ah] just go go go ahead with it
a degree then i i asked myself like okay what degree should i take at that time aku aku pun tak sure [lah] nak nak
nak ambil degree apa then aku cakap dengan diri aku okay since aku working in this line
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree (uh) which
is related to my work [lah] so (err) maybe (err) (err) few years down the road (err)
i apa my boss
i have good relation with my boss then they they they see an opportunity in me then is (err) kirakan (err) is one way for me to progress [lah]
down my career path [lah] in in my in my company at that time
so i i took up my
ya go ahead
[oh] okay (err) i was from poly i i went to singapore poly i took up (uh) civil engineering ya [ah]
(err)
it it it
(err)
it's related [lah] but
(uh) not i i my my scope
of work was not really into the (err) engineering aspect [ah] it's more to the project management side
[ah] so as to be honest pun apa my diploma pun anytime time masuk poly pun
it was just like [ah]
i just take up this course [ah] it wasn't (err) (err) it wasn't it wasn't like [oh] aku passionate about this course (err) aku nak nak jadi engineer no [ah] in it was nothing like that [lah]
ya
so (err) at at that time [ah] after o_r_d pun
pun ya you you should you feel lost [lah] macam apa kau nak buat dengan hidup aku [eh]
[ah] apa ni [ah]
so [ah]
ya i i can't relate i can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now [lah]
so apa ni at that time pun macam lepas o_r_d pun abeh macam
even before o_r_d during my poly i went for my (err) internship
so it was during my internship that that made me (err) think twice to to join the construction industry
pasal
(err) it was
in a way i would say more of
a bad experience what i went through
(err) for my internship [ah] macam
internship aku yang really opened up my eyes yang [eh] !siala! rabak [ah] industry
[ah]
the working hours the nature of the work (uh) the work environment
(err) (err) ya
(err) pasal okay
(err)
aku don't mind [lah] telling apa telling you the story tapi if if you don't mind listening if you if you are a person who is not bored to listening to stories aku don't mind just
just sharing my my my experiences [lah]
okay okay (mm)
so (err) apa ni for my internship
ya they attach me to a local construction company
(err) so
ya i mean i think it's it's the same for all industries [lah] or you can see a big difference between a local company and (err) (err) foreign or multinational company [lah]
i (err) in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that [lah] so i was attached to a local construction company [lah]
so the first day i reported to work (err) like aku masuk dia punya office the office is a cont~
(uh) its a container office [lah] because it's a construction site apa but this [ah] this construction site okay [lah] [ah] wasn't like those like ulu ulu punya tempat [ah]

weeks tak tak silap aku ada lagi satu engineer bar~ engineer bar~ [ah] engineer baru masuk engineer dia engineer baru ni masuk dia sekali pandang kau aku memang tahu [lah] dia ni engineer dia pun dari india juga [ah]
pasal the the the funny thing is
bila dia dia
masuk site office [eh] dia duduk kat tempat yang aku duduk yang aku tidur tu
so kir~ he literally
he literally
took up my my my place [ah] kirakan dia macam ibarat ganti aku [ah]
so aku
at first bila dia dia datang like
the first few days dia masuk aku tak berbual dengan dia sangat [ah] pasal aku tak tahu dia engineer as in aku tahu dia engineer he was part of the company is an
employee of the company tapi aku didn't know his background so hari-hari [ah]
[ah] so hari-hari aku datang office aku tengok dia pun dia pun macam aku time baru masuk dia datang office duduk office pun duduk
lepak tak buat apa-apa tak ada orang layan dia dia pun tak buat apa-apa
so aku pun aku tanya dia [ah] i [ah] pasal
[ah] kita attachment semua kita nak kena (err) put up a report apa kita punya own individual report
so aku
[ah] aku pun need someone to to to give me some input [ah] like all these technical technical details apa kita buat apa benda yang bangla bangla
dia orang yang tengah bikin apa benda yang dia orang tengah bikin so i need someone to explain to me [ah] so aku tahu dia ni engineer he's part of the company tapi dia pun tak ada kerja dia pun macam aku
aku tanya dia [lah] aku just take the opportunity [ah] aku tanya excuse me are you an engineer
ya ya i am [ah]
dia cakap dengan aku
ya (err)
i'm i'm the i'm engineer but not for this project my upcoming project haven't start yet
so that explains a lot [lah] kenapa dia dia macam aku duduk lepak aje tak sebab dia punya project belum start lagi so that's why the the company
i asked him to to come over to this project first sambil tunggu the his project start [lah]
so aku
dengar gitu aku like okay [ah] aku punya mind macam terus ada light bulb [ah] okay bagus [ah] aku boleh boleh pak~ apa
[ah] minta tolong dia untuk aku punya report [ah] individual report [ah]
terus aku aku korek [ah] help me tell me what is this explain to me what is that gini semua abeh dia dia bilang [ah]
abeh after that day onwards pun
(err) dia dengan aku sekaki [ah] (err) (err) dia pun selalu come let's go let's go out jalan-jalan (err) pergi keluar jalan-jalan pun ni [ah] jadi orang tak tak
tak tengok kita tak buat apa-apa [ah] [ah]
kadang-kadang cari kadang-kadang keluar pun cari tempat untuk tidur
[ah] so ya
asal tak tidur dekat sana ada got some certain days certain days we kita ada tidur kat kat [ah] kat tempat situ kadang-kadang pasal we did an upgrad~ upgrading project in a j_c apa
kadang-kadang pun kita [ah] apa jalan-jalan dalam sekolah dia kita tidur dalam classroom that was during the holidays [lah] so the school was empty [ah]
the only
(err) the higher up
kirakan (err) the
dekat site [eh]
yang paling tinggi is only the project manager [lah] and project manager that time aku punya project manager perempuan so [ah] she also
(err) wasn't the the macam mana nak cakap [eh] [ah]
there there are some ladies who are macam rude [ah] dia orang dia orang can do both the office work and the site work tapi yang that time aku punya internship my project manager she was more of the office type [lah]
so dia duduk office aje [ah] kalau higher ups ni semua [ah] dia orang jarang datang site
at most pun dia orang datang [ah] apa once (err)
once a month [ah] just for the meeting [ah] just for the progress meeting (mm)
dia orang pun tak akan dia orang pun tak akan macam (err)
ya probably they want kalau dia orang pergi site pun nak tengok progress you won't go into
macam dalam-dalam [ah] dia orang setakat jalan dekat tepi tengok [oh] okay ini dah siap ini dah bangun ini dah bikin dia orang tak akan masuk like literally masuk
[ah] ya ya
so ya then (err) that that was it [lah]
aku so the good thing the the engineer came aku minta dia tolong so like
aku pun help to update my my weekly report
okay [lah] aku
(uh) one good thing pun aku pun like have to be smart also [lah] macam aku pun tahu office orang semua
cakap aku aku datang pun tak buat apa-apa [kan] so bila bila this engineer [dah] datang aku dah dapat dia tolong (uh) aku punya report
so bila-bila aku nak kena bikin report aku buat dalam office [ah] i mean that's the only place also yang aku boleh buat apa
that's like like that's that's the only setting yang kau boleh buat kerja apa
so ada juga [lah] engine~ there's there's where other engineer pun start to notice [ah] !wah! dia ni ada juga [ah] bikin ni bikin ni buat ni semua pasal like a few weeks later ada lagi satu budak
attachment masuk

the malaysian chinese enigineers pun dia orang pun cakap dia ni
apa dia ni tak boleh [ah] dia ni buat hal sendiri
(err) in in his own world [lah]
apa so so that's that's the thing [ah]
(err) (err)
that was my experience [lah] for my for my attachment so it was from that experience yang aku tengok
[eh] !siala! rabak apa aku tengok the working environment macam it's so stressful aku tengok the the engineer yang dari india tu kiwak muka dah macam zombie
[ah] ya office hours [ah]
tapi un~ un~ untuk aku ya aku was just a student apa so aku just report to work like the usual like eight thirty to six something like that [lah] aku macam mana pun
pukul enam aku #chao# [ah] pasal they they don't really have have anything much for me apa tapi like those engineers like
dia orang after six pun dia orang still
stay back at work [sia]
(err) ya so abeh aku tengok like the work environment macam
semua orang buat hal sendiri macam not much interaction
like ya it's true (err) aku can understand they don't take me seriously and aku pun wasn't expecting them to take me seriously [ah] aku kau cakap gini pun aku teringat ada satu kali tu it was the first tak silap aku the first day [ah] the first day
aku report to to to aku apa attachment
so [kan] aku bilang kau apa ni (err)
everyone was so busy pasal they have a meeting so after that (err) they all left for the meeting
aku aku seorang aje [ah] dalam office
aku seorang dalam office sekali alih-alih ada satu orang masuk dalam office
dia pun tengok aku dia tengok aku (err) tak
tak kenal aku [pe] macam dia ni siapa [siol] abeh tanya [oh] who are you aku cakap attachment student [oh] attachment student abeh dia tanya aku (err) singaporean [ah] ya singaporean
dia dia dengar singaporean terus dia straight talk direct direct punya [siol]
you singaporean why you take this course singaporean where wan~ where want to work in construction [one] work under the hot sun work under the hot sun ini semua gedebak gedebuk kiwak aku dengar terus down [siol] serious aku dengar terus down
tapi [ah] [ah] tapi ya [lah] apa that was
i was still young [ah] you you you didn't really understand it [lah] tapi bila dah lama kau dah ini kau dah kerja kau dah in the industry [eh]
then
only then you understand
what he meant [ah] which is true [ah] which is true [ah] [ah] ya ya
so apa ya so
after the experience aku was like !siala! gini rabak [pe] (err)
this industry like this is the work environment that i'm gonna be in
so (err) (err) bil~ lepas bila aku o_r_d tu tu yang aku pun make me
(err)
fikir [ah] i like aku betul like [sial] [ah] betul ke nak kerja (err) construction industry rabak gini
tapi at that at that at that time pun macam abeh kalau aku tak nak kerja construction industry pun aku nak kerja apa [sia]
abeh aku fikir-fikir abeh aku dah belajar ambil diploma ni pun dah dah dah tiga tahun takkan nak
(err) wasted [kan]
okay [lah] cakap dengan diri
aku even though aku
aku still don't know what to do with my life since aku already have this diploma which already (err) took up three years of my life okay [lah] i just just might as well take up a job
(err) in this industry just just to just to have a job [ah] just to have a job and just help out help out the
(uh) pay the bills have part of the family ya which i which i did [lah] then
aku ya aku applied for
which i applied [ah] ni i applied the stat boards l_t_a public utilities board ni semua so okay [lah] #alhamdulillah# (err) within one or two weeks they get back to me and aku got the job quite quite fast [ah]
(um) ya apa time aku
(err)
this thing
ya bila aku dapat kerja p_u_b pun like
there were also doubt in my mind [lah]
pasal like (err) when i join the company
then they because it's a big company apa so they have this apa induction course [ah]
for all the new stuff so okay go for the induction course get to meet all the new staff of course you all the staff are all are of different ages [ah] it's not it's it's no longer
it's no longer your your your age age age group [ah] so you meet all kinds of people [lah] abeh abeh jumpa abang-abang ni semua apa
[oh] engkau umur berapa
(err) that time was like what
early twenties [lah] [kan] early twenties
[ah] ya ya around your age [ah] [oh] muda lagi ni kau punya ni kau punya [ah] first kerja aku cakap [a'ah]
[oh] apa kau patut
(err) muda-muda patut kerja luar dulu kerja private apa rasa dia punya susah payah dulu (err) kau dah kau dah tahu dia punya susah payah baru kau masuk
baru kau masuk (err)
government state board ni semua you know [lah] because they see government iron rice bowl which is true [lah] definitely i i won't i won't a dispute that [ah]
and (uh) so when they when they say that aku pun like [eh]
!alamak! aku pun did i make the right move ke tak [eh] (err) (err) like
you were saying [ah] kau
budak baru
a fresh fresh graduate baru baru baru baru graduate ini semua kau patut
(err) kirakan start from the bottom [ah] start from scratch
then you literally work your way up [ah]
but at that point
bila aku happy kerja
aku
didn't didn't thought had that in mind [lah]
and aku pun so it it gave me like
(err) doubts [lah] aku pun like
did i make the right move ke tak [eh]
tapi i mean
apa it doesn't really matter also [lah]
ya so
just went along [lah] abeh macam
kau
aku pun fikir balik like
(err) ya what he say really (err) apa like
(err)
[ah] like
[ah] tak bedek [ah] but
and it also [ah]
was stuck in my mind for for a few weeks [ah] abeh aku pun fikir balik macam [sial] [ah] aku baru dapat ni kerja abeh takkan aku nak takkan aku nak resign [oh] just
because aku nak nak nak listen to that guy [kan]
(uh) apa (uh)
i mean apa you
you just made do with what you have [ah] you just make do with what you have memang betul
apa the the at that at that time a~ my my nature of work
you need to have some technical knowledge [lah] which i was lacking [ah]
(err) with the engineering the engin~ in terms of engineering aspect
i was lacking [ah]
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad [ah]
i~ i~ like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas [lah]
so
[ah]
[oh] okay
(mm) ya ya
so ya (err)
(err) apa
it didn't turn out quite that bad also pasal
apa
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
[ah] consultants usually they provide the technical (err) aspect [ah]
so (err) when when when whenever you
macam you're not sure from a technical point of view you ca~ i can always refer to the consultants [ah] so
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya i mean you just make do with what you
abeh (err) from
from aku punya nature of work pun project management pun what what i
what i
what was more on the soft skills
pasal
back then pun aku wasn't really a
a a apa ni i'm
i am a very quiet guy [lah] aku not those person go around talk talk to people i mean i still am
but
[ah] when the work requires me to i can now i can i can do it [lah]
[ah]
so so ya you aku aku
improve on my soft skills and then dekat (err) during my course of work pun there like what i told you [ah] who decided to further my studies take up
a a
a degree [lah] then i took up a degree in building and project management
i took up a part-time degree
(err) previously was unisim now they call it s_u_s_s [ah]
ya so
then you decided not to
okay [ah]
good for you [lah] good for you i mean
[ah] ya so
i took up
(err) my part-time degree
like i told you before [lah] apa aku time ambil degree pun was like
[oh] everyones
doing a degree i should also do a degree tapi
at that time ya like
(uh) aku was just following the trend [ah] tapi now now aku fikir balik i shouldn't have do that [lah] i mean ya i you should still take up a degree but then
really take up a degree in what really interest you [ah]
and (uh) what you really wa~ want to do [ah] pasal that time
(mm) (mm)
ya
apa (err)
since you say it like that pada aku in my opinion it also depends on the industry you are in [ah] so you are in the what in the arts industry media industry
arts industry ya okay (um) which i agree [lah] which a degree is not really [ah] apa a need [ah]
in the industry because your industry (uh)
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
tapi untuk aku
when aku did my degree (uh)
(err) aku did my degree while while working [kan] abeh as years go by [eh]
aku kat kerja aku like
aku tengok aku punya sama [ah] like
work environment pun
(uh) with the the the
bosses like
aku tell myself [sial] [ah] aku aku aku don't see myself
doing this long term
like [ah] so like
aku tengok aku punya bosses [eh] like
macam e~ (err)
dia orang ada takde pun macam beza [sia]
like they are just like pasal okay
(uh) we are a big
organisation [kan] like ya we have a apa like (uh)
c_e_o tapi stat board they call it c_e [lah]
c_e and then they got their directors [lah] and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy [ah]
when kau pun s_c_d_f pun you should know [ah] [kan] hierarchy [ah] it's like
literally like fucking lot of hierarchy you know like abeh macam
kau kat bawah [eh] macam
kau nak kena dengar kata dia ni abeh dia ni kadang-kadang tak
tak boleh buat decision abeh kau nak kena
(err) lepas kau nak kau nak lepas kau nak kena
go through dia kau nak kena go through orang atas dia
abeh orang atas dia pun kadang-kadang nak kena tunggu decision orang atas dia lagi
i mean kadang-kadang politik macam orang atas yang paling atas tak suka
orang bawah abeh dia orang bertekak abeh kau kat bawah
like apa [sia] ni like
kau orang (err) kau orang cannot make a decision abeh aku nak kena buat apa [siol]
like sometimes the conflict like
bertahun-tahun lepas punya [sia]
you like even even before even before you join the the organisation or like [eh] !siala! kau orang dari dulu [eh] abeh sampai sekarang
more like pada aku it's not healthy [ah] abeh abeh macam aku like kat situ [eh] aku kerja situ like !siala! macam aku kalau stay sini aku tak nak [sia] end up macam kau orang ya i mean like some of them they stay they stay because of the money like ya it's true [ah] aku
dispute it [lah] apa (err) government really iron rice bowl [lah] as in like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally [ah] living a comfortable life [ah]
but aku just don't see myself doing that long term [ah]
it was
in my last year of my degree then i decided to
to
to to change line [ah] aku decided to go into aku wanted to do media so
(err) after my apa ni (err) my degree ended
aku graduated
aku took out a course dekat mediacorp
under t_v production [ah]
under it's under w_s_q [ah]
at first aku didn't know about it also like as in i i do bef~
[ah] apa sebelum aku enroll under mediacorp
ya i i did some i did some research [ah] o~ of courses of media courses [ah] apa that's where aku like macam aku menyesal [lah] !siala! like instead of me doing this degree in project management i should have like straightaway
took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
i mean because
as you grow older time ka~ kau akan rasa time is like you you will feel the time pressure [lah]
like you are running out of time [ah] so
it's good [lah] it's good [lah] (uh) so aku was like (err) apa !siala! aku tahu dulu aku
we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
and then apa that was
this school [ah] aku dah aku dah lupa [ah] nama sekolah dia s_d_a ke something like that it was it is it closed down already [ah]
[ah] something like that [ah] aku pun dah lupa [ah]
then apa ni so aku just still (err)
to go ahead with it aku look up ada ada aku aku just look up on google [lah] of of [ah] media courses [ah] abeh aku fikir balik [ah] macam
aku baru habis aku punya part-time degree aku did my part-time degree for five years
we are are we
aku dah like that five years [eh] aku pun like like like macam in a way like macam drag myself to to finish it [ah]
abeh (err)
lepas tu aku sekarang nak go into media industry kalau aku nak ambil degree aku nak kena
pick up another three years of study
aku was like !siala! five years of study dah dah macam dah cukup [ah] like [ah] enough of studying [ah] [sia] [ah] enough of studying [ah] i mean
[ah] abeh
aku fikir-fikir balik takkan aku nak take up another de~ degree
another three years of degree for media abeh aku just look out aku tengok mediacorp offer offer
this is w_s_q but it's a diploma [ah] it's just a one year course okay [lah] one year aku cakap dengan dia okay [lah] masih boleh take it [lah] one year okay [lah] so i i i i grabbed it [ah]
then (err) aku pun
at that time was
was so was want to
transition into the media industry [kan] so aku like thought of (err) maybe (err) take a gap year first [ah] before aku joined the media industry
so (uh) apa aku
was planning to take my gap year which was this year aku (uh) already plan to go to new zealand
[ah] there's this
(err)
it's called a [ah]
a working holiday if you heard of it [ah] basically i basically it's it's a holiday tapi [ah]
kau boleh you can apply for a job there
but [ah] but it's not it's not like those or full-time jobs [lah] it's like a temporary jobs like maybe like six month contract jobs ataupun part-time jobs are those kind of jobs [ah] ya [ah] so
and then the new zealand (err) working holiday is is a visa [lah] basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
(err) the visa is for six months
so (err) apa ni (err)
(err)
kalau there's an option for you to extend another three months provided you work in their horticulture industry
pasal [ah] their country they have a demand for the industry and they need they need workers are in the industry kirakan dia orang pun ibarat macam singapore singapore we need demand for the construction industry
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
(uh) is that horticulture industry [lah]
so they they make use of this (err) apa ni (err) backpackers foreigners to come to to to (err) holiday
and (err) at the same time these people need money to continue their holiday apa so they make use of this people to work in the horticulture industry [ah] so aku
aku dah plan [ah] aku dah book aku apa flight semua aku dah aku dah (err) dah dapat dah visa aku dah apa ni (err) aku dah apply deferment pun untuk aku punya
reservist [dah] approve
semua dah settle semua dah #swee# tinggal nak
nak ni je nak naik flight [jer]
ya i mean it's it's it's predictable [lah] apa aku punya kerja pula aku nak kena bagi one month notice so (err) apa [ah]
aku decided to like literally [ah] resign (err) one month before aku punya flight [ah] aku tak nak resign too early pasal aku pun need the money [lah]
the more money i have can save up the more money
i have over there apa
so aku pun decided to like just (err) retire one month before my flight
so this early this year when covid everything happen [eh] like
a~ aku was seriously like the the suspense [eh] was like !wow! like only
only god knows what i was feeling [ah] at that time like
apa (err)
when the news all broke out [oh] apa covid
ni semua apa [ah]
[oh] singapore at at first
[ah] [ah] at first
at first macam the whole the whole world were were singing praises for singapore [oh] singapore have their best system they have the best ini itu ini semua gedebak gedebuk tapi aku dalam hati macam okay [lah] aku harap that like
(err) maybe (err) new zealand they dia orang like closed one eye on singapore because
kononnya singapore have a very good system in controlling the the virus they will still allow (err) (err) visitors to come over [lah]
sekali but unfortunately that
did not happen [ah] aku punya
[ah] apa
the new zealand government they
announce they close the borders
[ah] three weeks before my flight [ah] so at that time when they announced that aku dah already tender my notice aku dah resign pun
[ah] abeh like fuck man at that time like !siala! macam damn when when when that news came out [eh] aku rasa macam like like rasa macam bodoh [ah] like [ah]
not really cheated macam
ya ya ya (err) abeh macam
betul [lah] i mean
it's not my fault tapi like i really felt stupid at that time [ah] macam damn like like aku like aku pun dah bilang (err) aku punya boss semua like aku didn't like literally at my workplace inform all my colleagues [oh] i'm going new zealand ni semua like macam macam excitingly like break the news to them [ah]
aku like just keep it to myself [lah] tapi of course dengan aku punya boss aku nak kena bilang dia apa aku aku nak resign ni semua
abeh boss aku pun of course they they dia orang pun tanya aku kau betul ke nak resign apa [ah] the~
at that time pun pernah tanya aku if aku nak reconsider ke tak resignation aku aku cakap tak [ah] aku still want to go ahead
he respect my decision [ah] dia cakap okay [ah] this is your decision i fully respect your decision if you really want to go you just go ahead [lah] okay [lah] so when the news broke out that new zealand they close the borders aku like fuck man like !siala! [ah]
dah aku dah tender aku punya resignation abeh semua dah dah dah settle flights semua dah settle logistics semua settle
habis sekarang tak jadi [eh] aku dah then (err) the the other things that came into my mind ni [ah] sekarang macam mana takde kerja takde kerja abeh like

cause like she already misheard she thought thirty three hours a month then i was like that's a bit too little of hours to work to get an incentive then she recently come back to me and tell me bilang (err) #nisha# you need to work thirty three hours per week baru boleh earn ten dollar i'm like yeah that makes more sense [lah]
thirty three hours per week that one is like if you work lapan hours a day for empat hari right a week you can roughly get thirty three hours like eight like tha~ as long s one day you get nine hours [lah] you can get thirty three hours
yeah and somemore she haven't she's not a barista yet i think at that one point coffee bean nak hire temperature screener right cause like they they really lacking manpower for it then they hire temporary screener first then after that they learn to become barista [lah]
yeah dia sekarang she she's just a temperature screener jaga burung dekat outside [jer]
yeah but okay [lah] she like becoming one next week like she's taking the health basic health hygiene whatever thing
(mm) yeah then after that after that she can can make drinks then i can kacau her after that
but you kau nak start sekolah soon right
yea like november ya october [ah] tak ingat
november [oh] my god this week got like tick-tock september october you got like nearly two months man
but then the results [dah] keluar [eh] like your whether you can get into the school
[oh] very long [eh]
home bum because you got no work is it
it's not like you're not trying to find [what] you tried but a lot of jobs like
they never reply or they got different criteria than you expect
[kan]
then sometimes kau pun macam malas [lah] nak cari lagi
yeah normal [lah] i mean you also not very like apa orang cakap like (err) what is the word [ah] [oh] main main blank like tak cerewet like that [lah]
are you cerewet no right you just you apply for most jobs already but like criteria doesn't mean your expectation also right
(mm)
yeah they ask a lot of jobs they asking for like for like three years [eh] (err) like at least a year experience then i'm like i haven't even start a job then you want a year experience a bit too much [sia]
yeah
what to do
yeah
is it
is it i never check like jobs right now
(mm)
yeah that's why
what to do
you got play among us
you know there's this game called among us
there's so many videos about it now then i i mean i played before [lah] aku pernah main dengan kawan poly i was like i want play [seh] like like i just want to play
dua orang aja
you need you need you need minimum lima orang [eh]
can ask like
(mm) can ask our secondary school punya kawan
yeah
but like it looks so fun right but i cannot lie i can't i i cannot lie everytime i lie they like okay it's #nisha# it's #nisha# i'm like [oh] no okay yeah it's me it's me just just kill me already
(mm)
(mm)
it's very fun you know like there's this there's this girl i i must say my volley friend [lah] there's this she at first i thought she wasn't the intruder then dia datang she always follow me you know dia always next to me sebelah aku aje then she like suddenly swipe the knife around me and i'm like then in this game right the rule for us was that kita kenaok we were in a voice call and when we play we have to like mute our mics [lah]
then once someone dis~ [kan] dia have to like discover the body
yeah then dia report body aku then dia bilang !wah! i found #nisha's# body here here here then i'm like then if you dead you cannot talk in our game then i'm like [oh] my god this this this girl this then i just keep maki on the other side because they can't hear me right then i just keep maki her like !wah! this this girl [ah] she's lying so well [ah] and everyone was like so who's the killer who's the killer i'm like (ugh) it's her it's her she's she lied so well you know then i'm like (ugh) i hate i hate her i hate playing with her
(mm)
yeah
(mm)
(mm)
what
you can hide the body
!wah!
i didn't know you can hide the body !wah! i should i should try
(mm)
then got there's also another one where i'm the intruder with this other person the girl that lying very well i was the intruder with her then after after in~ (err) intruder can like like kacau dia punya system right like you can like disrupt their system then they had the members have to fix the two things [lah] so the system will go back up then so when everyone has to go to this location to fix it because you have to like press your hand dekat machine itu [lah]
then so many people there right i just kill someone then everyone was like who who would kill someone in front of broad daylight when everyone's here then i just keep quiet
yeah [lah] cause this one you can like ada van then you can like apa ada mission juga you can see everyone instead i would mafia game [kan] macam kau kena tunggu the time only
then it's quite it can get quite  macam bosan [lah]
same like when we when it was the birthday party for mine recently kalau kita semua main uno semua right it was it was quite fun [lah] honestly
both especially with the plus four plus two
stupid games [eh] ya
i'm hungry man i like cra~ [oh] you're craving for meat [ah] but you're not a meat person right kau tak boleh makan
is it all meat or is it just (err) beef
!wah!
i mean i know i know you can but you just prefer not to right
kenyal-kenyal ox man
bau dia
i i won't be surprised right if you [dah] kawin then kau beranak [kan] then you like beef suddenly
yeah but it'd be so random imagine your guy like knows that you don't you don't like beef then one day you just craving for beef
are yo~ kau serius ke
funny [lah] usually pregnancy [kan] macam unknown unknown cravings
(mm) (mm) (mm)
i thought i thought you said kalau the ikan is pregnant and people don't like and i'm like that doesn't make sense
i was trying to make sense of your sentence then i'm like (uh) (err) !huh!
yeah
[oh] my god i want i want i recently was talking to #yin-shen# about picnic then suddenly nak dia nak main layang [kan] because since that last year want play layang already
then i was like [oh] can we go picnic then then he said like okay kau nak join tak we go picnic but
what but what apa
like currently dia nye holiday bulan [eh] it's this month it's this month like on the twenty eighth of september if we pergi isnin
okay i think next week then we next week next next week next next week next next week then we can bincang
dia orang sel~ dia orang selalu dia orang uni course sama [eh]
no i'm saying like their course from poly to uni sama
(mmhmm)
they dia orang selalu nak jumpa buat ape
that is like no helping buddy like that right no buddy system
no [lah] i mean you can meet [lah] but if you wanna meet every week macam penat [kan] nak meet like you already tired from uni then they still wanna meet
(mm)
they're waiting for you
i mean they were they were nice enough to tunggu tunggu kau punya reply [lah]
but you also not interested then they like okay sorry guys next time
then
sometimes i also like that [lah] but but most of the time when they know then they will change but if they don't know then they don't change and then when they don't when they know you do't go then they stay to the original plan [lah]
(hmm)
is it i mean i guess i mean secondary school of course more easier to handle this food thing compared to poly punya kawan [lah] like i also got bad experiences with like kawan poly semua nak makan yang tak halal punya benda then i'm like okay you guys go ahead then they are like why you never follow then it's like no brainer [what] you guys nak makan yang tak halal then then kau invite aku buat apa [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
i hate it i aku tak aku tak suka [eh] paling benci aku when i hear that kind of phrase then i'm like yeah you you can't eat here then we buy side for you or something else no !wah! i i had a debate with that with chris for the longest time you know like can't say that it's just not nice you know if you want eat eat together if not don't eat it at all that kind of thing
yeah that's why it's like it's worse i mean would they like it when when i say that [oh] we eat this one later we we specifically find food for you like like you like left out you know that kind of feeling
i'm like !wah! paling benci [sia] aku dengar apa that that phrase
then then that's why that's why i keep like distancing from a certain group of people in poly
i mean i don't i mean i i okay with them but when it comes to certain hangouts right nak nak jumpa dua orang like that i like i don't wanna really meet them anymore
(mm)
(mm)
yeah it's like you waste your time and effort keluar rumah pakai lawa lawa then kena pakai bus nye card lagi bus transportation for adult fare is so much
yeah
[eh]
four five times as in like to and fro back or what
!wah!
[eh] kak aku tanya [eh] kalau naik bus [kan] straight okay let's say i want go to a to b then aku naik bus aja is it cheaper than changing from bus to m_r_t or what
then next week just take bus all the way later i like i don't really
yeah i'm your guinea pig now [ah]
yeah cause like kalau aku naik bus satu jam [eh] if i take m_r_t also ar~ around forty five fifty minutes [kan] it's around the same time tapi like which one will be cheaper
and then natalie idea did you read natalie's the that thing
i i did the survey but i didn't see the point of having one
i think
yeah but i feel like if if i was the person cause her her topic was what technology dengan benda lain [kan] i don't know [ah] singapore technology thing then i'm like okay i think i would cater more towards the disability
i think that will be more useful [lah] in my cause like they only have disability for what the one that we know so far is a wheelchair only
you never actually heard of other disability kind i think that will be more helpful if they research in that [lah]
tapi nak tunggu bus tengah crowded is a bit i don't want to pay extra money for this
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that's why they probaby don't get on the bus they probably take taxi [kan]
(um) i mean (hmm) continue you continue first continue first
no no you finish your sentence first [ah]
(mm)
(hmm) but the thing is you don't know if they're really disabled like usually the more the the ones that you can see is the one dengan anjing [kan]
then other than that a lot of people also cannot afford having that kind of help [what]
cause it is expensive to have a trained dog
(uh) (mm)
(um) especially nak naik nak naik shut~ ape transportation [kan] public transport
yeah the yeah
yeah (uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
yeah like i feel like we should cater our technology more towards the disabled [lah]
convenience right
nak senang [kan] diorang nya apa diri
(mm)
yeah cause they had lost one of their senses you know (err) not one maybe like some it's very sad [lah]
(mm)
yeah
yeah we're so used to having five senses susah nak compare dengan orang lain pun nak susah juga [lah] like we always kasihankan but we never do anything right
have you heard
i mean i i wish we are smart and got money to do this thing
have you heard of the of the of the forest fire in #california# is it #california# or ore~ #oregon# [ah]
forest fire not fighting fire api
so apparently recently or is it this week or last week [ah] the~ there is a forest fire kat #california# or #oregon# and it was caused by a gender reveal explosion
it is so stupid diorang tak pakai otak [eh] it's like during summer somemore you know then they do this kind of stupid things
it's still happening now it's i think it's for few days then diorang [kan] kita nampak langit [kan] biru lawa their langit is red [eh]
it's constant like even in this in the morning is red colour then like it's so bad this isn't the first time that happen this is the second time that happen cause of a gender reveal thing
exactly like okay [lah] you want do gender reveal party it's okay i think i think it's a cute idea to have a party like that but if you wanna make an explosion in the middle of like flammable things it's a bit no brainer [lah] that one
yeah then like can you the the the thing is right the family already have children
then they exposed them to this kind of this this kind of stupidity
yeah [lah]
yeah but imagine [leh] like it's so stupid you'd rather waste environment things over your damn child's gender what then sekarang pun macam you know i i like okay whatever people born to be [lah] that kind of thing they wanna be bi whatever i'm okay with it then like what what if the gender is not what their gender is supposed to be there's a lot of like debate on it
really
!wah! what if then they knew when they dia diora~ were they planning your name to be different
[oh] man you should ask cause i think it will damn funny
yeah confirm for that nine months right diorang macam ingat nak nak namakan untuk lelaki right then suddenly perempuan keluar then they on the spot have to think of a girl name [leh]
i didn't know
(hmm)
[oh] boy is a girl joke [lah]
rated
over the top maksu~ maksudnya apa
(mm)
yeah it's like so isn't it like betting like you betting is actually a betting it's like just a party kind of thing it's like a party idea
a blessing right
(hmm)
yeah yeah yeah
yeah man funny [lah]
know yesterday aku kerja [kan] sorry i keep changing topic then yesterday aku kerja thought it will be crowded [lah] cause thursday gonna be friday so i thought will be crowded can you guess how much i earned for yest~ i i work at f&b [lah] can you guess how much i earned for the whole shift
my own shift yeah

i only serve what two customer
yeah i thought okay [lah] at at first i thought airport will be crowded then when the last customer left around seven forty five i had to quickly like sweep and mop right cause sometimes overcrowded [kan] tak ada time nak sweep mop then you leave then you leave work late right
then i quickly sweep and mop until eighty fifty cause no one then i just wait and wait and wait until pukul sembilan [eh] then i'm like should i wash the air fryer now or should i wait cause sometime last minute also got grab then aku tunggu aje [lah] tunggu [kan] in the meantime i just make like takeaway waffle
[dah] tunggu sampai sembilan setengah tak da orang [eh] i was like okay i just close up everything [ah]
i was so i was like so zoned out yesterday cause it was so quiet i like i want a customer but i also don't really want a customer to come in

i mean like i have to clean the shop still but then like i just sit there do nothing [eh]
literally like zoned out [eh] it was very funny by myself in the shop

(um) basically kat dalam course ni i do macam coding dengan design it's a very
i~ it's a unique course i would say
a pasal like
coding dengan design macam tak banyak orang tahu buat so
ya and (err) this course is like it appeals to me [lah] because i also i really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and i
feel like it might help me in the future when i look out for jobs cause now macam (um) banyak benda is like about technology [kan] so ya i feel like this course (uh) actually benefit me [lah] in the future
(mm)
(oo) so
[oh] recent~ so recently i just (uh) finish my semester one so some of the courses i sorry i mean modules i picked was
i did was (uh) design and colour so i do like graphic designs and stuff and i also (uh) besides coding i also learn (uh) concept
ideation so macam kita belajar macam mana nak (uh) brainstorm ideas (uh) for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so (uh) for you [ah] you said you were in like (um) marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules yang kau enjoy
(oo) that's not bad
yeah that's poly life man like mo~ most of the time you are just like spending time with your friends doing project work
internship [eh]
[oh]
true
wha~ apa
[oh]
[oh]
!wah!
i can't i can't imagine myself in that situation macam nantiif if i were to be in that situation confirm i i would panic
so susah tak macam kerja like in a like a team
like during that that test
[oh] right
(mm)
[oh]

[oh] during my free time i suka
(uh) macam (uh) draw i also like to (err) tengok apa ni
[ah] anime ya that's my favourite but i haven't really been doing so because takde time [kan] poly dalam i'm in a design course so i don't really have much time to (uh) do my hobbies which is kind of (uh) macam sedih but yeah so
now that i'm having my semester break i can finally (uh) do (uh) my hobbies
yeah
yep
actually ada banyak plan but like the thing is that i just like i'm just i'm too scared to
go for the trials (err) because i (um) i'm actually afraid of rejection
but (um) i'll probably you know i just want to like build up confidence in myself first then (um) maybe in (uh) (um) year two then i will start macam join like start trying out for c_c_a [ah] i've actually picked
macam a few c_c_as is (err) firstly is [ah] floorball like (um) aku kata tadi [kan] as i've mentioned (uh) floorball and then second was silat
and then third is dikir barat ya but
i i'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which c_c_a i wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
ya it is it is that's why macam i'm like a bit takut to (um) you know join their team because (err) macam dorang nya expectations like a bit high you know so i'm i'm i'm afraid like tak boleh meet dorang nya expectations
yes i have like a few months to think about it so ya then (um) so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today wh~ wh~ what did you do today
!wah! how was it
but i think right i think confirm boleh pass punya confirm
yeah
[oh] for what
[oh] mesti sakit [eh]
apa tu
[oh]
(mm)
banyak
[ah]
yeah
(mm)
then the the surgery bila
[oh]
!wow!
ya man i can't imagine myself
!wah! all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then dia ka~ dia kata like
(um) it's actually not that painful [lah] because like you know they put you in (uh) on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you bangun so i don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so i think [ah] after if i think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you tak nak any macam side effects [kan] so ya
then
(uh) other than
then right you you said that you had your i mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so (uh) how

i can't imagine the macam dia nya sakit

tak [lah] i never say
no no no you you meant [ah] calligraphy is it
[oh] yeah yeah
ya ya ya so macam during my free time cause [ah]
apa ni i lo~ i love doing calligraphy right so i like macam i have i have like a mini business where
i (uh) buat calligraphy on orang punya macam notebooks and stuff then i sell it for like (um) quite a reasonable price [lah] so it's affordable to everyone and i also like playing with colours and
(uh) i like !aiya! basically like (um) doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why i decided to macam you know buat this business because
cause a lot of people [kan] you know singaporeans [kan] diorang suka macam study [kan] then banyak orang suka buat macam notebook diorang macam cantik cantik so yeah that's why i i thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that diorang ada macam motivation to belajar
yeah [eh]
[kan] sekarang covid [kan] so like (uh) kat dalam rumah what do you do
(mmhmm)
ih
(oo)
!wah! !wah! tell me more
ya ya is good because like you know now covid like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so i think this online business thing is also macam a good way [lah] for orang to you know macam get that extra cash
then like after after macam covid [kan]
you where's where's the first place yang you want to travel
yup
list them all
[oh]
[oh]
ya ya gold coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
and remember yang kita semua jatuh sakit after we played at the beach
true
ya
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit
yeah hopefully once like macam the border [dah] buka then we can go
ya
ya true true
!wah! for me right
after macam this covid situation i think the first place i want to travel to is (uh) mana ni japan
yes
i've been there bila when i was like i think five years old
i was very young so macam tak ingat (uh) i don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why i wanna macam go there again and then macam like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya i i mean japan also macam if it's like an interesting country [ah] macam menarik you know pasal
like because (uh) i told you before i'm an anime lover right so like i want to go there macam collect diorang nya apa ni figurine because like banyak orang kata macam
is macam quite cheap [ah] so i was like okay [ah] then i i think if if cause i like to collect
figurine so i was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
!wah! i tell you i'm biggest procrastinator [eh] with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator i i like let's say like
the the work is macam due next week [kan] then i would only do it like macam tiga hari before the the due date
ya because i don't know sometimes i'm just too macam penat nak buat buat the assignment so that's why i keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
[oh]
(mm)
ya (uh) me also like most of the time is always like cause i
always use my i'm on my handphone asyik tengok instagram semua then it's like i don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock i'm like [oh] [dah] lambat [ah] just tidur [lah] besok boleh buat
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem i face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
(uh) it can be done but it's just very hard
macam like group projects [eh]
[oh] recently i i ada macam this one (err) group project like i just finished macam (err) dua weeks lepas is apa it's called studio project so it's basically like because (uh)
my course is interaction design [kan] so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm (uh) ideas together and then come up with like (uh) a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting [lah] because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
(uh) how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
so my group kita buat we did this (uh) macam is like a e storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and macam the setting all also we we draw ourselves using photoshop photoshop is is a very susah app
to pakai because ya it's only my first year and then is also my macam my first time [ah] pakai then it's like susah [ah] then like all my other friends macam they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from i_t_e ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story macam interesting [ah] so like when users (uh) see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like macam arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next (uh) page or something so that's like macam there's an interaction there
ya that's about it
for you [eh]
(mm)
why kay you tell me
how #rabak#
!wah! i legit also don't like this type of people [leh] like they really make my blood go up [eh] like like they already like i mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to [ah] take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like i feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works [lah]
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] i know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
[oh]
[oh] that's interesting
[ah] ya ya
(mm)
[oh] that's good that's good
yeah
[oh]
ya
i think i think it's a it's a good app [ah] because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our singaporean society cause like i feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good (um) for me i think your app is very beneficial [lah] for people yeah
(oo) that's good
ya ya ya very interesting [eh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
yeah i've heard of fun run before i actually played that game
!wah!
that's cool
animal crossing is a very in game now [eh] a lot of people have been playing it i'm also very curious macam banyak orang like semua main [ah] then i was i'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
(mm)
!wah!
ya ya ya very interesting
macam look forward to [ah]
!wah! that that's quite a handful you got you got banyak project to apa ni buat
[oh]
[oh]
yeah it's good also because like [kan] year three we ada internship right i and i also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for (um) untuk like the company before diorang accept you in
i i actually i didn't know that like i thought internship like diorang we're just like straight away masukkan you inside there but i didn't know like you have to macam go through an interview so i think macam it's quite ben~ it's quite beneficial [lah] like apa diorang
ajar teach kat dalam yeah
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
(mm)
i also had like a similar a similar module i did apa ni (uh) previously
where also same it's called (uh) effective effective (err) communication skill so diorang ajar macam mana
nak you know (err) if (err) communicate effectively and how to like you know gain (uh) confidence
and what are some of the
the like
powerful words i guess you can use during your interview so like to macam macam you like sell yourself so
ya i i actually find that module actually quite in~ interesting [ah] but macam sedih [ah] because like it was only for a semester i wish it was longer because it really it really helped me [ah] from someone who is actually macam
macam takut to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone i am now who (err) is (uh) confident enough [ah] to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
[oh] ya
ya
!wah! actually i make friends very instantly [eh] it's like ya because (err) okay the good thing about technology is that (err)
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called telegram so they had this channel for my school [lah] so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
and macam it's like quite cool [lah] because like then you can macam cari orang in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me (err) there's this macam ada this (uh) girl that she came up i mean she texted me then she was like [eh] i heard you're in the in the same course
then (uh) she's like (uh) let's be friends [ah] then from there (uh) we started being friends [ah] then (err) when during poly because (err) mostly it was on zoom right because of macam this covid situation semua so everything macam is online
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya so (err) ya then (err) in school like when we macam jumpa
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for macam many years
ya so it was like quite easy [lah] in terms of like making new friends yeah but i think now the only thing macam susah is that (uh) is like the modules [ah] because ya i mean like some of the modules it's like i've never macam done before
or i have no interest in and then ya like for example coding i've never done tak pernah buat coding before so yeah i i get to learn like new things and stuff
ya
you [eh] what about you
ya
ya from sec~ secondary school then to poly
!wah! my one don't have [eh] cause covid then no orientation very damn sad [leh]
i was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like macam party for the for the freshman then don't have cause covid
[oh]
!huh! really [ah]
[oh]
[oh] i see i see
[oh] i think i think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything macam
[oh]
(mm)
i i think not bad [leh] the one that there was one time
i also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time (um) my i had i had this (uh) program called like n_y_a_a so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours [lah] then you will get the
macam the badge gitu so yeah so i went for the eight hours shift [one] [ah] so it's not bad [ah] tapi panas gila
it was so hot
and the and the worst thing [kan] towards the is tengah puasa you know tengah puasa then like me and my friend macam like [eh] nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak
then we then kita almost batal [lah] my then my friend [dah] tak boleh take it [kan] then she was like [ah] batal [jer] [lah]
ya
eight hours was (uh) painful [lah] then kita jalan jalan
ya we we we we walked around the whole of #tampines# ya but it was very very rewarding pasal (uh) at the end of the day kita dapat banyak donation
ya
(mm)
!huh! biar betul
right
!wah!
kay [lah] not bad you know at least you all macam you know like put money inside [lah] donate also
ya
but if you were to do macam flag day again would you do it
really ya it is
[oh] ya ya i've done the morning shift [one] before it's very very tiring
penat i couldn't macam buka my mata
ya it was during bulan puasa
ya
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the macam the tempat yang ada shade [kan] already [dah] ada orang so me and my friend like macam terpaksa [ah] kita stand
un~ under the hot sun then collect [lor] but that spot was the best cause banyak orang lalu sana so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like !alamak! shouldn't have told them
[oh] maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad [lah] this covid there [ah] spoil all the plan [eh] then like legit man then [ah] spoil then like i can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do zoom zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
ya true hopefully [lah] i i i really wish macam this covid situation will macam die down [ah] because it really affects [ah] kita punya life
(mm)
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you
pressure okay
alright
okay so anyways
[ah]
what i want to ask you is
kenapa
kau
dekat bilik spare
okay again
[oh] okay
[ha] [ha]
(uh huh)
right right
wait wait wait so he pinjam duit
from
unofficial sources
[kan]
[ha] [ha]
and then
[ah] dia put #afan# name down as macam guarantor kau tahu kind of thing [ah]
but did he tell him beforehand ke apa
[ha] [ha]
so how long ago was this and berapa
dia punya amount
what
wait but kinda guy macam like can't he go to a licensed [one]
how bad could it possibly be like the licensed [one] they take anybody [what]
what i mean i would know a i i i i been there too
(mm)
alright so he's supposed to be moving out by october
but you are initially macam kau okay with that [ah] actually
dia macam
dia macam degil kind of guy ya
!huh!
okay
tak macam masalah dia it is that kind of thinking like
nanti your issues will like snowball
snowball anjing punya
wait wait so like
where did he go like when when did he move out
(mmhmm)
no okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
but to me like what's done is done that was like a last month thing right
like the whole
pinjam duit shit
[ah] but
he should have
you know
be upfront with everybody you about it right
!wow!
i mean of course
had anyone would would be pissed about that
so where's the guy now
ya ya
then his
then his things
right
but where that where can he go
i thought when he'll he'll stay with you cause he doesn't have he doesn't have a place
no but i don't
no but i don't have a place to go i i don't want to live in my mum's living room
alright i mean okay fair enough
but i thought he was
making macam
okay money
from his the other his
co-curricular activities kau tahu
but
true
but aku aku macam thinking more of on the lines of
so what did he do with the money then
right
[ha] [ha] [ha]
no but that kind of behaviour right okay to be fair
kalau
dia kawan aku
he was my friend
macam you ask me to get a guard
a strangle
then you know you kind of knuckle jack hits a bit
macam [eh] [eh] [eh] bodoh you know that kind of thing
!wah! man i cannot [ah]
but that's terrible [ah]
like
we are talking about like thousand two right or something
to be honest your rental rates is nonsense [ah]
you know
i would pay you five like like five six hundred for like
rental
[ha] [ha]
or there's
or there's an actual plague going on [ha] [ha]
okay so (um) about #fahim# thing
(err)
the other day
okay (err)
i'm going to say something about
brother herme
[kan]
tapi kau
kau jangan get rile up [ah]
okay so the other day aku jumpa dia
right
#ayip#
pick me up after work
i you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
kita gi makan
and all that
then on the way back (err) i i don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then i was talking about
[oh] down to v e
you know
ya cause i think we were
[oh] it's one of those kind i like like like (um) on the video kadang-kadang
they would [ah] play macam
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what i'm what
no i'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if i were the d_j i will get a kick out i think the most stupid things [ah]
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then i'll
sorry i just thought of of of him
[ah] then we were i was talking about it till like
ya ya then i was talking about it too
how to
tired [ah]
then he was
eighty nine
i wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
[ah] us ya
so (um) then he was saying how (um)
how did they go into it i
okay so dia cakap macam
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then i was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
(err)
kalau aku #hilmi#
[kan]
i would
i wouldn't support all these things
ya
so i was i was saying that i don't think #hilmi# actually supports [ah] no of course not
then [ah] he #wafan# was saying ya but you know the act of macam more or less you're saying
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do [lah]
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up [ah]
then he was saying how (um)
i think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
i was wondering kalau
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that [ah]
so now what now is just
matair [jer]
!huh! !huh!
so that's the thing i was trying to get across to him [ah] macam you know i understand where he's coming from sebab
it's
it doesn't feel
great [ah]
help help that's a fucking understatement [kan] ya but macam
i was telling him [ah] like they are gonna
in a in a very tough spot aku macam put it in a more personal light [ah] i'm saying that i totally not okay
[ah] when
when i had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then i was saying him [eh] i but mine wasn't cause of cheating [ah] of course
so
like if i was the cheater
like would you still hang out with me tak
in that sense
and then macam cakap
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit [tau]
ya
probably also he had a pause cause someone was trying to cut into his lane then dia macam maki sekejap [ah]
like nor~ normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
[eh]
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea i was just saying okay
!hey! brother
you should remind me to bring an a_u_x cable then i can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
asal kau nak gini
tak
tak tak tak
it it
singapore is very small
kau nak main lagu apa
abeh he said that he said that ultimate like pakcik thing to say that [ah] that was like
no no no no that's one thing that's this [one] pakcik thing but he said the other part pakcik thing
nanti
nanti aku tak boleh focus
[oh] !wow!
!wow! that's that's going into the wrong direction [ah]
so anyways right
ya so (um) about that i think then he was
telling me that
okay after awhile then he he told me that okay i i would still hang out with you aku masih boleh
lepak dengan kau [ah] kind of thing
but
i don't want to have the girl there like i cannot
aku macam okay
fair enough [ah]
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch [ah]
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
let's say kau nak main macam devil's advocate kind of thing
like how do you defend
[ah] his his actions from a moral standpoint [ah]
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than i am [lah] [kan]
so what do you feel about the difference macam in terms of
(uh) being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
okay but what do you think of her macam dia punya character and such
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given [ah]
(mm)
i don't know that's a very controversial statement [ah]
so by those dates
you you describe it as (um)
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
okay so i what i don't see where you're coming from [ah] macam aku faham but i don't think it's matter of gender [tau]
to me that [one] it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender [lah] like that's true
right
okay
tapi macam
#fahim# isn't exactly mister olympia material himself [pe]
i mean
what
i mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight i i've always known her to be a bit of
on the (err)
how do i put this
okay
rounder side of life [ah]
at !wah! that's
brother why you got to use the f word
what it post
!wah! i cannot
[sial] [ah]
bodoh gila [pe]
brunei
[eh] no no no no no
i've been to brunei
okay so
[ah] people in brunei
no i'm not talking about like the
workers are like the they have a lot of like foreign workers
sama sama situation as us [ah]
no but they are middle
income people there
right
half of them are
bulgy chonkers juga [tau]
ya
so like (uh) i was asking bell [lah] that time it's like why [ah]
like
when we do say you know
a couple of
chonkers due here in
singapore
[ha] [ha]
but
do you see more that there
then she was saying [oh] then she was expecting okay (um) one thing is
dia punya their food
[kan] dorang punya makanan
[ah] it's
the portion [kan] besar gila
that's a
b
(err) a public transport is a fucking nightmare
everyone drives
tapi there's no incentive too you know
buat apa
but there's no tourism to speak of
but that [one] also doesn't paint like (err) macam compete picture juga cause a lot of the citizens dorang punya baseline is met
free education free healthcare
right
i mean
okay (uh) as a brown guy here aku pun free education [ah] up to a point
but healthcare is not free [what]
ya
[oh] ya
we get sidetrack macam anjing
so basically i was
i was talking about [ah] about #ruqayyah# and then we talking about ya okay so
your your whole day your
i think what you're trying to say in summary is that
dia macam
a bit spoilt
like
and she doesn't have that drive in her to
do more
like
(uh huh)
wait so there are
other factors juga
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
(err) apa nama dia
no no no no no
[ah]
so what is it about the home wrecker yang
you know
[eh]
!wow!
why does it sound (mm)
(mmhmm)
like it just physical
[oh] man
tak aku
punya urge to choke slam dia is like rising [ah] it's
!wow!
but
i don't
the thing is right
i don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
like the underlying issue is still there apa like he's basically not happy
tapi dia tahu tak
kenapa dia tak happy
how else you gonna get x_p and loot
you know
i don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a dengki thing [ah]
it's a revenge thing [ah]
maybe
very complicated stuff
you know like i know we've known the guy for like forever
i never thought
(mmhmm)
now is what
fourteen years
no i never
don't want to say that but you said but you said it
ya i never thought you with #tino# until but then again all of us
ya but somehow in in in your mind you always thinking you know okay (uh) marriage is like the big leveller [ah]
it would down
calm down his raging lions that kind of thing
do you even iron clothes
[oh] i haven't seen an iron board in years [ah] dude
what for
but if you see me tons of time aku mana iron anything
ya
(mm)
so anyways
i don't remember that
[ha] [ha]
!wow!
no but it's one of those things that it just macam it creeps up on you
like like no one just wakes up one day twenty kilo heavier [pe]
don't care what you eat but the [oh] how many times you eat [lah] in that sense
wait
what's
what's your weight now [ah]
!wow!
[eh] is it
i i don't
is it
is it normal for your height i i don't actually know
right so if you
it's like you're on the the yellow zone kind of thing [ah] is it
[oh] no there's a difference you know you you you you cannot use the [ah] #ang-moh# ones
ya ya ya result
sebab [ah] asian dengan
white guys different [ah]
in terms of what lean body mass
ya
i mean we just evolved from different monkeys [lah] i guess
[ah] i don't think there's a big difference between malay and chinese
you know
[ah] wait wait wait wait
[eh] wait wait
what were they talking about [ah]
that [one]
okay okay
wait wait [ah] kau sixty one right
okay how how how tall are you
one six seven let me cal~ cal~
[eh] brother you are at low risk good job
[ah] ya your b_m_i is twenty one point nine
[orh] without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the h_p_b [one] doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference [ah]
according to this my b_m_i is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but i used to but i think (um) i think a couple of months ago i was
i was i was a bit of a
in a chonky
kind of situation aku macam i was eighty six kilo [sia]
i think my my highest
my my my my peak [ah]
peak
no
my peak was i was nine
you know at my peak i was ninety kilos [jer]
right
i
i think i know which [one] you're talking about like the picture
sugar a is an addiction
aku used to have an issue about eating [ah] i don't why like i i was constantly lapar like hungry
macam lapar gila
but you eat you wake up in the morning kira [kan] macam
ravenous nak mampus
!huh! !huh! !huh!
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
(mm)
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
i don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it [ah]
ya
alright
in law no not yet so [ah] cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
[ah] german guy did i did i told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course [ah] and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so (um) it's like things to do if the if (uh) for you know respiratory things [ah]
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing (uh) this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time [ah] he was telling me this i wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit #siao# also
so macam (um) i think they were doing like is
[ah] quarterly report or something [lah]
pasal dorang punya
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message [ah]
saying that you know
(um) good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email [ah]
then then at then a while ago were like complaining [ah] how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
covid
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
i don't know german guy
[ah] then
he will he told me he told me that first [ah] that was like the first time i met him then when when i met him again he was telling me the same story that i thought okay [ah] this old man might might have been repeating his story again
macam no no no
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two [ah]
or a few months medical leave
then then i was like [oh] why
i wasn't thinking that
at at first i was thinking like something else [lah] right
then said no
he got covid
aku dah macam yo
what the fuck
is it dah macam you know like
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
(um) the initial thing was
they wanted to get married [ah] this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents [lah] of course
no it's not so much #muz# [ah] #muz# macam
it's usually like a like a mother thing [lah] like
ya this kind of
ya so (um) and then what you call it [ah] then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that (uh) he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
so he was first i said okay but it was that kind of okay macam
suka hati [ah] you know that kind of thing
[ah] kind of ya so my sister was complaining a bit and then after that he was finding a a lot of issues pasal
islam [ah]
in general
like
which you know
can i can totally
ya if you talk to me about it !woo! you can go on for like this [ah] but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it [lah] then i'm like
aku pun nak join his side but i cannot
but there got a lot of things that he brings up also are things that you know i've i've (um) contemplated about [lah] some of them macam not a big deal but there are some things that he that as i find it to be surprising that he takes issue with one thing is zakat
dia macam cakap [oh] it doesn't feel transparent
yes
then i'm like
ya that's what i told my sister also [lah] i haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to m_u_i_s then i i told my dad i told my sister you know
i never give m_u_i_s i just donate
on my own
what i didn't mention was i donate to myself so it's a different thing
[eh] you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy [what]
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway i
betul [ah] that's what #fahim# adhere
so
ya so anyway then (um)
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
#wuhan# flu and all that
[ah] chinese cough as they say
and then (err)
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and (um)
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow [ah] from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved [ah] which is fair
ya [lah] of course [lah] you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay [ah] mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up [ah]
then (uh)
so my mum
i thought i thought they were in a good spot
[ah] and they were kind of
having some progress [ah] but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause (uh) [kan] they both work from home
like
(uh) my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go i think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya i wish i could do that
(um)
ya then [ah] he goes over to his place a lot cause (uh) k so my my parents live in #bedok# south right which is
basically near #tanah-merah# right
then he lives at the condo at #tanah-merah#
ya i think that's what it's called ya i've been there before once [pe]
ya
so she goes over there like every other day [ah] to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
[ah] okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya [sia] ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it [lah]
one of those guys
ya
and then [ah] she's there like every other day then (um) that day i kind of went to meet my mum
no not my family dinner at simpang [kan]
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of [eh] why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about (uh) that issue like my sister
(um) being over there [lah] what
and saying how [oh]
sebagai orang islam
[ah] aku dah
my mum
then
aku dengar tu aku dah macam (oo)
bulu
roma dah stand at attention
so i kau jangan cakap gini [ah]
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do [ah]
i don't know then i i told her that i think the best thing to do is
macam you cannot expect a marriage now [what] doesn't make sense right
so the best thing to do
ya [lah] exactly then i told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
just the show juga
apa
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
i think they should know
then the last time [ah] he talked to me and (uh) he brought me out for beers
[oh] he ajak me again like today's friday but aku macam
[ah] i've got things to do [ah]
ya so i didn't
what
[oh] no no aku have
an online class that that i want to do
ya
no no no no as in i am i am i am doing like a psychology course [lah] so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones [lah] it's just to like you know
no it's one of those like coursera kind of shit kau tahu
[ah] ya
so anyway (um) what what i saying ya then he was telling me about
[ah] at first if his parents have some reservations [ah] about him
going out with a malay asian girl [ah]
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
i get it
fair enough
no [ah] [ah] !whoa! this just !whoa! !whoa! that's fucked up
that's true
then at first i was kind of offended and then i had then i really thought about it for like for like a bit then i realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like [ah] muslim countries [lah] right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
this makes sense aku aku faham
but i don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way [tau]
was it aus~ (mm)
australia [eh] tak
ya so i think in the end just closed like that you know i think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first [lah]
okay can you hear me
okay okay can start talking already
ya
don't know you you are the one who was who is confused [ah] there's a cake on top of the macarons
tukar apa
no because because when when i made the order dorang they asked for the ya [lah] they asked for your options like what do you want
unless
ya cause the macaron want to send you for what because my mum made the choice already
ya [lah]
okay ya so the cake is now the chocolate orange cake with nutella [kan] ya then the macaron my mum biar dia choose [lah] cause different different colour let her choose [ah] but she cause she
colour colour is the flavour [lah]
ya ya ya
ya the colour is the flavour so dia ada different different flavour [lah] so but my mum choose like the colours that are [ah] but the the taste the taste is not that different [lah] for macaron manis [jer] dia punya taste a bit a bit [jer]
tak dia maximum three flavours ya so so the bottom two the bottom two tier is one flavour the second two tier is one flavour the one two tier is one
tak tak
(mm) tak
ya so that [one] cause since she they decorated ed the cake already ya so she just choose the macaron
i [ah] cari-cari [lah] kat instagram
ya i read all the reviews apparently all the reviews say the macarons are good so i try the macaron i tak tahu that's that's the thing that's why i rather take the macarons cause the reviews a lot on macarons
cannot covid cannot do cake tasting
ya by right can but because it's covid
nak order order birthday cake first [ah]
ya but then but i already pay deposit [lah] so whatever [lah] kita tawakkal [jer]
ya
ya cake is the ya i think the remaining i just need to find out dia ada minta macam i think they ask for two hours time frame the that [one] i don't understand [lah] i ask (uh) don't know they haven't reply [ah] whatever [ah] nanti [ah] tapi that the cake is still a long time [pe] the day on the wedding baru dapat [pe]
i also don't know i mean i'm just waiting for them to answer
ya i don't know [ah] but i asked them what do you mean by that
i don't know i just cause their phrasing for that question is like very weird so i was like what do you mean by this tapi dorang belum reply so nanti [ah] just wait for them to reply
either that or they want like within these two hours like what time do you want them to come or something whatever [lah]
ya [lah] of course [lah] decor [lah] they have to do the decor [what]
ya
[kan] a lot of thing
ya she want to ya she want to tambah-tambah [lah]
ya so biar [lah] biar [lah] dia mak pengantin
ya but he didn't ask tak i i called him actually i i wanted to ask about the package cause i need to order the wedding cake ya a_s_a_p i i want to

tapi mak andam nak siap lelaki i don't know

nanti apa
takpe i tengok kalau dia tanya kak kau nak pakai inai ke tak tak yah [lah] [ah] okay [lah] [ah] kalau dia macam gitu okay kalau dia cakap [eh] kau merepek pakai [lah] inai [ah] then tu makna terpaksa
kalau awak tak tahu nanti tanya sekali
tak perlu [lah] #hafiz# pun tak pakai
ya so prep for wedding like what time the cake can come and all that
what time the cake can come and what time ya what time our representative can come in to make sure that everything is ya nice
and lepas tu ada lain benda [ah] [ah] pasal yang food serving
assign what
ya sof~ serve like what time like we want them to serve at eight thirty
ya cause after nikah nikah selalu berapa lama tw~ fifteen minute twenty minute
thirty minute
(mm) tak [ah] ambil gambar [jer] [lah] abeh lepas nikah dah ambil gambar
doa ada doa kena doa #bismillah# gitu
okay [lah] so so fine eight thirty nanti (uh) the thing is actually kita dah short of time [tau]
ya nak ambil gambar orang nak ambil gambar kita
ya abeh kita tak makan [ah]
sekejap [ah] like the last [ah] last last [eh] we are photo taking tiga puluh minit sudah [eh]
[ah] okay okay so okay so awak take note (err) for lepas nikah kita cakap the food is served at eight thirty walaupun apa jadi just serve [jer] because it's gonna be on the table [jer] [kan]
ya so so just eight thirty [a'ah] macam eight thirty eight thirty gitu okay start serving [lah] like once once dorang dah they feel like nikah tu dah is okay to make noise already then they can just go
tak [lah]
tak dia bu~
tak kesah [lah] kita nak makan we still need to cake cut okay
okay
sela~ sela~ selalunya orang ambil gambar sebelum makan sebab nanti kalau makan berkecah
ya
like okay dengar dengar dengar that's why i say ya we'll go by table that's why i say biar let them serve the food after this lepas nikah lepas tu okay just ask #rizal# to okay (um) now the food while the food is served we will go table by table to take pictures [eh] like each person [ah]
[ah] but first of course our parents first [ah] ya of course of course our parents first lepas tu dah lepas tu dah continue [ah] so in the meantime people come people go back and then just makan [jer] [ah] like that one time so once we are done dah lima puluh orang then we can just go join them makan tapi cake cut kita belum
selalu cake cutting first [kan] selalu cake cut is the first [kan]
ya ke
[eh] okay [lah] okay [lah] okay then then the cake will be the last because after that kita terus kasi and then kita kasi dorang then they just cabut [kan] together with the berkat [kan] okay okay so (oo) but i need to remember to buy packaging to give the macaron and the cake macaron macaron boleh bawa balik the cake boleh makan tak [ah] plastic okay [lah] macaron plastic okay [lah]
macam macam yang kopi ke tak kopi punya [ah] itu okay tak [lah] on macaron ya allah macaron
tak itu itu nanti saya suruh #siti# #siti# #siti# bagus #siti# [kan] baker
[ah] tu yang nanti #siti# nanti suruh #siti# tolong anokan
ya so eight thirty makan table by table take photo and then once we done we join bila kita dah habis blah blah
baru kita cake cutting cake cut okay dah jalan-jalan dah
so table by table kita makan by the time should be nine thirty [lah] tak [kan] kita makan lama sangat ada chance pun saya pun macam tak terasa nak makan [a'ah] lepas tu suruh dorang bungkus makan
shouldn't be [lah] kalau pergi table by table should be tak terlepas [ah]
i think so confirm #rizal# #sabo# nya dia mesti #sabo# punya like (uh) korang ada apa words to each other [oh] okay we both have a few words con~ conjointly #rizal# kau irritating okay dah dah siap [eh] okay then something else i want to ask [lah] something else i wanted to ask the venue but i forgot ya [lah] yang pasal deejay tu are they giving cause dia cakap remember yang pasal spotify cakap just give us and then we will play it for you
[oh] ya okay okay so so can kita lupa pula nak tanya pasal tu sound board [ah] you tanya dia like who ca~ is is someone manning the sound board supposed to be from our side or you want your person to jaga your sound board
ya [lah] just ask him
ya so so just ask him kalau tak takpe i just standby #hafiz# #hafiz# nanti kau pergi
i think
wait [eh] nanti nanti ya it's just fade down fade up actually kalau #rizal# boleh buat pun #rizal# boleh buat sendiri [jer] bila dia nak berbual just fade down sendiri lepas tu dia berbual bila dia dah habis dia off mic lepas tu dia pergi [ah] lepas tu dia pergi balik to the sound board to just [ah] macam fade up lagu sikit ke ya atau actually awak boleh set [kan] on the board auto fade down

i i tengok terus i tertidur
apa
ustaz mana ni
okay
(mmhmm)
okay then
abeh
why what
good men
tapi ya [lah] like let's same [ah] like my my brothers can do whatever they want perempuan aje like the rules only ya because they're me~ the~ they're guys ya the rules only apply to girls guys ya [lah] dorang lelaki nanti dorang selalu cakap [ah] biar [ah] dorang lelaki
everyone [ah]
it's it's the it's the same concept as the westerners [ah] like when the girl have sex a lot she's considered a slut but when the guy have sex a lot they're considered macam !wow! a man ya tu [ah]
so it's the same concept [ah] i think i think i think everywhere is facing it everywhere is facing it
or is it it comes from the western [ah] so orang tengok macam gitu [kan]
ya
the children the childr~ the children will tengok at how their parents are [ah] nanti kalau dorang nampak dorang macam dorang nampak macam if let's say dorang nampak the father kurang ajar dengan mak dia nanti they also know they will do that to the girls also
(mm)
(mm)
ya
it's no [lah] sometimes it's not about the father also sometimes because sekarang perempuan semua they want to be feminists ya that's also the problem ya perempuan perempuan wants the same status and rank as the guy so macam ya sekarang wives apa
tapi women now don't want to show that women need men
ya sekarang susah
nanti dia cari orang lain yang perlukan dia
ya [lah]
i think it's okay it's okay kalau women want to be independent but ya but at least show [lah] kasi like give and take
(mmhmm)
!huh!
tak sayang [ah] tu
ya they don't have time to dia you know you know i saw i read something like i think we should do it [lah] when we get married dia cakap tak i read somewhere it's macam an advice dia cakap how to keep your marriage alive or macam not there dia cakap make sure once a week at least once a week you go out go for a dinner [a'ah] then at least once a month go for a staycation or something once a month macam go for like like a someone further away somewhere further
tak okay okay okay once once a week go out with your family together with your kids once a month have a one to one date [a'ah] lepas tu once a year go overseas with the with the whole family this is how you keep ya ya so at least walaupun like you have children once a month you are having dates so every once a month if if any time between the first month and the second month your your love macam die sikit [ah] you will macam you will refresh your dating days [a'ah] so at least every once a month every once a month you are lighting up the candle you're lighting up the candle [ah] so at least diam [eh] ya so that so i think it's a very good advice [seh] macam i think ya it's it's it w~ ya cause the thing is sekarang a lot of people
but ya but when things happen dah susah
tak [lah] don't have to be tak don't have to macam go out macam overseas as in pergi dekat dekat pun tak kesah macam malaysia you know that kind of thing ya just somewhere [lah]
ya it's about macam kita macam keluar once a week bring your children out is macam gi bawah main-main ke [a'ah] just macam every sunday ya so macam picnic ke bring your own food [ah] pastu macam bila dating pun tak suruh pergi mana-mana mahal macam just go out dating [jer] !huh! ya just go out like apa
ya that is the daily that's the daily punya cure [ah] tapi susah because i think everyone is working tapi dorang cakap [kan] dorang cakap kalau let's say suami dia actually dah solat abeh bini dia nak solat suami tu boleh solat lagi just to imamkan dia something like that [kan] macam let's say kalau wife wife dia dah solat sekali lelaki dia datang
[ah] lepas tu lelaki let's say the husband datang balik balik dari kerja it's okay that the wife solat lagi dengan dia just so [ah] suami dia macam just boleh solat jemaah [lah] with the wife
nanti balik [ah] imamkan
sekarang ya the thing is sekarang cakap senang nanti mesti ada dugaan dia bisikan syaitan tak payah [lah] tak payah solat jemaah pergi solat sendiri-sendiri sudah dah apa ayah why you never pray what time already siapa anak siapa anak #syafiq# [eh] ayah what time already
tak [lah] dengan mak bapa dia dorang sendiri-sendiri dengan awak [jer] dengan kita [jer] nak solat dengan kita tapi dorang kat rumah sendiri-sendiri

apa lalu jadi macam pirate [ah] basically so like our
our
roots our malay pirate roots
orang #bugis# right pirates
i i i think so
#bugis# is from the land of #bugis# [ah] i don't know
my god the
the capital of bugis is (uh) arab street
what the hell is piawai
what the hell is piawaian
are you saying are you saying something wrong are you like mispronouncing it badly
what does kepiawaian mean in indonesian
#huzaifi# you you read a melayu
primary school melayu textbook you probably need it to be translated for you also
keah lian
[orh] kepiawaian means expertise or skill
i thought #bugis# people were the pirates [one]
(err)
no really i know like
g~ got like a big community of
there there there
#mahathir# at one point he called
#bugis# people pirates i just googled #bugis# pirates i mean i can tell you this one
i googled #bugis# pirates
so at one point of time
(err) #mahathir# like the malaysian punya prime minister [kan]
then after that he said (err)
he called
he referred to the #bugis# people as pirates and then after that like the malaysian royals marah dengan dia
this was in two thousand seventeen quite recent [lah]
but yeah
yeah
no i'm on
well ya ya ya does it have pirates in it
troll as pirates
reputation for being pirates [ah]
the #bugis# people raided english and dutch ships mercilessly
ya ya that's what i'm talking about
proud of my culture
[oh] that's quite cool
i'm gonna start telling people that
it's like [eh] kau jangan main main aku aku darah what is pirate in melayu [ah]
ya what what is pirate in malay pirate in malay
lanun
[oh] kau jangan main main aku ada darah lanun
exactly [ah] [sia]
ya dulu [lah] i think
i dulu bila i time
mula
mula j_c right
i was like
i was on the verge of getting a tattoo
okay i wanted to get a pirate ship because
i like pernah dengar or~ orang kata orang #bugis# pirate then i like
wanted to show my culture
but it but
kena letak at my at my thigh
pantai you macam orang pandai ada orang jaga
ada letak at my thigh [sia] i already had it planned like the placement semua habis
and then after that i fikir balik
#toh# is the only one who's like full blooded #bugis# and if #toh# finds out i did this to show my #bugis# side confirm #toh# will beat me up [sia]
yeah
don't judge me shut up [lah]
cool [pe]
ya
i i i i'm young at heart
cool [pe] tak cool ke
obviously i didn't go through with it
[eh] no [sia] i fikir for like
i fikir for like tiga tahun [sia]
and after that i finally masuk n_s then i was like okay
ya i was thinking like i'll i'll i saved up enough money
already like i think tiga tahun in j_c i saved up enough money then i was like [ah] i i cannot [lah] later i go n_s later they throw me into like mono intake infantry or something cause i got tattoo so i wait first
then masuk n_s then i like cannot do [ah] later must take m_c
and then after that finished n_s no money already cause i spent it all on new zealand
(mm)
is that is that correct memang [ah]
you're so cool bro !chey! memang [lah]
k jadi tattoo apa yang
there there will be a tattoo of a
koi fish [eh] koi fish tak habis [eh]
ya the the the japanese wave shit then after that it's always like a koi fish going up and then after that the koi fish is at the forearm
nanti kat atas it's a dragon tapi usually dia orang tak ada duit nak habiskan the dragon so it's just a koi fish at the forearm
seriously i
i kena like tiga orang who have the exact same tattoo and they stop at the exact same spot
sebab tak cukup duit
why do you think i saved up money for three years when i wanted to get tattoo
tak ada colour [ah]
colour mahal [sia]
i don't know [ah] depends on the quality [one] [ah]
obviously i di~ i i didn't do much research [ah] i didn't want a koi fish tattoo i wanted a pirate [one]
you know it will be like like
!huh!
!wah!
ask her to do an apprenticeship [ah]
what the fuck
apa [sia]
[eh] korang boleh maki tak
man
i wouldn't i don't i wouldn't trust myself [sia]
number one sakit [eh] later you like you tattoo yourself after that you pengsan macam mana
then just like later pengsan then the line like drag across across your body
you know like when you're writing ya but you're like in class then later tertidur youppo
apa berkam apa [sia]
cuppin
the one you bought after you exercise
[ah] ya ya ya
(uh huh)
!woo!
[oh] that's cool
macam tattoo
[eh]
it's like test test dulu [ah]
[ah] cause
because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right i'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
cause the gun is going in and out it's very fast so you tak rasa sangat
or like you rasa for a shorter amount of time cause it's masuk keluar masuk keluar
well with the hand [one] it's like the person cucuk one by one slowly i'm sure it's gonna hurt more
i mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
i'm sure it's not that fast [lah]
ya
you [tau] [ah] i lagi sikit i bila i went to mexico [kan]
i lagi sikit
i almost got a tattoo there

baru nak book appointment already when i was there
habis my dad dia kata [oh] cause before that my dad got the kidney problems [one] then he didn't want to let me or my sisters donate our kidney

that kind of thing like that
[ah]
bila i pergi clubbing in n_s with all my friends

aku nak aku nak pergi nak pergi jumpa kawan kawan [eh] like then after that kita tengah joget joget so usually when i go
like clubbing and k i'll go with my friends and then after that we just joget joget together like just guys it's just like playing around by ourselves then after that at one point of time there was this group of girls
also happened to be there and then after that they like trying to like like my friends all like ikut dia orang [ah]
then after that
i sendiri
and after that this girl came up to me then after that she like started macam joget depan i
then after that you know like they dance very close [one]
then my friends were behind me then they were like egging me on
and after that i pusing belakang then i was like [eh] bodoh [sia] [lah] sempit [sia] and then i the girl then i they all were like what the fuck [sia]

ya
how is it how was your last duty you get into trouble or not
surprising
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
hose testing tu apa like you just turn on the thing [ah]
[ah]
[ah] okay
[oh] [dah] buat salah sekarang buat baik pula
action [sia]
i
[oh]
baik hati [ah]
merepek [sia]
what time you balik
apa
[ah]
ya okay [lah] that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like turun
hand over shift
tujuh setengah [kan]
and then after that i i didn't turn out for call i malas so i tidur i tidur in like the they have like a mass hall but atas [ah] on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else tidur on the first floor and then i tidur on the second floor
habis naik atas like pukul satu pagi then i was like [eh] ma'am i i go sleep first [ah] then she like [oh] k k i see you upstairs
habis tidur
bangun pukul sembilan pagi [sia]
when i when i went back into the office [sia] [lah] semua day crew and then they all like [eh] you this shift what why you come late then i was like no encik i night shift [sia]
ya pukul sembilan bangun
then after that nak kena sign out [kan] the reservist nya attendance sheet
habis dia nya
night shift nya semua paramedics [dah] balik then i was like [eh] encik macam mana [sia] then he's like [ah] never mind i sign for you i sign for you
reservist
n_s n_s takkan nak begitu [sia] [lah]
n_s balik on the dot [sia]
actually not really [lah] n_s i used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay i'll
(mm)
(mm)
night shift i wasn't like that [ah] because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning [kan]
for me if i night shift then i finished in the morning [kan]
dulu
[orh] me and my friends selalu keluar eat breakfast [lah] so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics balik station [ah]
ya
last time my rota quite bonded [ah]
one time we naik basikal
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already pergi entah mana nak makan [lah] or something then my friend kata [eh] [sia] [lah] aku tertinggal aku ni barang [ah]
then after that we cycled back and then we masuk the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper macam
habis dia orang keluar then after that the #suay-suay# the r_c is like !oi! bicycle siapa ni then i was like encik encik bukan saya punya bicycle
[ah] that's like fucking eight bicycle [sia]
eight bicycles pump~ like parked beside the p_l siapa tak bingit [sia]
nasib baik dia orang tak kena
(mm)
[oh] ya how was it cardiac arrest right
[ah]
cannot [sia]
(mm)
[dah] expect [ah]
(mm)
fuck
ya that's quite rare
i think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
twenty percent a quarter of them [ah] dapat shock
[ah]
(mm) depends [ah] depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
kadang kadang
no most of the time if dapat shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
[oh]
so the pulse [dah] balik [ah]
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
no no when was the last time the patient like dia orang sampai dia [dah] [dah] gone [kan] so like how long before that did they last see him
[orh] like depan mata [ah]
[oh]
why [sia]
ya ya ya
kadang [eh] the
when i went back reservist the medic told me sekarang they make it compulsory [sia]
all medics
kena like you you have to have the my responder app
my time it was like optional
then after that sekarang dia orang enforce like you have to download
then after that if you dapat the notification kena pergi [ah] i mean if you tak nampak then #bo-pian# [lah] but
they expect you to go
(mm)
[ah]
that's cool
apa dia orang dapat
apa lagi case (err) the community responder was
the this captain from
(err) division #yishun#
habis the this the this captain the the dia dulu macam medical officer
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
habis my my kawan nampak dia tengah belakang was like belakang selalu macam lepak lepak [ah]
then after that dia nampak the captain dia terus [eh] [sia] [lah]
my the the responder is captain [ah] then after that he told us macam
macam take charge of the scenes semua then i was like [eh] [sia] [lah] uar uar [sia] aku give kau lesson engkau buat bodoh [jer] macam tu
so ya
[oh] ya my last
you know my (err) last duty
one of my last few duties [ah] like my previo~ (err) the most recent cycle i also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate [sia] resuscitate the patient dapat we gave like i think three or four shocks
[eh] no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
but the nyonya was quite tua already
then they but the i think it's because
the dia orang [dah] tolong this nyonya out of the toilet then she terus collapse so like right from the mata [ah] then they immediately call
[eh] usually cardiac arrest kalau pagi pagi [kan] it's usually a macam orang baru bangun baru bangun then they jumpa the body then it's like [dah] beberap jam [ah] so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you dapat cardiac arrest
tak boleh save [ah]
ya it's like
pretty much [lah] but most of the time we still try [ah] just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare [ah] unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing c_p_r [lah]
and kena buat c_p_r betul betul [lah] that time apa lagi
(err) my last duty in n_s like my last duty ever kena dapat call the this #ah-pek# he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we sampai and then we saw the doctor there was a doc~ there was a clinic in front of the food court [ah]
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor datang so when we reached the doctor was doing c_p_r then the doctor buat c_p_r you know like got a there's a pace [one] when you do c_p_r it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
to do c_p_r that kind
ya
then doctor buat macam macam jackhammer [sia] don't know [what]
macam begitu then after that macam [eh] pukimak ini apa [sia] ini rabbit [pe] and then after that my paramedic my paramedic tengah jalan
then lepas tu he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
[sia] [lah] dia buat apa [sia] then i was like betul in public k buat betul betul
the doctor the doctor buat c_p_r sembarang then we after that we all like what the fuck [sia] the doctor you know
then he was like like
that's why like tak tahu malu ke like
you fucking terrible at c_p_r until like an n_s_f has to take over you
and like the n_s_f that take over wasn't even me it was like i had to ask my junior to do cause i to set up the other equipment
ya so i asked my junior about the physical
why okay [what] actually last time medic
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew [kan] you will gaduh over who gets to do c_p_r
cause if you do c
everybody wants to do
cause you do c_p_r is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
[ah]
you if you not doing c_p_r means you have to set up all the equipment so you kena letak the l_m_a [lah] the b_v_m set up the o_two set apa
buat the adrenaline kasi the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you buat salah you kelam kabut you don't give it to the paramedic on time kena maki
so like everybody will gaduh over who gets to do c_p_r
except for me i i don't like doing c_p_r so i penat
ya
(err) they started right after i o_r_d
i know my encik was the one who came up with the vehicles [sia] there like that was his project
as in
ya that's true
i think ya tak salah i heard f_m_v they got the thing for macam orang morbidly obese
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
cause the normal the normal alpha sekarang is fucking kecil [sia] like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right i think your time got the box alpha right
(mm) the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also boleh
boleh muat
the new alpha is freaking sempit [sia] like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite sempit already
so i think like the f_m_v
plus the f_m_v dengan the stretcher [kan]
like you don't need to angkat the stretcher like you just picik the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves bodoh tak nak taruh in ambulance when we actually convey patients ke mana yang sedia
rabak [sia]
wait the the guy also a medic [ah] tu
[orh] firefighter
[orh] the~ then turn out for s~
[orh]
ya
actually [ah] the my last cardiac arrest case like bila balik reservist ni we also turn out with f_m_v and then after that i nampak [kan]
so far dia orang asyik suruh the boy yang buat c_p_r then after that yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian [sia]
the firefighting [ah]
so like the so when f_m_v comes the the ambulance crew like tak
like lepas tangan c_p_r so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment [ah] like we put in the apa tubing semua
and then after that so like free up free our hands [lah] so the f_m_v crew yang buat c_p_r
and then after that like i tak pernah nampak anyone wearing orange bunker gear buat so far is selalu the firefighter
like the the green the green one
[ah] [ah]
tak [ah]
t shirt [sia]
what you all turn out pakai bunker gear [pe]
[ah] [ah] ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what i saw also [ah] when i turn out with them
but fun right
tak stress [ah]
(mm)
[eh] wait so were you were you the covering sec com
[oh] then nasib baik [sia] nasib baik ada the fire fight
[orh] so even then like if even if you turn out the p_o will take charge [lah]
[ah] so so if anything like the p_o will take charge of the call [lah]
p_o what
[ah] ya
sekarang it's that's damn short [sia] so dulu dulu during my time [kan] the e_m_t attachment was like two dua tiga tahun begitu
[oh] then
[ah] i see i see
ya
[orh] they want to put people into the
f_m_v [ah]
[eh] but actually now p_l also turn out for
p_l also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity c_p_r or something like that
i don't know what the hell it is [ah] high intensity c_p_r h_i
ya let me google [ah] high intensity
s_c_d_f
high performance high performance c_p_r
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do c_p_r
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance c_p_r to resuscitate a patient
so like basically the whole and then semua turun then after that they take turns doing c_p_r i don't know what the the the protocol is [ah] like i'm sure there's like some
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
apa
make it better
i als~ i also don't know
ya so basically right the the p_l people will do the c_p_r and the alpha people buat the medical staff [lah] the a_e_d semua
that kind of thing but ya
i heard they was like they were starting to do it
quite often relatively often
but then sejak covid then they stopped because they want to limit like exposure or whatever
apa

i i guess i get what you mean [ah] but it's been a long time since i felt that [ah]
[ah] like i never
[a'ah] mampus i o_r~ i o_r_d [loh]
last time i remember they they ask us to download when i was in n_s then they say like it's not compulsory but we highly encourage you to download
then after that i think it was during like our o_r_d talk or something like that
then macam kawan pekik
sir i off duty for what want to go collapse then we were like [sia] [lah] i mean i know everyone was thinking it [ah] but you don't have to say it bro

the only thing
is like we get tested on it like the contract indications and what not

like our our depth of compression the rate of compression that kind of thing
then if you pass then you will get by right supposed to get the cert [ah]

so (um) like recently he talk to me again like i was it was after like my birthday so like he wish me then became like a like a weekly a weekly talk like we we tend to talk macam weekly so like there was more conversations happening [ah]
but then like (um) recently i never i haven't been talking to him but then like i found out from my friend like who's a girl [lah]

that one is not my teman lelaki
that one is my ex [lah] k bekas [lah] sis bekas bekas
okay it's correct yes yes so basically my friend like jumpa dia on like o_k_c [lah] then the best part is my friend my friend match with him to see just to to to have like you know just just match

ex~ exactly exactly then i macam like
i tak i don't understand
he's like
because he already like
he already dah buat like perangai he got buat perangai already last night
he like you want me to change so you want me to change now because he cakap
(uh) i don't think the teacher even care if macam
(um) about presentation or the slide
or the standardisation i don't think the teacher care
the point is he already say
it's important
he alr~ he didn't
he didn't say it's important

takkan your your group presentation you tak buat you nak buat all differently
then after that he
he already mention ni [ah] yang macam all the slides you compile like you you finish already you go and give to one person to compile it
which is one person compile it obviously compile the same thing [what] takkan nak lain-lain
exactly abeh you you know
exactly then you know what you the dia dia boleh bilang i dia cakap (um) that one is not marks okay that one is not marks [lah] the aesthetics is not marks !alamak! i macam nak sebat semalam
i'll i nak lempang dia the yesterday night then after that i just say like i just feel like my like my table is a better
macam
it's a better presentation a way of presentation cause it's very straightforward senang for people to see like even tidak they don't understand there's one thing that they can there's one thing that they can take away from there

(um) i think i want to end the call already cause macam very haprak when i hear that
i very
i very hungry [lah] [eh]
my side recording
five four three two one
okay baik okay let's start the things macam how's things on your weekend
ya i mean tadi ya i had to wait for my wife come back cause she just now in the afternoon you know my my kid dia tidur all the way so my wife ingatkan dia can go to the hairdresser and then just relax kejap [lah]
you know just have a relaxing hair trim (err) hair wash and then go for a relaxing massage and all that (err) because today is the last day of her annual leave of two weeks so she wanted before balik kerja [eh] jadi dia nak
dia nak one whole day just pamper sendiri saja [lah] so let her be and then by the time she came back then like this [ah] just nice also you (err) you also jadi to do all these things ya so k [lor] so everything's all right so far i think it's a peaceful day
(err) while i was also thinking whether we want to discuss regarding our tournament punya benda
you know i think that's one topic you can do because i don't think even if we talk all these [leh] i don't think this (err) all the researchers i think it's okay [lah] to all these to talk about all these things [ah] i don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
[a'ah]
exactly ya ya that's my idea pun i was also thinking about that actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya so ya i also (err) not been discussing my guys (err) all those you know my my my guys who i've been consulting with [lah] (err) those that were in the s_f_l_s semua tu
so dia orang kata you know like is it they worry about that what exactly what you said how what is you know how will we get the sponsors to come when kita takde benda you know like you you there's no real cove [lah]
like everybody knows kita punya reputation tapi takde takde portfolio in this this sort of thing so they will also thinking why not maybe you hold a weekly event dulu
the weekly event and then just nice (err) earlier this week ada there's a league that is there's a new league a one v one that kicked off so dia punya format [eh] sixty four teams or sixty four players thirty percent of registration fee jadi first prize
fifteen percent the registration fee second prize five percent registration fee third prize so kalau kalau all sixty four players masuk dalam
#prizenya# tak banyak it is seriously tak banyak actually so the regist~ total registration fee will be it's ten dollars per person jadi the whole prize pool [eh] baru apa enam ratus six hundred and forty
six hundred forty dollars so thirty percent of that the champion is only gonna get tak sampai dua ratus dua ratus dollar pun tak sampai it's like one ninety one ninety two something like that and only the top three players get and this is supposed to be a league jadi kena main each other for like
(uh) (uh) god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks (err) assuming one game a week [lah]
so that's at least thirty two or sixty four matches jadi a a lot of the the response of the company semua tak nak main it's like [eh] it doesn't make sense ya it's only ten dollars tapi you know like it's nak you you enter that
only top three dapat menang apa-apa and then even the prize will not that great it's that it's not like one k or few hundred dollar it's just like not even dua ratus so banyak orang you know the dia orang tak suka [lah] all this thing [ah] so i was wondering but
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
maybe let's say like of the registration fees [kan] ninety percent these guys only did like not even half [ah] what is thirty plus fifteen plus five that's our forty five percent tak sampai setengah of the total registration fee so why not have we do something like that but for a one weekend thing only
or even one day just have one day saja and then (err) we have like a a what a tournament which we will cast fully we will make everything on our own because we can cast ourselves (err) ya and we can have it as as relax as possible no need to be so (err) what's that called
(um) so serious because we are our own clients apa
so you know there's kita we can just like borak have fun you know and then let the committee come in and then tell them [ah] look this is you guys gonna pay ten dollars okay but the more the more people there are the bigger the the the the prizes
and the winner is not just gonna go back with less than two hundred dollars [ah] because the prize pool we're going to have it like ninety percent we'll just take ten percent of the carts just for our time saja [lah] so even was at six hundred dollars let's say okay let's say we enter it at ten dollar
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per [ah] for the whole tournament [kan] then we take just ten percent that's (uh) between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
i mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour [lah] outside [lah] now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out [lah] but whatever it is at least [eh] the whole tournament (um) one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
i i i entah [eh] i also don't know how many people have resgistered tapi the the response i get banyak orang semua semua kutuk [ah] critics semua kutuk top top white center
now semua kata you know ni apa apa benda what kind of nonsense is this you know buat apa kita main buat apa i mean we play so much habis duit sikit saja then kena main lama lama how many weeks ya [lah] ada better things to do [ah] than to just stay around and play fifa like that for for nothing at all ya
no tak tak tak nampak lain [ah] ada apa [eh] let me see kalau ada league there's a link here ya it's a facebook page
(uh) i drop it in discord
ya so
namanya d to d_e sports league entah siapa i langsung tak pernah dengar aku tak pernah dengar dia orang punya ni tapi ada nine hundred plus members kat dalam
so they have this new league
i don't know how many people have signed up so far
let's see ada tak berapa berapa orang dah sign up tak ni tak nampak pula [eh]
tapi nampak macam masih buka [jer] masih boleh sign up [jer]
(um) i just didn't know
[a'ah] berapa orang
[ah] belum tahu [ah] berapa orang [ah] kat dalam
tapi ya so this is one thing i saw where i noticed somebody's shared this on this (err) whatsapp community group page for fifa in singapore so semua orang kata like
you know the this league not worth it seriously
so there wasn't even any one they say !alah! just go for the fun of biar [jer] langsung takde orang say that semua semua kutuk okay i'll i when i say semua [eh] it's literally there only like three people that response [ah] that responded
yang lain semua you know buat buat tak kisah saja
[ah]
[ah]
en
(mm)
ya
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya this this this d to d thing it's just like a cash grab [ah] dia orang just buat ni benda just (err) make a few posters bilang semua okay [eh] aku ada league [ah] you know you get thirty percent kalau kamu menang you get thirty percent
tapi fifty percent of all the registration fee goes to the creator and they barely have to do anything benda senang i think there's just one guy doing everything it's a good business idea but it's a little bit
macam gray ar~ macam makan makan makan sendiri [ah] makan all the community
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah] exactly exactly ya
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
i'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point [lah] is that so~ social media aspect [lah] so
in terms of like i say getting the players i have no doubt we can get more than fifty players at one go that's that's definitely for sure even if it's just a one off event semua [kan] minimum or i think we can do a (uh) forty a thirty forty players so takde issue langsung [ah]
but (um) the social media aspect of a one off thing [eh]
itu pun susah juga [kan] so i'm so i'm thinking at least kalau kita have a league a weekly league system thing then it will just (err) macam mana kata [eh]
(err)
every week ada content baru that we can we can put in and there's a there's a linking story between each of these different weeks
[ah] ya
ya
[ah]
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and [ah] we we don't have anything on our port~ on our portfolio [eh] how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm) maybe maybe who knows maybe
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
i
actually nak kata possible [eh]
it actually is possible actually because you need okay let's let's take everybody at regis~ once [ah] actually nak kata registration fee selalunya berapa
sepuluh lima
selalunya
[ah] okay all the c_c tournaments then
because they're by community centre budget no problem untuk dia punya wang actually it's free registration dia orang tak payah bayar apa-apa
so it's just my masuk [lah] [kan] but that's for the c_c punya [lah] (um) ya but even then i still believe you know people should pay a nominal amount and also that they will be they will come down and play juga then noticed we won't have so many buys and stuff like that [lah]
tapi for all the c_c events (um) what [ah] who [ah] they don't really need to recoup anything whatsoever they just dia orang just bayar bayar bayar [jer] so takde registration fee takpe juga untuk dia orang ya but for us we add in [lah] as much as we want to we are we are okay with
(uh) how do i say [ah] ya we need a way to pay or displays but but i at the same time i don't want to have a registration fee that's too high and then people will think !alamak! one day registration fee sepuluh ketul and then who knows you know like i play one game and then i'm out
you know so
ya so
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
i'm thinking what we can definitely though okay put it this way (err) let's say registration fee let's say lima ketul [lah] i i can definitely okay
(err) five dollars
five dollars okay i'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know (err) so (err) or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that [ah] we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool [eh] wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off [tau] this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
(mm)
(mm)
ya correct
(uh huh)
betul
ya okay
(uh huh)
ya
(mm)
okay i have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say [eh] we do everything for every
let's say every saturday [lah] [eh] every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event k to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say i can get (err) thirty two players
on average k that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
k we tell them alright we have (um) four four prize winners
each of the prize winners (err) okay and then at least (err) total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright (um)
or we could just put it every every week (err) the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that i i don't know the actual number [lah] k the the hope is that i'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
the more people that join your prize pun naik gila babi
okay [a'ah] and then like this [ah] we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool [lah] basically [lah] alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say [eh] thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
(uh) one hundred sixty dollars time zero point zero five that's eight dollars back you win one match kau dah menang tiga dollar
ya
[ah] duit datang balik [tau] all you need to do is win that first match you going back eight dollar you pay me five dollar win one match i pay you eight dollars back
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that [lah] so let me get up my word pad my notepad [ah] so let's say top sixteen five percent so i six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
[oh] six eight
[dah] eighty percent [eh] [a'ah] [sia] tu dah banyak juga tu
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually [ah] we can't do that maybe top eight [ah] top eight get five percent [lah]
yes
[ah]
ya get a wise five per~ (uh) [eh]
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
soon lepas tu kalau dapat masuk to the semi final top four [ah]
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
(err) so five percent each lima peratus satu orang lima peratus okay naik top four
[ah] kau dapat sepuluh percent [lah] sepuluh peratus [ah]
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent [ah]
correct so you masuk kalau you masuk quarter final sudah dapat five percent you masuk semi final you get ten percent
you masuk final up to fifteen percent
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
(err) mana percent yang
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great [lah] okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
kejap [eh] so that's twenty percent plus okay and then the next four [eh] the next two okay four winners get twenty percent total alright naik four two will drop out now they get ten percent each so that's another twenty percent of the prize pool [dah] removed
k
two were good carry on the second place get fifteen percent the last place get twenty percent all by itself so that two four six seventy five we are still within we are still within (err) apa tu
(um)
ya
correct correct we can even up the champion to thirty percent pun boleh thirty percent of the total prize pool
[eh] of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is [lah] whatever amount
there will really get people to like [eh] !siala! if i can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at [eh] i only pay five dollar registration fee [tau] i get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
[a'ah] correct
matchmaking pun susah [ah] [ah] ya so so that's the thing [ah] then the list (uh) ya uneven
so that's it we need to have at least
(um)
ya [eh] kalau tak some people get a buy then they get their money back [eh] that's not fair juga [eh]
(um)
okay but that's why okay you (um) then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
(mm) (mm)
(mm) true also true also difficult [ah]
(mm)
thirty two fairly i think [eh] no problem senang
senang [ah] senang
sixty four possible
tapi aku tak boleh ganti
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] tu [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
en
(mm)
i have okay like even without all this this new tournament thing [kan] i have a~ another place to pitch our original league idea too but i've been holding it off (um) so that hopefully we can get our own (uh) third party sponsors [ah] takde orang akan kacau kita [lah]
so this idea [eh] is basically if i were to go to n
falls the one that is working with scoga [ah] cause dia pun dah dia sendiri nak buat community events sendiri juga
en
my understanding is that he has his own production punya house or something like that
(err) but i can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under scoga
and i think at this his if we go to him for sponsor or whatever like that [kan] we telling him that [eh] looked operations side kita semua dah settled everything kita dah dah fikir masak-masak and kita boleh you know bawa orang-orang confirm register punya
you know tapi the one problem [kan] that i can see is that if we'll go to him to look for sponsors that is definitely basically is a scoga event or is a scoga sponsored event scoga duit no problem this is definitely their alley they were one more i~ (err) jet ideas
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a fifa market for them [kan] they're all out for it
that is what n #nadesan# has been saying [ah] kalau duit anything with money ke apa [kan] with gaming related scoga budget no problem that sounds scoga can afford kita
his words [lah]
tapi so that's that's the thing [ah] we will be working you know like (uh) together with scoga it won't be our event [eh] technically it will be our event but will have their name on it as well
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
let me
[ah]
let me try and see if i can find (err)
(err) what's that called [lah]
scoga event and see how were they mark~ how they marketed it
semua ya cause ya they have scoga but i remember they also it's it's almost like zenway [lah] actually ya supported by scoga supported by zenway but organised by you know like [ah] people association entah apa community club [lah] sports club
south west c_d_c ni semua so it's it's it feels very zenway like
ya even this (err) apa dia e delta league
(err) basically they're having this league i don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two v two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
i don't know macam mana dia orang nak buat aku pun tak tahu [lah] [eh] tapi organised by singapore police force national crime prevention council
supported by tote board pizza hut blah blah blah venue partner sports up [oh] okay so it's gonna be an offline event [ah] kirakan [ah] kalau venue partner [dah] sports up tapi it's (um) [ah] you know like (um) it's again [ah]
scoga is the one that does the the the operations [ah]
so basically scoga [eh] in my opinion how they've been running all their events [kan] sa~ sama macam zenway sama
it's a it's a carbon copy
dia orang just buat the operations but they already have like sponsors will do all that so let's say we can put our branding there you know besides scoga
so is scoga will have the logo there and then (err) this (err) will have (err) the our
our venture punya logo whatever it is [lah] [eh] we're we're going to call it however going to design it there ya we'll definitely have that (uh) ya but scoga will definitely take a cut is one thing
what i'm afraid of [eh] is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
ya and and that's a thing even i've been talking you know i've been talking to my wife [ah] technically she's the genesis of the initial idea of all these kind of having our own event dia tak suka the idea of kita (um) how to say [ah] handing over the rains to another person
dia nak kita hundred percent seratus peratus ni event kita bukan orang lain punya this is ours have our name over there for and then of this (uh)
you know orang lain tak boleh kacau [ah] senang kata orang lain tak boleh kacau
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that i'm i'm you know i have been thinking of and i've been battling myself about [lah] like
(err) like (um) even when i i told her the idea look [ah] why not (err) we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these [tau] she want us to be on our own
loudmouth partners loudmouth partner kita sure but it's not kita joined loudmouth and we we work under lock mouth
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event [tau]
then they'll be like mana nama kau aku nampak nama scoga [jer] nama kau mana
i said [oh] now we work under scoga mana bukti
kita tak tahu scoga kita tak boleh you know we cannot we have to take you at your word i don't know about that but if kalau kita boleh tunjuk on a poster that has our logo on it
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african [lah]
dia orang tak boleh cakap apa-apa [ah] they there's proof that says we are the ones that take all this we're not we're not the what [ah] (err) we are not not just mere partners or whatever kita tak buat apa-apa but
kita yang run the show
so that's why it's important to have our entity separate we can work together with scoga with [ah] whoever but they have to be partners it's not kita join dia orang we work under their name
that's the number one thing [ah]
yes
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor [lah]
a
[ah]
satu orang kena start dulu [ah] senang kata
[ah]
tu tu yang juga [eh] that
and then why i also tak nak like you i know you you said quite a number of times we're not you know i can put you can put your own money inside semua
tapi there there would seem a little bit of a chip [ah] then when like let's take your scenario you said you know we go to sponsors and then sponsor kata okay so siapa yang sponsor your previous event (uh) and then you say football academy and all that junior football academy
i tengok [eh] ini kau punya company apa
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible (um) you know
the main reason is i don't want if adult person i don't want us to spend money at all [lah] you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also i think it doesn't really help us in this particular
(err) potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
(um)
ya ya correct
a
[ah] [ha] [ha] [ha] tu yang problem juga
(uh huh)
a
but i think i would okay nak kata our community [eh] okay now to think about it objectively the positives that can come if you were the sponsor is that you know like throughout the entire days cast you know like we will have you know like (um)
you will have your own you know shout out [lah] you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in i mean that's the whole point of advertising [ah] a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events [eh] is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they (err) how to say that the
i macam mana nak kata (uh) ada orang kata a lot of times at people sponsor benda [kan] they don't actually get anything much out of it
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer [lah] in a way [lah]
it's the same as t_v advertisement [ah] so i'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
(mm) but i'm okay now i'm okay ya still in my head [eh] i totally agree with what you said i'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that k look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact j_f_a is it j_f_a j~ junior football academy
j_f_s junior apa junior what
football school sorry about that sorry about that so j_f_s okay (err) so j_f_s we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right i spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about j_f_s you know
let's put aside the fact j_f_s it belongs to us [lah] okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a mon~ money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours i was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
(mm)
yup (mm) (mm) (mm)
so
[ha] [ha]
[a'ah] [sia]
!alamak!
!alamak!
okay
okay
i think ya i think in the end tu nak buat sponsor tag [ah] in the end
ya
you know macam mana [eh] i don't even know how to sponsor that looks like i've never seen one before though so i don't know what to base it on
okay
we can actually do that actually if we were to look at because right now dekat facebook [eh] all the videos [kan] it will show how many views ada ada ada rather it will show how many views actually
[ah] what we we won't see total views we won't see how many concurrent views [lah] apa [lah] itu semua tak ada (um) ya even okay right now zenway is live right now sekarang ada berapa orang ni sekarang ada lapan belas orang lagi tengok some mobile legends punya benda
ya but i don't see any total views belum lagi belum lagi total views but let's see if i can load a previous show
previous show berapa [eh] let me see another video
(um)
[ah] v_p_g tapi the problem my my v_p_g midnight punya shows [ah]
there's another
[ah] correct correct so but i can i can load i can load v_p_g one and one play e sports [lah]
one play e sports
one play sports videos the problem with v_p_g semua malam-malam betul [ah] ele~ paling awal pun pukul sebelas tu yang #problemnya#
ada ada orang but it's not that much [ah] okay ya i'm looking here
(mm) v_p_g asia champions league semalam nine hundred views (err) asia pro league which was on midnight five hundred views
pure (err) pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
(mm)
ya the singapore premier league a week ago (err) three point eight k views
one hour juga ni semua one our cast
(mm)
but that was the the very first punya [lah] i mean like it was the first
(err) what's that called
okay e #singa# cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen k the finals is six and a half k views
quarter final seven k
(err) e #singa# cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs [ah]
ramai juga
for the one v one e #singa# cup
one v one e #singa# cup
[oh] they split it into
the whole league
(err) but they split it into different parts [ah] macam part one first two hours ten ten k views
part two another three hours was five point eight k view so it's actually in the thousands [ah] early thousands
you know so ya
quite quite a bit this four v_p_g [lah] but then again [eh] v_p_g e sports ada berapa berapa followers ni v_p_g e sports how many followers
[oh] shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two k
[ah]
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight k followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel (err) you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
i~ #aiman# will help out also and in fact if at all possible i would like to ask iman pun can we stream it on your stream
ya that would that would really help
because [eh] if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just (err) #aiman# giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then (err) what's that called [ah] ya and then like this [ah] people will be alerted
or even better if we can get we can rope #aiman# in as a commentator juga [lah]
ya
exactly
[ah] correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually i i i've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because [ah] i don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
you know i i can we make but then fees and all that [lah] like how [sia] macam mana aku nak you know send prize money it's not that's the only reason why i'm not opening it to outside singaporeans i don't how to send prize money to you
[ah]
jadi kalau kalau if there's a way [eh] for us to go meet #aiman# i'm very sure he will love to work with us and i think kalau kita bilang dia look kita ini kita semua [eh] kita will ini kita punya event we're not getting paid
maybe we need to pay more stuff you know to add on to the prize money [ah] so maybe kalau dia dengar tu [eh] the hope is that he might be able to if he's free on that day firstly because now dia ada banyak banyak event [kan]
jadi kalau kalau [a'ah] [sia] dia banyak events [ah] so i don't know what he was bitching to us about [lah] jadi honestly i was like dude ini it like it [ah] i look i know you're disappointed e piala malaysia of fucking meeting [ah] (err) bullshit i just said [ah] sorry
sorry researchers i didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing i understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
but you are getting lots and lots of quantity [ah] you're winning quantity wise those two guys [eh] other than e piala malaysia apa lain dengan other dia orang takde benda satu benda pun takde benda
[ah] lepas f_o_t
tak tak takde benda [sia] i can't i [ah]
okay i know that (err) see siapa ni matthew [eh] has (uh) has (uh) some malaysian cold wrestling thing or whatever there's a totally separate community it's a totally separate thing dari bola [tau] so you know [ah] [oh] kalau nak kata streaming bola [jer]
dia orang takde benda [sia] decipher lagi takde benda at least matthew involved in that wrestling thing whatever decipher langsung aku tak dengar apa-apa [tau]
so ya so he said [oh] i lost out to them honestly [ah] it's just connections [ah] you lost [tau] on connections [ah] that you just didn't have anybody that's inside whoever's doing this e piala malaysia thing that's the only thing but you're winning in everything else you lost one event so what that's it is just one event
a
ya
(um)
ya not that bad correct correct so i'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
because i know he's been doing singapore events juga
you know and all we want [eh] it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
it's just to tell future potential customers look our our #chapalang# event tak ada sponsor takde apa takde benda
us sepuluh ribu views [tau]
or whatever we can (uh) we can get [lah] we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
[ah] ya so
(mm)
so i maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who #sekaiichi# is [ah] they just look at pure viewership numbers [ah] we can talk about them [eh] we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
you know (err) ya i also can tell it you know [ah] definitely when i when i let know of my community (err) this this affinity whatsapp group semua that's guaranteed a you know a number of views as well
that's no issue get a number of views
ya i can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way i got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
[ah]
the other way is if we go to existing partners like scoga zenway or whatever i i i think of the three that i personally know of which is one place zenway and scoga i think scoga have the best in because (um) and you know really likes to work together with me [lah] basically [lah]
ya but i don't know anybody else in scoga [lah] so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya let's say they're nah ya this is the one major stumbling block kita ada [ah] aku aku pun tak tak takde ideas [ah] apa nak buat like to find my own third party sponsor semua takde idea langsung [ah]
and he's not like any of my friends like have like companies or (err) what [ah] macam macam kau dan aku yang yang my friend #hafiz# the one that's you know that always leaves comments regarding commentary and stuff like that [kan]
dia kerja d_h_l
i broached either to him by [eh] d_h_l nak sponsor kita tak you know this sort of event then kalau kau betul-betul managed to get them in [eh] aku bagi kau you know some some credit or whatever [lah] some kickback [lah] so dia kata d_h_l
won't see anything unless there's a global outrage dia orang tak langsung tak support local which is a lot of ya a lot of companies do that also ya timing also another issue right now a lot of companies are trying to tighten up their purses not spend more
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
okay so
officially [eh] looking at their website [eh] dia kata [ah] they are a youth non profit organisation
kalau nak under official words [ah]
(um) ya they have (err) few initiatives [lah] all this (err) e sports academy campus game fest campus legend so ya (err) and they let see apa lagi dia orang ada [eh] about us
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local e sports in i think ya there will be
(uh) ya so apa ni executive committee
who do they have
nicholas aaron #khoo# macam familiar [jer] nama tu
okay me too ya
[oh] okay (um) sekarang i'm doing like part time (um) kerja part time so macam (um) i do some (um) actually doing financial advisory (um) ya at the same time doing (um) freelance freelance works [ah] ya (um) macam and doing translation works for untuk bahasa melayu to and bahasa indonesia ya
[ah] no no no i'm actually singaporean but last time i had (um) indonesian punya maid so sometimes ya
ya
(uh) ya ya ya so actually (um) like last time my maid selalu (um) talk to me in in bahasa indonesia macam i know how to~ ya how to speak ya (hmm)
sorry
(um) actually it just baru baru start so macam (um) macam just had like briefing then (uh) so far haven't actually do the the translation yet ya
(hmm)
[oh] you you also quit your job ya
i see i see ya
(hmm)
ya i think macam health actually quite important [lah] (um) ya i rasa macam when looking for a job it's important to
look for somethi~ something that actually you would really feel happy macam what's the what's the point what's the point kalau kau pergi kerja everyday then like very stress and this kind of things is very unhealthy [lah] for your good for your health and stuff like that
same [lah] sama sama ya is is i think macam it's quite common gitu to feel that way if like when you're unhappy at the job ya
(um)
dah berapa tahun dah berapa tahun in
you kerja [oh] so baru graduate also
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh]
dari dari
from which from which uni
[oh] sorry sorry from poly is it
okay okay
(hmm)
i see i see
[oh] drama side drama side macam buat apa like day to day like what is it like
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] macam just macam entertainment untuk dia punya budak-budak that kind of thing [lah]
i see i see
(hmm)
okay okay
(hmm) so you're you're you're currently taking a break so your company macam allows you to to to to take breaks in between [lah]
(mm) dia (mm) okay i understand i see ya actually the way you feel is actually quite common [lah] untuk like some some of us yang baru start kerja then like like we didn't had prior experience in or maybe we had internship but it was slightly different so we thought that macam when we graduate the work would be in certain way but actually is not so i guess it's actually like macam is it a mismatch of expectations bila you baru start kerja you thought it would be something else
(hmm)
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm) actually good good that your boss macam i recognize that you you need to take a break then (um) then kalau when you're better than you can always balik go back to work he said you can go back right at least he welcomes you back then that's good ya ya so for me (uh) ya [lah] macam i work for dua tahun then lepas tu (uh) i tried dua company tapi macam (uh) at the same time it felt different tapi macam same like the problem was the same that i that i face at both companies so i also macam tak tahu if it's the industry punya issue or kalau i need to change industry atau change company ya macam that that problem was in my problem was in my head for a while so i decided to macam take a break and then (um) from there i explored different different punya industry and then (um) at the same time i kerja part time then (um) macam trying to at the same time i explore [lah] whether i feel nak stay in this industry or i want to go to something new that kind of thing it's tough [lah] one thing like when we graduate and then we don't know what we want to do forever kind of thing cause ya because your career is you like to decide right macam you want to stay here or move to something else like ya
ya
correct
(mm)
ya at least some more now macam it's covid punya period then then nak nak cari kerja pun macam susah then ya so our options are limited right don't you think
(mm)
it's something better than macam nothing right
(mm)
tu~
ya ya ya i think to be honest macam singaporean man a bit cautious or like became fikir banyak sangat of what people think of us you know right we should just can just do whatever that feels good for you then kalau doesn't it doesn't feel good then i guess it's not good for your health also then you should just do something else i guess ya i'm start i'm starting to like accept that a career doesn't always go the way you want it to go and that's and that's that's okay because not everyone has a perfect career at the start also so macam just take it day by day try something new i guess if if if you want to try something new learn something new sekarang i'm i'm actually i'm studying something about digital marketing with so macam at every ya every setiap pagi i i have to attend the what is it called a webinar ya ya it's for macam tiga jam [jer] then (um) ada assignment then (um) some project ya just learning new things i guess
[oh] the the webinar is actually (uh) era diploma like a full blown diploma so it's enam enam bulan then ya at the same time they are macam giving allowance for it so i guess that's good ya tapi those (hmm) tu actually untuk mid career adults [lah] macam those that ada work experience but you want to try something new so i just just took this opportunity to learn something new [lah] i guess ya
ya
(hmm)
tak payah because everyday macam is just online so we just attend it whenever you want to wherever you are also can on mobile
(hmm)
ya
but how macam mana nak teach the kids if it's working at home i don't understand
[oh] okay okay
(hmm) okay i see i see i see sebab dia what do you feel about on on that that kind of arrangement
(hmm)
okay
[oh]
(hmm)
[oh] that's (hmm)
ya macam overload of things to to do right do you feel
tapi what about the your your other work punya colleagues like do they feel the same way
(hmm)
(hmm)
ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
i see i see
i see
that's true
(hmm) sounds very challenging [lah] macam susah so
ya so macam i told you i took a break from i i totally left my industry at the moment [lah] so i started taking (um) (um) i started joining this financial advisory punya company then dia orang give like trainings (um) to to prepare us [lah] macam how to how to like you know prospect for clients macam how to (um) basically like sell their their products that kind of thing ya so at because i rasa sales punya skill is quite important macam in every industry you go is quite important to be able to sell your ideas or kalau be it ideas or products to anybody [lah] so so i rasa macam it's a good opportunity for for me to learn new skills like sales is not easy right this is what i learn macam susah to macam convince people (um) to actually buy into your idea or buy into whatever it is you are selling ya so it's it's a process [lah] i'm i'm still it's it's been about three months ya so thing ya
(hmm) i macam baru start meeting clients that (um) (uh) there are some (um) pot~ potential potentially potentially that potential clients sorry ya so that one ya will have to follow up on that [ah] ya
so (um) other than that macam i think you what you said about (um) an environment a good environment is quite important to be in a good environment and supportive (um) like make you macam want to go to work everyday that kind of thing you know ya so so far so good i guess tapi macam i haven't actually (um) had a successful sale but hopefully soon ya ya
then thank you then (um) for the ya for the part time work ya i just started because i wanted to macam earn extra income ya ya so it's in a sense macam or even though sekarang i'm like not earning as much as last time i feel like more happy macam ya like i don't bangun tak rasa macam stress or in like angry you know that kind of thing ya like then you go then after work macam you don't feel so fed up like you don't feel like not talking to anybody this macam how i felt [lah] everyday after after work last time like you balik rumah macam tak ada mood to talk ya you just want to like bathe and sleep ya ya
[oh] man ya that feels like me
ya i think it's common like macam i spoke to my kawan my friends dia orang pun macam rasa the same the same thing [lah] ya but those for those that are not happy with their work ya so
(hmm) yes yes yes
(mm)
(mm)
then you got try macam try company company lain tak like because ini your first job [kan]
so g~ you did you like try to apply for different companies see whether macam is different environment that could maybe make you feel differently about the work itself
(hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
but you said you did the conversion
(mmhmm)
i see i see so this is like the conversion thing you're talking about [lah] [oh] okay
(mm)
ya
(hmm)
is it you are supporting financially ke or dia boleh pay for dia punya own things like [oh] is it difficult
(mm)
i see i see okay then i will just i will just talk about myself ya ya ya okay (um) so (um) ya it's really macam it's i think sekarang we're in a very difficult punya position pasal there are many things that we are expected to be able to achieve by now so actually i'm twenty i'm twenty six years old how about you
[oh] you are twenty only [oh] sorry sorry i'm twenty five not twenty six ya so like and ya at at at the same time my my mak and my my dad don't pressure me [lah] like because ya even though i'm already twenty five tapi dia orang macam they know it's not easy [lah] our time to like they said last last time by twenty five dia orang dah kahwin dah ada anak you know that kind of thing but they but they don't macam push that idea on to me that you know that kind of pressure so i think [ah] macam syukur [lah] like i feel quite
not stressed at home which is great [lah] because some people feel stressed at work and at home you know that another thing ya so i'm thankful for that ya i'm thankful for that at least ya
[oh] i know what that means ya
[eh] same same ya
same same
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh]
(mm) i see ya i think macam same my family macam not very affectionate also when growing up what macam don't we don't really communicate face to face with so much
ya i think it's common more common that you think but like at the same time it's not that great not something to be proud of ya ya
(mm)
you ada connections with like theatre punya (um) like people in the theatre industry do you have connections
no time is it like no (hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya i know what you mean actually i'm also seeing someone then i also feel a bit down like but even though even though like i don't really talk about it like ya i do worry about like what what i'm whether i'm doing enough at the moment kind of thing ya so i think is understandable what you feel i've totally get it ya
ya i get it
(mm)
(um) actually macam i just told him i am exploring something new [lah] while because like at the same time also (um) learning like macam tengah belajar new things ya while i take advantage of the trainee trainee not really trainee right it's like a course by s_g united so macam i'm just taking a break it's been about two three months plus ya about almost almost four months
(um)
then i feel i mean because i i don't depend on him for anything [lah] like i can pay for my own things like i ada savings and that kind of thing so i mean he is he's okay with that [lah] like he kind of like supportive i guess ya
but i guess like ada ada like i guess like it's normal to feel not good enough when you're not sure also ya
(mm) ya
[oh]
ya
ya i think macam having colleagues they are so helpful is so great for for any workplace [lah] it's it's quite important to have a supportive your colleagues that you can talk to laugh with that kind of thing macam it you make you look forward to nak pergi kerja you look forward to seeing them
[oh] [oh]
okay
[oh] okay
[oh]
ya #irritatingnya#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
then dia orang dia orang tak bayar o_t (hmm)
[oh] that sucks
(hmm) [oh] you mean the your conversion is is a proper diploma or what like macam mana like how does it work
(hmm)
(hmm)
is it i didn't know
ya and then (um) ya so (um) ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm) so little
[oh] so october is now
so what do you think macam you want to try ke you don't want ke
at the same time (um) i rasa like while we're still young important to save also [lah] saving is quite important ya ya so macam since since i was young [kan] i always believe in saving then macam i am quite thrifty [lah] macam and like macam tak spendthrift sangat so like i made sure to to have enough savings [lah] so that on a rainy day i won't feel the pain so hard ya
ya
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
[oh] but
(hmm) [oh] i thought i thought [oh] okay
tapi you got you got try macam apply to a different company for the sponsorship for early childhood tak
[oh] ya ya that's why you already started already
[oh] but now is the intake right you said october you just check macam apply for fun [lah] like what's what's it there's nothing to lose kalau you apply if anything there's a there's something to gain right (hmm)
[oh] okay okay okay
ya tapi you can just tell her later [kan] like macam that you you're but you're officially left right you said
[oh]
tapi ada notice period tu semua [lah]
[oh] kenapa
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
then kalau kalau you leave you must bayar dia punya six thousand ke tak like it like if you do finally decide
[oh] that's good
tapi macam you don't owe companies anything you know sometimes like if you want to leave you can just leave then kalau tak then we'll go back that kind of thing that you don't have to be trapped feel trapped ya
(hmm)
[oh] so sorry
[oh]
i totally get it get it ya
okay actually i ada kawan yang just started the early childhood she also was from engineering punya field then i think she did the conversion but i don't know whether is it's the same conversion as you
ya so kalau you want you want me to connect you with her i can give you her number that you can talk to her then like find out more about dia punya program how it when cause i think she's been there for she's been there for about three months or something few four months
ya
can later i will give you her number ya then (um)
no worries then then from there maybe you can like decide whether you want to continue or not cause she switch industry totally so dia totally no background in early childhood whatsoever but she wanted to try and she she i think she's okay i'm meeting her next week so hopefully she's okay you can find out from her i will tell her that that that i have a friend who wants to find out more early childhood then can ya then i think it's important to talk to people macam sometimes you feel shy right i am also a shy person so i don't really like asking i don't really asking people for opinions or held that kind of thing it's not macam out of arrogance is just like personality
so ya macam some ya ya ya that feeling what's segan to us just sometimes that feel that way tapi actually it's quite important it's quite important to to to talk to people who already have experience macam whatever you have experience [lah] then you can maybe hopefully get encouragement or like inspiration from this this kind of people ya
then can maybe made you look forward to something better and maybe she can even recommend you to her company you know you never know
ya i would link you i would link you i would link you up later then at least macam [lah] like like after you talk to her then if you realise okay i really don't wanna do early early childhood then you can start looking at other industry [lah] then at least you roll one out
ya
yup i'll text her later i'll text her later than i'll give you her number she's a very nice person ya
can you hear me can you hear me
[oh] i hope our recording is not affected recording is not wifi [kan]
(hmm) ya
[oh] i
okay okay
(hmm) ya
(hmm)
[oh]
okay okay
ya
ya ya she's very nice she's very nice ya
so actually i met her from (um) like a random punya part time job also then macam we got close ya after like a few few weeks ya so then we kept in touch and macam after how many years still keeping in touch which is like as if like we know each other so long ya
so ya macam random it's like a random near two two weeks or three weeks job then after that we still keep in touch so it's quite nice ya
ya okay so maybe hopefully after that it will help you [lah] i just wanted to like try help you a little bit but don't know whether it will help ya
ya
no worries okay
i don't know i think macam i'm i i i before i do things i put a lot of macam thought into it it's not macam a fleeting decision like i was really macam very stressed out at my previous workplace then i was like okay i had enough nowadays i need i need a real break like even even my punya bosses all like understand [lah] like my work was difficult [lah] like i was facing a difficult punya client macam everyday hentam on email kind of thing so it was very stressful ya
so
at the same time macam as in like i said [lah] because i had macam savings to to tide me over a few months of not working so that that's that's important [lah] like like what i'm telling you cause like you're younger right
ya so like
(hmm) important to save [ah]
so that i know like if you do need to take a break you can afford it you know that kind of thing like i know not everyone can afford not everyone can afford to do what i'm doing [lah] ya it's not it's not easy to like especially imagine kalau you ada children or what you know not they they cannot definitely cannot do what i'm doing [lah] like take a break and not work kind of thing
(hmm) so
(hmm)
(hmm)
good for you [lah]
sure
(hmm)
[oh] no
(hmm)
why
[oh] probation [ah] macam sekarang sekarang is probation period is it
tapi dia punya contract what the contract say
then you actually you can demand for that you know
(uh)
no but your contract said you have m_c so actually macam you have like a right to keep fight for it ya and then dia orang tak they didn't write anything about probation right in the contract then actually you can ya if i were you i would have fought
(hmm)
you mean [oh]
that sucks though
(hmm) ya that ya
[oh] ya
you have do you have siblings like you ada kakak or adik like
[oh] only one kakak [lah]
!huh! sorry [oh] see i see okay ya i'm also not tak tak not close to my siblings my elder siblings too pasal dia orang dah marry and then left also like move out ya it's it's common [lah]
(hmm)
so (um) i hope everything will be better for you after you speak to my friend or that or like after you find something that you decide to do part time to like macam sustain you for awhile and not have to think so much about money
ya
yes yes yes i agree ya i agree that (hmm) that is so important macam not many jobs are like that these days in singapore
ya
(hmm)
tapi macam like when you say expressing yourself right i've been to macam cafe where dia punya server is so friendly like dia bother to check up with the the customers like you can always do that like it's it's one form of like expressing yourself like recommending dia punya food you know that kind of thing like little little little little things that you can like say to express yourself like i think think you can't do that if i'm sure you can do that at f&b too
but ya hopefully you find something that makes you happy that's quite as in even if it's not happy doesn't make you unhappy ya
or maybe like if you do need help to like have you consulted like polyclinic to get referral to doctors
[oh] you have already that's good because i have friends who did the same
no what's that
(hmm)
tap~ tapi dia punya fees what about the fees
[oh] that's good
okay have you tried the polyclinic route cause a lot of people do that way i don't know whether it's cheaper
[oh] okay
is it
cannot choose the opinion hospital [leh] cannot choose okay it is one hour you want to stop stop this one do we stop we stop okay

hi kira
what are you doing
i a~ i ask what are you doing
what are you doing bukan how are you doing
[oh] ya i forgot how is your haus kau batuk lagi ke
(mm) cause aku perasan juga like i notice your cough in your (um) videos i notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and (um) and also like when you have kahak li~ in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then i'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not (um) clearing her throat first before she talk
ya i didn't know now i know at that time i was like
kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
k~
[oh] o~ okay [lah]
have you how many times you had to use it so far
susah tak nak pakai tu like how did you know how to use it did you like google it because if it was me i would have to google it
[oh] i think i think i saw that but i think i saw that like lambat
[orh] kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak inhale like deeply [ah]
must be hard because actually now i'm better but i think when i was in school pun i used to have bad coughs yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama
[ah] i used to have to eat a lot of (um) cough medicine but i didn't it didn't get like too bad that i had to go to clinic [lah]
(mm)
i did not know that i think at that time my my sinus was (err) developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my (mm)
symptoms when i'm like having an allergic reaction is that i have a throat i have phelgm
i have kahak so i have a lot of kahak that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so dia macam satu it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
[ah] so macam sekarang ni i can recognize it [lah] when i'm having when i'm having a sinus allergy reaction
macam at that time i think i didn't know cause [ah] before
how do i what
actually (err) is a lot better that i can eat chocolate now the only thing i'm not eating right now is (um) tempeh
(err) roti kicap
i know i know a~ no but ya i think the~ these three yang betul betul i've been avoiding because
(err) at first memang i avoided everything i avoided like #vitagen# #yakult# [lah] yogurt i mean i still don't eat yogurt [ah] apa tapi macam kalau yogurt is in (mm) is like a flavor aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak [lah]
dia is is in at yeast allergy a~ it's like (um) (err) fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast [kan] is a product of fermentation [ah] so macam temp~ tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan because it's like soy bean fermented
(mmhmm)
kicap pun aku tak
[ah]
ya macam tu sebab [lah] is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what i can or cannot eat because macam tu [lah] because (uh) in some kadang-kadang aku makan
tiba-tiba macam ni
(err) apa gatal but actually you know (uh) when i went to clinic my sk~ it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because i just got like new macam active (err) areas yang gatal and everything
and he asked me if i started to eat any vitamins recently and i did i started because before that i had a very bad [ah] episode of sinus punya ni like selsema for like one month
so my dad told me to start (err) drinking yang effervescent tablets tu barakah
so i did and then he ask me i started (err) started drinking that and then he said that [oh] ya it's very bad padahal [kan] i look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains (um) macam yeast ke apa but i guess is one of the by products when they make it
(err) so (err) tapi recently because i at first i memang betul betul jaga my diet and then i notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that i cannot eat kicap because kicap is such a common common thing kalau kau masak [kan]
so dia
ya ya no a~ at that time she's making #nasi goreng# #sambal-sotong# tau like leftover #sambal-sotong# so dia letak [lah] kicap tu sikit just for flavour
and then i was a~ i already ate like one full plate and then she's like #aina# i'm just like but i don't know how i don't remember how but she said that she put kicap and i was like
tapi i was already but you know i can i have medicine to help with the itching so malam tu aku macam aku [dah] ready [lah] untuk makan ubat
but i realised that i didn't react
so at that bad macam is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the gatal pun dia kurang [lah] i can control it so when (err) after that i realise that you know i should try to because it's been
(uh) nine months since i've been to the doctor
so macam i should start
i should start (uh)
trying out food yang i'm not eating
so i s~ i drank like vitagen once and it was okay tapi aku kurang [lah] i don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
[ah] cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti
(err) kicap tempeh yogurt [jer] [lah]
actually supposed to go and see the doctor bulan enam but at that time [kan] i was m_c_o [ah] i couldn't go because clinic tu dekat #tangkak#
ya #tangkak# kat #johor# but it's far [lah]
(mm)
#tangkak#
it's li~
(uh) is like one or two hours
yo~ you know why because j_b is betul betul dekat hujung
betul betul dekat hujung dekat singapore like really is like there
so macam
ya
because especially because my house is (err) dekat #danga-bay# which is
i think [ah] the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
beca~ and then my window is facing the (um) memorial the #sungei# that goes like i can see the boats the fishermen boats ada kelong and then i can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya tapi i'm no~ i didn't go to singapore i've never been to singapore
i used to because when i was younger [kan] (mm) kalau kitaorang balik #johor#
i and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings [kan] dorang semua [dah] ready bawa passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari (um) like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
juice like the drink yes yes
dorang some some [ah] dorang tak produce dorang tak hantar that brand dekat malaysia
at that time [ah]
so they will go there macam is a trip for them and then kitaorang budak-budak would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
ya and then
we'll all be like so jealous !wah! tak dapat ikut pergi singapore and then i realize and i got older and i realised that singapore dengan malaysia takde beza
sama [jer] [kan] sebenarnya
i think i think it's the same also because i grew up in (um) in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
i think is it's gonna be the same
ya it's the same i think ya sama [jer] it's just that you know at that time i was like !wow! singapore
did you (um) see
apa
ya
[ah] that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the memang my family memang suka makan roti kitaorang we can go through like one bantal yang besar tu like two days so now substitute is wraps [lah]
wrap wrap
wrap
(mm) so macam always ada tu or you know like prata yang frozen
[ah] kalau if i go to aeon i will buy the croissant
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
(mm)
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's (err) you wonder that i never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
i think is
croissant
croissant croissant itu memang one of the benda yang paling kelakar
because kau [dah] terbiasa
ya apa
[kan] cousin aku [kan] belajar
why are you not eating
[oh]
tunggu [jer] [lah] lunch is almost lunch time
are you going to cook or [what]
usually kau yang masak ke
[oh] ya ya ya i know she's on medication also
can can
[oh] how old is she
[oh] s_p_m
(mm)
(mm)
(um) i think dia tak not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
(err) routine to have to moisturize and when i say moisturize [kan] it's not it's not just (um) sapu lotion on dry skin you have to be bilas with water first and then you have to pat dry and then baru you lotion because then baru dia ada moisture
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] ya ya tapi macam you know if i if i mandi awhile like
seven or eight and then i sleep at twelve before i sleep i will just
wear it bilas and then i put lotion and then is very effective kalau you moisturize it overnight
[ah] ya
[ah]
dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga that's why you know when i was
(mm)
(mm) but when i was younger and it was bad memang my mom would paksa
like
if she caught me
(err) because sometimes it hurts tau untuk mandi cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
shower
to make sure that i properly (err) you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat (um) olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so macam masa tu [kan] i
[ah] tak tak
yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia powder tapi dia dalam capsule
[ah] and then [eh] that time i cannot i couldn't eat pills i couldn't swallow pills pasal kau tahu (uh) sampai menangis like i tried to eat it until i cried
and then (err) i gave up you know what i did
i open the capsule onto a spoon lepastu aku makan
it's disgusting tapi
(mm)
[oh] your your cough medication is too much
kau makan ubat
okay [lah] [kan] maybe
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know potong tiga ke to get used to it instead of cons~ makan powder [jer]
(hmm)
[ah] you need to take your time [lah]
(mm) have you have you done the l_i portal
tapi dia macam faulty [lah]
can jap i give you the link cause i just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like (uh) after i register tak boleh nak log in pun
tak tahu [lah] dia punya website dia macam faulty tu yang si #nai# cakap semalam dengan doctor john
[ah] you when you register to use your apa e_m_s punya account
(mm)
try [lah] nanti apa i think they need to (um) solve on their site before they do before you can log in
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
do you know
other than aquaria or you know i did go to aquaria
(mm)
i get it i get it [lah] but thing is kat k_k you need like a car
[ah] to go to work
[ah] tu [jer] [lah] i think that's that's really the only macam problem that i have
(mm)
but
[ah] itu [jer] [lah] tak banyak pun tapi they haven't responded to my email
aku dia ada dia ada dia macam (err) inquiry box dekat website tu
[ah] so i i left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive (um) interns undergraduate internship pro~ apa ya program
tapi dorang tak reply maybe i need to email them directly
(mm)
ya actually i i agree dorang punya one of the malaysia punya government or any authorities when punya weak link weak point is that dorang punya website is very poorly handle
[kan]
because because i think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
[ah] bukan tak pandai they don't see the need
[ah] macam kita [kan] apa-apa pun kita akan website dulu [ah] website website
so tapi aku cari [lah] kat #johor# kat #johor# pun banyak juga
more opportunity banyak tempat but it's definitely gonna be far from my house [lah]
tapi okay [lah] as long as you know
[ah] ya
yes apa ni apa aku cakap [oh] when i was in second year
i did go to aquaria [kan] aku pergi dengan #shikin#
and i saw (um) some of the stuff dia tengah macam recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
macam like writing on the clipboard so aku tanya dia aku tanya dia (uh) kalau apa dorang ambil aquaria ni ambil intern ke lepastu dia kata dia pun intern
[ah]
dia cakap apa lagi
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya and then she said that (uh) apa i ask [lah] yang selalunya yang feeding [kan] yang diving and feeding tu dia kata anyone that has a diving license boleh i'm like [ah]
(mm)
[ah] tu [lah] i wonder also
(mm)
o~ it's hard
jauh ke dari rumah kau
jauh [lah] tapi it's either you have a long commute atau you sewa rumah dekat situ [lah] sewa bilik
(mm) actually actually
kau tahu tak #fasha# #fasha# nak buat intern kat #johor#
sebab (uh) ya [lah] but she wants to be close with #shami# dia nak jumpa [lah]
so this so kita orang macam [dah] pernah cakap sebelum ni that if she gets an internship in #johor# i would i mean if we get in the around same area
we would rent a place together [ah]
(mm) but don't know [lah]
[ha] mari mari tapi #johor# ni [kan] besar so we don't know [lah]
(mm) (mm) tak tahu kat mana tu [jer] [ah] when i think that
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
macam is i'm so scared
ye tak pasti macam
i saw because i se~ did see my brother going through his internship pun susah gila nak cari no no company would want
(mm) tapi
tak nak bayar
tapi i did see some private companies yang bagi internship not bad [lah]
i think you just have to find the right one
#wei# you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer [lah]
[oh] [ah]
i~ takde i'm trying to find material for my f_y_p tapi
i don't know if i can just use the paper that my supervisor bagi like
you know did i explain to you my new title
dia dia [kan] my old title was combining water quality dengan (uh) macromentoes
so i did my field work tapi since we cannot go to the lab
i'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
(uh) the data is from the paper that he published
dia [dah] published [dah] tapi dia co author [jer] dia bukan the main author doctor #chan# lepastu dia ada data dekat tempat yang sama of macromentoes so aku kena analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper punya data
yes
so
for my and i'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should i find more or should i just use
dia punya paper as a reference for my water quality part
(um) i think i have a i think i have an idea of how to do it [lah] tapi you know [ha] i actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
ya
i also agree about the reading part
macam aku aku try the system where when i read i highlight the paragraph
pastu i go back to it and then aku akan copy paste for the whole paragraph i go i put it in my word document
pastu i try to retype it
in a different way
tapi sometimes it becomes macam disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad tapi tu [lah] gunanya supervisor
(mm) so far so far my progress is very little
tha~
are we the same
are we the same
[oh] laju kali ni supervisor kau laju
last sem
last sem aku rasa macam supervisor aku [jer] yang asik minta ya your supervisor was so quiet
i think [kan] i think she knows (uh) means she learn from last sem
sebab haritu [kan] kitaorang ada meeting mentor mentee [kan] dengan doctor #chan#
and then he said that (um) #farid# ask how we how did we do as a class
uhh macam on the our f_y_p presentation dia cakap
the examiners all are impressed dengan kita punya presentation
pasal our presentation wise we are all macam mantul tapi when it comes to the writing
[ah] writing kita ada macam slack
(mm) i think it's a bit be~ it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
(mm)
i think must me and my feelings pun macam gitu macam
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
(mm) sometimes aku rasa macam [oh] my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it tapi sebenarnya okay [jer]
tak
(mm)
no but you know [lah] how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
(mm) ther~ i think
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer yang (uh)
the opposite
y~ because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
[ah] and tapi aku rasa macam my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions dorang akan jawab
cause i i've had experience with it before because i did ask stupid questions ya [lah] sebab kita nak tahu [kan] we i'm i was scared of doing the wrong thing when i was going on my field trip
make sense (mm)
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
(hmm)
[ah] memalukan like you feel embarrassed
did you hear about the girl
yang dekat #terengganu# [eh]
did you hear about the girl kat #terengganu#
[ah] yang kawan [ah]
#wei# tu gila [dah]
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
(mm)
maksudnya
ye lepas lepastu dia boleh whatsapp lagi macam acting as if like nothing
macam
[eh] bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke
(mm)
(mm) macam ramai [kan] orang punya story macam banyak version
kesian [dah] like
imagine imagine the dad
wife [dah] [lah] sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang first [kan]
but it's so sad [lah] tapi memang
apa
ada video evidence [kan] that she entered the house
(mm) dengan apa i think like hair in her hand
(mm)
tak boleh log in [kan]
[dah] tu [lah] i think you just wait [ah] because think somewhat tak boleh tak boleh
i think someone did text the yang apa doctor jaga situ puan puan #lin# [eh]
(mm) we just have to wait and see
adoi
(mm)
apa dia
no if my mum is around i don't cook
(mm)
aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh [jer]
i do the after part
(mm)
[kan] dia macam semak
[orh] dia panggil okay [ah]
i think my m~
my mum doesn't ask us to help kalau dia tengah masak
[ah] macam after tu i usually just go and see [lah] tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta [lah] minta tolong
excuse me
aku pun tapi aku kurang [lah] because aku [kan] tengok drama yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat netflix
so macam is a lot of more steps to
to watch it tapi sebab you know k drama they are so long
macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ for an hour to watch it
actually that's why that's why it
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
i didn't watch that because i saw a lot of people punya comments
but i think the k drama yang i watched that had a lot of (err) long episodes was prison playbook
itu [kan] i don't usually watch (uh) slice of life punya drama
i usually watch macam investigative atau medical tapi somehow prison playbook ni
(err) [ah] best
it's interesting and dia kelakar
dia cam just a nice balance of kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar more kelakar than sedih
best tapi tu [lah] ada episode dia yang one one and a half hours
lama
ya #wei#
ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa [dah] lama [dah]
sebab you know i'm used to watching (um) english
english punya series english punya series paling lama pun like forty minutes [jer]
and then kalau comedy kalau comedy tu
lagi [lah] twenty minutes twenty minutes [jer]
you know what i grew up on was (um) how i met your mother
that's where i really like pick up on spoken english because i used to read a lot tapi macam tak bercakap [lah] [kan]
so when i watched it i pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references macam inside jokes
pastu
ya [dah] you know masa tu [kan] dia kat dalam dia kat channel hallmark
kot
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode baru
so macam my mum was (um) was very strict with this about bed times [ah] usually macam ten tu we're ready to go to sleep
so we only me and my sister [lah] my oldest sister kitaorang akan sneak out untuk tengok t_v
pastu kalau
i don't know [ah] sometimes dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar [jer]
i think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know biar [jer] [lah] macam
let us get away because sometimes kita kena belajar [lah] to be
you know have to break the rules
especially because kitaorang [kan] ramai there's like six of us
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so i think both of them they were like
[ah] benda macam ni is like a small thing let it go [lah]
i used to macam tu [lah] my sister and i would break (um) bed time
a lot sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok t_v
baca buku yang i don't know time at first it was bagus you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot kalau kitaorang pergi big bad wolf or sale yang like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to simpan and then the worst part is that we have books yang we haven't read but we want to buy new
tapi
[ah] banyak [jer] sampai sekarang tak baca
tapi my mom [dah] simpan semua buku dekat my grandma's house punya store so kalau nak cari balik kena cari dalam store tu but i read books on my phone now
exactly you just download the the book the e book
#wei# kau nak dengar tak aku punya mimpi yang paling aku ingat sekarang dan paling merepek
ya my my mom [eh] my parents have this friend
anak dia pun ramai tau anak dia like wait [eh] one five or six tapi semua boys
and then
(uh) the oldest one it's like us around the same age [lah] cuma the last one the last one beza dengan the second last one was like twelve years or something like that
(uh) the last one is still is still young still a child still a kid like primary school but the second youngest is our age i think so dorang handsome tau
[oh] no i'm so embarrassed
pernah aku pernah mimpi i was marrying marrying one of them but but it's not
it's not any of the siblings is another sibling
that's like doesn't exist
ya this is this is is my dream but i often memang get (err)
often memang get a really bad not really bad not bad dreams but they just like very weird dreams because
i think because my brain doesn't really shut down
tidur pun fikir
ye ke
aku jarang
aku jarang tak mimpi then
like i do get recurring dream
yang macam banyak kali one of it i can remember is that daripada aku dulu daripada aku kecil tau masa aku [dah] pandai drive lagi i always dream
that i'm driving in my family's car like the #estima#
and i don't know how to drive
but i'm really
that's like daripada dulu lagi i've been having that that one specific dream
sampai i can imagine it now
tapi a~ actually i
i think it's interesting tapi most of the time
after i wake up
i don't really remember unless i betul betul put in effort untuk remember i won't remember
ya and then actually the the thing that i remember is the feeling of the dream
[ah] i will that's why sometimes i wake up and i'm in a bad mood is because i had a dream yang
made me [ah] macam you know it's a bad feeling
but i don't remember what the dream was about
that happens a lot to me
(mm)
for
[oh] i_c_c_m
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
apa yang what was
what was your worst case scenario
you are in a group with who
[oh]
good news is we are in the same group
bad news is the other people in the group
are the last people i want to choose
i don't know i don't know why we are in our last semester tapi our lecturer wants to

(mm) (mm) tu [lah]
sabar [jer] [lah]

so i asked my mom if it's still (uh) m_c_o is still like enforce at that time and tak boleh nak buat tak boleh nak buat kenduri
how
my mum said nikah [jer] [lah] dulu and then kenduri we can think about it later
i cannot imagine [ah]

(mm) (mm)
ya tapi dorang [dah] ada [lah] dewan apa semua they have already corresponded dengan that person for now they are planning as if there's gonna be an actual wedding
reception
(mm)
so we will see [lah] but i cannot imagine my sister being married
aku rasa but but because
(err) we know the guy we are friendly with him ya i used to do it with him so aku rasa macam i don't feel like
[ah] apa i don't feel like i'm losing her [lah] sangat
[ah] so
[ah] and then he's nice i mean we argue a lot tapi kitaorang gaduh manja manja [jer] because i think we have the same like almost similar personality
[ah] it's like we are both the opinionated and then kitaorang memang minat benda yang sama like we
we watch the same things
apa semua so i can talk to him [lah] about and he's very friendly even to my family
(mm) casually talk to him so it's nice tapi macam you know my sister getting married

[ah] my young~ my older sister is the oldest the first one
then i have two brothers and then i have another two sisters

the last one tu supposed to be lelaki but
keluar perempuan so dia tak balance
but i'm grateful because i am right now macam paling rapat with my younger sister
even though we have like six years difference between us
doesn't feel like six years
because you know being the youngest she matures a lot more than kitaorang
(mm)
form four lepastu tak tak matrix

i don't know i miss them cause [dah] lama tak jumpa
but she's very active and like she will she's like trying to walk here and there every day everywhere and then she likes to eat
she eats
best dia makan semua benda especially fruits
dia basically kau suap apa pun dia buka mulut
and then kalau macam my sister duduk atas kerusi [kan] pastu dia kat bawah and she's like she's standing then my sister holding a fruit and then dia akan tries so hard untuk panjat my sister's legs
and then her mouth will be [ah] please give me some
comel gila

(mm)
hi
my name is #intan# and this is weird
okay i guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe entah bah
wait wait wait so kirakan like you land in singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like (err)
later on like the when the government give like the government (um) announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give (uh) you
ya we top we we top the rank [ah] isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases tu [lah] pasti
okay well
well as you know [lah] [kan] i came back in january as in like i think by the time it was mid january (um) there were already like
if i'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially i think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of january i think that was when the report (uh) singapore reported their first case
but by that time (um) we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like kita pergi #bangkok# for like satu minggu holiday
even though like you know there were threats of (um) like you know this unknown virus being spread around [lah] tapi
like we didn't care so (err) after that when (err) jan no actually when february rolled by we had a bigger trip
we went to japan habis habis lepas tu was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but (err) my my boyfriend was like the most #kiasu# of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most #kiasu# and he was very irritating
dia pakai dia the kind macam dia pakai mask
and then is like he just insist [ah] right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
habis like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a met~ (uh) metal tube with like hundreds of (um) other people like he will refuse to wear dia punya mask and i'm like
aku tak faham so anyway
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know #tokyo# is near
yok~ #yokohama# no is it is it near i mean like (err) there there are lots
of like i mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in #tokyo# [lah] so
(err) we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like (err) luckily we came back right before when (err) singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other l_os and (um) l_o_as and whatever
sorry so ya begitu [lah] but ya then after that it's like (err)
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
(uh) they took unpaid leave and then after that (err) i i i tanya dia orang [lah] like [eh] so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on (err) what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then dorang cakap macam [eh] kau lucky [sia] kau (um) (um) you left at a very good time and then i'm like
ya but i didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
but ya macam begitu [ah] and (err) like you i'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is i'm studying
so i can balance i can juggle my life with (err) studies i can keep my time occupied [eh] and like you know just do my stuff
you do you remember that (um) the viral video that fiasco the whole #ateeqah-mazlan# punya benda that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay i mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like macam padanlah muka dia
cause it's like i know i know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up siapa h_d_b is it or something is it h_d_b i can't remember
ya habis tu apa macam like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them dia macam nak dia berniat nak
dia i think i think her niat is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place (um) apa [eh]
(uh) like the current regulations that are in place (mm) related to home based business begitu
tak satisfy is like an understatement because dorang i mean like you know like melayu punya backlash is like next level dorang macam like [oh] (err)
(err) dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup
[kan] as in what do they say (uh) they said something about like (err) nak tutupkan (err) nak kacau periuk [ah]
periuk nasi orang something like that i don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi so funny
okay i mean i feel bad for laughing at her because i kind of know her [lah] but as in like the fact is that like stupid [sia] you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible p_r
okay i did not think that it was our good friend #hadi# pasal si
[oh] my god stereotype [sia]
that's another unwanted
of course [lah] i mean like it it i mean he is an unsung hero i mean like during the whole like during covid [eh] sorry during c_b it's like people will stuck at home okay lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan [kan]
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum macam frus
then after that she was like (err) even at times at times we we i suggest [lah] okay i say nevermind [lah] mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so i guess if even until now also
dia orang masih kerja like you know i mean they are adjusted out there you know i mean like more than (uh) more than ever and like
it's still a kerja [ah] kerja tu kerja [lah] but like you know
they should be acknowledged as well i feel
ya
it's true like you know i as in i'm not sure if you watched the the national day segment i mean like i only watched it for like a few hours
because it's like i had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some macam
i won't say personalities like they i mean they picked (err) they they featured some characters like you know (um) everyday singaporeans and everything
(um) like so~ i think one of them was about like (uh) a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to (uh) the needy [lah] basically and (uh) you know they they feature all these individuals but
if i'm not mistaken or maybe you know i did not watch the whole thing but they did not (err) feature
food deliverer (uh) like you know food delivery people riders
so i mean they they they they how to say they lauded like (um) healthcare workers which they should but i guess there are more people out there who deserve
(err) like you know like for example they they do a featu~ they did a feature on like the n_t_u_c (uh) cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
the apa tu barang barang for the (err) how do you say the the items for the supermarket [kan]
that there was a there was a segment on that but i think there as in like maybe like
how how long is that show two hours is like dua jam i don't think you can like squeeze everything together [lah]
[oh] really
[oh] it wasn't cheap
(mmhmm) but i think that
i don't know as in like the i think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very i won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
highly taxing job for example [kan] macam like in a family a a low income family of like for example dia punya anak dia (err) anak dia special needs kid
habis lepas tu the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older habis dorang tak ada they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
(um) you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in i mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like (um) not considered
people who are en~ like who are eligible for like macam help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular (um) in~ like income ceiling for example and then after that like macam (err)
how do you say this i need to gather my thoughts cause it's like (err) very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that i put quite
a lot of thought in it but i just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like macam you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
[eh] what
but in order to in order to get
(mm)
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right i if i'm not mistaken like grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
so is like ya i don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so macam i guess
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
well not really as in like i i at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen april right so it was a interesting time for me like (err) because (err) apa
right school
so like school as usually i have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that (um) like
(err) the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading (err) (um) like how do you say the community cases in in in singapore started increasing
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very leceh pasal like you know because
there were at least macam twenty people in the class then after that like (err) we
(err) our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking [lah] like [eh] so how [ah] you think that next year [ah] no sorry next sem which is like in a month (um)
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so macam kita very move very fomo
so so (um)
(err) we we were like somehow like quite happy that (uh) we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know zoom
then (err) then we we tested out the zoom (err) interface then it of like sucked [lah] because it's like you know zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then (err) we had exams
and this was the very funny part so kita orang punya exams we  kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one [eh] apa [eh]
what is that module i took i forgot [oh] (uh) it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
we were revising and basically we were revising based on (err) what the exam usually entails [lah] macam like
like like ada m_c_q ada open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sit~ sitting for the exams then covid happened
so basically we were stuck at home so (err) like the school has to think about something
(err) so that time nak like in the end we for the first time in my life actually i did an online exam can you imagine back in when i was working [ah]
for like all those four years i never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
(uh) there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book tapi kita orang macam like
[eh] get real [lah] kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan you know go on whatsapp lepas tu kita text [eh] kau tahu tak what's this what's the answer for this but in
tak ada tak ada
so it's like (um) basically we were (err) there are there are like three different kinds of exam so macam like open task
so this open task (err) is like
a forty eight hour it opens like (uh) forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then (err) it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like (err) by one thirty a_m on
let me see saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
so macam like we get on we we all got go online lepas tu we all sit down together
buka tu link duduk for two hours ku duduk situ
kau buat tu (err) exam just like a normal exam tapi (err) ni in the comfort of your own home  begitu
well nothing because okay for that macam the time exam [kan] the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two i think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on [lah]
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me [ah] i personally i rather do myself [ah] because i know i can do it
so it's like it's the thing where i mean like ada forty eight hours exam that i had recently it was like
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a p_r assignment so basically i had to do (err)
p_r stuff !hais! like i prepared f_a_q questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and i have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then i was like
[ha] you memang betik
usually it's twenty five marks and i spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours i cannot
deal but i finished it in like less
i did i did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why i went back to school anyways is not because i want i mean isn't that at some point in my life i want to [lah] as in like you know when i left
when i left (err) when i graduated from poly i did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
[eh] thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and i wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause i was so fucking playful [ah] sorry
i was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like i can't i don't think i could have like continued my studies then so i went out to work [lah]
i enjoyed my life met so many peo~ many different people habis lepas tu like now (err) bila i'm like more settled a little in life sort of
i decided to go back to school to get that degree and [oh] my god the characters i have to deal with
is like is like
there have
i do not no i really
(mmhmm)
(ugh) i'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project i mean like whatever that i'm doing now is no different than what i was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when i was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive [lah] i really enjoyed my poly life even though i kind of like played around a lot
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now pasal like (err) how to say this like (um) i'm much older than i was obviously
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up [lah] you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again i don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that i have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the (err) that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like i am more focus i guess i mean like you know like kids right
i totally get it [lah] okay like my my classmates [ah] my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
dia pandai tahu dia pandai she graduated from mass comm [eh] no she graduated from advertising
#ngee-ann# similar course tapi dia punya dia punya
distracted tak tak boleh tahan so i had a project before just like macam like maybe two weeks ago ya so dia sibuk dengan dia punya boyfriend punya birthday
habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam you know it's a group work
so nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk and then discuss lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa in a powerpoint
presentation nak kena prepare pasal kita orang ada presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that kita kena buat like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
so because i know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides i have nothing better to do in my life [kan]
i said to her okay you know what aku buat aku buat yang lit review punya part lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like macam kita orang punya (um) information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report itu pun dia tak boleh buat
and
the fact the fact is like i ain't going to do that but as in like okay so dia boleh
dia boleh [lah] pergi mana mana like dia punya boyfriend dia punya twenty third birthday dia pergi prepare all the apa tu
gifts for him bagai can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
because is like even though when i was working tak ada chance my boyfriend has ever going to get x number of presents however old he is from me
[eh]
itu part time just
i really i really salute them for that because i cannot do that
i
no man i like my sleep i enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay [lah] i i don't think my my (err) my lecturer's gonna hear this i'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
we are online (uh) we doing online lessons right now [kan] so like half the time kita
(um) kita log-on like at 9 o'clock
in the morning and then after that you are on i'm still on my bed and then i'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture (uh) eleven (uh) sorry in on monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and leceh gila then i was like (err)
tak nak [ah] malas [ah] but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks (um)
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically i know from nine to nine thirty at least i can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that i have to turn on my mic and talk
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know i'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that duduk dekat atas meja [lah] and do my work
and then !huh!
shut up ya anyway so i mean like i'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time (err) by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty i will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently i'm not the only one who does that [lah] so sometimes like and i i i mean like i am
for some reason like that class i made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on (err) in real life you know we haven't seen i haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
this semester so i macam like to be able to connect with them in a level (err) i mean like online everything is very cool
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
apa punya
that
yes it is a word i think
i'm the complete opposite of you like i really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so i sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time i only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free [eh] (uh huh)
(mm)
as in this particular food panda thing dia punya promo [jer] daripada dulu ke baru sekarang baru saja as in like (err)
no because
no no no like period~ like periodically right periodically (um) (err) grab host like have this like (err) promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer (um) a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then [oh] no sorry the most recent one i think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
(uh) the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so (err) ya
and then (err) so isn't like basically is this was this (uh) service available on (err) foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course [lah] because now everybody can go out already [what]
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months
ya no know you know #nurul# is (err) #nurul# has been working her butt off all through circuit breaker until now
ya
if russia if russia produced i mean if that vaccine claim by russia is proven effective then maybe we have
we wait wait shorter [lah] there goes my korea trip at the end of the year
entah [lah]
we will see whether it works or not but ya like i said let me reiterate this point i said that i'm going to misses i'm gonna have to cancel my trip at the end of the year
how many vacations did you go on this year
i went three times okay minus the fact that i came back from #doha#
[ha] apa
ya but february we are still gooing out to japan and then after that is like
ya
i think we went to [oh] ya we went we went to j_b once in march
no no no no i can't remember when (err) no it wasn't it was before way before like the part
i think it was one week before singapore said that whoever who left overseas have to go undergo like quarantine or whatever
salah
kita boleh pergi [pe] sen~ #sentosa-island# or like pulau ubin ke pulau hantu ke like our friend went to pulau hantu [what] recently
fernando
itu itu next level i was
i know but he she he was so antsy to leave the house like whatever it takes
i swear to god but whatever is it up i think it's up
okay three more minutes of talking shit
wait
you are not young anymore you know this is not like ten years ago
this is not ten years ago already okay hello i remembered when we were it was ten years ago we we used to sit
like for hours doing nothing and doing crap on on internet
ya [oh] shut up
kejap now is like almost two o'clock ya i what's what's classes what are classes
ya i'm i'm going for a class that i'm paying for so thank you very much and it's my holidays now so i'm chilling

[eh] thirty plus dollars compared to my twenty five thousand dollars is nothing okay diam sudah diam
thumbs up
i don't have a loan i didn't take a loan
i'm gonna get mine like next year and i still don't have a loan
!huh! how how how many years have you been working already
how many years have you been working
i won i won
i don't i don't know how many
(mm)
no tak payah [lah] just stop [jer]
i don't know (ugh) i i don't have access to the the whatsapp right now kejap [eh]
ya got it already
(err) finish my practicum !yay! (um) i think semalam
technically
i complete four hundred hours [lah] around wednesday but i stretch over
cause i macam like you know
i took half day half day
[ah]
ya !alamak!
(mm) two and a half months around there
ya ya i just need to complete four hundred hours
true true then macam how to say [ah]
like was just getting into like the hang of it then after that like
#kobe#
i don't know
(uh) it's not project (um) it's just basically more case management
(uh) so macam
in a way macam same thing as (um)
what i did [lah] for my previous job
(uh) so macam meet client then (um) got assessment then lepas itu
we do [lah] same around the same [lah] it's more intense cause
(err) it's residential areas so it residential institut~ not institution [lah]
then macam apa itu my office is literally macam just beside the units where they live so macam kalau dia orang nak apa-apa then they will come over knock on the door but it's not twenty four seven [lah]
[ah]
i don't know if i want to say
okay [lah]
i don't know
ya [lah] okay [lah] existing cases tapi macam apa itu
because sekarang macam buat split teams [kan] then it's like there's two offices we're like we're not supposed to cross then we handle macam cuma two units each [lah] so kita punya outside unfortunately macam banyak
(err) like we face shortage of manpower [lah] macam cause (um) this the (err)
cannot remember her title but the my supervisor she's actually she's in charge of two programs [lah] macam two services so dia kesian gila [lah] like she has to run back and f~ like she has to toggle between both
and at that time bila phase two right she couldn't meet the other program so she has to run everything at
the (um) from the office my my office there [lah] so
so (uh) so then macam then she also has to handle the clients [kan] the office the the program that i am in and then the other program she (err) she also has to attend to the matters there [lah] so macam double work
[ah] so she kesian [ah]
[ah]
then baru sahaja recently another staff left ya cause
it's not pasal itu [lah] like i think we don't want to take up social work then like there's just no one else to go
so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out i think corporate world so leave it be [lah]
ya
i think so
i think so not too sure
okay [lah]
but ya
but i don't know [lah] kalau macam
(err) yesterday i meet up with the (um) e_d [lah] then dia tanya i like kalau do you prefer to are you okay to work
she added [lah] if i want to come to the company and work then macam i don't know what program [lah] ada satu program ini dia !hey! just started up their office is in #simei# which is like great [lah] macam very near my house
finally somewhere i go is near my house
i realised my tempat kerja dan tempat semua macam jauh gila ya
like at least at least [ah] fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
(um) not
full time [lah] macam (err) how to say [ah] they ask me to apply tapi macam a bit weird [lah] macam i was telling one of the colleague macam the colleague there [lah] the staff there there was like
i apply right then i turn up at the interview
then (uh) what macam (um) so weird cause they already asked me a lot of questions and they already know me
and then i think the e_d (uh) my my (um) the staff there cakap (uh) the e_d is the one you are interview [lah]
then macam like so weird the e_d is actually my technically my supervisor [lah] then then she on the first day i came in for my macam meet up session dengan dia and my reporting officer
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
sampai padahal they just want to get to know me better [lah]
so cute [ah] then she ask me [lah] macam like you can go this option this option then apa itu
(um) then she ask me if i want to continue working [lah] at the same place yang i buat internship itu then i macam (err) not sure [lah] like a bit too far [lah] but
i guess it makes sense [lah] for me to macam continue there cause i know the staff there i know like half the clients there
then macam in terms of macam you know blend in with the team gitu like they know it's going to work
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya ya no issues [lah] ya i think
i think internally adalah macam issue sikit [lah] cause dia dah macam cause ada change [kan] so macam the difference in (mm) apa power dynamics i guess much macam (mm)
my the reporting officer she's actually supposed to be macam less
(err) hands on but i think because of the split teams and everything and then she couldn't meet with the other program [kan] so macam dia (um) just suppose head of the homes is actually macam a bit restricted [lah]
!haiya! he's like he's the one yang actually main person to do the homes and everything but because (um) the assistant
ya she's the assistant director then she is there and then macam like dia dah lama dengan kita [lah] she already do this kind of this job so macam when she comes in and station [kan] the office gitu [kan] so (err) i think he feels a bit restricted [lah]
ya ya can tell sikit [lah]
macam i think dia macam like some of the things he didn't agreed with and then macam cause he got his own way of doing things then macam like he doesn't think that we should do this but (err) in a way
i would say that she overrides him
(uh) then macam like ya then macam at the end of the day macam like i dengar two things [ah] like i think dia pun macam segan and come up to me and then talk to me about certain things and then i macam (uh) then macam at the end of the day dia cakap [lah] like i'm not trying to supervise you
but (um) this is how it's going to work [lah] this is how i we used to do it [lah] so macam i macam caught in [tau]
ya ya i know
so like (uh) macam am i talking too much
ya macam like this client he came back from hospital then dia pakai taxi then he kept asking [lah]
lepas itu (err) i want to
(err) be refunded by for my cab then apa itu dia cakap
(err) [oh] last time
(err) the assistant director did this (err) blah blah blah and then she always say if i need help can come and ask [ah] then
apa itu i put in a group chat [lah] where everyone can read and then the assistant director said
(um) ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in [lah]
so then after i (uh) i got the message then the head of the homes came and then cakap [lah] like okay this is for to build independence why does he not have enough money to pay for a cab fare then i macam like what what is going on
ya
ya and then macam like it felt weird like macam apa
like dia orang punya procedure in a way like try to solve it internally call
then i was like but the chat i thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
ya so like macam i felt a bit (err) and then still some more like sometimes
the like i'm macam
(mm)
i guess macam dia orang treat me a bit like staff there [lah] which i understand [ah] macam like
i don't know how they treat their other interns but i think bila yesterday too when i met up with my reporting officer and supervisor she said like i she she thinks that they like i'm treated a bit like staff [lah] macam they they allow me to do a lot of things
i guess so good and bad [lah]
i i felt like macam still terikat [lah] like if i was the actual staff and case manager like a lot of the things macam i tak check in sangat [lah] like i would have just check in a bit then i would have run with it [lah] but macam
(uh) macam as a intern you realise that what you doing
will have an impact on like the other case workers so macam like i hold back and then like i keep checking in so macam in a way to protect myself and also like to make sure like the client tidak ada
like what is it there's no bad impact [lah] on the client at the end of the day [ah]
so macam two and a half months actually quite short [lah]
like ya but
but at different locations [ah] under different program
(mm) (mm)
i think
ada one satu grad dip then the other is i think (um) under grad but (err) it's her second practicum
(uh) so i think this company macam purposely they take up (err)
they tried to pick up macam grad dip yang pernah kerja
in the social service ya
ya ya in the social service sector so that macam (mm) not train [lah] macam like you know (uh)
work etiquette [ah] work etiquette macam like organisation after awhile macam a lot of organization macam structured a certain way
and then macam there's like cause i know [lah] macam like there's policy there's guidelines macam there's k_p_i to meet gitu so macam like i roughly know [lah]
[ah] then it's also under a_i_c so previously my previous job (um) they are the funders ya
so (err)
ya so i kind of know [lah] a_i_c punya mentality where they go they a bit
how to say
they are a bit macam
jaga muka jaga face sikit like macam they expect
(err) fast and (err) presentable results
i guess like macam when you work with people it's not easy to see a change very fast [kan] ya so macam some of them macam resistant some of them macam they are forced to go into the service because of what they they did are like
or macam the society or the community macam thinks of them that that there's an issue with them so they report [lah] to government or a_i_c which is a_i_c [lah] can trickle down to a_i_c usually [lah] cause they always report to m_p [lah]
that's your m_p
so then anything m_p raise up [lah] then blah blah blah nanti in the end turun to the organisation so then they expect organisation
so macam be miracle [lah] miracle workers then kita cakap dengan dia orang [lah] it's not possible they don't see it as a problem you see it as a problem and most of the time dia orang pun tak nak someone to come in and interfere with their private affairs
it's considered private affairs [what] (uh)
so in the end you have to get consent from them
and then macam how to say
dia orang punya k_p_i is a bit merepek [lah] at times i feel
they cannot
cannot be that macam one case worker has to hold maybe around
(err) i think last time apa [eh] eighty cases
then
ya actually ya actually initially they wanted according to my reporting officer [lah] they wanted i think hundred i was like kalau hundred one case sahaja can be like besar gila because of their complications is are they
ya and then ya that's why
someone who is very minimal macam susah gila it's because like it comes and goes [ah] each person kadang-kadang this period they are okay some periods not and then also macam seasonal you see cause sometimes like
i i think depending on the timing like macam chinese new year or christmas timing right they will there's like explosion of things going on cause macam i think macam
how to say macam it ties into their
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
so dia teringat-ingat the families [ah] or what how is your relationship with their family [lah] that kind of thing
ya
ya correct correct
ya
you ketawa
for like (uh) macam reporting period [lah] ya then macam
supposed to
supposed to ya
(uh) no no
(um) you have to record down [ah]
but i think macam they try to push [lah] macam reduce the amount first of all and then second it cannot be that macam is singular case work [lah] it must macam kita buat group work or something considered under the k_p_i [lah] because macam f_s_c
it's try [lah] they try to [lah] maximum i think thirty to forty [lah] but then nowadays [ah] cases macam complicated you the person itself is not alone [kan] then you have to look at the family like the community setting
so macam orang dekat atas tak faham orang dekat bawah
and i was like
and apa
i don't know i i think i'm not suited for f_s_c at all
i might [lah] i i will i will look through the #simei# [one] is a new program it it seems like macam (um) a a duplication of some of their services so macam like
i ask them [ah] what is it about this new program that you want to start (uh) new siting cause macam i think they try to ask different people to build up the team from like previously the different programs [lah]
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then [ah]
so then i ya so then i was like asking so what's the difference [lah] because last time like this kind of services still the same and
i mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
(uh) people i think can't remember where
(err) i think the cases all the cases in the east to be transferred [lah] so then what's the macam main difference [lah] between the other programs
so it doesn't ya it still sounds very (um) macam apa exploratory
[ah] so i don't know [lah] what's going on
[oh] no no there's no need to itu i have to i apply the usual route [lah]
(uh) ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty [lah]
ya cause i just
macam i'm not in the headspace to cari kerja sekarang
(uh) like
i just like finished my practicum i just like submitted my last assignment
ya
and then in two weeks time i have like exams which i like i haven't even started studying
ya ya
no no no no it's okay it's okay (uh)
my line is very small i don't know if it's clear or not but i'm holding the the the the mic ya near to my mouth but sometimes i move [lah]
so cute
so maybe when i take a break from studying [lah] i start applying for a jobs
that's so sad
i don't know if i want to just continue doing my masters ke tak next year is like i i feel macam
(um)
it's not that [lah] i macam don't know where to go yet i don't know if macam s_u_s_s is the place for me to do masters like macam after one year one point five years of doing grad dip [kan] macam like
is it a good place to start like to study [lah] macam their profs are good and everything but macam ada i don't know [lah] what i want to take up the extra curricular modules and then if i want to take up continuing masters in social work

macam normal [lah] tak won't break your bank kind of situation [lah]
(mm)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
okay okay understand
ya
ya
(mm)

ya (mm)
[ah]
okay
(uh) okay
okay maybe you should ar~ are you okay to like go for the hiking on tuesday
okay
!huh!
(uh) no my mum okay sahaja lepas bekam
(mm)
okay can
at least you don't transcribe yourself i wa~ i was apa itu part of my assignment one of it is macam to do process recordings [lah] then i kena record myself with a conversation with a client
[oh] i was like (uh)
it was so cringey then i heard myself cause it's macam i pakai mask [kan] and then i have to macam analyse [lah] everything that i do with the client then i was like so (uh) i hate this i hate this like interview so long thirty plus
i was like (uh)
ya i know i think ya i think when i heard my (uh) voice macam like apa itu macam way lower then macam
(uh) ye~ macam
i was like don't you think my voice sounds like a man when you play it over cause my voice is not
the normal normal high pitch i think i realised my voice is the lower register and then macam calm like more !huh! not calmer [lah] macam
lower register [lah] basically
ya
ya unless i'm like super excited to talk then i can go quite high
i think one
then i was like (err)
ya
you sound like what my cousin #inhan#
but usually isn't it the the people with like deeper voice like you have a wider range
(err) i guess not like we're going to sing any time soon
then will be like kenapa hujan siapa nyanyi
[oh] no it stopped already at my side
[ah] okay [lah] good good good (uh)
(mm) no [ah] it just sounds normal to me ya i i don't know [lah] macam ada ya
i think i don't know [lah] macam something to do with our ears like usually when we
listen to our
voice macam i think it's the defen~ (um) channel that they go into so macam when we hear our voices during our
apa itu using recording ke apa right ya it sounds weird net factor
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
we're gonna die
what that's so funny
can't imagine we apa itu sekarang [what] maybe they gonna do some space travel [kan] tak sampai ingat who is it [ah] the guy yang faizal tak suka itu no
that's
ya but just [ah] yes
yes he wants to do like space right space travel or something like that right
is it him
you see
i don't know [lah] okay [lah] he got some admirable traits
i guess and then it's like he's from a i think
single par~ i mean single mother household
i if i recall i think so [lah]
i don't know was it him or someone else (ugh)
cannot ask me who about celebrities background [ah]
!huh!
ya i did (uh) !aiya!
why
ya
(um)
okay okay can [lah] i don't mind cause technically macam it's either
that areas or like it's my area like which is far for you
(um)
macam no (err) no macam
parkway parade or like you know north east region gitu
actually macam ya in terms of connectivity macam cycling i think in the east is better
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya good
like (uh)
(uh)
[eh] there is a dekat #tampines# there's a eco green park town
it's near to
ya it's near to #tampines# interchange actually
(mm)
i can send it to you but the the pictures are nice i think like i've
she goes to how's #afiqah# [ah]
[ah]
(mm) no
[ah] when was she married [ah]
[ah] [eh]
[eh] i is this the guy yang you were s~ the one that ya the one that you macam not certain is it this one
okay
[ah] okay okay
i
okay
you never met the guy is it
(mm)
(mm) (mm) okay [ah] nothing [ah]
[eh] is he our age
okay
okay now now where are they staying
[ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] it makes more sense [lah] habis itu ya
(mm) (mm)
then sometime macam like kalau the girl moves into the guy's house is sometimes macam
(uh) ada [lah] fiction you pernah dengar
outside you and the mother-in-law macam okay [lah] bermesra gitu but
i think there might be some tension
ya
dah macam
(mm)
i think macam like entah what would what would i know also
tak macam ada like female macam ada expectations on us like we should tak kisah [lah] kalau you kerja full time couple like you're supposed to help out
at the house then macam like the opposite doesn't hold true if like the guy moves into the house like you still have
(mm) like macam apa itu
like you don't expect the husband to like do so much of like housework or anything is macam financially sahaja [lah] kasih duit
ya [ah] ya
but nowadays is like susah [lah] nak
one person stay at home like you still need that double income somehow
ya
i know which is like macam a bit worrying [lah] macam i think i tengah fikir-fikir because macam
like i also don't want to send like any potential kids to infant care or childcare cause macam at the end of the day the kids how they turn out is supposed to be your responsibility [kan] but then also
is (uh)
like you shouldn't segan and not ask for help and then my (mm) then my parents dia orang tak nak macam they want to have their own lives [lah] they don't want to be like you know
babysitters so
it's like the only other options i can see is that i macam berhenti kerja sekejap [lah] jaga anak and then ya and then potentially you lose
(uh) apa itu credibility (um) relevancy to the the area that you are in then susah balik nak masuk kerja
ya so
so then also like your c_p_f is lower then you basically rely on your husband [ah] and then macam a lot of people tell me [lah] macam [oh] what (uh) don't rely so much on your husband try to be independent macam like what is going on
ya
ya
ya
i know
four months four months
(mm)
(mm)
ya but at the end of the day macam but if you is good [lah] kalau you only want to have like one kid sahaja but then kalau you want anak kedua ketiga then when is it going to stop
ya so macam
technically kalau nak masuk playgroup [lah] it's a nice timing to masuk balik kerja and then
you send the kid to play group [lah] then even then even then it's not full time you but not sure [lah] ya so do you want to work part time and then
i don't know [lah] macam singapore punya culture not flexible yet
i think ya
so macam
okay
okay ya
we're good
alright [eh]  macam [eh] [eh] okay [ah]
okay [ah]  boleh boleh no problem
[ah] [eh] [eh]
[eh] bro school is [eh] i hate school
school s_i_t can go suck dick i'm telling you
okay (uh) #rabak#  gila okay you imagine [eh] okay  kau kau just imagined
 aku i got i got like one (uh) one website
okay [eh] i got one website for
for this one module okay i've five modules [lah]
so i have my student portal that's one website
okay [ah] then i got one website for my
(uh) module submission for another module
i have one website for this other module submission
okay one other website for this one  punya module  macam q&a
in total [kan]  kau tahu in total  aku ada berapa banyak website
 aku ada like around nine websites  tahu in total and this is just week four
apa #lanchiau# [ah]  aku tanya engkau apasal [lah]
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites [kan] is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like communi~ you know you know
amongst the students [lah]
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like [eh] this one how this [one] how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that [lah] to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like (um) there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
i have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then i have to ya then i have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so i ask around some random stupid questions [ah]
like [oh] this [one] how  padahal this [one] is everyone know  semua orang tahu ini benda
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota [lah]
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat [lah] having a lecture or hav~ having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
 kau tak boleh actually learn anythi~ everything in one shot
 kau tak boleh ask your on the left on the right
 kau tak boleh
ask even the professor [lah]
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively [what]
so  aku just  bingit gila having this online lesson actually  aku tak kisah tahu pasal covid
 tapi ever since this  aku masuk s_i_t [eh] !wah! !wow!  aku bilang kau #rabak#  gila
seriously it's so ineffective then i'm
i sp~ i like stay up until like two a m almost everyday [sia] just to do work
#rabak#  gila [ah]
#rabak#  gila [ah] ya [sia] #rabak#  gila i tell you
(mmhmm) ya
ya
but
[ah] [sia] seriously as i (err) i didn't know uni is so bad that it's legit just  kau pandai pandai [ah]
 kau imagine like on the first week
not not on the first week [lah] like almost all lectures i have
this one lecture i have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just bro~ like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example [ah] python (err) you kn~ there's this [one]
[ah] ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input [ah] input forma~ format [lah]
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
 aku pun tak tahu [ah] ya ya some
it's it's just so bad [ah] like and then
i don't know like even the other day
(err) i have this other module okay
[ah] it's basically i'm learning about digital electronics [lah]
okay so  aku kena
i i got some friends [lah] i got some friends here and there
and then after that they because  a~ aku from engineering background  apa
right so  dia orang pernah tanya aku [ah] [eh] #koi# can teach me or not this this this okay [ah]  boleh aku ajar engkau [ah]
then the other day i tea~ i taught two of them i only took
two hours to teach them i think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
[ah] like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad [lah] because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like r_p you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni un~ my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things [eh]
ya and
ya and honestly i didn't expect that it would be that way
because i thought that
when people say s_u_s_s singapore university of self study [eh]
okay like that's what people say [lah] my friend also say that he's in s_u_s_s
and then after that i'm like okay [lah] maybe s_u_s_s is terrible [lah]
but then when i come to s_i_t i expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
they just  macam [ah] okay [ah]  kau buat gini [ah] okay  kau tahu bagus kau tak tahu [ah]  kau belajar [ah] google [ah]
 apasal like
i don't know [ah] to me it's it's it's just nonsense [ah]
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like i think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two a_m
(err) asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
[sia] [lah] poly  mana ada aku stay up  sampai pukul dua pagi [sia]  buat kerja
in uni i have to constantly stay up until two a_m just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up [ah] just to do it
then it's just like it's just so i don't know
this is just too crazy [lah] honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent [lah]
(err) i mean i mean we're okay because when you hear like i  aku tak tahu kalau kau ada dengar tak
 tapi aku ada dengar that (um)
n_t_u n_u_s this type of high
(um) really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother [one] [ah]
they really not brother [one] but s_i~ but s_i_t right at least it's they quite brother [lah] because
(err) and i found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two i have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] your age [lah] but what i'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya i've never met anyone below twenty [eh]
ya i [eh]
ya ya (uh) everyone there is from like i_t_e or from poly
wait [eh] hang on [eh]
ya [ah]
 apa dia [ah]  cakap cakap cakap [jer]
[ah] okay
but
[oh] part time uni
(err) (um)
[oh] honestly the
i don't think s_u_s_s even is a
i don't know s_u_s_s is a good choice or not i got fr~ i got two friends in s_u_s_s
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work [lah]
there's things to do here and there
ya i think s_i_t is mainly for people from like i_t_e from poly the more #rilek# ones [lah] the [one] the not so snake [one]
ya
s_u_s_s  aku tak tahu
legit [ah]  aku tak tahu aku tak tahu because i've only heard about n_t_u n_u_s all these like up there  punya uni you know
but i but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
 macam gitu [ah]
 tak tahu [ah]  macam mana padahal baru week four
 baik baru baru week  besok is week four  baru week four  aku [dah] ada a test tomorrow
which is ten percent of my grades
 besok (err) six thirty p_m
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test [lah] [eh] no it's a
test from home
but i'm this browser that you know how r_p you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so ye~ so my s_i_t they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down [eh] where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they [ah]
they force they shut things down like
your telegram
like discord steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya [lah]
stewing from that [lah]
ya is it is a browser [lah] on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
i think i no i'm i need to have i need to have internet connection to have the test [lah]
but i cannot access anything else
ya but i need internet connection because it's a test [what]
so they [ah] and then after that the test got webcam [ah]
i need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam [ah] either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam [what]
ya ya ya (um) the one of the professors actually do that
using her phone for a webcam for like writing things down because maths
and maths how can you teach maths without actually writing things down right
ya
 macam gitu [ah] [ah] i don't know [ah]
then (um) you imagine [eh] s_i_t [kan] okay  kau imagine  kau masuk sekolah
 kau masuk sekolah then at like my at like your second week they're like [oh] by the way
by the way
you have a report ya [ah]
[ah]  aku aku macam !alamak! aku baru saja
 masuk sekolah week two  dia orang [dah] cakap [eh] you got report [ah] to write down i'm like [sia] [lah]
stress [pe] boy  buat report
[ah] then  apa
cause
ya then yesterday i spent like the
i think i spent like two hours writing on just like a few paragraphs of my report because i've never actually i have done a report in poly
but report in poly and report in uni is you know the standards are different
(err) like you actually have to put in some effort
for a report in uni
i mean
i mean in poly you can just  sembarang buat then okay  [dah] some #chapalang# report okay  [dah] submit
but
would uni i actually have to write i had like ten tabs open just
for
(um) just for this report section
ya [lah] i'm but as in what i'm saying is thatthe the step from poly to uni is very drastic you know
i got one friend who is taking this module as me
 lepas tu he panicking already he panicking then he want ex~ he want
exempt from this module [lah]  lepas tu dia macam [eh]  ini macam mana ini itu macam mana [eh]  aku tak tahu [ah] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh] [eh]
then you know he's just panicking [ah]
 dia dari poly but i think  dia dari poly  juga but i think he he doesn't handle stress well [lah]
(mm)  gitu
(mm) trimester
[ah] so but then for the first year
[ah]
okay so it's very weird
when the other day when i was comparing i was talking i was telling i was talking about this with my friends the other day it was super weird
so you know how in n_u_s or even in r_p you had
thirteen weeks in one semester
right
and then after that my trimester you'd would expect because i have three trimesters in one year right you would expect it to be like okay [lah] maybe
lesser lesser weeks right lesser weeks because yo~ because trimester you have three terms as compared to two terms
right
so you would expect like okay [ah] trimester but then [eh] my trimester
thirteen weeks also [eh] then i see n_u_s [eh] their semester
thirteen weeks [eh] like  apa [sia] this one
what did i sign up for my my s_i_t i got three terms each term is thirteen weeks
n_u_s got two terms each term is thirteen weeks also like what
ya my break time is small [lah]
but it doesn't it doesn't defeat the fact that
my one term is the same as other university's one term eventhough i'm trimester based you know
ya
no [lah] (err) ya [lah] ya [lah]
[eh]  mat susah bro serious  aku cakap dengan kau susah
serious i didn't i didn't expect it to be
i didn't expect it to i have to put in so much effort you know
like (mm)
ya like my sisters were like !wah! #koi# #koi# run
utterly hardworking [eh] and i'm like no [lah] i just unfortunately i have to be a hardworking [lah]
i also don't want to be hardworking but
you know unfortunately i have to be
it's just unfortunately i have to be
eventhough i don't want to be because i want to  macam #rilek# [ah] chill chill take my own sweet time but no you know i need to be like need to do this need to do that
ya  macam gitu [lah]

[eh]  jangan gitu #lu#  fikir #lu#  siapa
[eh] ultraboost is for casual this [one] is for running
eventhough i have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that i have no time seriously you know i wa~ i doing work
right you know i the other day i spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay i had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is i take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation [lah] so i had this [ah]
i had this lake concept method the other time
and (err) i will i couldn't get it to work [lah] even though the concept was there
the idea was there but i couldn't get it to work so i asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept i two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but i cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
then i was like  kenapa [sia]  tak boleh [oh] and then after that i spent i spent like
 aku agak aku spend  macam three four hours on it [lah]
three four hours okay i started at eleven p_m  aku habis pukul dua pagi tahu
 aku habis pukul dua pagi then after that you know what was the problem
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax [lah]
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right i put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
then after  aku just found out that it's because of spacing then  aku bilang kawan aku [eh] okay  kau try  kau letak space
 kau ada problem  tak lepas tu dia orang letak space [a'ah] [lah] [sia]  dia orang pun tak boleh
so  dia orang boleh [ah]  pasal dia orang tak letak space  aku letak space  tak boleh
[sia] [lah]
 kau imagine  tiga empat jam aku duduk depan computer  [dah] pukul satu pagi aku tak is  apasal tak boleh [ah]  aku
 garu kepala garu garu garu [ah]  tak apa [ah]  mandi [ah]  mandi [dah] habis mandi solat [ah] okay okay relax  sikit relax  sikit
 lepas tu continue  buat kerja buat buat buat [eh]
 apasal [eh]  aku stock  aku break down i rewrote my code like three four times
i break everything to everything down okay  apasal ini input  tak boleh ni ni input  kalau aku tulis macam gini boleh ke tak then
ya [lah] so so that's what i i was trying to do [lah] so i break everything down i run bit by bit okay  dari gini
 kenapa tak boleh [eh] okay  aku perasan aku tulis macam gini boleh aku tulis macam gini
 apasal tak boleh [eh] then i found out [eh] okay  aku kalau tak tulis dengan spacing
[eh]  boleh [lah] [sia]  aku tak [eh]  pukimak irritating  apa satu white space or because of one spacebar
 dia kirakan kasi aku error
 dia tunjuk dia tunjuk but th~ but then what they're showing is right
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because bec~ then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
then i'm like  apa [sia] twelve comma  tak boleh convert into integer
twelve comma  boleh apa
 habis tu it's because  tahu aku letak twelve comma two comma eight
because that white space right that white space  kirakan anything after that space bar everything will ignore
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course [lah] comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
 aku macam [sia] [lah]  kau orang kau orang just  bunuh aku [sia]
four hours [ah]  lepas aku masuk a~ lepas tu aku [dah] baring aku [dah] baring [dah] masuk katil baring pukul dua two two a_m [ah] two [oh] five a_m  gitu

ramai orang yang tak ada kerja they can apply for this (um)
government grant [kan]
ya it's just like is this at #tuas#
i pun ada apply i pun ada apply for other jobs but they also gave me the same reasonings like [oh] you are overqualified or you are underqualified
the macam for certain positions they will say macam (um)
this job requires you to do this this this
tapi
it's just simple steps you know but then they expect you to have like [oh] five years experience in you know
doing that type of job i'm like !huh!
hello
i don't see
what's the
tak ada hal panggil hal [ah]
right now pun !aiya! susah [lah] as long as i feel that kalau dapat kerja pun ambil [jer] [lah] [eh]
rezeki
i mean also
ya [lah] tengok condition dia [lah] you know some people they just
the pay isn't good then it's tough times [what] right now
so kalau pay is not good
[oh] kerja apa tu
kerja apa
[oh] teaching you got a teaching cert [ah]
[oh]
i did i did apply for teaching though then (um)
cause i applied for teaching macam english you know lang~ languages [lah] basically
and then they say that [oh] (uh) you don't have a teaching cert from n_i_e no i don't why do i need a teaching cert to be a tutor though
[ah] macam tak faham [ah] i just
ya but like
tapi ya ya papaya [lah] you know just
why you need cert for that if you just gonna be a private tutor i don't i don't really see the need
need for that it's not really
leceh [lah] it's just part of the routine right sekarang
ya [lah] it's always like that [lah] the management sometimes when you tak when you don't have a good management right
it's not like you don't feel like
it's good workplace for you to stay if you like a bit toxic
[oh] ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
that's the whole point of training [what]
(uh huh)
wait she say like that she say like word for word gitu
!wah!
she say like word for word macam gitu
was minta kena sepak [sia]
right
ya
just just toxic [ah]
[ah] [dah] burn [ah] tak payah [lah]
bu~
apa tu right now pun macam susah [ah] kalau nak
dapat kerja
the it's work from home
if you
why you don't prefer
okay [lah] technically i come from a i_t_e background so
most of my job
either work from home or face to face [ah] i preferred tapi
also depending [lah] like cause i'm doing project right like i said then macam
prefer face to face [lah] so that we
can do things chop chop fast fast just
you know
habiskan
i_t projects so basically (uh) kalau ada apa apa
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that [oh] i want you to make this app for shopee
so we will take in that project and then we will work on it [lah]
(mm)
you can say that (uh) i do
i do mostly the front end
u_i it's called u_i and u_x design [lah]
so ya not not if you see
[oh]
ya they don't give the option in the skillsfuture [kan]
ya
the comfort of the home
ya
but my project requires me to work with
a few other people [lah] so
ya ya you know the kalau
one part of the proj~ the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call [eh] hi how (um)
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
macam (ugh) malas [ah] it's better to do face to face [ah] you know like lincah can just
look at the computer and then there's
do (uh) [oh] ya
whatever [lah] right now pun
we cannot complain much [ah] because
covid [mah]
so ya i know kat sini quite bising
(um) right now kat sini ada renovation my area sini
forever [sia]
ya
(err) but i feel like
[ah] i just want to
don't you feel like
it's a bit suffocating kalau you stay at home work from home
you lacking the human interaction
(uh)
macam tak dapat jumpa kawan
only now [what] i get to see you so
but it's limited to five
[ah]
#paitao#
ya like
rimas [ah]
i feel you i feel you
like
you come out from your room and then you see their faces you mean
round the clock you have to see their faces i feel you
ya
how many siblings you have
what why [oh] [oh] because she's longer in a
a longer relationship is it
[oh]
[oh] make okay [lah] make kind of makes sense because
she got stable job she's she's (um)
she don't have to
[oh] she's not
she's a
[oh] so right now she's also finding for job [lah]
kirakan
[oh] okay [lah] there's some source of income [lah]
but i think kalau nak kalau nak kahwin sekarang pun macam
ya considered a luxury [ah] because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
i get what you mean
ya
ya basically
i mean technically we are muslims [what] so we do have to you know
go the proper way kena ada majlis perkahwinan
you have to like
we have to have right i mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then (uh)
the wedding services
that one i that one i thought is just a
really [ah] that one i don't know [sia]
that one that one i don't know [sia] i don't know i don't actually know how it works kalau your partner is a non-muslim
[oh] really [ah]
i tak tahu [seh] ada benda macam gini
what how long already
you and your
[oh]
how how long have you guys been together
kau orang dua
(uh) i don't think so
no i don't tak tak ingat pun you ada cakap
almost three years
(mm)
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents kalau your parents ada pressure you
your parents ada pressure you
it's really you man
ya because like right now i feel like i'm not doing much colourful i don't have a baby you know you know i think it'd be quite fun [lah] because i don't have to work and then
[oh] my god i'm the
polar opposite of you
because (err) my parents think that i'm a workaholic
and (err) ya cause i
[kan] kalau you are studying normally you just focused on studying right
ya but i prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there [ah] i i don't i don't really get much sleep i don't really do much but i i
i like being busy in that sense
so i i tend to neglect kalau ada
(um) like i neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so i'm a i'm
quite a workaholic
ya i'm still twenty five also i don't feel the rush you know to
really get married i feel like even if i get married now it's because that
i don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd i don't like crowd i don't
(uh huh)
(mm)
ya [lah] i feel like
no i feel like i want to get
h we want to we should get h_d_b first then
(um) you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get h_d_b first then
get the wedding cause some people they get married first kahwin dulu [ah] then
tak ada rumah nak tinggal
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like i feel like it's quite crowded [lah]
ya i just nak keluar rumah you know have your own
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl [ah] then they expect a lot of you
female
get out [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
are you sh~ will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your boyf~ your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you (uh) get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married
bigger house go there okay
#zao# #zao#
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
well okay [lah] actually
[oh]
no for me my
my boyfriend's place is just (um)
just enough for his family [ah] i cannot really move into his place
so
he cannot really move into my place also because i think kecoh [ah]
i think kecoh [ah]
no (uh) (um)
i don't prefer kecoh
which kecoh no not that kecoh
(uh) it's cramped kecoh
then what you feel what
[oh]
i think that's most likely you know
ya my
my brother pun nak kahwin [kan] end of december i i hope
they move out i don't i don't hope for them to come over
cause like kecoh
no [lah] it's not like i don't like it's just
the house is just cramped [ah] sekarang my house ada enam orang
and i got
cats also and she's scared of cats
my
yes
she's very scared of cats though i i not sure how it's gonna turn out
!hais!
six people is too crowded already bro
i cannot
ya
i
but i really es~
how about no i should get rid of the person instead of my cats my cats has been longer okay
are staying longer at my place
but just two cats [lah]
but
some people have like six
seven cats you know
i saw that coming from a mile away
!huh! ya [lah] basically #jurong#
people are weird i understand i get that a lot
okay they always say #jurong# people are weird
i i have to admit [ah] because down here there's a lot of crime that
is those it's not even petty crime it's just weird crime macam
curi seluar dalam
steal underwear kind
(um) okay cool i didn't know our area got a lot of
weird people
i
i like nowadays i don't
ya
ya
#jurong# shady [ah] #jurong#
especially the west side
country
bawa passport
kena bawa passport
actually ya pretty i think because #jurong# my area #jurong# west [kan] (uh) banyak
there's a lot of (uh) there's not much of commercialised building it's more of (uh)
industrial building
so a lot of (um)
foreigners there [lah]
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
some more there's not much (um) my area there is just macam industrial there's not much activity going around
in terms of police or anything
no no
i don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know m_r_t or vehicles
but
it's quite scary [lah] kalau balik malam-malam then
you will be scared [lah] because
(uh) all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation (um)
those (um) touch and run away kind
ya then ada juga (uh) pencuri which is
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
i have many cases where i was followed back home like from my house [kan]
i take i walk from pioneer m_r_t
then i jalan balik
it's like a ten minute duration
so while i'm walking back home
like i feel that (uh) people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know (uh)
they even take he even took the same lift as me
(uh)
i told my parents [ah] then my parents macam cause my parents are in the
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
ya my parents on gila [lah] you know they are all in all these
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know [lah]
so i told them about that then they raised it up to the c_c
the c_c members and then the c_c members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy
what
i
i would confront them but
i'm a very small person
more daring
you are more daring
ya
fight [ah] come [ah] fight [ah]
ya
[eh] seram [pe]
ya #ang-mo-kio#
ya got industrial places [what] there
(uh huh)
ya i get you
if you know what it's always like that though
it's always like that you always get kerja somewhere far away from your house
my office work my main office is at town what so i'm like [ah] malas
malas the crowd no
i would rather
#tanjong-pagar# still not bad [what]
#tanjong-pagar# still not bad i feel like around cause my
my office situ is like
at city hall
around there
so i (uh) it's crowded [lah] especially kalau in the morning [kan] nak ambil public transport
i cannot [ah] i just for me i feel i get
anxious over crowds
so i'm not a crowd person
i i cannot deal with big groups
i prefer to
stay clear away from that
so #jurong# staying at #jurong# west is quite fitting for me [lah] you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in #jurong# west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the m_r_t
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
fact that you feel like seram [ah] especially if you go home late at night
okay [lah] i mean it depends [lah]
you you can you can stay at #jurong# east if i'm not wrong #jurong# east ada
#jurong# east also considered c_b_d area but then
ya certain areas macam (um)
what's that area called [ah] you know #hua-yi# there i forgot what is it called but ya
there are areas where
it's not far it's not really far away from the m_r_t
but it's also not close to any
you know (uh) malls or ke apa
no noises [lah] you know if you prefer that
ya
[oh]
ya
used as back up right now [lah] because of covid
ya i feel you man i also got some savings that i thought like you know
like i i also had the same mentality as you macam (um)
(err) rent house somewhere near my office also
somewhere more accessible [ah]
no not at town at least like
maybe at most
east side [ah] cause east side i know
east and north side basically is
you got direct transport to town [what]
ya but my area my west like we have to
okay also direct transport but then
it's really long [ah]
and it gets crowded
at my area #boon-lay# there you know so
i don't do i don't do again i don't do well with crowds [ah] [eh]

okay so i never told you #liana# or jasmine anything about this but that time i was on a date with this guy we were going
how to say we were going so well we were talking online why are you looking at me like that
okay to be honest i didn't consider it as a date but it was more of an outing okay it was just a outing to get to know each other better ya whatever [lah] okay so
(ugh) okay so we were going so well we were talking online and then we decided to go to i believe it was #jurong# east popeye's you know [kan]
[oh] shut down you #sengkang# [ah] okay so we were at popeye's and then we were just talking about life we went around [oh] wait maybe it wasn't in #jurong# east it was at orchard

ya orchard but it was kind of a staple place [ah] for a date or something like that then
we went (uh) we just walk around and we talk and i thought it was going so good but the thing is
i thought it was going so good but then after we went our separate ways i saw that he block me on every single social media platform and even my number
i have no idea [leh] it wa~ it was going so well or at least i thought it was going so well i made jokes he laugh he made jokes i laugh
and then after that i couldn't contact him at all you know that's the thing because after that date right usually after every outing i would say thank you [ah]

that time [lah] [eh] saya just tahu dia tak suka saya tapi that's okay pasal
dah biasa [kan] online biasanya dia orang cakap apa ghosts [ah] ghosts i got ghost stick in my life
tapi tak apa [lah] ni kehidupan [kan] manusia what to do it is what it is jadi awak ada calon apa-apa lain tak untuk saya
calon apa ya

ya ya okay that's true
(mmhmm)
[ah] okay wait how do you even know him same madrasah or school or
[ah] okay
okay faham juga but let me tell you something k my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
but i'm also specific about whether they are [eh] yes man or no man you know sometimes guys can be like
[ah] ya ya ya do whatever you want or like [eh] no way cannot do that just because you are my girlfriend you can't do that and stuff like that i don't want like that [ah] i want
bantah no no no no bantah is you shake right
okay to make it simple i just like someone who
won't restrict me from doing the right things in life or at least things that will do me good but at at the same time i want a person who can correct me
like if i do any mistakes they won't just let me go off just like that
just because i'm their girlfriend and don't want to correct me like for example
kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain in a
in a macam manja-manja way of course [lah] mana boleh gitu kita dah ada boyfriend of course kita kena setia [kan] jadi macam i prefer kalau dia macam
berbual dengan saya [eh] you are my girlfriend [seh] [eh] janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita happy sama-sama
ya i want that type of person it will be so sweet
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya that's true how about your boyfriend is he on the nice side or is he on the mean side
is he mean to me [ah]
that that sounds so wrong [eh]
that's sounds okay okay anyway ya it's very hard to find these sort of nice but not too nice guy i know a lot of man who would say
[oh] this girl is too picky for saying like that if i see these online and then i'm like what the hell do you want to fight me that's like the most basic thing a guy could do for a girl [leh]
don't you think so
ya
do you think you and your boyfriend got lucky i always feel like that not lucky [pe] [seh] but like that time in i_t_e
he went by chance someone said for you to look into his eyes and for him to look into your eyes are like !wahseh! so cute
!huh! really
[ah]
[oh] my god are you serious
ya !huh!
ya
(uh huh)
[oh] my god wait tak
maybe maybe he was acting cool you know like those big macho guys like [oh] my god girl loves me they say the inside themselves
but then you know but then on the inside there also like what the heck this girl likes me she's crazy
(uh huh)
[ah] apa [ah] are you serious
what [lah] this boy this what you was talking to his ex when he kind of likes you and then after he is with you then the ex wants to right wasn't that the story
(mmhmm)
ya
[ah]
ya
[oh] my god so she was playing hard to get is it
you know i've heard a lot of stories about this you know let me tell you one so i have this friend !huh!
(um)
basically same story as you he was with this girl but then they broke up okay they already separate [ah]
they ya they already separate then suddenly when the guy wants to be with another girl suddenly the ex girlfriend came running back
why you are you with girl why you with this girl blah blah blah blah then i was like what [seh] this !huh!
when he told me the story i was so confused wasn't she not with him anymore and the thing is right she broke up with him ya ya ya ya
!wah!
okay like ya after that (um) once i got to know the story of course i cannot confront her right because i not i not in their relationship [what]
and but the thing is i don't know how
i got roped into this drama and somehow the girl thought the guy was cheating on her with me
ya ya that's true
ya tapi mind boggling because yang that time somehow ya saya kena roped into the story [kan] jadi i was also confused [lah] apa tengah jadi ni then (err) girlfriend nama dia pun ada mention my name
and the thing is [kan] all this time dia baik dengan saya [tau] dia tak pernah tak senyum pada saya dia selalu macam senyum nanti dia hug kalau nampak saya
muka muka dua ular kepala dua (err) agaknya [ah]
dengan pelik [seh] story gitu yang [oh] lagi satu saya nak bilang [ah]
bukan bukan nama saya [jer] yang dalam story itu kawan-kawan lelaki kawan-kawan lelaki tu yang perempuan dia pun letak nama dia orang sana
lelaki itu bukan gay lelaki tu straight cuma lelaki tu
ada juga kawan perempuan takkan tak ada kawan perempuan [kan] ya jadi yang ex girlfriend ingatkan dia tipu perempuan tu dengan saya tapi
yang masa tu juga dia ingatkan lelaki tu macam buaya
apa (mm) mungkin dia tak begitu confident dengan dia sendiri ataupun dia punya relationship dengan lelaki tu jadi
saya tak tahu [lah] saya tak nak cakap apa-apa saya tak nak buka aib dia nanti saya yang kena [eh] kena jadi saya pun tak cakap apa-apa pasal tu [ah] saya just diamkan (mm)
(err) saya rasa saya tak sepatutnya tanya [eh] bilang awak tak apa [lah] nama dia orang semua tapi ni [jer] [lah] yang saya boleh bilang awak
yang lelaki tu kawan saya saya saya dah memang tak suka lelaki tu [ah]
sa~ saya cuma [ah] nampak lelaki tu sebagai kawan baik saya macam abang-abang
tak tak tak dia hanya kawan sahaja dia nampak saya sebagai adik saya nampak dia sebagai abang itu [lah] kita
punya perhubungan [ah] kalau faham [lah] jadi ra~ ramai orang pun tahu kita tak suka
[a'ah] satu sama lain macam kita yes correct we are just platonic friends but a lot of people know that
because we did we did clarify it with them
tapi
the girlfriend [lah] i'm not i'm not so sure what's happening with her but
ya
ya you you used to hate her so much [eh] i i found that so funny
turntables or the table turn
i wanted to watch the office but i don't have the v_p_n
(uh huh)
ya it
ya the cameraman would just bend into everyone's faces

at (mmhmm)
[eh] (mmhmm)
!woo! spicy tell me
[ah]
yes
(mmhmm)
alright
ya
(mmhmm)
what
i feel like every time we are at the workplace or something especially if we're at an intern level or like those lowest [ah] of all candidates
we would always get told to do one thing [eh] we get to do one thing and then suddenly when we do that thing suddenly someone else say [eh] don't do it don't do that [leh] like
isn't that the job of another person or something like that then they make us go round and round and around and then i don't know we we will get scolded for it in the end
ya that happened to me also at my workplace (err)
jadi my supervisor ni melayu you my mentor pula cina [lah] then [kan] ni sebelum covid jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama [kan] jadi saya yang kena pass
(uh) all these work to let's say kalau dia cakap kena pass (err) find me to another person [kan] (err) jadi i just do that [lah] tapi nanti
the person i pass it to semua they tell me that it's wrong i'm not supposed to do that then i have to go back you get that feeling
(mmhmm)
yes work from home
ya
yes yes
ya
(uh huh)
[oh] okay but the thing is yang the company itself should also update their tablets or their p_c or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
or home or whatever we will we will bound to use it and when we use it of course you have to use it at an optimum speed [pe]
(mmhmm) what is on your plate
(uh huh)
nine thirty as it wait what time do you start work again
what life this girl my my office hour starts at eight [leh]
okay [ah] wait how long does it take for you to get home let's say you from the office [ah]
okay fine wait but that's the same timing i have [ah] to get home
(uh huh)
naik turun bukit you know what let's let's grab this topic completely i want to forget about intern
you know what topic i'm interested in talking about our good friend j j j j j
no
our good friend #jannah#
you know we're we're talking about the relationship topic just now right i suddenly remembered her it remember when we went to her house
!huh! no no no
does she know know not that i know but i feel like i want to find someone for her someone special
i have no idea but you know [lah] like any of our friends who aren't judgmental
i would feel so happy for her too she's so patient with us and i feel like she would be even more patient with her husband or spouse or whatever they call that
ya but at the same time i want to find someone for her but i feel like most of my friends aren't good enough for her [leh] it's ya do you have anyone in mind for her
i know you don't have a lot of friends
what do you have
but do you have anyone in mind maybe your cousin your your your boyfriend's friend
how about allan friends allan's cousins allan family is huge [eh]
[oh] my god ya that's you know what this is is a this is a hard thing to do we want to find someone good for her but at the same time we feel like our friends aren't good enough for her
so how she's already up there #shaza#
[oh]
ya she deserves better than me to be honest okay k k we all deserve the best !woo! feminism power hashtag girl power
(mm) (mm)
u_s elections i
[oh] i don't really care too much about it but i do stay up to date sometimes what about it
(hmm)
ya correct correct and the thing is i feel like (um) to them right voting is just
it's just
something to do and then if it's funny they feel like they should do it which is so weird because in singapore we have this election thing we have to choose and then we are actually serious about it like or we have this good points and bad points
ya (uh huh)
ya [oh] ya
but but the thing is like maybe their country is
of course [lah] their country is super big it's bigger than singapore of course it will be harder to maintain right then i guess [lah] it's
it's harder for them to keep track of the votes and i i also think that most of them are like or i don't want to get involved in politics so i don't want to vote for anyone you get what i mean
ya correct correct but
but most of them still think that we are macam or they have a choice to not choose because i feel like
nowadays [kan] everyone is sensitive about everything you you know that
i i saw i saw these two video [ah] it's like satire and then it's basically [ah]
showing that people nowadays almost every single thing you have to be offended about it if you don't feel the same way
no no no please explain
ya
wait wait work culture or walk [oh] woke culture no i never heard of that [leh]
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
suit so
like in [ah] if so basically we just have to be careful with whatever we say is it like right now i'm talking to you [oh] i feel like blah blah blah but blah blah but blah blah so i have to keep adding in defending points [lah]
but no offence to this culture blah blah blah ya you know ya okay i feel like i understand the meaning of woke culture now is it like a also something like let's say you were defending woman
then talk about rapists and stuff like that then suddenly got some guy in the comments
what about man man also will get [ah] okay i understand now what [lah] these people
(mmhmm)
yes
[eh] sorry
equity
as in as in financial management equity
equity
[a'ah]
[ah] okay okay okay ya
(mmhmm)
saya pun confused [ah] tengok bual-bual pasal apa ni okay tapi tapi saya faham [lah] saya faham awak kena [ah]
berbanding sama tapi kita kena bagi-bagikan
(um) okay k saya faham juga melayu kita memang hancur apa yang awak dapat grade untuk secondary ke primary school [leh]
a two
[oh] unbelievable [oh] (uh) (uh) ya
saya saya dapat b three juga agaknya tapi [ah]
i do well bilang saya untuk retake kertas tu tapi saya tak bagi pasal (uh) saya memang tahu saya tak akan ada time untuk belajar untuk bahasa lain atau topic lain

#alhamdulillah#
that's true ya okay what is the most fun aspect or memory about i_t_e that you have
ya ya
that's true
ya ya ya ya
they do ya they do care about us until now they do care about us
ya it is not an obligation to them right for them it's just a natural thing to do
[oh] my god i knew that [mah] ya
okay
okay like you already recall right these fun times you or like those non-judgmental times you had in i_t_e and we will remember this is the most non-judgmental thing you remember or not we were in i_t_e and then (um)
basically the girls can put colours in their hair they can
[ah] i don't know dress [ah] wear like outstanding jackets and then the guys would taper their pants i don't know in in those little ways it just shows their
their how to say [ah] their creativity their expressions and [oh] my god that's so good
ya
yes
miss judy and mister #farhan# to be honest
yes we really didn't like them
ya but i get you we we didn't really like them because i i have no idea i guess we weren't used to people being harsh to us we were still babies you know we were from secondary school and stuff like that
and ya and ya basically we didn't get to be scolded most of the time so once we got scolded by them
we we felt attacked in a way
(um) yes
is this relatable woman she you remember when she said that she would drink with most as we some of the seniors like after they graduate of course at the right age remember that drinking isn't responsible before the right age
ya (mmhmm)
i_t_e was ya one of the best times of my life though
yes ya
(uh huh)
(err)
it's okay it's fine
(mmhmm)
[ah] [oh] [oh] my god
it's the sisterly affection [oh] like [oh] my god that made me recall something
awak awak ingat tak yang that time kita tengah
nak cepat-cepat habiskan project sir #farhan#
then kita tak pergi class kita pergi library
then [ah] ya ya that one and then (uh) mister #farhan# ke miss judy yang pergi library caught all of us dekat sana
ya dia yang tangkap kita semua [ah]
ya i was there [ah] saya dekat sana then they nampak saya okay
the thing is [kan] yang that hari itu tangan sedang berdarah (uh)
tangan saya berdarah dengan saya tak nak (um)
lipat saya [eh] saya tak nak buka sleeves saya jadi [ah] ku tak nanti baju saya kotor [kan] kena darah semua
ya jadi saya lipat [lah] saya punya sleeves then ingat saya cuba potong tangan saya kerana saya sedih ya betul
dia dia [ah] lepas dia dah marah semua orang dalam library dia panggil saya untuk berbual dengan saya dia dia tanya saya saya okay ke tak lepas tu dengan saya tak tahu kenapa dia
dengan dia punya ketabahan tabah mean apa ya
[oh] [eh] okay saya tak tahu perkataan dalam melayu tetapi dia dengan #confidencenya# dia tanya saya awak sedih kerana awak punya agama tak kasih saya suka perempuan [eh] tak kasih awak suka perempuan [eh]
ya
saya tak tahu kenapa dia fikir macam itu
apa [lah] perempuan ni lepas tu saya cakap tak tak saya saya memang saya saya suka lelaki saya suka saya saya suka perempuan tapi [ah] ada ada limit dia [lah] yes
[ah] lepas tu dia memang paksa paksa bilang [ah] [jer] bilang [ah] [jer] saya tahu yang awak suka perempuan jadi takpe takpe bilang [ah] [jer] saya pun !huh!
miss really i am not lesbian i have nothing against lesbian i like girls but as at a certain there's a limit to it i like boys i really liked boys thank you for your concern
i think i think mister alan was the one who told her because (um) our first lesson for that day we was with mister alan ya ya i guess okay i i guess i put myself up to it [ah] cause my sleeves was wore right and the blood was like dripping but i cannot do anything over it if
no the thing is if i wanted to fix my scarf right i would be late for school and you know instead of being late for
school i'd rather go [ah] go to school on time and let myself bleed to death that's a natural thing to do
[oh] my god you believe that story how [lah] correct correct okay
i
everyone knows that story was fake lady
[oh]
okay let me tell you [ah] the the real story was that i was fighting with my cats
i was fighting with my cats because they were fighting each other i naturally put my hand there right ya it's why cat
i'm not lying to you now i only lied to you two to three years ago but everyone knows that was a fake story okay everyone knows
okay ya so i was i was there [ah] and you you know you always talk to your cats right ya i always talk to my cats like the humans so i'm like
stop it [lah] what the hell stop stop stop stop stop then i put my hand in between them then one of them
[oh] got caught caught or
what is it what is it called they they hook my hand basically they wrap themselves around my hand then they kick then they bite also then my hand started bleeding [ah]
because they follow the owner i'm their owner so if i'm aggressive i'm an aggressive person ya aggressive also but they are sweet too so which means i'm sweet [ah]
then ya so basically i put my hand to between them and then they scratched me and i cannot do anything about it i'll just
decided or i'll just wash a bit then i go to school [lah] i go to school then mister alan thought i was suicidal weak weak
mister alan did have you seen this snapchat picture i i merge his face with mine
no no no no as in you know snapchat we could merge our face i put my face with his face right
it was the perfect match i look like mister alan in a young girl's body and i felt
weird later i will send you ya okay to sum sum it all up i guess i_t_e !woo! poly !aww!
i feel like ya i feel like going back right i had i don't know
i want to kit from there the kits that are so pretty and so cheap
i i guess so i don't know i guess ya and then but the thing is i feel like we should also move on [lah]
k and k got that
you can put your earpiece back on
!yay! okay (um) [oh] my god can you imagine i cakap !yay! pula nanti dia kena transcribe lagi takpe takpe okay
so anyway (um) how has your work been
[oh] how come [ah] how come boleh
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay
how long was it [eh] the practicum
!huh! so fast
but still two and a half months pass by quite cepat actually [kan]
[oh] cause macam
bila you start the project [dah] start is it the project that they were doing at the place
(mm)
[oh] [eh] the area dekat dekat mana though
[oh] ya okay ya ya ya no no (err) what was i
what was i going to ask [oh] but then macam was it susah to like
suddenly
you know y~ you you took on like new cases atau existing cases that they pass on to you gitu macam tak hard to adjust
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
macam short staff short staff sikit [lah] gitu
[oh] no
[oh]
[oh] i think i remember your office dekat mana dia tempat (uh) my office dulu [kan] daerah situ
(mm)
(uh) apa apa itu nak cakap (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya that that's why
ya
ya [oh] so
they offered you full time is it
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[oh] tapi padahal they
[oh]
(mm)
ya so macam your experience is good [lah] from the [oh]
and then macam environment besides environment wise macam your your bosses and your supervisors and your teammates all macam okay [lah] like okay like no issues
that's good that's refreshing
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
pasal dia dah biasa with what macam
dia dah buat
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya that's (mm) awkward
tidak apa [lah] kita apa itu take turns
(mm)
(mm)
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
(mm)
wait that that that's a good thing [kan] or
(mm)
(mm)
ya
are there ada interns lain or you just seorang intern like or like got other people macam doing their practicum there also
i see okay okay wait the interns usually macam fresh grads or
all macam budak masters or like budak degree macam you know same level as you
[oh] okay
or people with experience [lah] so they don't have to train so much
independent
(mm)
i see
ya
(mm) lol
ya
ya that's true
[oh] that's a lot
that's why #siao#
(mm)
ya
[oh] so it's not macam it's not necessarily a happy time for them kind of thing
ketawa but then hundred cases for the whole for the whole year atau
i mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
[oh] so not like say this month i have ten next month i have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
[oh]
ya
ya ya ya ya i mean i feel like that's a common how to say a recurring issue in a lot of macam
what i hear from a lot of my social worker friends
macam organisations [lah]
you know ada this issue
so you're not gonna take take up their
apa itu offer so called
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] okay
ya
(mm)
it's okay keep your options open then macam explore (um) you know macam lain opportunities when do they need to hear by
(uh) okay tapi tidak ada tidak ada macam deadline for the application
[ah] okay okay
[ah]
ya faham faham totally faham
i mean i got exam but i don't think that is comparable
am i am i talking too loud like do you do you feel like i'm talking very loud
no right
cause tadi bila i ketawa [kan] dia punya line macam besar
the phone the mic
ya see when i laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like [oh] no sorry whoever's transcribing i'm so sorry okay
apa nak cakap (mm)
[oh] okay ya i totally understand macam the need to take a break i mean
that's where i'm at i mean that's not where i'm at i'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
(mm) make sense ya make sense i mean you also still
studying [kan] lagi berapa lama before you finish the when you finish your masters
tak necessary is it
(mm)
(mm) [ah] ya ya understand i feel like i'm there also i'm thinking macam you know i really don't mind
considering a different industry i mean at this point like my previous job was doing what i liked
but like it was
(mm) dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what i wanted to do like child psychology in (uh) you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then i got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
so macam who knows maybe if i if a a different place macam even a different job a different industry i could enjoy it enjoy learning something new even if you know it's not something that is related to our degree [lah] gitu
(mm) it's been good i am teaching
okay is macam zoom is surprisingly so much harder than tak zoom you know like it's so hard like you have to take note of everything like macam you have to make sure everyone is paying attention you cannot
talk you cannot macam how to say cause zoom if two people talk at the same time then you cannot hear one of them so i must be careful not to interrupt the teacher who's leading the particular lesson cause like (um) when i
eventually when i'm no longer a trainee i will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
(um) switch [lah] so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and i was like [oh] my god
and then macam the way you talk to them actually on zoom [kan] you don't command as much like authority or respect i feel so macam the tone macam they taught us we cannot be like can you please you we must be like i need you to stop
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me [lah] cause i i i have a habit of being like can you can you (um) (err) i need i'll be like (err) [oh] sit down okay or like (err)
i need you to be quiet okay or like can you be q~ can you be a little quiet actually i'm i'm like okay i can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want [lah]
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
(mm) be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
ya i mean right now they hardly recognize me also because i'm not their regu~ regular teacher and then macam i get a bit sub con~ [ah] subconscious a bit conscious bila i punya camera on so macam when my camera itu on so i boleh nampak my own videos i'm like hate this makes me very macam self-conscious gitu [lah]
so tapi bila i off (um) i am less self-conscious i can be less
(err) i can be more strict gitu tapi i tend to not because kita have to senyum for the entire lesson senyum for the entire forty five minutes to an hour so macam
kalau macam camera off then i will terlupa to senyum gitu [lah] ya so a lot of things to take note macam
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
tapi dia orang macam type nonsense tau macam hi hi hi hi macam
kalau answer dia a they be like a a a a then i'm like
kind of thing you know so it's like (ugh) but then okay [lah] they are cute and i'm getting the hang of it i think tapi [ah] last week i did not teach because (um) [oh] so on thursday i injured my back
i went to the gym to the gym and then i injured my back and then bila i balik
no one week ago so ya so one week ago i tak warm up [lah] it was really stupid i forgot to warm up and then i just angkat berat then i felt like macam a sharp pain in my back then i was like [oh] no
so i thought i thought macam okay okay is it because i'm sore asal asal macam susah ini i feel like everything feels heavier and more i i feel like everything was sore i thought okay maybe
you know my period's coming
[tau] like i'm just tired not enough sleep so i just continued but then it continued to
be sakit [lah] then macam i really messed up like !aiya! something is wrong [lah] this not normal this not like normal soreness it's like probably a sprain or a strain on my back tapi i continue whatever i can but lepas i balik i had a class [lah] and then during the class i told them i will be lambat sikit because
i am moving very slowly so be like my neighbour macam this slow then i i drop my soap and i couldn't bend to pick it back up
kind of thing so macam so when i joined the class they were very understanding sorry i joined the class usually kita will jumpa about half an hour before the kids come in so i came in about twenty minutes before the kids come in [lah] so it's still okay
and then macam (um) i told them about it and then eventually af~ i think after the class she told my (um) how to say my not my supervisor [lah] she told my
superior about it not the like the boss boss but the the girl who was like training us and everything so the girl told me that saturday tak payah so macam you have to clock in a certain number of hours for training before we become like a you know a full time like teacher
jadi on saturday she told me (uh) tak payah kerja because ya she she told me to like rest and then friday that friday also i was supposed to go to the gym cause i had a training
tapi i tak pergi cause my back sakit so i was like okay [lah] okay [lah]
i'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came (uh) okay [lah] like out of the six of us only like four people c~ [eh] two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
ya tapi
ya then after that i thought okay just rest [lah] macam take this opportunity to rest so i rest tapi lepas itu macam tak baik-baik ini pun macam tak baik-baik and then macam it hurts when i sneeze so i thought !alamak! ini macam not macam bukan tak normal [kan] ya
ya so i told my coach semalam yang it hurts when i sneeze so she said (mm) she's worried that is a nerve thing rather than a muscle thing so i started to panic and then she was like [oh] maybe you should go sebab kalau pergi g_p the only thing a g_p will do is give painkillers
so she was like i think you might need to see a sports doctor you can like to get an m_r_i or something so i was like tak nak so she was like okay [lah] then macam tengok chiro or like (uh) get a sports massage [lah] so i tried making an appointment with my other coach who does like bekam
and sports massage cause i read like bekam can help with like nerve macam you know what if your nerve macam (err) nerve pinching i feel like sometimes you macam you your muscle you pull your muscle then your nerve like gets pinched or something so macam it's apparently bekam can help with that and macam
ya bekam can help you with that i takut sakit tak have you tried it before
[oh] did she say if tak sakit [eh]
(mm)
(uh) yes but in that case do you want to go with me i'm going on monday
i think like there's
(mm) you free [kan] dekat #gambas# that's where my other gym is
there's
(uh) dekat #sembawang# there got another branch this gym has another branch in the east i think my the coach that (um) has is qualified to do like the massage and the bekam is dekat will be at the #gambas# one on monday
(err) she asked me if i can make it at two thirty then after that she belum reply i so i tak tahu belum confirm [ah] tapi
i'm hoping that !aiya! i can go
did she reply me nope not yet
itu pasal she haven't reply so i said okay how long is the session and how much is it so macam
so no reply but i read on on the website is like sixty minutes and then macam what she will do depends on your condition so macam either i mean you can ask for her to bekam [lah] if you that's what you want macam mana otherwise she will (uh) base it base her like you know on her professional opinion whether you need a massage or a bekam or like some mobility work [ah]
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
(mm) tapi i think she buat bekam angin if i'm not wrong cause i think i saw a video of her doing bekam on instagram can send you
no it looks like the angin one like ada macam after she put the cup like she pull something (mm) then the thing macam suction
go for the darah one
(mm)
[oh] so the dia macam slightly different how to say
(err) like bekam angin versus bekam darah macam target slightly different things [lah] gitu
[ah] okay
[oh]
i see okay good that i
don't then
(mm)
[oh] the dekat rumah dia is it
[oh] then hers is how much
[oh] i ada macam hundred around there standard right that's like standardish i guess
(mm)
(mm)
ya cause i was thinking if i went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that i was seeing when i was playing rugby [kan]
(um) like consultation dia sahaja dah
macam hundred she's really really good it's really good like if you ever have like a sports injury or a injury you got from like
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
(uh) tapi ya she she's a private doctor [lah] so very mahal like she sees a lot of like national athletes and stuff so her rates are like consultation sahaja hundred plus then macam if you go x-ray everything then it just adds up so like
ya just a lot
ya that's why i'm thinking
ya so i'm thinking about i'm thinking massage atau bekam dulu [lah] i mean kalau it's not like
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know i mean i can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
no [ah] abeh sekarang sekarang my kaki sakit dah [lah] belakang sakit kaki sakit because i pergi gym
for training yesterday [kan] then (uh) certain things #aqilah# [lah] like macam you know she
(uh) macam certain things she made me take it easy which was frustrating for me to take things i mean it it's not frustrating to me to take things easy in all other aspects of my life but when it comes to lifting you know macam i feel like my ego i have like macam like it's frustrating [lah]
like all the progress i've made gone so macam the the weight the weight the group that i was doing it with so we were we were progressing at the same pace so they are moving on to like eighty kilos ninety kilos yesterday and i was like thirty kilos
i was struggling because macam nak angkat sahaja sakit then the moment i felt like that stabbing pain i'll just like i scared [lah] so it's like cannot cannot cannot cannot
ya so she also like told me to just
ya and then tapi semalam ada sekarang my kaki sakit because my mother this like finisher thing that we had to do so macam like thirty squats like thirty sets of squats so macam
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
[oh] really [ah] tuesday i still have like (um) tomor~ today tomorrow monday three days for me to recover plus i'm going for massage on monday so unless the massage makes like more sakit then i'll let you know
i mean it wo~ it won't right like you don't have we don't have to like after bekam there's no like rule to not do any physical activity [kan] i mean kita jalan sahaja
so kalau kita i mean kita hiking right we're not it's not like we're gonna climb a mountain or anything it's okay if we're just walking it's good good for you movement is good i think for like you know aches and pains
[oh] my god my laughter is so cringe nanti orang transcribe
(mm)
[oh] that is so
[oh] my god
i cannot imagine i cannot imagine and then like
macam kita ketawa-ketawa abeh nanti all the haha hehes that kena transcribe i i cannot transcribe my own voice also [lah] can hardly listen to my own voice it's so cringey like it's it's so weird like you you don't sound like how you think you sound
you know
it's just like (ugh) gross
way lower than you thought
[oh]
(mm) and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high (mm)
ya ya ya
ya
the first time i heard my voice as in i feel like i sound like a preadolescent boy i kind of feel like i sound like a boy when i listen to it by myself my god i sound like a ten year old boy or something (uh)
cringe
ya i feel like i sound like a kid i think #inhan# sounds not like older than me i feel
i don't know i feel like i sound like a kid i don't i don't sound like like a girl i don't sound like a like a lady or a woman i just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now alr~ is any super heavily actually near my house
[oh] mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me [lah] i mean like you heard you heard my v~ okay okay
(mm)
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside i feel i think something like that [lah] it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not [kan] so it's a different ya so
i mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our ma~ our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans [oh] chris evans i thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
(err) ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
i wonder if we can talk about these politics i mean it's not all politics i mean it's not even politics it's just (ugh) celebrity
i guess
is it (mm) i had no idea i thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
[oh] anyway apa itu so
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
have you seen the list (uh) list pula have you seen the website yang i hantar
which which interest you the most i feel like the train track ones is cute but then i'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
i don't know [eh] macam the jinx tak [lah]
i mean mana-mana pun ada so it's me [lah]
ya but most of them are so far for you i think hillview is like the how to say dekat situ ada banyak trails i feel cause that's the nature reserve area
(mm)
your areas ada ke other trails macritchie is it wait no #sembawang# area
[oh]
ya that's true actually like if you want to cycle but well i can't cycle and now i just announced it apa nak cakap [eh] okay we can look at more sites [lah] think got more options tapi yang yang at the the one i sent you to (mm) kita ada the lower pierce reservoir park
(mm) #ang-mo-kio# park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
and then there's the #sungei-buloh# wetland reserve need ini dekat mana [eh] #kranji# hopefully doesn't rain though you know speaking of
(mm) ya and then there's
na~ dairy farm nature park
[oh] this one got stairs don't want malas they were like don't forget to wear comfortable shoes because you will be climbing some stairs
and this one quite
[oh] eco green
[oh] tapi is it like a like a mainstream park then everywhere knows about
like would it be very crowd~ is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
i know #afiqah# #afiqah# you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
actu~
she is married and i think she's doing like transcribing right now but full time like sort of that time ingat tak yang kita pergi makan
[eh] were you staying at our table
yang kita makan #mukshidonna# [oh] ya so she was talking about that
(mm)
she got married (uh) i if i'm not wrong she got married at quite (um) because like (err)
i guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and i don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so i think the period that she got married in right
(um) they only allow like ten people
(mm) and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it [lah] like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
(mm) i don't think so
[oh] is the is the one that her long term the one that always [eh] ya the one that's always been with her i've i think ya and he's really n~ he's really nice really nice so i think
i was talking about someone else
i don't know but ya
(mm)
okay maybe i just don't remember but ya
(mm)
not officially tapi like you know sometimes when we hang out and then like he meets up with her when we're going home i thought he fetches her and stuff like he's nice [lah] he just seems macam very shy a bit macam shy [lah] i mean like a group of girls then kita [kan] kecoh so i think maybe it's a bit awkward for him but ya
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything i think that's really good
ya and very macam considering he's quite young he's very macam independentish macam financially independent like ya like matured [lah] matured
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
(um)
i'm not sure i think her place
i think because like when i see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so i think
because (err) i assume her house i mean her house is big [kan] so i think and her room is big so i think macam he moved in with her [lah]
(mm) makes more sense
and padahal and i think in a way not that it always makes sense for the girl to move in with the guy until they can find a house tapi macam is easier pakai tudung leceh you know if you were like
i mean brother then okay [lah] i don't know whether he has brothers or not but like you know brother or someone else then she has to keep wearing tudung
[oh]
ya ya ya i feel like sometimes it tends to be like that because macam how to say the mother runs the house some sometimes [lah] like you know in most situations like you know she if she's a housewife especially then macam if the wife is also like a
i don't know like you know you might you know feel a bit ya i get what you mean tapi macam less of an issue kalau if the guy moves into the house cause he
i don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
i mean unless they are both working [ah] then maybe
i don't know i don't know what i'm saying but ya
what would i know
(mm)
[oh] like the dad is more chill [lah] usually
(uh) ya that's true i feel like macam there's that expectation [lah] double standards a bit ya
and also like cult~ it's a culture thing also [lah] like [oh] you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
not working ya because like [oh] perempuan kerja apa sahaja perempuan kerja you know sometimes they say things like that ya so it's makes it tough
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya i ya
that's true also that's true
ya ya ya ya it's like a double it's like a you expect you say that and on the other hand ya
especially macam your in your industry that you are working in like things change very fast
so macam if you come back after a few years then you're like (uh) you know some cause maternity leave is not enough like
just the maternity leave okay say it's like three months right around there is it not then after that four months okay then like is a four month old baby someone have to take care [kan] then it wil~ it might fall to the parents that's not fair so macam if you want to raise the kid until the age where the kid is like relatively
you know not independent independent but you know like of you know of the age where macam dah besar sikit then at least school age school going age you know
ya then when when he's at school or she's at school then it makes it you know slightly you have more time [lah] to like (uh) you know when when he's at school we're at work so your kid won't be like left alone and like someone has to take care of him or her
ya that's true
okay i think we're recording
(err) so my name is #umar# and my conversation partner today is
so
so ini hari we will be talking about corona virus
(err) in singapore and how so far kita kat sini at home and (uh) my family semua how we've been coping
(err) with all the jobs and all the (um) confinement semua kat rumah
how the family my family my mum and dad and my siblings and how i've been interacting dengan all my friends [lah] basically
so okay obviously okay i start [eh] so basically (um)
bila we heard about all this (um)
corona virus thing (err) dulu back then i was somewhat employed [lah]
then after that (um) when we heard about this corona virus issue actually i was in #jakarta# (err) celebrating chinese new year [lah]
terus (um) when i heard about it at first (err) it didn't seem like such a big deal [lah] because (um)
people over there were quite (err) rilek they didn't care too much about it and it seemed that
(err) maybe it won't be as such a big issue [lah] tapi after that when i came back (um)
i was given a couple of mask tapi i thought like okay [lah] not really necessary but (err) eventually it turns out that
(um) the the the hype so called or the whole issue (err) it it went up and then
so that time bila we saw it on the news (err) my my girlfriend's (uh) auntie [lah] so dia kasi
(uh) because she's a bit paranoid more than usual so she decided to buy us only macam ten masks or so something like this
habis (um) ask us to use it (err) when we are at the airport sebab (err) who knows [kan] especially indonesia agaknya maybe
not so safe [lah] and then (err) so i flew back i still wear the mask (uh) at first i thought macam too much [ah] actually macam maybe
it was a paranoia or something but when i came back to singapore (um) and then i slowly see singapore move to orange alert and then (um) the whole of singapore they were taking it very seriously
and (uh) at first i was going to work and slowly (um) you see more and more people
kat m_r_t station pakai mask habis (um) some of them (err) they there was no form of social distancing [ah] back then so there was no such advice but
mask ada quite a number of people they were wearing it [lah] and then (um) they decided to
eventually (err) make an announcement on t_v and said that dia punya mask ini semua actually not mandatory [lah] at first then cakap only kalau macam you sick (err) you stay at home
(err) just jaga yourself [lah] there's no need to go out (um) and then slowly they start to quarantine and then slowly start to close the border and then
(um) slowly fall into the whole circuit breaker thing but in between there's a lot of doubt banyak orang orang macam didn't quite understand why we had to do certain things why the government asked to do certain things
maybe (err) eventually (um) it escalated to that level where it became a global pandemic [lah] habis malaysia orang malaysia affected orang indonesia affected
at first singapore was the first i remember we were actually the first ranked to macam got on the list [lah]
[ah] so at first we were the first habis
(um) we were eventually taken over by (um) okay [eh] at first it was china [lah] and then second it was singapore
at first [ah] this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries (uh) in italy
(err) in euro and then slowly got to america and now sekarang [kan] kita in a state where (um)
u_s is the highest [lah] so singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
(err) but that's how i remembered my experience (um) when it first started (err) and how at that point of time i was
employed habis sekarang macam like looking for job because (uh)
let's put it like (um) i wasn't employed anymore (err) after this whole situation so now looking for job [lah]
how about your experience macam mana you were coping with it
okay to be fair i don't think siapa siapa anyone [lah] was expecting this kind of situation to just suddenly appear
and i think a lot of businesses were impacted banyak (um) even home based business at some point was (err) affected [kan]
(uh) that was quite bad like the whole malay community like more or less macam slammed her
some authority figure [ah]
ya but (err) because of what she said a lot of people macam tak satisfied [lah] diorang macam
you know
i'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
(um) kena pulau rabak rabak [lah] basically because of her statement she even
ya and
i think
i think like most people what she should have done is even though sometimes you may think you may be right or niat dia the niat is there [lah] tapi macam
sometimes it's not about being right sometimes it's about being kind you know yes sure your intention is good macam nak tolong all these regulation issue [ah]
tapi sometimes it's about you you have to think about your consequences okay [lah] i mean of course the idea was not to be viral and not to get all this attention
tapi because of your words and especially now people are so uptight during this covid situation is (um) what she should have done was
after she did it and of course nak return balik dia punya statement susah [kan] but at least macam just go out there and just apologize properly
and say that (uh) you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen (err)
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say (err) i understand
tapi she chose to macam go online and just tell everyone all off that kind of thing is just crazy there's a lot of
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole covid situation that (err) gone viral for no reason
(um)
and (err) some of them are funny macam the recent one where the foodpanda rider just waving around
and i thought it was our good friend #hadi# because okay to be fair sebab
#hadi# dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when i see #hadi# [kan]
last time when he was riding panda foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
habis he will macam [ah] be in that exact same attire and the exact same pants cuma bike is slightly different [lah]
like the first time i saw it macam this could be #hadi#
it could really have been #hadi# the way they dress dia punya seluar dengan dia punya helmet dia punya visor
that's why i tagged him and a lot of people thought that i was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny [ah] but i saw the article [lah] i think mothership covered this article about him
(uh) unmarried guy twenty four year old guy but (uh) i think a lot of people macam does really
(um) macam it's an unsung hero kind of thing so people were quite (uh) positive feedback [ah] about the guy dia super extra [ah]
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes [kan]
because if you think about it (um) just the fact that during this whole (uh) circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
and (um) while it's widely recognised by society singaporeans at large tapi macam it's not something officially recognized by the government
so it's a good analogy to say macam this guy this #mat# just naik motor habis just riding and
he is not part of the actual celebration of they are not actually celebrating him it's just that dia macam very extra so he just happen to be there and he just
(err) actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's foodpanda but it's also the fact that
(err) the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
(mm) (mm)
(mm) well i have this opinion about (uh) all these food delivery [ah] so to my understanding [ah]
(err) the first tak salah deliveroo was to start all this tapi in singapore i don't know whether is uber x or grab or something [lah]
but what i really feel about food delivery is dia macam quite the game changer okay just think about this for a second [ah] about grab drivers (err) not grab drivers
but (err) food delivery [eh] so i feel that (um) it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all (um)
people who are do food delivery all this kalau they really macam really work hard macam #chiong# all the way [ah] macam maybe eight hours #chiong# all the way macam #hadi# for example [kan]
(um) they can earn about three thousand four thousand or even five thousand a month depending on macam mana they hit dia punya incentive or macam mana they hit dia punya
(um) hours or dia punya right timing [ah] because all these riders [kan] macam dorang [dah] experience for a very long time they will know a certain technique or certain tactic
how to do it right kedai mana (um)
prepare food quickly kedai mana prepare food very slow they know how to play the game [lah] basically so if you think about it they can potentially earn a white collar salary
and they are blue (err) blue collar workers [kan] so think about this for a second [eh] to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an in~ interview
you don't need to (um) like basically if you apply [kan] most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you n level you're o level you're a level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
and how skillful you are and how you deliver and how you strategize macam your delivery [ah]
so i thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for (uh) the lower income group to catch up
to the upper income group because macam especially during circuit breaker period a lot of people and the delivery price isn't very cheap also
so every delivery macam ya macam every delivery is about ala carte you pay about four dollars (uh) or something [ah] per delivery so
chances are and even there's rich people macam (err)  beli kopi just one and then they they get the person to deliver and they they they they they
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it [kan] so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar (err) job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing i like about (err) food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
no pre~ much prerequisite [lah] maybe if you macam nak deliver naik motor [kan] then
[ah] kena pakai lesen you have to prove your lesen [lah] but if you are walking or you are riding a bicycle you don't need to
then think about this so i saw an interview (err) macam documentary [lah] don't know on grab and how (err) some of the handicap people
(um) they managed to get jobs in grab macam dulu (um) when they before grab [kan] macam there's almost very little or no job they can do at all
so maybe some of them they did say macam if you are in a wheelchair maybe you can do admin job yes tapi ada orang macam down syndrome for example they can't really do much and
to be a person growing up with this kind of handicap you know macam is like a big beb~ macam beban
duduk kat rumah jadi beban [jer] puas hati macam you go out earn whatever little money you can and i saw this (uh) girl this malay girl in a wheelchair [lah]
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day [lah] for example on her electric (err) wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
of how slow the electric chair also you you can't expect to deliver [lah] maybe satu hari deliver four or five items [lah] for example
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is [ah] okay and maybe people might tip her or something i don't know
but the fact is (um) you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet [lah]
so macam berdikari [lah] so instead of
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
the interface macam the training everything it allows you to do such a simple
(err) it it simplifies the task basically pergi sendiri pick up pergi sana drop off so it it it gives this
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to (err)
admin position or something macam kena interview tak tahu pass ke tak (err) your experience whatsoever like a normal job
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have o level or you are in a wheelchair
you will get it you will get it most likely you will get it unless macam kalau too saturated or something [lah] there's too much driver around so i thought that was quite interesting as well
(um) the way that the food delivery has changed the landscape of earnings and how (uh) blue collar workers can potentially earn white collar workers punya salary
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway (um) with regards to that (uh) there are some people who are like that as well
and i guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an in~ indiscrimination kind of
(err) (err) employment
(err) i don't know if this is an actual word indiscriminatory indiscriminate macam
you you don't get (err) you don't get denied (err) okay selalunya the idea is when you do the employment [kan] (err) you cannot be judged based on your i don't know (err) race or
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis [lah] in singapore so whether you are (uh) as mentioned before whether you are
(err) low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide [kan]
so macam for example delivery if you want to work you turn it on and then you work when you're done you're done
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver i assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver [kan]
so (err) nak kerja kerja tak nak kerja sudah so when you're tired you get home
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab (err) you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your (err) (err) picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
so that so called keep them motivated [lah] whereas macam delivery for motorbike delivery for example bicycle delivery you're not tied down
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really (err) let's say you already have a bicycle [lah] let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
and you don't have that burden of [oh] hari ini kena buat sepuluh delivery for example no you earn how much you get that's yours
so it it simplifies a little bit
[ah] yes okay definitely [lah] so basically macam you go to the shop and then the food costs ten dollars (err) what you get
is (um) basically is through the app punya interface [ah] so as if the app interface says you earn seven dollars that seven dollars is yours [lah]
it's it's already a net amount dorang already cut off whatever that needs to be cut off (err) because sometimes
for example (um) whatever the food is dorang [dah] minus the food amount so (err) this delivery apps they alreally take a bit of your card
terus (err) whatever is shown in your phone macam you earn let's say six dollar forty five cents for example [ah] that's yours [lah] basically
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
you are okay let's say you are riding habis habis aleh-aleh dia hujan
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
[oh] tak !ee! i still got to go on i need to hit (um) ten deliveries today or (uh) i cannot pay my rental or whatsoever so
it has that sort of it extended flexibility [ah] and i don't think a lot of singaporeans see it this way [lah] it's just something i just thought about recently
and how it is a good way for people macam let's say they have spare time [ah] macam let's say they work nine to five
habis malam macam they got nothing to do they just wanna okay tell you what let me just turn on my device and then (err) just make a few deliveries on the way home maybe
maybe (err) do a three hour trip (err) three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home [lah] so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
(uh) as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that (um) a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such (uh) active (um) kind of employment especially for the lower income (uh) people to help a bridge to the higher income people
(err) ya so we were supposed to talk about corona virus tapi sekarang [dah] starting so much on delivery
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay i think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
(err) it does
(um) so during the circuit breaker period of [pe] was it two months
i think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing (um) did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery (err) did you meet anyone or
okay question online exam what is stopping people from i mean to buku letak kat tepi
[oh] okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
what sort of (err) security feature or identification yang dorang implement
[kan] risau
no [lah] if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say [eh] i'm doing this (err) exam (err) next week
(err) i pay you two hundred dollars [lah] just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay [pe]
man i don't think i can i don't think i can go back to school already macam kirim salam [ah]
seriously
i mean who you would you get to the level where you think you are at the not say pinnacle [lah] but you think that you are macam everything [dah] okay
and you you think that you you can survive on that level of education project kerja just to survive on the salary from that job
(um) but i kudos to you [lah] memang is not easy to go back to school when i if you ask me to do it now i would probably won't don't it
right well characters is something inevitable
or facebook ada politics [pe] sekolah pun ada politics [pe] but one thing i okay so just to do a very very
brief shallow comparison between school and work i would say that
in school walaupun you don't have to go everyday and you can plan your timetable whatever belajar but apparently you always have this
sinking feeling at the back of your head that macam there's exam coming up and you know you should be studying macam nak enjoy susah
tapi okay it it depends on people right so (um)
i think also it depends on school as well [ah] because when i was in uni (uh) (um) a lot of people who went to s_i_m like me [kan] they (err)
two major popular universities that they went to is either r_m_i_t or [eh] u_o_l so u_o_l macam sekolah so basically you study throughout the whole year
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
whereas for r_m_i_t the one that i went to basically (err) buat project
(err) it it it becomes like what (uh) eighty percent of your grade then twenty percent kat belakang exam
so in a way you can balance [oh] out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
so that contributes to maybe twenty percent tapi kalau you have macam ada solid group you can work with
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but (err)
i don't know maybe your school is not like that maybe your school is exam based or but i am sure yours ada project [kan]
sometimes (err) if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway i think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
(err) for a couple of years you actually (um) understand and appreciate what (err) higher academia can bring compared
to your peers (err) in school at the moment [kan] even for myself [kan] if you ask me to go to school now and i were to go to school and (um) if i really want it
i think i would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or (uh) it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
and you know where it unlocks you to you know as compared to macam all these budak budak they still have not have a taste of full life macam full working employment yet
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so i can understand i mean we were all once students who i mean even yourself when you were in poly
(um) you know it's the uncertainty of (err) okay [lah]
you know if i don't do well then don't do well [lah] you know but (uh) once you are in a position where you are out
that's why i think a lot of my friends yang (um) went to you uni sim basically (err) university
night university [lah] so dia orang juggle between the job and basically if you do that you are throwing away your life [ah] there's no more social life basically
(err) pagi pagi daytime you go to work and then (err) malam then you go to school
and then you rinse and repeat basically you need to find time nak buat (err) nak buat group assignment nak study untuk exam at the same time in the daytime you are working
is very exhausting and (um) some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful (err) well kudos them
ya there's a lot of compromise (err) and you have to be willing to macam at least throw away one aspect of your life and typically is social [lah] because there's so much there's only so much sleep you can throw away
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
no [lah] at first to be honest [ah] at first bila all this thing happen [kan] macam (um) it's interesting (err) because is something novel
macam is not common apa dulu to to (um) communicate through okay maybe for you [lah] but for me it's i it's not common for me to do video calls
even with my own family tapi when this first thing happen and you will start communicating with your friends online
(err) at the comforts of your own home on your own bed anytime (uh) kerja (err) in your own room
it it seems fun at the beginning but afterward macam i think it depends on people also [lah] because ada orang ada orang boleh focus when they're at home
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by i don't know
snacks [lah] toilet [lah]
or the bed sleep [lah] take a nap during lunch time tu semua for some people it it it it's harder
you know because everything is there already and we just whereas kalau macam kat tempat kerja you've got to drag your ass and then
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people (um)
they switch into mode you know macam home mode (err) duduk kat rumah macam
more relaxed and then they are in that environment of relaxing cause for me when i'm at home i'm always feel like i'm in relaxing punya mode
and when i'm out i feel like i'm in out mode you know when your hair is macam all wax style and then
[ah] you know you're wearing clothes (um) and then you go out and [eh] you you just have that vibe macam i'm i'm ready to take on the work
you know macam when you're home you just want to relax lie on the bed watch video netflix or whatever so when you you mix that kind of black and white and you get that greyish kind of area
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
(err) i don't know for me it would be doubly hard
(um) if doubly is even a word for studying
so !aiya! i mean so
no don't get me wrong i enjoy i enjoy the break i enjoy the break in (um) i enjoy the break in the regimen i enjoy the break in dia punya scheduling and stuff like that tapi
i don't know [eh] ultimately it is a state of mind [lah] so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
macam dekat rumah you can just eat macam you can snack and all that shit (err) but kalau kat luar (uh) macam you need to walk for it and (uh) i don't know
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
do you okay do you know that when you okay let's say when you deli~ (err) do delivery (uh) i think the so called delivery fee is about macam four dollars something like this [kan]
but if you are on foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to google you just type (err) foodpanda pro
and you can actually see they have macam those package and the funny thing is if that month you just order two times you already make up for it because the the most basic package tak salah is (err)
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so i i don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
no it's like a pass [lah] it's not really a promo if you say promo means it's apa macam limited edition [kan] tapi it's actually has been around for awhile
circuit breaker i wasn't sure but (err) if you go now it's definitely available
[oh] well people still deliver food a lot of people still macam still work from home [pe] banyak orang work from home [pe] sekarang [lah]
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well #nurul# didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker [lah] so it's a different story but for those people who
can work remotely they've been working remotely all this while sampai sekarang
suspect until the end of the year [ah]
fishy [ah] the russian punya vaccine they didn't complete the trial the trial number three [what]
entah [eh]
entah [lah]
personally i think if at the by the end of the year i manage to go one vacation i'm actually more or less quite happy already
i went this year i went #jakarta# once only
that was the only overseas trip i did this year
what the the the thing happened in february ya the thing happened in february [what]
it was very fast
ya well i think also because in feb~ (err) late january it was chinese new year i had to go #jakarta# but i think we were supposed
to go i mean i was scheduled to go for another vacation i think in may or
no not may (err) april or something [ah] it didn't happen anyway so [ah] whatever [lah]
well kalau at the end of this year dapat pergi dapat pergi malaysia pun i'm quite happy already to be honest
just need a break cause okay if you think about it [kan] people other than singapore
all the other countries at least dapat pergi somewhere within their own country [kan] so malaysia even malaysia or indonesia
even though their borders are closed at least boleh pergi #penang# dapat pergi (um) i don't know
for one of the islands #perhentian# islands or something you know #sentosa# nak pergi #sentosa# #sentosa# ada apa kau [dah] kenapa

(mm)
women who who who
[oh] my god and then then sekarang sekolah macam mana masih kat sekol~ (uh) masih kat rumah juga
[oh]
ya actually that [one] [sia] the
(uh) what work (uh) work from home and like h_b_l all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard [lah] because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
susah sikit [ah] nak call call cikgu cikgu ini semua like
leceh
more like like usually you know when you go to the class then you like kenal all the muka muka of all the cikgu
then you can
macam berbual berbual sikit
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on microsoft teams or like skype or like [what] or they use zoo~ zoom [ah]
zoom
it's like a bit awkward [ah] because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
ya it's like it's like you berbual with like some
orang yang tak kenal [kan] then susah nak berbual [lah] pasal like
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
i tak kenal anyone
like not even the profile picture [dah] ada dia orang belum letak lagi you know
so i don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say [eh] teacher how to do this [one]
you know
[oh] god but then now that at home right
during class all i keep watching tik tok [ah] then

(uh) that time during (uh) lockdown tak ada orang kat road [pe] jalan jalan
so like just cycle cycle [jer] [ah] orang orang then just
tak ada orang nak kacau
then kau buat apa since (uh) h_b_l
(um)
confirm your intern also work from home then selepas itu ada banyak benda nak buat
(mm) what what what kind of activities is inside your morning routine

so
[oh] my god ya baru makan [seh]

nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
[oh] my god animal crossing
it's been a while since i touch that game
then that time i go buy the switch with you right
ya like i buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya i buy like how much [ah] six hundred plus dollar then i buy with that game the diablo three
ya but then like when i play when i buy only after that i never play you know
i never played the diablo three i think it became like what i buy i buy for
eighty five dollars then after that i never even like
i never even play that much like i only played it like maximum like fifteen times
like fifteen minutes fifteen min~
then selepas itu the game now inside my cupboard
(uh) [dah] berapa lama like [dah] tak main collect berabuk
dalam cupboard
macam apa [ah]
ya then then that time that time also i like i beli the what animal crossing sembilan puluh dollar
i tak tahu [sia] boleh boleh beli dekat kedai for like only eighty five dollar
but then i go beli on the nintendo switch shop
untuk for like
berapa like sembilan puluh dollar lebih u_s_d
then actually i spent almost one hundred dollars on like animal crossing for no reason
ya
it was a bit sad [lah] but then
[dah] wha~ [dah] beli [kan] nak buat apa
damn you should play it
[oh] my god you just now just saw you say miss #bae# right like miss #bae# from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school [sia] i haven't been to like visit secondary school swe~
why you don't want
[dah] lama [seh] tak berbual dengan cikgu cikgu melayu all
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
ya [dah] lama [seh] tak berbual then like macam you see other than cikgu dia baik juga [ah] dengan kita orang
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the [one] i was i was the [one] i was of his first student
no i was his first student
first [one]
okay [ah] i might be the worst [ah] but like i'm i'm i'm the first
i'm the first at the best
ya no [lah] he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be with~ without him right i think i already fail art
o o level
ya no because like actually before he came i was with mister #irman#
that teacher
then after that like (uh) i because he got too many students then after that everytime i ask him for help he will like put me aside you know because he you know like his perang~ his (uh) attitude [ah] he's like he would prefer to like (uh) (uh) give his attention to those who are better you know
he want to keep the a students a then after that like macam
macam he
selepas itu diam diam i was like ignore [ah]
dia macam tak suka layan my my artworks then he tak nak really tolong
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
tak apa [ah]
selepas itu then like mister #shafrin# came
the person that came mabuk
he like he like one malaikat like that
for o level art i think i i wanted to do like some [oh] remember me beli the right then after that like i take pictures of the dia keras
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like (uh)
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what studio ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
no because it showed like macam the perspective of how a small person just as a big person would be
(um)
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
(uh) what [ah] it became like
i just did a photoshop [lah] of people like climbing onto the that was very old
[oh]
ya
and then i just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so i just took some pictures of like people and then like i edited it into the
into the scene [lah] so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya [eh] i remember you were doing also [ah] but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
[oh] my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the c_c_a
it's very hard to use your focus on your c_c_a and your studies at the same time
ya
then like i also like jumpa a lot of pak cik
the selalu kata to me [ah] like
(uh)
selepas sekolah selalu just pergi
trail
then selepas itu like
it's (uh) satu jam cycle from rumah all the way back to
the trail then selepas itu from the trail pergi rumah tak sampai satu jam pon
selepas sekolah but then like
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic [kan]
i tak rasa like can boleh boleh buat benda mcam gini [ah] because nanti terlalu penat [ah] selepas selepas sekolah [dah] penat then selepas itu nak pergi cycle selepas cy~ selepas kayuh kayuh kayuh [dah] lagi penat
then selepas itu
(uh) hari hari selpas itu masih kena pergi sekolah juga
semakin penat [seh]
like that salah buat
ya
just penat
tired
even in english also i can say like tired [lah]
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me [ah] in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester i will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
like still masih tak [tau] [ah] ada rasa macam nak masuk jadi orang army [kan]
tapi selepas itu
macam takut [ah] takut kena dapat kerja merepek [ah]
it's
i don't know [ah] people here people always say [ah] macam if sign on [oh] later you
you kena you will kena banyak banyak [ah]
nanti tak tak enjoy you know
ya
but
but sadly gitu [ah] like engineering
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why i would rather go to army [ah] even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because #sui-sui# in engineering
(mm) got chem~ chemical engineering
[oh] my god tapi ya earn and learn itu sekarang banyak orang tengah apply
my mum also kata like macam nak ambil juga [ah] it's like boleh upgrade skills but at the same time boleh belajar [eh] no boleh like kerja and then and earn duit
you know
[ah]
[a'ah] gaji dia tak seberapa tapi it's
lebih bagus daripada tak ada apa apa terus
[ah] then selepas itu nowadays also
banyak orang tengah hilang kerja
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you [oh] we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of covid you know
l banyak orang kena pecat so quite sedih though
ya then also like
you know that time i saw like channel newsasia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
ya it's like quite sad like i know singaporeans like gaji
banyak juga [ah] tapi like
tak seberapa [pe] like
one person like my friend i heard before he earn like [what] five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst [one] is the people who who already have high pay [lah] because their
their lifestyle is already like (uh) i have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
then selepas itu like if tiba tiba the [oh] gaji potong then like their lifestyle is still the same you know
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard [lah]
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
[eh] why gym close [ah] cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
ya rumah dia orang terlalu kecik [ah] then also tak boleh work out kat rumah [kan]
then selepas itu even if kalau dia orang work out kat rumah nanti mak dia orang kacau or like adik beradik kacau
[oh] my god talking about working out at home
you got see channel newsasia
they were like showing like macam a got these people they were doing like zoom workouts
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like zoom workouts
but then the coach was act~ originally like a
(uh)
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase [ah] then they people were like following him
i feel like it's good [ah] because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay [ah] obviously there's some limitations [ah]
but
ya he went to the extent
no [ah] because his house was too small like he he he showed (uh) showed the
like t_v programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
so like selepas itu he just buat kat tangga [ah] kat tangga lebih banyak ruang [pe]
ya
then selepas itu also got the malay dance group
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the zoom call
so basically they just individually semua like joget kat depan camera
savage love ya i don't know but then like
but then like they just joget at the camera individually but then like they did like their own solo part then there
it's quite cool [ah] because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun [ah]
you just open up the game that [one] [ah] yang ada minecraft that [one] then you farm farm kat dalam game
sama juga [pe] like you
berkebun
[oh] my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren #tan# that [one] or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like [eh] you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside [ah] like what if hap~ what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
i know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like i don't i don't eat vegetable [sia] but i like the concept
ya tak suka [ah] makan sayur rasa macam rumput gitu like
to me to to me like sayur semua rasa sama
it's like
but rasanya macam bila gigit daun then keluar air
rasa dia semua sama tak pernah tukar even kalau ada sambal [kan] sambalnya just tutup dia punya air like when i gigit into the sayur right masih rasa [eh] ini macam sayur macam daun keluar air then ada sambal itu [jer]
tak pernah rasa lain [ah]
tapi sayur bagus untuk kesihatan
tak nak tak nak
tak suka sayur
tak suka sayur tapi suka earth so mesti
so must (uh) buat hydroponic gitu [lah]
yes
ya
and eating all the kambing the kambing semua makan rumput [kan]
rumput buat oxygen
saya makan kambing semua untuk save the earth
ya lebih rumput you know
(mm) but mutton taste so good
i know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
[oh] my god you know actually why i love hydroponics so much
i got tell you before last time when i primary school i was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion i had during second~ [eh] during primary school
(um)
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like (uh) they showed (uh) around [lah] like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube [kan]
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
then macam very cool [lah] then selepas itu [kan]
i menang something
because dia orang buat macam ada kecil punya competition [ah] untuk macam bagi budak budak chance bawa balik benda
then after that i menang
i menang like a small pokok ribena
ya
i think same thing like grape [ah] dia like mash mash mash
then after that dia orang macam just kumpul together then buat macam syrup
[a'ah]
ya
ya i think the moment they like boil and then after that they make macam like concentrate
then selepas itu dia orang campur dengan air syrup gitu [ah] untuk buat yang kita buy itu
more thick
like more pekat [ah] i think i think confirm got like got like sugar inside li~ like sugar syrup
to make it more thick
but ya then after that i men~ i won the pokok
no dia orang just tanya like macam
(uh) they just ask about the facts on the pokok [ah] like the hydroponic or like how how like i forgot [what] [ah] like macam
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like sec~ primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything [ah]
ya but then i don't know what happened to the ribena plant [ah] i think my mum throw away already
i think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya i think so i don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like (uh)
actually i saw this one whole circuit
[oh] like hydroponic
it's like very cool i think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
ya [lah] because obviously like the plants pon contr~ constantly be like con~ (uh) consuming
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenh~ greenhouse effect [ah]
ya f_y_p question [ah]

[oh] k k k [ah]
(mm)
first ya
real relationship
[ah] that one stupid [ah]
that's kind of long [sia]
that's like two years later [eh]
but technically speaking if he comes back to you after two years right i think you would have moved on [sia]
i think you would have moved on already
like now you're in the process
i think after six months you already dah dah dah tak kisah ya
feelings balik
for you for him it's easy
because guys will have the mindset that they can get everything they get they want
serious serious they they can they will use that
they'll i don't know what what power [lah] okay but macam dia orang they have like this mindset right that they okay anything i say or anything i do confirm girls confirm girls will fall for it
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
the thing is you don't know that's why
exactly
siapa
aku dah cakap [lah] dia dia kalau comfortable dengan orang tu dia dia selalu buat gitu
[oh] my god
#astarghfirullahalazim#
bukan adik kau yang
adik kau pil~ pilih si izuan ke [ah] dia cakap [eh] kau ni bapak kau tak lawa tak handsome ke macam
i don't know why many people many girls find #izuan# handsome termasuk kau but
i don't know it's just me even elfie cakap [tau] ya ya !oi! that time aku tanya dia [eh]
[eh] iya ke jazli and #izuan# handsome
then dia kata [a'ah] not bad why abeh dia cakap dia orang handsome ke because most girls find find them hand~ handsome
aku macam
no sorry
yes
for sure [lah] correct correct
(mm)
that one ya that one (mm) ya that's the truth [ah]
#izuan# is like
he came into the picture later exactly
kau jangan #wei# sembilan belas ada yang dah tunang [sia]
dua puluh satu dah nak kahwin [seh]
izuan kau nak tengok kat izuan izuan ada apa
radam gaduh
maybe ten percent ya
i'm not supposed to tell you
i mean you cannot tell [lah] but
i mean some other way kau boleh macam
okay you get the feeling
[oh]
ya exactly
i mean if you moved on already what can you say
if the feelings hilang already what
okay if caring okay
his one right i think his type of like macam
(err) his kind of
convincing or talk or apa apa [ah] in general
his type is to like macam lead you on
lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
okay macam okay
#humairah# said that he still like macam cakap to you cakap
he talks to #humairah# about you right
k that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say [oh] i just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what i meant by he keeps leading on
[ah]
tu pasal
so you get what i mean now
that's why
don't high hope [sia]
(mm)
never ya just dont ca~ care about him move on zack is in front of you even if zack doesn't like like you again
maybe in the future may~ maybe will
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he tak itu
ya exactly
so jangan don't don't think that that is the end of the world also
ada beribu-ribu jantan
ya [lah]
she got cheated
[oh] my god
like just like that
(mm) cheat juga so it's two ways
[oh] my god
[ah] [ah]
she straight up said that
break up
tak nak tanya [lah]
[oh] okay
so they are still together
serious [ah]
toxic bodoh
i_g
perempuan tu ke lelaki tu
[oh] mana aku tahu aku ingatkan perempuan tu
(mm)
i mean
you can't ex~ k the thing is kau tak boleh expect like a guy to look so great
for you
cause that's when you know macam kau kau confirm tak boleh dapat
lelaki
right
you know it's not their hati yang gatal it's bawah dia orang gatal
ya
c_b [ah] c_b circuit breaker
ya it's very rare to like find guys who are less

susah
nak cari pun tak tahu mana nak cari bodoh

terus dia reject
kau reject [eh]
[oh] ya kau tolak [eh] kau cakap i i'm still moving on
high hopes [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
guna gunakan
[oh] ya
why
[oh] okay now i get it because
okay [lah] now getting because i think he say because split i do number isn't [ah] linguine with me to select and mulberry is opposite [lor]
i think he said because kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua [kan] zack is the opposite [what] that's why he feels like very competitive gitu dia tak suka
!alah! kesiannya you but did you tell him that
but did you tell him that
kau cakap apa dalam letter tu
!alah!
comelnya okay
[ah]
(mm)
so cute
but like if a guy if you know that he feels like that right
you should just tell him that kau orang together not because your expectation of a guy is
macam you should say that at least he tried it's easier
[oh] dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat
now what time
okay i mean dia tak teruk seteruk aku [tau] but
but what can he do so
(mm)
it's okay
kawan pun boleh eventually turn out to be so
it's okay
that's that is the beauty of like having friends [lah] itu [jer]
he does trust me
you told like so vaguely you told him what
selenge aku ketuk kau [kan] kepala ke kau kau cakap pasal si zack depan-depan dia [sia]
aku i was like laughing behind the screen i was like i want to look at #izuan's# reaction
ya tapi dalam hati tu mesti sakit padan muka
ya [lah] okay you're you're moving on two months dia dah break up dengan kau two months
abeh kau cepat gitu
okay i'm not i'm not saying it's a bad thing but
i mean ya you're kind of fast [lah] but

nanti lelaki will think otherwise that one that that one i don't mind
if he says like that i don't mind but he says as if i'm the i'm the macam i'm the one wrong
tu pasal aku dah macam marah that's why i was pissed
ya you i look at you then after that i was like thinking
what the hell
ya the one he said when you were what what made him talk about it [ah]
[ah]
i mean it's your opinion on what you wear [what]
aku dah cakap apa terang-terang like kau nak pakai itu masa~ kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu then it's not my problem
aku pun pissed gila #wei# gitu dengar
you're telling me not to wear things
ya exactly
as a friend okay i understand
your point of view
but don't don't make it seem as if as if it's my fault for dressing like that and then i lure guys into doing it
[eh] you !wah! shit [sia] cannot [sia] like you can see my whole face it's not that obvious
ya even if i i asked #husni# you know
aku tanya husni gambar-gambar tu
like it's way before
aku tanya husni
i don't know we were talking about [oh] no kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik
lepas tu aku tanya dia like #husni# was like talking because kita tiga [jer] [kan] dah biasa
then after that we just talk [ah] macam
(err) we need to talk about like macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia emo gitu
lepas tu aku bilang [lah] dia orang macam apa jadi
like as in apa jadi as in like (uh) why is she still feeling sad [lah] gitu
then aku just cakap in my opinion i think
dia masih belum move on gitu ya then after that ya
(mm) and then lepas tu
husni cakap maybe
(err) husni came to a conclusion he just said that (um)
because like (uh) that is why you shouldn't play dating app ni semua
ya then after that aku macam it's like aku cakap [ah] macam sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person itu [jer]
for fun also [what] kau nak kenal-kenal orang [jer] [pe]
and then (err) suddenly you say
then he
te~ tell me that (uh) takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga [tau] lelaki ni semua tak bagus
okay that one was okay i understand he say that

then after that because that #irfan# guy right he commented he com~
he talked to me about my picture
the one that i put

then kata aku cakap (um)
dia cakap
aku bilang husni [ah] aku tanya dia in my in your opinion [lah] do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
pasal tu husni cakap no you cannot see anything [what]
because it's all black you cannot see the shape
it's just one line dah tu [jer]
[oh] so so like what's the problem it's just one line
if you

that's great sorry (uh) i didn't hear you just now you were saying (uh) you buat apa sekarang
(hmm)
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] are you are you indonesian
[oh] [eh] [ah] [ah] [eh] like why why would you participate kalau you indonesian sorry
[ah]
[oh]
indonesian i see (uh) freelance tu kat mana
like how how do you find the freelance job macam mana
[oh] that's that's great because (um) actually macam kalau i pun tengah cari-cari kerja [lah] sebab (um) recently i just quit my job because of ya ya because of some (um) apa kesihatan [ah] related to kesihatan (um) ethics so macam i not quit [lah] i taking a break so but i tak tahu i nak continue ke tak
ya so i'm i'm looking for jobs to so macam that's interesting (um) maybe i can like to try to look (uh) look for this kind of jobs too
(hmm)
ya
ya that's true
[ah] [ah] like i i feel like i woke up everyday like macam rasa tak happy gitu [seh] like nak pergi kerja !alamak!
(hmm) so like (uh) as of now i i tak tahu if like it's not my passion or like it's not it's not my rezeki or what because i really feel like (uh) i used to really passionate about this tapi macam sekarang macam dah malas nak pergi then macam really tak tahu [lah] if i should continue or not but like now i'm taking like maybe two months break
[oh] okay so what like sekarang like what line you you at like (uh) what industry
[oh] (um) early childhood
ya but i pun macam not really (um) into it yet macam how how do i say it macam dulu i
baru [jer] baru [jer] because
ya i baru graduate (uh) last year as in actually this year [lah] the apa tu during the c_b period actually suppose to have our (um) ceremony [kan] tapi tak boleh ya so i'm the unlucky batch
(uh) singapore poly (um) i ra~ (uh) [oh] [oh] sorry you don't know ya
ya (um) ya so (um) i i got into an internship dia ajar bukan ajar [lah] tapi macam it's speech and drama so i (um) my course actually applied drama and psychology (uh) so macam my interest is more to theater and stuff ya they macam post me to (uh) this early childhood not early childhood [lah] tapi macam like somewhat macam budak-budak dia macam actually interested (uh) tapi i got confuse i think i more interested in the (uh) in the drama side instead of teaching budak-budak
ya
when i was in internship [oh] (uh) so pagi kita okay (uh) so the internship place is actually at enrichment centre so pagi (uh) tak ada apa-apa it's just admin job then the admin job pun macam like tak susah sangat [lah] i mean like it was difficult because halfway kita punya supervisor then like a lot of teachers left in (uh) the company because of some things happen (uh) then (uh) so that's why the intern had a lot a lot more jobs to do in the morning but then like afternoon then baru macam kalau ada budak-budak datang for class [kan] then we are just i'm the teacher's assistant then the teacher assistant just (uh) tolong the teacher to just hype the class nanti kalau cikgu dia cakap something funny then we're just like (uh) apa tu [oh] my god isn't it funny like that kind of thing [lah] macam stupid gitu tapi macam
ya it's like to encourage them to macam speak up macam do do the drama with them macam we will have like (um) dramas (uh) drama train which will bring them to the drama drama island then in that drama island the teacher will be in another role
okay okay
ya so like now i tak tahu if i nak sambung kerja dengan budak-budak or like i i'm just interested in the dramas side
(um) actually it's not like allow allow not like dia orang suka-suka nak allow but it's like (um) it's a bit unethical for me to work there also [lah] because like (err) i've been having macam low moods and stuff so macam kesian the budak-budak [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) i honestly tak tahu [seh] because like because right now that's a lot of thing that happening so macam i i tak tahu if it's because of my (um) my job only or is it because of my whatever that is happening in my life that contributes to how i feel right now that's why i'm (um) but i i came clean to my boss like i bilang dia (uh) whatever that's been happening in my life then she say [lah] macam (uh) i don't think you're you're capable of working now so macam i need to macam set my head straight [lah] (uh) maybe i need to seek for help i go to seek for help first and stuff just make sure when you come back you feel macam hundred percent here [lah] because like right now you're a like everywhere
ya
to to work he he he said you can go back right
ya existed that this he welcomes welcomed back then that's good
(mm) but like (um) ya
(mm)
[oh]
ya
ya
and that's a big decision to make [seh] because like (um) it can affect your future if you stay here not happy then macam in the future like kalau lambat then you it's hard for you to change but now macam is the time (um) for us to macam explore but it's like exploring also is so difficult when you don't have anything to follow i feel
[ah] tu [lah]
susah
ya unless kalau kita kerja part time yang macam (um) temperature taking gitu semua i mean it's it's okay [lah] macam good mo~ ya it's better than nothing tapi macam the thing is [ah] i'm just worried macam this is just macam just graduate [kan] so macam i think too much about stuff then (um) if i take that kind of job now then macam i don't have like much experience in like (uh) what i want to do in the future dia macam i scared macam i'm not prepared [lah] but this is just me overthinking [lah] but (um) if dapat dapat kerja the temperature taking pun macam bersyukur [seh] as of now
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
berapa lama the semi~ the webinar
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] but like !huh!
ya
(hmm)
that sounds great then i think (err) my sister also took that job [ah] last month but like so like webinar you don't have to go to any venue [kan]
(hmm)
!wow! that's really good because like actually (um) when i joined the company the one that i'm taking a break now i actually suppose to go for a class to macam a diploma conversion ya so but then (um) for now obviously cannot (uh) go to the school [lah] the tapi nanti if like the situation gets better than we have to go to go back to the school so macam (um) i i don't know i feel like macam its a bit more demanding in a way macam and like i don't think we are allowed to do whatever we want i think we need to sit in like our house and like you know like just just sit macam focused on like just real school
[oh] no (uh) it's not (uh) teaching the kids at home but (err) apa itu it's just like normal school macam we learn about how to teach the kids at home but then in the morning baru kita teach the kids at school get it so from eight to eight two (um) one we teach the kids at school real kids then balik then (err) the teacher that lecturer will teach us pula on like about kid
(um) honestly i feel like a bit macam i don't know because i i didn't go for it yet [kan] macam i stopped before it started today was supposed to be the first time day first day work at the start of the class tapi (um) from what i think [ah] macam it depends on the company you work with kalau the company macam give you a lot of (uh) things to do like homework macam preparing worksheets for the kids tu semua they don't have like a proper system like tak ada macam mana [eh] they tak ada their own worksheet for us to just photocopy we have to make all the worksheet so macam it's that already a a lot of workload then kita pergi sekolah we have also we also have our assignment and like test tu semua ya so it's like it's a bit macam scary [kan]
[ah]
ya i feel i felt that way [lah] then macam that's why i felt really macam (um) i'm scared like i i had i had a meltdown semua
(um) i think they because there's only one that just (uh) finish the diploma conversion then she's she also said macam is going to be difficult [lah] sebab (um) the tempat kerja even weekend sometimes the boss i think macam she didn't like intentionally do this tapi macam just to macam she will like text us during the weekends macam to tell us need to do this this this so macam (um) my colleague yang just finish the diploma dia cakap [ah] it's a bit more demanding from the company itself then macam we we also have the our stuff to do so macam she she felt like it's a bit difficult [lah] to go through
that so macam she she was concerned about me [lah] because like she she knew that (uh) it's going to be tough for me and especially now [kan] (um) that's not enough teacher the card the company so so macam there's a lot of macam pressure on on the new teachers macam kita not teachers [lah] macam supposedly i'm not supposed to teach [kan] so macam they try their best not to macam expect do ask me to do a lot of stuff because i'm just program helper tapi macam sometimes nak tak nak macam takkan [lah] nak biarkan the company to drown [kan] like if you see this that you need to help obviously you need to do it ya macam that's why macam she say it will be early will be more tough on me [lah] because everything is new then nak kena belajar nak kena adapt to the changes then like (uh) nak kena apa belajar lagi
(hmm) ya ya
so now you doing (um) a part time and working it's continue working at your industry or like on break too
(hmm)
[oh]
(hmm)
true
ya true
(hmm) (hmm)
[oh] so how is it so far
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm) ya
#amin# sure #inshaallah#
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya that's why (hmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's good
[ah] [ah]
[oh]
stress free
[oh] man ya that feels like me
!wah!
but then like okay so why why macam i'm stressing myself [kan] like i agree with you macam since since secondary school i already told myself macam kalau tak happy like there's no point of doing it like as long as i'm happy then i will continue then (um) but then now [kan] macam i know okay deep down i i didn't tell anyone [lah] tapi macam i know deep down that i'm not happy with working with children now then but then macam i takut because i didn't have any other choice as of now like i haven't explore other than theatre tapi kat singapore theatre is not really like appreciated and especially during this c_b nak buat theatre macam mana [kan] like there's no audience but i know there's some like macam virtual and stuff but then macam virtual i feel like if you are already in already in one theatre company and then obviously (err) you it's easier for you to (um)
(uh) to stay there [lah] macam to continue from where you are tapi macam kalau you are not in the theatre company then macam susah nak dapat nak ada audition pun tak ada
ya
early childhood (um) the thing is like for early childhood [kan] macam i tak ada (um) much experience other than my internship internship ya so (err) i and i also my diploma is not early childhood diploma is applied drama and psychology so ya so i feel like (um) there's not much of got there's not many companies that would accept me then ma~
ya the conversion is (err) is (err) the company itself yang i am in right now is actually macam they want they want new teachers to come in and it the boss also say that (um) she tak ini [ah] tak expect us to stay very long she just (uh) provide a platform for a like a stepping stone gitu so macam she she encourages people to ya she macam looking for people who wants to become a new teacher there
ya so ya then the the the theatre thing macam i know deep down that i am interested in theatre [lah] to i want to macam act again and stuff tapi macam i know in singapore tak boleh [kan] so much that's the pressure [lah] ya i want to do theatre tapi macam i know it's going to be difficult on the finance like financially then
(uh) for like kalau i nak buat early childhood then i don't feel that happy so but then macam and early childhood is not bad the the pay [kan] especially in singapore because they need people but then like (um) and like if i don't continue for early childhood i macam i just feel like my mum is not really supportive of me to quit [lah] honestly
ya it's it's not difficult it's like macam average [lah] tapi jap [eh] my mum my mum is like texting me
ya ya okay later i come back to that
i'm twenty
ya
[oh] okay
that's good
(mm) ya
that's that's sweet because like my mom dia macam passive aggressive tak tahu nak cakap macam mana it's like ya she macam i (um) because dari kecil we don't really macam (um) not very affectionate we are macam okay ya so macam kalau nak cakap dengan dia a bit awkward macam nak open up pun a bit awkward
then macam every time macam dari kecil i nangis about like [oh] my friend don't want to friend me all kind of things in primary school then she will be like you you go to school to to study not to to make friends so macam like she taught me to be tough [lah] macam like (err) emotions she put away emotions tu so macam sekarang i sedih i marah or like anything [lah] then i cannot like go to her to talk about things [lah] then macam i try my best walaupun dia macam push or try to avoid the emotion [kan] i will just like
try my best to explain to her [lah] macam what i'm feeling this way because this this this tapi then but i will text her i i cannot talk to her face to face because every time i cakap face to face she will macam like (um) suddenly become very cold then macam don't want to make eye contact then she will just say things macam (err) (err) if you cannot do it then i cannot force you macam that kind of stuff you know so macam i know that she's not happy but at the same time like she's trying her best to not macam put any pressure on me but macam that itself already made me (err) pressurize ya
(mm)
ya
so so it's like (um) so if i (uh) like i what i wanted to say just now was (um) because if i don't want to continue with this early childhood right my other choice is only the theatre come a theatre industry but then like i know theatre industry won't make much money [lah] as compared to early childhood
!huh! (err) (err) i i have seniors but then macam i don't really talk to them macam i really never never like try before because like i in the back of my mind i already told myself like i don't want to start if i start then like i scared like i'm stuck there macam i don't want to stop ya
ya so macam i go for the safest (uh) option first which is the early childhood [lah] then macam but the thing is like i know deep down i am not happy with it tapi macam kalau i nak go out of it i'm like i don't know where to go you know like i don't have any interest in anything else other than early childhood or theatre then macam
and also i'm thinking about because i have a boyfriend now then like his family a bit well off [lah] i would i would say so macam if like i don't have any this is just me [lah] (err) if i don't have any macam (um) any education or like any specific job in mind i scared macam like not good enough you know this is [kan]
(mm)
[ah]
(hmm) (hmm)
ya so (um) ya [lah] so macam (uh) as of now he keep on saying macam don't worry don't worry tapi macam you know like at certain extent you have to worry because like (um) that is your family obviously you say don't worry ya
like like (err) have you have you talk to your your boyfriend if you don't mind sharing
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
so he's okay [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
[oh] that's good
(mm) (mm) ya so like sekarang i i don't know if i'm doing the right thing [lah] because (um) it was a hard decision for me to make to like (uh) stop whatever i was doing like i totally like left the company (um) not preparing any anything for them macam macam imme~ very abruptly [lah] the i didn't even like a complete the worksheet for them or anything but they my colleague yang [ah] the one that just went through the conversion she macam very quite helpful [lah] she macam keep on saying [oh] it's okay it's okay she will do it because also like my partner somewhat (err) ya we teaching the we we you macam assisting the same class
(mm)
(hmm) (hmm) but i didn't i didn't really have a good rapport with her before this because we were teaching assist~ assist~ assisting (um) the the same level [kan] so macam i was (err) more of the art and craft and maths but she's more of the language so macam (uh) craft obviously have a lot more to more to prepare tu semua [kan]
then like (um) the the thing is they they have this thing in the company macam kalau craft teacher dengan language teacher have to work together to prepare the craft materials
but then i think she didn't she didn't get that (err) idea so macam most of the time i was doing the craft then macam balik pun i buat craft weekends pun i buat craft so macam like it was really a lot of stress for me [lah] ya then (err) macam i macam i that point of time geram dengan dia [lah] macam (uh) dia keep on saying macam [oh] i'll do it i'll do it tapi end up tak buat so i macam pressured [lah] because i'm the one who carry out the craft lesson [kan] macam the one
ya so macam it was really really irritating then sampai like (um) the colleagues (uh) [ah] my other colleagues we very small company [lah] so macam they they saw me struggling gitu macam everyday i supposed to go home at one thirty like my contract ends at one thirty but then (err) i my contract pula my timing ends at one thirty [ah] but then like the the full time teachers ends at three three thirty gitu tapi my my timing [kan] i'm always there until four until three so macam
no no that's that's the thing so the company macam we already say in the contract so macam it ends at one thirty but whatever materials you have to do is your own time own target so macam ya that sucks [lah] that's macam that's why i feel like macam kalau i continue to work and go for school the conversion confirm rabak
ya it's a it's a proper diploma so (um) if you have a diploma already but then you want to to macam decided to go for early childhood industry [kan] so you can apply at an at n_i_e_c and then (err) and n_i_e_c will consider [ah] macam but most of the time they will they will accept you [ah] because macam tak banyak in singapore wants to do early childhood
ya tak i don't think is [lah] because like (um) it this is there's a stereotype of like (err) early childhood teachers gets a lot of because (um) there's they really need early childhood teachers preschool teachers because that tak banyak in singapore nak buat
ya i don't know what to say about that so (err) so the the the diploma conversion (um) after we apply but then (err) we we find a company first [lah] we find the company we can get sponsorship if we work with the company less than six months
then (um) if the company also want to sponsor you then like you apply for the n_i_e_c and then you see then you say [lah] the company wants to sponsor you then (um) they will consider you if you fulfill the the requirements so macam diploma tu semua macam (uh) your o level english tu semua and then (err) they will contact you [lah] [eh] but there's only like two two openings every year if i'm not wrong there's one in in april ya april and (um) october
ya
(uh) i right now i don't know if i want to continue [lah] because like after talking to you then macam like really make me realize macam ya i should just macam do things that made me happy because like there's no point of doing getting money getting good money if i'm not happy like how long will that last
(hmm)
i~
(hmm)
(um) that's that's good but then like (um) that's i used to have savings (um) before before joining the company [kan] and then like but the thing is i i thought i was going for the diploma conversion right so i my laptop rosak so i decided to buy a new laptop [lah] so because i was thinking okay with the pay that i'm getting then macam the laptop won't be so much [lah] and i also look for a cheap laptop not like macam one thousand plus gitu [ah]
it's just like six hundred seven hundred then (um) after i got the laptop so macam my savings to terjejas like affected already then then like (err) when i join the company then i got the pay already right then macam okay [lah] my first pay so macam i belanja my my family to eat tu semua then like my boyfriend leaving so macam i help him with (um) (err) not help him macam like i give him as a gift to semua macam barang-barang for n_s but not everything [lah] within just a few then macam i didn't expect this to happen like i didn't expect that myself will like (um) broke macam mentally broke broken
ya as in like mentally broken so like (um) i i didn't expect things to happen then macam my savings pun now like terjejas my laptop like i'm not really using my laptop that much then macam i really feel macam everything is just
it's just cubaan now [lah]
(uh) haven't yet because like i it's just everything just started i just really like (err) i just quit my job last week
ya but it's very pressurizing [lah] because like
(hmm)
ya but like i like mention [ah] i tak tahu if i want to continue with early childhood or not and also like i feel it's a bit unfair if i go for another early childhood company but i never tell my my (err) my boss that i don't want to work with her anymore
(uh) no i actually still have contract before until next year december ya
(err) she if i terminate the contract supposingly i have to pay like six thousand dollars
(um) so but a bit too macam you know so that people don't just terminate contracts suka hati ya so but i i brought it up to her [lah] about my situation tu semua but she quite understanding she say macam the six thousand dollar it's just for for formality [lah] it's not really macam to force to force you to pay or what
so macam she just macam let (err) let me (uh) apa tu not pay it [eh] not pay her and just macam take a break first but like (err) she say if i feel better then i can i can continue working with her [lah] but then macam as of now i kinda have this feeling that i won't continue with her [lah] because really make
(err) i i don't think so i i ya that's good but at the same time macam i feel the guilt [lah] because i told her that i want to continue working but like (um) i for now i cannot continue first i regret for saying that [lah] honestly because like at that point of time i really you macam have a lot in mind so macam i tell her stuff that i macam regret now
(hmm)
i i don't know why i as of now i really macam feel like everything is (err) falling apart [lah] because (um) ya [lah] because of the job then until i don't know if i want to continue then about my health also i'm not really stable right now then (um) my my boyfriend i mention him right then he just left for his n_s yesterday i mean he's just n_s it's just n_s tapi macam i had a past of like my (err) my father's death so macam it kind of like triggered me [lah] just macam ya that's what i'm thinking so like (um) he him leaving my changes trigger everything [lah] so (err) i'm feeling like really really macam at my lowest right now [lah] ya so macam i feel sekarang
ya so i don't know what to do right you know that's why macam i'm supposed to take a break during tapi macam my mind just doesn't want to take a break you know you to keep on working macam why am i gonna do what am i gonna do but then macam i need to macam con~ ya so macam i don't know i'm really lost right now [lah] so i'm trying my best to macam look for freelance work from home kind of thing
(hmm)
[oh] okay sure sure ya sure ya can can okay thank you so much
(hmm)
okay
okay
[oh] okay
and segan kind also ya understood
ya
(hmm)
(hmm)
ya
(hmm) [oh] [oh]
okay thank you
(hmm)
okay ya that sounds so great
thank you
okay is it is it the connection the the wifi but i think my wifi ada something wrong gitu cause macam i can but then macam like very dubbing
ya i hope too ya i think it's my house wifi [lah] ya i think our recording should be okay
then ya [lah] i i i understand why what you mean by macam (um) you shy to ask questions like for me it's not like really i'm shy because i mean i'm in i'm from drama so i'm quite like okay with talking to people but like the thing is (um) i overthink a lot [lah] so macam when people macam just hesitant to say something then i will straightaway think [oh] i'm asking too much and like i'm troubling her or him macam i will start to to question myself [lah] macam like am i am i like menyusahkan or not that kind of things that's why like i don't really wanna talk not because like (um) i ya [lah] sombong or what but ya i i think it's it will be great talking to someone (err) especially like someone that i don't know so macam i don't really have macam anything to lose so if that sounds bad but then but then macam ya
[oh]
[oh] that's so nice
it's like meant to be
ya i i think it will help definitely sikit ke banyak still help thank you so much but i just want i just want to say that i i'm really like amazed at how macam you're doing it for your own good it's like you you boleh make that decision you know of like (um) taking a break and like exploring new things like i i don't know if i were ever have the courage to do that
ya
ya
ya [lah]
ya
[ah] [ah]
ya that's true
so it's like i i'm glad like even if or even that i just graduated i masih macam like in the past as they have this macam (um) want to like put (uh) put some into my savings so like now macam even though it's very little but i still them don't feel like i totally broke you know ya
so macam [oh] but [oh] my god can i just rant i mean like we just met but but i just macam nak lepaskan anger gitu because like i'm so annoyed because (err) so this month punya pay right i didn't know that my m_c because like in the contract it says that i i can get a few few days m_c seven days m_c so macam every time this month it's just very unlucky for me [lah] i got food poisoning [lah] i got like macam selesema [lah] because there has been like cold (uh) cold bug around the school so (err) then i got it also then i also macam ada panic attack in one of the night because i ingat i injured my neck so macam this month i took a lot of m_c thinking that macam you can like i can claim from their m_c m_c [lah] then rupanya they cut cut it off from my from my gaji then because like (err) i still macam baru kerja situ it's still not three months yet something like that [lah] so macam they ya but she
ya but she didn't tell me my boss didn't tell me that is like i i heard macam from my i'm not i don't know [lah] i i know i heard it somewhere that there's no probation or anything so macam and that's why i thought macam (um) we i already macam can claim the m_c or what she also never say anything about it then after on like my second last day baru like i she mentioned [ah] about macam [oh] i took too much m_c too many m_c in one month like if i'm in another company definitely they will let me go and stuff so macam (uh)
the contract says i have (uh) i have seven days m_c and like they never say any probation
ya but like at that point of time i already like giving her a lot of trouble you know so macam macam dah bagus dia tak suruh bayar enam enam apa enam ribu [kan]
ya that's true
no they didn't
(err) ya [lah] doesn't tapi sekarang macam i just feel a lot of guilt (err) towards the company so macam i tak tahu if i want to bring it up or not [ah] because (err) then okay there's a there's a continuation to that then macam they cutting from my gaji [kan] so macam i already had in mind okay my gaji month will be like a bit less but it's okay you can still sustain me for like one month then i can find like part time job and then i (uh) apa tu when i terminate the contract means i'm not continuing the the diploma they rupanya they will like macam will not get a refund if i apa tu (err) discontinue my diploma conversion in less than fourteen days
so the com~ the company will have to pay will still have to pay around four hundred gitu so macam my gaji dah kurang then like my the the company has to pay four hundred which means i have to pay [kan] obviously the company won't ask won't macam want to pay for no reason so like i think my my pay will be like less than half you know this month then macam !aduh! sedih gila [seh]
ya
so it's like
like like i said [lah] that's why macam i i'm really free feel like this is my lowest point of life (um) because like money wise then macam like (um) my boyfriend left for n_s rasa macam got triggered by my past then like my mom is like not really that supportive that much so it's like really [lah] what's the everything is just falling apart
i have kakak but then like she she move out already because she nikah
(hmm) two actually but (um) my i'm not close to my eldest one because (uh) she we lain mak
sama bapak lain mak
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) ya
so
(um)
i think i for now i should just find jobs that's like (um) that won't bring that i won't bring it back home macam buat kerja kat situ then balik tak buat apa-apa
macam kalau penat penat kat kerja [jer]
i mean other than like there's (um) part time like macam f&b gitu [lah] guess can can do that tapi macam i don't know i kind of i'm not (um) i i have this need of like expressing my thoughts so like i don't think macam i can (uh) i can stay in can do that kind of part time but macam if there's no choice then i don't mind trying also now
(hmm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm)
ya
ya maybe i could think of that too
(um) that's true [oh] my god i need to keep you on reminding myself that
(err) actually i just when yesterday (um) ya but then like (um) i i did not go poly though i i went to check organization do you know
organization so they are actually under i_m_h macam they are more they work more with community instead of (err) [kan] kalau i_m_h like you are the patient [kan] ya so much as chat is like you are the client as in different different fee [lah] macam like you just macam go there they already they give a free mental health assessment actually
ya but then like from there then (um) macam they will tell you [lah] or you you might need macam counselling or what then macam they will refer you to them [lah] me (err) i think if with them then can get a bit of subsidy [ah] i'm not so sure about that but then macam (um) because yesterday when they told me about the the (err) what i can do next then macam rate of like (err) what the next thing then we just counselling [lah] macam is forty dollars per session so like i think it's quite okay but
(err) i ya i went poly polyclinic last time and they referred me to i_m_h ya but it wasn't it wasn't nice experience at i_m_h itself because like the doctor really didn't macam mana [eh] don't really [ah] take you no cannot ya
[oh] okay sure okay
okay i started recording
okay ya can
so later on today you are going to go for the other (um) what do you call that focus group
(uh huh)
#amirah# #amirah# from m_i [ah] [oh] [oh]
how do you know i mean how do you know she's going
[ah]
[ah] [oh]
(mm)
what (mmhmm)
!wah!
[ah]
dia orang nak test concept [eh] like concept of a show
[ah]
[oh] iya [lah]
[a'ah]
[oh]
ya
what you have to watch a show first then kalau kalau kau tak suka
[ah]
i see
!wow! then that what then ya i mean if you didn't enjoy the show then you have to give them the feedback [lah] like [oh] i couldn't sit through
[ah]
[a'ah]
[lah]
ya
[ah] [eh] who who are they like new faces ke orang lama tak ada like popular artistes
[oh] my god
#syarif# #syarif# #malaque# [eh] [oh] okay
i see
ya correct ya i mean nobody really turns on the t_v
no
i don't know i used to i mean like my parents used to watch it all the time right #suria# so when they have the t_v on kadang-kadang kalau ada show yang macam okay okay then i'll sit and watch [ah] but to be honest i cannot remember any any specific title
ya so it's like (err) i i mean i don't know is it cause it's very peachy
[ah] ya like it's just like macam background noise gitu
tapi macam i i mean the content okay kadang-kadang like the some documentaries there was one with (um) that girl #dalila# i don't know the girl with that cornrow hair
ya that one was quite interesting
[ah] #dalina# #dalina# during bulan puasa [ah] bulan puasa macam kadang-kadang like sebelum buka then baru will watch
kalau tak macam (err)
ya
ya like just inner noise
right
cause i think now we have netflix right i don't like the idea of having to [oh] okay i have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know
ya like what okay let's go says [ah] which is very true everything is on demand
[ah]
[oh] my goodness
[oh] my goodness mentang-mentang ada library [eh] kat situ dia orang dia orang dengki [eh] ya
i mean ya it's true i mean if you think about it like what one in three malay people in singapore listens to o_l_g right
or something like that
i'll try to put my phone
k k i put my phone here okay ya
tak payah pegang
[kan] aku dah lama [seh] tak pakai zoom call
[oh] ya sh~ what finance
[oh] yes yes yes cool
[oh] a partner
[oh] (err) wait
[oh] true true true
ya then i will find a partner
let me try my husband
[oh] ya #jannah# ya ya i can force #jannah# then kalau kalau aku berbual seorang
[oh]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
ya
!haiya! if like that then
like that #jannah# and i meet up [lah] to do it
then like that there's no issue about it right
ya can also then it'll be like a meetup hangout
ya
sounds good
[oh] ya [ah] you have your but [eh] then where where is your sister dia tidur kat mana [seh]
[ah]
nice [eh] tengok tengok tengok sikit
tu anjing [eh]
cantik
abeh apa [oh] [lah] horse ya #allah#
anjing [eh] [eh] cantik
cantik [seh] babe is that #ros# in the photo
[oh] ya ya betul betul betul
okay
ya
macam-macam [lah] kau mengarut
aku
pessimistic as in about your relationship
(uh huh) (uh huh)
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
[oh] okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
[oh] okay okay cause like right now there's a lot of discussion about kalau you [dah] age thirty you must have at least hundred k in your bank account that kind of thing
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred k in like in in like asset
ya
in general but i don't know i still think hundred k feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house [what]
ya correct
but then how how would you okay i i mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old i think most people are earning between what four to five k around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like i i mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
like a a a real high flyer then of course you can save a lot more [lah] cause right now a lot of like twenty five years old are saying [oh] i already saved fifty k then you no need to get married [meh] no need to buy b_t_o ke you know ya then still spend money [what]
ya
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] no then sekarang are you actually stress about the wedding or stress about all these things that you feel you're stress about or
aku ingatkan kau fikir banyak sangat [ah]
ya kalau kalau kalau bukan ros kalau robert kalau !alah! apa-apa [jer] [lah] sebab kau rasa macam robert you know would have the financial means
i don't know but #ros# also
but the think is russell financial means are also above average jadi you know apa yang tak cukup ni sorry kau
[oh] like you yourself okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
is it dia
okay okay i think
i think it's cause of the industry as a whole [lah] also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all i mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's s_i_a you know what can happen
right but then cause of covid and then they say [oh] people will are only gonna start flying in twenty twenty four then ya [lah] rasa takut tu mesti ada right sikit
!huh!
[a'ah]
ya
what [oh] no but [eh] five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred k ya [lah] there's your savings
[oh] okay okay okay that's nice so now your loan amount berapa
[eh] thirty three dengan hundred jauh beza [seh]
dope okay [lah] hundred plus
okay [eh] then okay [eh] not so bad [eh] hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan [ah] is
but is but six hundred plus k right the the cost price of your condo
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus [lah]
!wah! that is okay [lah] tak apa kau kau cepat-cepat collect then
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
to to to pay off your loan okay so i watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
ya two percent then tak apa [lah] just pay [lah] five hundred every month then after that you slowly accumulate your wealth back again and then you can invest the rest [what] cause you can always make your investment grow more than two percent so that's the logic behind it [lah]
tahu tahu
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from c_p_f [kan]
[ah] okay okay can [lah]
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right
[oh] no
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
!wow! malay and higher malay
ya
nice
you know why then everybody else is just happy [lah] they they don't but but i thought #aini# has a full time job
mana dia nak cari masa nak do relief teaching on the side
aren't you keeping in touch with her i thought you guys were quite close right or
[oh] okay okay
(mm) (mm)
[oh] no

especially marriage kalau kalau you're getting retrenched ke atau sakit ke i mean marriage is not only through the good times [pe]
but i think it's just you [lah] you just want to you know make make sure that everything is perfect before you enter any serious commitment

i didn't know this one got okay this is just ya correct
i can even
this is #xiaomi#
it's only twenty dollars
unlike the airpod which was like what three hundred
ya tapi aku aku ambil hidayat punya [ah] it was hidayat punya airpod

(mm) ya
(mm) (mm)
ya correct
ya
the house is a better investment ya correct
[eh] actually you don't need [lah] you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree i mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya [lah]
ya which is ya which is which which i get it ya
ya ya i mean i totally get that [lah] but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
i don't know
but ya [lah] a degree is ya i don't know i don't know if it's pointless or what but ya i wish i wish i went through the
i think right it's more about the experience like you have in school like if you were a part of a campus at n_t_u n_u_s s_m_u then i feel it's really worth it
but like okay i mean i mean even my laselle experience it was fun [lah] macam
macam you you are learning a lot of things abeh kau jumpa ramai ramai orang who have like the same ideology
abeh it's it's the friendship ya the project work the experience but not so much the piece of paper itself

and then they teach you
ya [lah] around there [lor]
that is what for one year only right twenty three twenty three k
[oh] the whole thing berapa tahun
eighteen months
actually okay [what] right
[eh] but come
[ah] ya true ya true true
ya that's true plus you are also getting married
ya ya ya ya
but don't do anything you don't want to do
[a'ah] padahal kau yang nak kahwin sangat-sangat
you know
but now you realised that !hey! actually my life is pretty good right unmarried not not married
and then you are not sure by getting married it will make your life better or worse like would you even feel empty if you're not married
you know what i mean

there's a i do there isn't but ya she just decided that okay [lah] just let them live their life
you know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna interfere
[kan] dia orang dah kahwin dia orang solve their own issues [lah] yang macam hari tu [kan] [ah] [kan] kita orang keluar dengan hanan it's supposed to be all of us plus #hidayat# [lah] to go out with his entire family right my parents-in-law then dia last minute dia tak nak pergi sebab dia geram we had a fight [lah]
pasal tudung kau percaya tak
hidayat dengan aku kita orang dua bergaduh pasal tudung aku pakai colour pink lepas tu dia kata tak kena tu pasal aku kata tak [lah] pink dengan black kena apa [kan] baju aku ada pink bunga
then after that he's like why you so rude [ah] i don't want to go [lah] then he called his sister and said [oh] i'm i'm not going already then i have to go [lah] i went out with his family
and my sister-in-law and #hanan#
ya i was so angry but you know cause
and they they so excited [seh] they want to go out with #hanan#
takkan i want to cancel right everything just cause we had a fight then #hanan# also want to go out
ya [lah] tapi tapi tak awkward [lah] hide the truth
!hais!
he's like hati berangin [lah]
i want i'm trying to trying to so it's like
it's like on and off then you see on my instagram i'm not wearing ya
it's something that i want to try and do but we will see [lah] #inshaallah# [lah] and i keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
i ordered online on shopee and then after that i compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
i bought like of shopee [lah] like (um) you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that i also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me [lah] they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
but haven't found like my tudung style you know it's stressful cause you have to iron
ya
[ah]
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
that's all ya and okay i i think in in the first place also dia macam malas [ah] nak keluar pun
sebab dia baru balik kerja [kan] the night before
ya i also think so and then and then he just melenting you know
ya cause like dia terus nak cari excuse [ah] then he can just say he don't want to go right
his family i mean his sister asked me [lah] i told his sister [lah] the truth
ya i think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
he's a bit panas
ya
like he got his temper
[ah] ya i told i told his sister ya
then his mother like then he tipu just say !haiya! dia tahu [lah] dia dia penat dia malas
lepas tu dia malas nak keluar
ya
!hais!
ya [lah] this is
[eh] you know that used to be me but now i'm like !haiya! i really cannot be bothered like i cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
macam
i'm like i used to be so feisty like i used to be okay no it has to be this way this way i want it my way sekarang like !haiya! whatever [lah] i cannot be bothered as long as everybody alive at the end of the day aku tak kisah
gasak kau [lah] nak
he's okay if cause for #hanan# right i make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually #hanan# is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
i think ya
ya i i cause i know eventually i want to go to work [what]
ya ya correct so i need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also [lah] but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like #hidayat# will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
like one hour gitu hidayat will actually wake up early to play with him
cause hanan subuh dah bangun
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
dia macam faham dia tengok upin and ipin
lepas tu dia ketawa
ya [lah] but i love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya i just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
i just scared he feels like [eh] mak aku tak sayang aku [eh] asyik-asyik nak tinggalkan aku kat tempat merata-rata dunia
bukannya dia kerja pun dia duduk rumah pun dia tinggalkan aku kat rumah nenek aku [lah] opah aku [lah] kesian aku budak kecil i mean if he's thinking that way but ya mum's guilt
then today right i'm going to make stocks for him
i'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
ya so i will be boiling it for five hours entahlah macam mana it will turn out
but like plain
no salt no what
belum [ah]
ya he pernah start aku kasih dia makan
now (um) next week [ah]
next week dia boleh makan bubur dah
like dia dah six months plus
so boleh [ah]
ya
ya hopefully
dah besar dah boleh duduk dah esok dia pergi dah n_s
but #hidayat# and me are like no [lah] i think i think #hanan# will be the one and only cause penat [sia] aku tak aku tak i don't know [ah] it's just so so tiring like where do people get the energy from you know
maybe
!huh! i really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
aku dah tiga puluh tahun pun mak aku still come in to to help me so much
you know what i mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
!hais!
ya until we die until you die or they die first whoever dies first you know khalas we're done
ya [lah] even now also my mother helping me out so much if you need anything for #hanan# anything anything for her cucu
ya
the only one for a long time
[oh] my gosh

[ah]
just like ya but then like #hidayat# has been talking to #nazreen# like [oh] so how you feeling he's like (um) okay [lah] kita ingat dia orang putus [seh]
cause of the cause of the way he responds
about like you know the the marriage and stuff like that like macam macam dia macam-macam aje
takde takde ceria ke takde apa-apa
[ah] ya his face is a blank he doesn't get excited he doesn't get scared he just like okay these are the things i have to do and i will do it [lah] macam gitu [jer]
the girl the girl is works in a lab so she does
i don't know she tests things she run she's the ya she does research

#nazreen# is an engineer so he works in the east so he does he's like my sister [lah] they she they studied mechanical engineering
ya
he's been working a while
ya i saw the girl stays in the east
they they will stay stay with each other for a while la while they look for resale
ya so cause #nazreen# works in the east so they going to stay with the girl likely

i don't like the way they talk
on
lepak one korner
i feel like they always sindir o_l_g iya [lah] kita kita tak pakai bahasa kesat kita kita kita kita apa [eh]
i don't know [ah] what they say but they always say like they they are not kesat when they are disrespectful blah blah blah then that's your brand [lah] no need to say other people [what]
you know and then they they are like two guys and then they are not really like guys you know the #zuhairi# right he's a bit soft so he's like nyah aku rasa aku tak akan bayar hantaran and all these things
you know then then the other guy will be like [oh] iya [lah] itu pasal kita orang tak kahwin you know

ya no don't don't even bother i tried giving them a chance it just makes my blood boil
ya ya
i only listen to his podcast with #aisyah# his girlfriend #aisyah-aziz#
it was okay [lah] but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like i think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like [oh] you know like if i have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows [what] his girlfriend is #aisyah-aziz#

people like #razz# will intern~

so actually #dzar# can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no [lah]
#din# doesn't add to the conversation i feel like he will just ask one question and then after that [oh] okay

[oh] that's cool
[oh] my god
this is like toy story
like tiny people like just random people
that's cool
(err)
okay like i i retook
o level art like
so i took o o level art two times [ah] the first time like i did it then i took it again in secondary five
(uh) so there was two time like the first [one] was like achieve it to my
grandfather who passed away
ya
so that was quite like close to my heart [lah]
like (mm) [oh] my god i'm gonna cry like (err) i incorporated like things that remind me of him like there's this biscuit [lah] like he always like offered me
to eat it because i really like the biscuit wha~ and between like me and my datuk like (um)
he
he always like (uh) cakap like
the biskut is biskut hospital [lah] dia tanya [oh] adik nak ke tak biskut hospital ini then i'm like yes please please nak like it's so good like macam like (um)
i will makan it with milo or like or like minum teh gitu then i will eat the biskut together
ya so
that biskut ada banyak kenangan [lah] with my datuk so i used the biskut as the background of the painting then (uh) for the forefront of the painting like i put (uh) my sofa all like from the living room
and also (err)
there was a portrait of me and my family like sitting on the sofa and like (uh) our expressions were like sad [lah] to show
like tribute gitu
and for the sofa pillows [kan] like
(uh)
apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that (uh) i like i like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya i made the pillows like (uh) act~ apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time i took (uh) o level art (um) it was
it was
i don't know it was like a quiff
artwork [ah] it was it was like mostly about my hair [lah] about my pink hair i don't like i didn't like it
at that time
it was just like a form of like expression
like (uh) previously there were like some people who say like i i wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
i don't know gross or something but then i'm like
no i'm gonna do it i'm gonna prove you wrong so i did it so i dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
(uh) for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and i incorporated m~ my sister in the artwork
so ya that was kind of cool
i miss painting and drawing
also like lately i've been trying to draw a lot
also i i i i joined a art competition like my school's art competition [lah] like it's being held from
like (err) (err)
like n_y_p's sketch club [ah]
so like i just joined it so i'm trying to start drawing again like i really rindu art [lah]
so ya
ya for sure and i've been lazy
it's true it's like i i know a lot of people yang macam
they ada c_c_a then (uh) like they
letak like all their energy into the c_c_a
then their g_p_a is like wrecked [ah] but then they are like very bagus in their c_c_a
true true
word of the day penat
yes
just high [ah]
true true
ya
we~ it's very macam
like content heavy [kan]
true true
ya
just polytechnic life
so what are you planning to do for your future
asal kerja merepek [seh]
(mm)
i see
i see
actually ya
ya i'm in like chemical engineering so that's quite interesting
so ya a lot of shit also is like content heavy [lah]
i think ever since like this intern right it really made me reflect on
like
what i want to do for the future and also like
what kind of work i want to be in too i think for now like my plan is like (err)
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university [lah]
then (uh) let's see if i don't go to university
i think i might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which i which i think is quite cool [lah]
like it's
some it's like a choice
that i can try
if if legit like i can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then i might just go to work [orh]
then if i go work i will i will like
work for two years then hopefully i can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
(mm)
tapi sekarang susah [lah] because (uh) covid ya then banyak orang
that masuk that programme jadi to have something to fall back on
because the pay for it is
still
legit [lah] compared to like having tak ada kerja langsung [kan]
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and i heard like there there will be like a second wave [kan]
ya
like
true
imagine those lagi like
two k jobs like only earn like two k plus or like one k plus if you cut it even more it's like can barely survive [seh]
true
ya
but that's so bad [lah] obviously you have to change your lifestyle and if that happens
(mm)
true
true true
(mmhmm)
what
(mmhmm)
orang is not [oh]
(mm)
but i'm shook
but i'm shook at the fact that he go zoom call at the staircase like out of all places
(mm)
true true
(mm)
true true
a lot of c_c_a now is also like they carry out using zoom zoom calls
you know
but that's so boring though
but okay [lah] at least something you know compared to like nothing at all
confirm when i grow up i want to be a farmer
i don't know
i don't know macam cool
okay [lah] that
that kinda satisfies the my dream a bit
but i want to be like a full on farmer i don't know i think i've had this dream like since secondary school
like i
why why
(uh)
i know but like maybe [ah] maybe that's part of it [ah] but it's not like entirely him right it's not like i want to like have a farm with him or [what] [sia] like but i genuinely just want a farm
like i want to be rural
then like just vibing
you know
no i'm so shy
no
no
ya
true
[oh] actually true
but i don't think they do it on top of housing though
[oh] ya i guess so
you don't even eat vegetable like you don't eat your vegetables at all
rasa [seh] tapi this is like
tak sama
!ee!
!ee!
that's another you
it's good an~ ada vitamin dia semua
[oh] [oh] i know so you are saving the earth by not eating sayur because you love the earth then the earth need more sayur
alright see i'm a genius
i need to tell that to my grandmother
my nenek love kambing man
she gonna give any excuse just to eat kambing
she can makan kambing for like
i don't know i think she can eat kambing for like
the whole month straight or something really [seh] we really have to macam kita kena macam hold dia back untuk
like from eating kambing it's just that bad but she got like high blood pressure all which is like bad [ah]
but i hate mutton taste
i hate mutton it smells like shit
ya i like vegetable
why
[oh] you god yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) that's cool
(oo)
[oh] my god
you just triggered my like primary school memories like i (uh) like my my last time school also they they tanam pokok ribena then they l~ they kasi like me macam
pegang the ribena punya fruit
it was quite cool like but i don't know how the dia orang d~ buat the fruit to the air gitu
macam like dia orang just
macam rendam kat dalam air ke apa
tapi
(um) dia punya buah dia like
like it's not even buah it's dia macam bunga gitu
tapi bunganya dia macam buah gitu [eh]
[oh]
to buy
to buy
pekat sikit pekat
yes
ya true
thick
like your thighs
[oh] but tapi dia buat apa competition
(mm)
ya
[oh] [dah] itu [jer]
[a'ah]
tapi cute [seh]
[oh] sedihnya
satu minggu [jer]
really
video
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] [ah]
i need that
i need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
i think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
i think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
(ugh) (uh) is this a f_y_p question
[oh] okay okay [ah] change the world i don't know [oh] my god i want to be more environment friendly [oh] my god talking about environment friendly
so i join like (uh)
like i join y_c_s [ah] then i went to this
this (uh)
what's it called
i don't know what is it call it's like a outing i don't know it's like [oh] it thi~ it's a volunteer it's a volunteering
like (uh)
b_y_o_b b_y_o_b stands for bring your own bag like (uh)
they held this thing like (uh) we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that (err) we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then (um) we will take out those (uh) which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then (uh) we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags [ah] so it was quite so it's a
(uh) then
i think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption [lah]
i think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
but i like the fact that we are like trying slowly now like we can we can also see like macam
singapore cuba try
to
jadi macam more environment friendly
like
i don't know dia orang buat like macam ada certain implement~
like they implement like certain things [ah] to make it better
like i think the like #pulau-semakau# like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast [ah] then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but i feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like i feel like singaporeans are just like
just rich like dia orang rasa like that sepuluh sen pon macam tak ada apa apa gitu so dia orang macam [oh] just bayar it gitu
so like they will still bayar it like that ten cent like i think we should like push it up to like fifty cents or something i know fifty cents [kan] confirm orang macam lagi terasa macam like [oh] my god that is like duit like i should really bawa my own plastic bag or like bag in general
ya true true
ya imagine like fifty cents it'll be like more like
ya for sure
so that's cool
why
and i never ask for plastic bag i bring my own bag
when
i'm so proud of
yes
change the world

that is very weird
(mm)
actually right like sometimes the benda-benda that we think
it would be nice to like tengok balik like now like ten years ago we will think it's like macam
(uh) no value like that
then you will just buang and then ten years later you like [eh] [oh] apa jadi with my thing and then you will rindu it
(mm)
that's true
(hmm)
yes
you can find cari satu soalan
remeh (hmm) i don't know the makna of that
[oh] pettiest !alamak!
pettiest

see
[oh] when they jalan and then the feet
tak angkat you know and then they're dragging their feet

(uh) london or wherever
and then he will bawa the orang and then they will (uh)
travel together in like a blue kotak you know a kotak biru and then they will fly through space and time
and
and then they will go to like different planets or different time periods then they will fight aliens or like
stuff that is like luar like
you know extraterrestrials actually it's very hard to explain it's very interesting
it's (um) it's a bit macam action but like
(um)
i feel macam ada like the disney show undertone so it's like every episode ada lain
villain and then like they fight
i don't know how to explain [ah] i thought it's actually macam merepek at the start
but then but then i watch this like [eh] this show is actually quite nice so i just
tengok aje and then i finish i finish (err) three seasons or something but the one of the seasons macam
the character macam menyampah and i cannot stand her and i always want to sepak her so i just skip the whole a bit first season

ya i don't know what is bad
maybe what if you like (uh) you want to okay let's say you don't beli if you do something and then you get one free like (uh) you marry one wife and then you get another one for free
[eh] that's like (uh) you get a kembar
[oh] my god what if the what if the couple macam
expect only one child and then
suddenly keluar kembar and then what are they going to do if they already prepare for only one child and then the other budak [eh]
no what if it's like the the
cause sometimes when you do the ultrasound then some people like [oh] i don't want to know the gender of my child
or something and then
the doctor also don't tell them that they ada twins and then sekali ada keluar dua
it's like [oh] surprise
anak i don't know however much
but like beranak a bit macam sakit like it feels it looks sakit you know even i don't want to think about it
i don't know
now i'm kidding [ah]
[oh] you know my mother got married like damn early
actually not that early [lah] she got married around like
twenty one
twenty two ya then she say she say [oh] cause [ah] nenek nenek kau [kan] selalu [ah]
buat bising then mak just kahwin [ah] just to get my freedom like

already in university and
like just before university [lah] then  dorang pun happy happy [kan] !yay! [dah]  boleh semi retire
[kan]
hurrah hurrah [kan]  mane kita nak pergi let's travel around the world
i think it's a long way to go when they are
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but it'll be fifteen years of fun [lah] so what's usually a birthday like
(uh)  macam gitu [lah]  kalau birthday  ni selalu we always tell people that you know [ah] really [ah] even when the adults celebrate the birthday [kan] frankly speaking !alamak! you know is really [ah] for the kids you know
it is really for them  pasal macam they really get into it you know  nanti [kan] (uh)  bila you tell them [eh] no need [lah] anything [lah]
coke anything also can but the kids are the ones that like [oh] must put this must put that [oh] must sing put the candle [ah]  semua ni [kan] all them [ah]
[oh]
that's why we say [lah] you know like that's what the house [ah] will come falling down i tell you
and you know [lah] usually [eh] some adults [ah] one or two of them will make the fatal mistake you know to give sugar
or sugar reduce drinks you know
[a'ah]
 ini topic [eh] i tell you [eh] i think every young adult [ah] will know this topic very well
[kan] [kan]  kita selalu gaduh [kan]
i think it's more frequent than that [kan] if only it was only every weekend you know  pasal every weekend [kan] is when you actually see [tau]
 kalau you  tak nampak in the week  pun [kan]  nanti dorang stealth tactic you know (uh)  bela~ behind your back [ah] [eh]  selit-selit kasi-kasi you know
[ah] and they will (uh) how shall i put this [ah] they don't even get defensive when you tell them [eh] how come [ah] when i was  kecik-kecik dulu tak pernah kasi pulak kena marah kena sebat
you know they they will just say no but that's you what you know
this is for my grandchildren !wah!
the double standard [ah] very good [ah]
[ah] so for me
no kids (uh) but i was (uh) raising  itu my nephews my nieces [kan] from the time they were young [lah] (um) partly because for (err) me (err) usually [lah] i'm not around in singapore  pasal
i was studying away [kan] abroad then after that when i was working also (um) i was living abroad most of the time  pasal kena posting
so  selalunye not here so when i'm back usually
my  apa abang or adik already  duduk kat rumah [lah]  jaga
my  mak [kan] pasal my  apa parents my late father dengan my mak my mak masih ada [lah] tapi my father [dah]  arwah so i moved them into my place [lah] so when i'm home in singapore [ah] i jaga all my anak sedara [lah]
so that's why i been there done that with all the birthdays [lah] you know
(err)  dulu mula-mula kerja dengan apa (err) foreign service
[ah]  jadi macam (err)
 lepas kerja sini tiga tahun lepas tu keluar empat tahun lepas tu come back home for about
you know couple of years and then after that you know when the big boss say [eh] you go [ah] [ah] then you go [lah] so to be honest [lah] i spent most of my (uh) youth away  pasal belajar [kan] you know away in university
then i come back  pun
as a young twenty something i'm usually out
(mm)
out of the country the thing is  ye [lah] [kan] people always say [eh] but you come back what you know what's the big deal but i said ya but people usually travel i don't travel i live away
that [ah] that the big different [lah]  pasal most people [kan]  macam business especially you go in go out  keluar masuk lepas tu  ye [lah]  paling-paling maybe  seminggu you know
one and a half weeks right go to two countries seal up your deal
[ah] so what were you doing before covid sales
[ah] okay okay
(uh huh) ya

(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] now mice [ah]
anything to do with travel anything to do with you know (err) in and out of country
gatherings
ya e~ everyone now just i think on survival mode [lah] you know basically now we all just day by day by day by day [lah]
 semalam
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] okay k
your first job [lah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
[ah]
 ini biasa [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
 tapi apart from  macam bonus  macam grade [kan] i mean  takde apa-apa macam incentive  ke or
[ah]
ya
ya
ya
(uh) is just to put [ah]  betul [lah]
actually [ah] your
ya actually [ah] your situation were quite similar to one of my good friend [lah]  pasal kita pergi sekolah sama-sama dulu-dulu [kan] one of my friend so he was
(uh) like you accountant also (err) s_i_a s_q so actually s_i_a  yang hantar dia so went to u_k  belajar lepas how many years [ah] three years ya three years  lepas tu balik [lah]  balik then of course serve the bond [lah]
serve the bond buat accounting [kan] and like you [lah] also quite good at it  dia punya bond  berapa [eh]  enam tahun masa tu
if i'm not wrong
(uh) (uh) for accounting
not too bad  pasal pun for them  dorang habiskan n_s  dulu baru pergi unlike me [lah]  pasal for me [kan] disrupt (uh) n_s
then [ah] then  pergi luar lepas tu [ah]  balik you see so
(err)  ye [lah] for
for me a bit different so  lepas tu my friend  balik as usual [lah]  kita [kan]
keep in touch
you know especially when  biasa [lah] [kan]  ada baby then baby shower
 lepas tu keep up  lepas tu kaya-kaya then  macam every  dua tiga bulan you know [eh] fed up [lah] let's go have  teh tarik adam road you know then one day out of the blue [kan] suddenly he said
[eh] i'm leaving [ah] my job
his last six years [lah] [ah]
you know i thought s_q's very good what no  ye [lah] but this is different i won't be going for posting what you know just stay office counting accounting accounting know to cut long story short  apa dia jadi nursing officer
[ah]  dekat hospital
until today [ah]  pulak sekarang covid [kan] [ah]  pulak dia #tan-tock-seng#
[ah] !wah! high demand  bukan more in demand high demand  sekarang mengeluh aja [lah] so he saw already like !alamak!  kene shift work  lepas tu tengok sape foreign worker everyday [kan]
(err) i think that's just tip of the iceberg [lah]  pasal masa period gini [kan]  kena buat banyak [lah] i think the most important yang  dorang kena buat triage  macam
 semua bila datang tu [kan] [ah]  nanti is (uh) people like my friend and his team [lah] then they check and then they ask them [eh] you look familiar [ah] because after a while [ah]
they keep coming back  tahu because now they know what to do like [oh] my back pain (uh)  dapat m_c [oh] i feeling
a bit fever [kan] and a lot of them now get full medical check up
[kan]  pasal when you tell them (ugh) my chest (ugh) cannot breath sir (ugh) (ugh) (ugh) [ah] then you cannot take the risk [kan]
so my friend after a while !wah!  boleh kenal muka tahu
so he will tell them [eh] you look familiar didn't i see you one month ago your m_c over [ah]
!huh! but it's tough [lah]
because the shift work [eh]
i mean basically (err) you don't have enough people [lah]
i mean that [one] for sure [lah] it must be twenty four hours  pasal you just never know when this virus will strike [kan] [ah] so  sebab itu susah [eh] for your job  yang last time  tu so you say you cover asia pac  selalunye which countries [ah]
[oh] indonesia (mm)
[ah]
[ah]
africa was actually my first department
[ah] see i'm older than you [kan] so  tahun sembilan puluh lima that's when i first started on the desk [lah] so i covered all fifty-four african countries
so i always joke
and tell people [lah] i literally cover [kan]

 pasal chad is spelt c h a d you know [ah] and then #djibouti#  pasal starts with a d d j

so i tell [eh] a to z know you think what [ah] fifty-four country you know a to z a to z so ya travel there a lot because that [one] wasn't posting [lah] that [one]  macam
you know  dua minggu pergi so two weeks there you'll be like you in south africa

then come back [ah]
then after one month [eh] you go back there again then you go to you know (um)  macam #namibia# then you go to south africa then maybe you go switzerland
[kan] (um)  macam gitu [ah] but back then [ah]
[ah] you cannot stay too long [lah]  pasal
got a lot of things to do [kan]
within say three days you are in one country [ah] !wah! you just pack the program
from breakfast early breakfast or you may even have working breakfast [kan]
so from that time [ah] you know  sampai ke malam [ah] then even after you finish your dinner you might still meet up you know for a couple of short meetings and then you also still have to do your work [kan]
so [ah] it's fun [ah] especially when you're twenty something [kan]  penat pun penat [lah] of course but you know it's fun get to see the world [ah] by the way this is pre-laptop pre-handphone [ah] i'm different era
(uh) no distraction but also [kan]
you must understand [ah] so much harder i mean  dulu
you know then you want to look for somebody you call their hotel number [kan] and then you must remember which room they are in [kan]
then (uh) you cannot find (uh) where you're going  mana ada google map google earth  ni semua right so !wah! everyone  cakap [eh]
now [ah] i cannot imagine [ah]
how you all last time [ah] work without all these [ah]
and i always tell people ya you all [ah] think now life so #mafan# [ah]  susah [lah]  ini [lah]  itu [lah]  leceh [lah] you know but imagine my time i told them started work [ah] no laptop is this thing called [ah] desktop
you know then when the first of the
(uh) when internet came along and then you are supposed to (uh) surf and
do some research [kan] then you must call up
your
(uh) ya what is it service provider [ah] using modem
[eh] but when you first started at starhub !wah! already [kan]
[ah] [ah] starhub cuppage [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
starhub was quite good also [ah] back then
[ah]
i've always been on s_c_v
in the which department
[oh] when they  itu ambil [lah] [kan]
[nah] i i've been (uh) using s_c_v until today  cuma sekarang supplement (uh)  gunakan netflix [kan]  gunakan you know rakuten view
[ah] banyak lagi [lah] sometimes you wonder still worth it or not
two [ah]  macam macam [dah]  tak worth it  gitu [lah] [kan]  pulak kena bayar tiap-tiap bulan
 budak-budak semua masih suka disney plus [eh]
[eh] good [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
now they are smart they know what to to target
i went through that whole serv~  apa (uh) how shall i put this [ah] i went through that whole cycle [ah] [kan] that whole cycle [ah]
of dora the explorer thomas the train ben ten
power ranger
twinx the magical fairy  ini semua [kan] that that was i went through the whole cycle
[kan] then you have to be always referee [kan]  nanti (uh)  yang satu nak tengok ini nak tengok powerband  lepas tu adiknya abang i want to watch something else  abang [ah] then you have to be referee [kan] then when the cousin  semua datang [ha]  lagi [lah] kalang kabut
then you know [lah] i'm not a big fan of letting them watch anything
on (uh) handphone or s~ tablet or whatever you see ya i bucked the trend long ago i always tell them kalau nak tengok semua share okay
[ah] good for you [ah]
[ah]  macam panadol you know
i think fair enough everyone has their own parenting style but i think you are absolutely right  macam mana pun [kan] i mean cannot [lah] you know when ipad first started [kan] i realised a lot of people buy stroller
then there's that little hook that you can put [kan]  dorang taruk situ then babies are watching it you know i started seeing that very quickly you see so
 macam ap~ kenapa [lah] you know maybe [lah] you call me jurassic [eh]  pasal i'm conservative about this thing [kan]  macam !huh! why is your baby looking at youtube [lah] and this and that [kan] to me if your baby's crying number one is actually good for baby to cry  pasal dia punya lung
get exercise  tahu
 cuma you don't want them to cry for of course one whole hour then something is definitely wrong go see doctor [lah] you know but otherwise baby cry pickup usually they will stop crying  pasal babies are
basically crying for attention you know and once they have human touch as you know you [kan]
father of four [kan] you  tahu [lah] [kan]  budak-budak ni semua  bila nangis then you  kasi attention  sikit aja semua okay
but i don't understand [ah] this parents [kan]
[ah] there must be other horror stories you see [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
exactly exactly [ah]  sama [lah]
no  pasal you  pun sekarang tengok nanti bila family  keluar [kan]
it's getting to be quite disturbing to me [lah] [eh] you know is quite disturbing [lah] no you go and see especially pre covid when families can go out [kan] then you see [eh] father mother two kids maybe [ah] maybe got maid [lah] [eh] s~ doesn't matter
then everyone is looking at their phone
while eating you know so to me is like [eh]
you are here to it as family so each one of you are too busy with your instagram your work mail your whatsapp so what's the point [ah] [oh] my friends  semua marah if i
say things like that you know [ah]  kena tegur sikit je semua melenting so  macam no [lah] you don't understand so i will said so what is it that i don't understand i live on the same planet way i have the same family structures [what]
right so wha~ what
kenapa i don't tak faham apa-apa you know say you know i don't understand you know these kids [ah]
said [oh] basically you can't be bothered [lah] you know to to to talk to them ask them ask them also no point they don't tell you what happened they just say okay okay okay
said  biasa [lah]
[eh] let's face it [lah] you know even we as teenagers [ah] last time [kan] remember when your mother  tanya score  macam mana [ah] okay [lah]
[kan] despite the fact that you had two fights that day
lost your homework  kena marah teacher don't know where was your wallet your friend
took it play a joke on you but when you come home just say okay [lah] nothing
where is up to you know as the parent for you too
[ah] tease out [kan] bit by bit and find out  semua [kan] all these kinds of things [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
(mm)
fullstop correct correct
and it's not shift work you know
you you are a parent twenty-four seven
no i think until you basically die i always remind people  pun [kan] you know let's face it you know even when you become a parent right your own parents can be eighty plus and you are maybe sixty plus right to them [ah] you are still [ah]
a six year old you know ya so that parenting continue and so that's something i always remind
people over and over again [lah] [kan]  pasal so is true what is twenty-four hour you cannot switch off  macam even  lepas i  hantar last time [lah] [eh] my  anak sedara and all that to their school whether it's kindergarten primary school whatever then i go to work
afternoon i check in [what]
although  ada maid ada  dia punya you know grandmother  kat rumah [kan]
but i will just check in okay everything okay you know came back k do homework or not are you know check check check right then when you come home is the same [lah] you know a you know tomorrow got what [ah] got e_c_a not you know got this now whatever
it's twenty four seven you cannot say like you say [lah] you know you cannot okay for two hours i cannot go up because it's my
duty you know no [lah] nothing to do with that
nothing
but i don't think it's it's just you i think (uh) there are still a small but good number of people yang macam you and that's good  tahu pasal
would to be honest i was teaching for about  setahun gitu for one
right cause i was an adjunct i was an adjunct lecturer then i saw the kind of (err) students that we have these days
even the good [ones] honestly [ah]
when you
you know take some time talk to them [kan]  tanya-tanya macam mana [kan] then you realize actually they are quite neglected
(err) by parenting
and usually it's parenting by default meaning [ah] is the maid
(mm)  tapi kesian juga you know and you can see it you know  macam quite a number of them
seek attention so they they really many of them  macam manja-manja dengan teacher  pasal macam
that is their their parental figure
[dah] [lah]  every day pergi sekolah [kan] and even during covid and home based learning [kan] they see the teacher still online [kan]  pasal
you are looking at the laptop [kan] and what not ya and although parents now k [lah] belatedly realised !hey! you know actually
quite good to spend time at home spend more time with family and all that
but i can tell you also when we went into phase two [kan] !wah!  budak-budak semua balik sekolah [kan]
no more home based learning for many schools [kan] !wah! most parents hurrah hurrah  pasal they can still work from home but the kids must go out !wah!
i saw so many
(mm)
 betul [kan]
(mm) (mm)
bit longer than that [lah]
ya (mm)
[ah]
[ah]
 ni macam shift work [kan] follow the time zone so tell the kids okay [ah]  tidur [eh]
maybe there are other common interests but definitely traveling is one of them [lah] [ah]
[ah]  betul
[ah]
or you can travel a bit [lah] take one day off to maybe  beli-beli barang boleh beli present [kan]
(mm)  beli present [kan] [ah]
especially if nearer to the school holiday  ke [kan]
!wah!
 musim apa musim sejuk

for me last time i would go to manchester  macam a few couple of months i go up  pasal i was studying [kan] that time
(uh) u_k cause i was
(uh) in university [kan] [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] i wasn't in london so you know
for my university (uh) it's already you know out of london so i just go up to manchester [lah] if i go to london i have to go down to london
[oh]  lepas tu nanti one of
not one [ah] couple of my friends  semua gila bola juga
then  dorang ada that time (uh) subscription [ah]
 macam membership you know so but the good thing is being asian  dorang semua mana macam muka kita
to them one of i mean you all look the same you know ma~ you know all this (uh) (uh) ya
english people so i'll just borrow someone's (uh) membership
card
and then watch the weekend game or something [lah] you know and my time don't forget because this is (uh) nineteen ninety [eh]
there's no man u wasn't big name
you know
ya it was like you know man city you know (um)
liverpool everton newcastle (um) all sorts of names which today are like a lot of the kids weren't even really remember unless they are really hardcore historian [ah] [kan] you know they track track [kan]
so we go and we go  bukan (uh) division one  aja we don't just go to premier league you know we also look for  yang macam
secondly thirdly [kan]
and back then also people go up three to two two to one you know and go up and down the league also very fast last time
 pasal takde big name  takde big player they weren't having all those kind of you know hundred million pound transfer you know that kind of thing
so that was (uh) always a lot of fun [lah] you know when i was also a student [ah]
then fast forward when you mention paris [kan] i actually (uh) live there two thousand four two thousand eight
(mm) (mm) (mm) i was posted to paris  tapi from paris i also cover (uh) three other countries [lah] i'm based in paris but i also cover spain portugal and another country so  empat
country [lah]  yang kena jaga so for me [ah] when people come usual [lah] you know then they'll want to go to euro disney and then don't forget [ah] i was also surprised your wife didn't drag you to the
not the duty free but the premium outlet
[ah]  pasal
[ah] because that [one] is one stop
[oh]
eu~ euro disney you see
[ah]
so a lot of people will go there to go premium outlet [lah]
and  kalau pergi london  tu just outside  selalu ni all this (uh)
housewives all these  makcik-makcik will want to buy the wedgwood
[ah] dinner set the porcelain and all that you see
[ah]  dorang bukan beli satu dua orang lain semua order pasal dorang ship tahu
singapore i mean wherever you are in the world [lah] so !wah! #shiok# you know so i was in paris (uh) two zero four to eight so  empat tahun [ah]  kat situ
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) i live (err) i lived in (err)
(err) the eight
sorry sixteen in the sixteen
(err)
quarter [lah] they call it [ah] so i'm literally halfway between #champs-elysees# the arc of #triomphe# to and eiffel tower
so from my window every night [kan]
 nanti nampak yang that  lampu tu [lah] [kan]  dia macam lighthouse [kan] every night [ah] [ah] so i'll see that light [lah]
circling circling
so i lived in the really the central part [ah]
[oh] so easy for me pasal i just walk to office only about ten minutes
ya so it's quite (uh) good
(mm) [ah] that's the #gare-du-nord# (mm) (mm) (mm)
the museum [ah] [ah]
[eh]  penat juga budak-budak
[ah]
 naik stroller [lah] two of them
[ah]
actually #gare-du-nord# when you  keluar pun makanan sedap pasal banyak
halal  banyak kebab  banyak yang #maghrebian#  nya [kan]  yang daripada morocco  daripada daripada mana [eh] (uh) tanz~
ya [lah] (mm) the #maghreb# areas [lah] (mm) morocco algeria you know those kind of places
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
they they call it #bateaux-mouches# the flyboat
[ah]  ada dua option satu you just  naik yang lagi satu boleh makan
[ah] [ah]
burn down [ah]
so you saw when it was still
[oh]
no it's actually [eh] really really
really a shock to to many people when notre dame burned down  pasal that thing has been around for so long
and it's  macam symbol [lah] paris [kan] so  bila
[ah]
 bukan sabotage  bukan ada terrorism
[ah] sebab itu [lah]
 sedih juga pasal orang kalau naik boat boat  ni semua dorang touring [kan] it's really really
!wow! you know it's really inspiring you see
ya and i do miss (uh) living there  pasal it's really one of the most beautiful cities in the world [lah] you know without a doubt [lah] you know
ya
paris [eh]  memang really made for walking even compare to london you know london  macam k [lah] you can walk a bit a bit [lah]  tapi after a while  macam
[ah] boring you lose your way and then is quite dirty also you know in london you know and  macam after awhile there's no change in the scenery [kan]
(mm)
correct correct
i agree
correct don't look down you know i always tell people when you're in paris [ah] look up you know ya
i mean once in a while
 kena tengok bawah [lah]  pasal dorang banyak apa itu taik anjing semua ni [kan]
[ah] then they will just litter the place you know it's like ridiculous you know
but it's a really really a nice place [lah] you know so it's quite good to go
they got [lah]  nanti after covid
[ah]
after covid even for me  pun frankly [lah] [eh]  lepas i came back two thousand eight
after that i rarely go out anymore [lah]  pasal pun tukar kerja then
basically mostly  dekat singapore [lah]
 tak tak keluar-keluar and it's by choice [lah]  pasal
you know is also question of family and a question of you know looking after people especially my  mak [kan] seventy seven this year and ya so she still lives with me i don't live with her she lives with me there's a big difference
and also then for me travel just means basically usually weekend [ah]  masuk #johor# [lah]
(mm)
(mm) and also  pun !aiya! you know  boleh beli barang-barang lebih murah you know and many
things are easy you know and even when you've got kids [kan] like i've got even (uh) grand nephews grand nieces [kan]  yang dekat malaysia then its easy to (uh) go to
legoland [kan]  pergi makan-makan
relax relax you know so quite fun [lah]
you know (uh)
especially now waiting for the borders to reopen [ah] i suspect will probably
only be able to travel [kan] pergi #johor# and whatever  sebelum kita boleh really go out there again [lah]
know  dekat-dekat [lah] you know maybe
likewise also we need them for workers you know (um)  pasal every day before covid [kan] between two hundred to three hundred thousand [eh]  dua ratus tiga ratus ribu tahu [kan]  bukannye satu dua ribu [kan]
they come here
ya come here they work and then they go back again so
at the end of the day you know we know [lah]
you know we need each other and but you're definitely right  pasal apa dia punya
 penjaja all the businesses it's very hard for them without us you see
[ah]
paradigm paradigm (mm)
(uh) paradigm about two years about two years [ah]
(mm)
ya ya [ah]
obviously [lah] but also don't forget catered also for the #johorians# who work here  pasal
the ones who are here most of them will open up a p_o_s_b d_b_s account
because of the payroll
mean you used to be in m_o_f you know this [lah] pasal you know they don't l~ you know ask them to open with up to the other retail banks [kan] so
[ah] even for your maid you know today anyway [lah] [eh] these days
as soon as you hire one [kan] then  dorang buka [kan] payroll payroll  nye tu d_b_s p_o_s_b [ah] so  dorang gunakan apa dorang gunakan nets
[ah]  dia by two [kan] when you go there  sekarang some shops [lah] they definitely accept nets which is good [lah] you know
 pasal even for their workers [kan]  lepas tu balik malaysia [lah]  nak kena pakai ringgit pulak up [kan] nak tukar duit
[kan] when their salary is already in sing dollars so  dorang !alah! pakai nets aje [lah]  lebih senang
 tak susah
but you can tell [ah]  macam the shopping mall over there you know you can go onto all those sites [kan]  yang nanti orang ambil gambar ambil youtube ghost town  betul [lah]
is really bad  macam city square tu [kan]
(um)  orang semua tengok !wah! really really ghost town you really really wonder how they are going to survive
ya hopefully [lah] it'll be a slow and painful process [lah] but you know everyone is going through the same thing so it's not  macam kita aje [kan] you know
is everyone everyone is going through the same thing so  macam gitu aje [lah]
[ah]
[ah] that's always good question  tahu pasal macam orang selalu cakap you know to me  macam each one is so different [kan] so
but generally [lah] my preference honestly is to go to a place where no one knows me and then i can just lose myself
you know ya  pasal dulu pun when i was a student then you know [lah] budget pun  bukannye banyak [kan] even though you know you got sponsorship and this and that so we are the type  macam
okay we go italy one day milan two day rome one day
you know you just  ambil gambar ambil gambar
and that's it you know  macam you  tak appreciate the country you don't really appreciate the culture you  tak duduk bersimbang-simbang you know have the equivalent of  teh tarik with a local you see
but as a working adult that's what i did [lah] you know just to go round and then lose myself in the crowd  lepas tu berbual-berbual with the local or foreigners who live there you just make friends [kan] [ah] so for me that's where it's quite you know
that that's more it [lah] you know
but i must say (um) not so much now [lah] but in the early days then hanoi was really good destination for me  pasal that was my first posting i lived there for four years ninety-seven to two thousand and one
and that was the earliest  yang dorang  baru [jer]  buka [kan] (err)
(err) not not easy [lah] to go in [kan] that so really really under developed but the people were slowly getting used to
 orang asing you know so was a lot of fun [lah] you know and then after that even after i left i made it a point maybe every three years to come back visit old friends
see the developments but the changes [kan] since my time there and it's been what you know (uh) more than twenty years [kan] almost what twenty five years maybe the changes are immense so even i don't recognize it anymore
[ah] [ah] okay good we are one hour already
[ah] we can stop recording
okay let's stop recording stop now
yes
i'm going to be wearing this nonya kebaya [lah] it's pink and it's gold
tapi bawah dia actually is kain daripada indonesia dia javanese punya batik [ah]
tak [lah] kawan aku cakap dia beli murah [jer] kat indonesia she said you can get like cheaper things in indonesia macam kalau kau nak buat kebaya-kebaya semua just buat kat sana
because it can be done in like thirty dollars for like something that will cost seven hundred and fifty here
no (uh) kitten just me
no kita just
kita just kena pretend [ah] macam this conversation [ah] kita boleh tukar-tukar background kau nak pergi paris kita boleh tukar pergi paris
boleh [lah] kita just tukar nama dia orang as a dengan b
(mm)

let's say let's say hypothetically speaking [ah]
kalau aku kahwin dengan andre

he never like remain in contact and that it was his fault and i'm like nah it's all good

the social distancing people even went there

(mm)
he don't know how to find job is it

(mm)
i think there's a there's like a there's like an experiment [eh] where you get paid for just sleeping
ya
!wah! i'll be great and that [sia] andre sure [sia] will be good at that
he always he always !huh!
i don't sleep twelve hours he doesn't sleep twelve hours he only sleeps for five hours babe
and he sleeps very early like whenever i stay that's why like if you like message me in the middle of the night i won't see because i will be sleeping also
!wah! snowy jingle bells but ya like if he's very tired the earliest right we have gone to bed is nine thirty
it's nine thirty but by three a_m by three a_m he will wake up
(mmhmm) i always i always cannot sleep like
early when i'm alone
!huh!
buat lagi buat lagi macam mana kau tidur dalam lubang
i don't know when i mean when i was with my ex for six years also we never like kinda like i don't understand how couples can do it like we will cuddle for awhile and then we will say good night then we will both turn our separate side
i also cannot like panas [sial] only like with andre also we will cuddle for awhile then we will say good night and we will turn and sleep or sometimes andre will andre andre is a cuddler so andre will like put his hands but then after awhile i will like tell him like it's okay you can move your hand because i know it'd be uncomfortable but that is only sometimes if not he will also turn the other side but i will wake up to him cuddling
i don't know how but i will wake up to him cuddling it's either i wake to him cuddling or i wake up to him doing work downstairs
or he come up a wake me up with a cup of tea and tell me to wake up
it is only when i'm very tired like most of the time right i wake up but then then i see okay [lah] he already wake up he cause i know he always wake up very early then i say okay katil dah kosong dia dah tak ada dia bangun [kan] but i cannot like the bed very comfortable [lah] then i just go back to sleep
so sometimes i wake up then i turun bawah already cause he's doing work right then i see breakfast dah ada
he doesn't i mean he will cook [lah] once in a while but lately we've been buying (err) he will go down cause he will go cycling in the morning like he will go cycling at six a_m
i don't know how i don't know where he'd
i don't know where he get the energy from [sia] he would wake up at like on saturday on like saturday monday and tuesday cause i always stay from like
the saturday until tuesday standard then okay saturday because i will come in the afternoon so he will play football he will play football so tomorrow morning he's going to go play football chances are he went home drunk tonight and he's drunk is not like
the drunk we know like our kind of men do it like the my the way my ex used to get drunk not like that like he can still function you can still talk he can still like get dressed mandi take out his clothes and stuff and all that [lah] so
every friday he will go out with the boys so saturday sunday monday tuesday's our time right then saturday morning it's either he will play football if you never sign up for football he will go cycling then afternoon i'll come because you know i would not wake up in the morning
every time i plan every time i plan right like i confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then i say okay ten thirty
then he was okay he he still can layan okay ten thirty aku tak bangun kadang-kadang i will wake up early i'll wake up at eight but then [ah] because i wake up too early right then i tell myself okay [lah] my alarm ten thirty (uh) no my alarm at nine thirty so i can still sleep i still got one hour of sleep right that one hour of sleep become two hours sleep [lah] bloody hell then when i wake up it will be always like after ten thirty then i see my message he already
babe still asleep right
i cannot so like even today i i'm ask him [lah] whether he got football not so that i know what time to come by then he said yup i sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
[oh] so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick [ah] just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
ya see so so it's not that there is nothing to do it's because kau orang pemalas
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do i don't know [ah] it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like [oh] he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but i don't know why he's telling me ya
i mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making [eh] like it's pointless like i told andre because (uh) last i think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle [lah] so i felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me [lah] but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well i mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscio~ conscious choices [what] anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like i'm not going i'm i'm i love being lazy i love the bed right but
if i allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will i be [sia] so i told him like okay i mean i do enjoy cycling in the morning and i don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when i'm not with you i will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like i'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise [ah]
(mm)
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
#syed# better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar [what] and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself [lah] like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like i like i said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while i'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and i will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and i will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes i will never like i will never like distract him on purpose [lah] but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right i got nobody to wake me up
then i sleep until twelve p_m [sia]
i wake up to him waking me up because he buy back lunch he walked back from his office and he got lunch for the both of us then he makan lunch already he go back to office
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like [oh] (um)
i don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and i will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
i was living your life girl
i was living your exact life i was where you are now
trust trust i was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and i didn't like pick him up
and i will always stay at home i didn't even get to meet any of my friends i didn't get to go out because if i go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
i i really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
(mm) same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to i mean like
now you may not but i'm very sure eventually you'll get there [lah]
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
i told you already [what] tomorrow i'm going gift shopping
with andre i'm thinking whether i should get him a batik shirt [ah] to match me but kedai mana ada jual sekarang
on a saturday
but it sure is
pukul berapa dia orang buka dia orang buka tak saturday
pukul berapa dia orang buka because if
upper #joo-chiat#
arab street punya mahal #doh#
cause afternoon we're going to town to go robinsons or #tangs# i think and then i was thinking okay by the time kita habis we will probably be eating dinner
because chances are but i'm only i'm meeting him at like one p_m [what] so i'm meeting at one p_m
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
and then we will go to town so i won't have time to go and bring him there then i was thinking kalau dia orang buka pagi then i can go and buy first
and then harap-harap [ah] dia boleh muat
i don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
because i don't think he got i don't think he got i don't think he got baju that will match that colour dia ada baju yang boleh match ni
but the other one i'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt i know he got a lot of pink shirts [ah] but i don't know whether it will look good together i'll see [ah] i'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then i have to finish writing my speech
yes
i'm i'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
he will eat [lah] he will eat he he he likes food in general babe dia tak picky when it comes to makan dia tak picky like even when you spicy like deepavali aku bawa bawa balik apa lauk-pauk
then he eat but it was really spicy for you [ah]
he eat but he's still white
so like white people [kan] standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
[oh] my god that one would kill him
he will just die
i am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that i've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one [what] i mean if you are near the area then ya [lah] if not it'll be very troublesome for you [what]
!wow! i wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope [ah] out of curiosity
when is #syed's# birthday
january what
[oh] my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
i mean you are not a gemini [lah] but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs [what] your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
do it do it do it babi
!wah!
i'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and i i i will message them [one] know in like the last message i got was that [ah] [oh] it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
(hmm)
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
i can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if i travel with you i know i confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
!aiyo!
i'm so tired
yes and i still have like things to do after this i cannot go to sleep yet
well i'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then i'm going to pack my things and then i'm going to go out
ya i must like spare my baju-baju or what i mean i have some of like my my things there but i don't have my clothes there i have my workout stuff i have my my boxing gloves are there
my some of my underwear is there
like i already have a toothbrush there and he already bought a shampoo for me that's there so like that one all tak payah fikir [lah] but other than that he's bald what he want to wash

i don't think they were pirates or something [lah] i think you i think you
in bahasa #indon# or in melayu
anyhow only [ah]
are you googling

(uh huh)
are you on the must share news dot com that one the seven facts about #bugis# people

that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something (uh)
ya
sure sure
merepek [sia] its like
the spur of the moment that kind of thing [eh]
but i'm glad you i'm glad you thought it through [lah] !huh!
but you would think
!huh!
[ha] i didn't know [oh] ya yes ya recently like one of the budak yang [dah] o_r_d he came back to station what last night
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of #angmohs#
then the guy like bawa motor [ah] macam
then he bawa motor then he got tattoo then the #angmoh# like [eh] !wah! you are so cool then the malay guy was just like
#siao# [lah] ini semua malik in singapore ada [sia]
bukan apa yang special
but he like just step step begini [ah] like that
but the #angmohs# were like you're you're so cool
ya [lah] he working at some burger
like the standard [lah] kadang kadang belakang
on the arm
it's a belakang tangan dia begitu ada apa tu flower something like that [ah]
is that an actual thing i've never really heard of
that you could do it
(uh huh)
i mean ada colour punya ke
tapi beberapa beberapa begitu beberapa ratus [ah]
[orh] i know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people [ah]
no [lah] it's just like her own macam tak ada kerja nak buat then just
brand tattoos for her friends that kind [ah]
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first [lah]
which is macam gila [sia]
macam tengat buat kerja tidur [ah]

actually
you you know you know about the apa the bekam before
yang bekam melayu dia
[ah] like cupping
you know what's cupping

then there's like the bekam kering dan bekam basah so the bekam basih right it's they poke
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part [lah]
so while i was getting that thing i was just thinking [ah] [sia] [lah] sakit [pe] this one confirm macam
i think like this is what tattooing feels like [ah]
and maybe if you ever think about getting tattoos again you should go for the bekam first [lah] then
you see how it feels [ah]
but like sakit gila [sia] it's like
pedih [ah]
like getting injections over and over again

was that on impulse also or what
habis
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
that your sisters what

so aku tolong [sia] buat hose testing tu
ya we just connect the hoses to the hydrant then so we just turn on then tengok yang mana telah bocor ke apa so yang bocor we put to one side
then tolong tolong [jer] [lah] make up dengan tukar botol semua
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes [ah] more like it
[ah]
half was that half was
half was like
i actually felt bad [lah] cause like i had to walk past them and then go upstairs begitu takkan nak buat bodoh [pe] naik atas lepak [jer] [ah]
so they were
like my team mates so tolong [jer] [lah]
that was the other half [lah] the other half was
[dah] buat salah
buat baik sikit
but ya other than that
next morning straight away skip baris pun
(err) what time [ah]
like
six thirty kira bangun and then tengok bawa mendap then six thirty [ah]
so sixty thirty bangun tengok bawah mendap
then dia orang duduk [jer] then he like okay [lah] kita balik [ah]
so we balik tidur
then so seven fourty five bangun

i mean okay [lah] no rush like not like i'm in a rush to do anything also so like okay [lah] just tidur [ah]
ya
[orh]
then keluar makan semua semua
[ah]
apa ramai ramai [ah]
[sia]
[oh] then my medical call
not bad [ah]
quite interesting [ah]
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my e_m_t was like chill [lah] yes [ah] okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
kalau merepek ke apa
not nak merepek [lah] but it's like tak tak tak serious [ah]
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
as in we were rushing up but tak macam lari tak lari [ah] just like brisk walk that kind of thing
then we reached the lift lobby
we reached the lift lobby then suddenly one guy came running then he was like panting and berpeluh semua then he come in already
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my p_o ask him
(err) are you the one who called just now then the guy was like [ah] ya ya
then i started asking him then he said ya he [oh] his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when i came
straight away the second shock given
which is (uh) pretty rare [ah] to to to see like shocks getting given by the a_e_d [ah]
ya but the guy
beberapa shock [ah]
[dah] beberapa shock already
tapi they shock all in the ambulance [ah]
(uh huh)
[oh]
[orh] but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping [ah]
i i think so
itu kali bila dia orang jumpa dia tak tak breathing [ah] no breathing no pulse
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for sh~ with a shock
[oh]
[ah] quite fast [ah] actually cause yang abang dia jumpa dia
so dia abang jumpa dia then he collapsed so i that one maybe estimate five
tak (um) i think i think five ten minutes max until the brother found him
then the abang straight away he called nine nine five then he started doing c_p_r
then i think nine nine five dispatch the near the my responder app ke apa [kan] ya people actually use that [ah] do you know that people actually use that
compulsory to what
[oh] serious [ah]
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay [lah] i mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay [lah] that guy quite nice the the community responder
he naik basikal then he cycled over
cause he was at home [ah] he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah]
so from from no breathing no pulse [ah]
[oh] ya that guy
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so it's within like ten minutes kena buat c_p_r [ah] kalau tak buat then
confirm gone [ah] is it
macam just show show face [ah] okay
(uh huh)
got the what again
[ah] the the one and two and three and four and that kind [ah]
[ah]
wait that was a doctor [ah]
asal boleh [jer] doctor
it isn't you know
!wah! rabak [pe]
#sian# [sia]
who gets to do as in nobody want to do [oh] nobody wanna do
why [sia]
(uh)
!huh!
but (uh)
i was talking to the the guy who came back station also [lah] so he was saying that
cause
when this f_m_v is a new thing also [ah] like during out time was it f_m_v or tak ada
[orh]
ya so
i don't know how useful this thing is [lah] but like
i don't know [lah] like a bit half useful a bit half macam
no point
cause i don't think i don't think anybody would ever get conveyed their f_m_v [ah] apa tu
siapa about conveyance
[oh]
like normal alpha tak ada buat [ah]
so f_m_v can [what]
!huh!
[ah] ya ya the ugly one [lah]
[oh]
ya ya
[oh] ya i d~ d~ d~ #ding# was telling us [lah]
actually they can buat c_p_r [ah] habis buat c_p_r
terus yang nyonya tu
dia ada feeding tube so makanan terkeluar
habis cakap busuk gila [ah] so then he straight away ask the boy to take over
also he said dia [dah] nak muntah tu
like busuk sangat nak muntah you take over [ah]
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the f_m_v [lah] f_m_v recall
[ah]
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
medical relay [ah] habis dia nampak segak entah
okay [ah]
cause i came also like
tak [ah] pakai seluar [jer] [ah] bunker dengan seluar
then the top helmet put tak pakai so it's just bo~
bawa that one medical punya equipment bag then itu [jer] [lah]
then go up
but okay [lah] fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress [lah] cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
i was the f_m_v sec com ya
no [lah] but my p_o is e_m_t trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if i came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my p_o is e_m_t trained
ya [lah] definitely [sia]
i like i mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge [lah] but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the [ah] p_o take charge
cause the p_o [dah] kena buat one year e_m_t course [ah] as in their e_m_t attachment to the medical side
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
last time macam indefinitely [kan] dia orang kat medical side
but now makes sense [ah]
ya
f_m_v and fire bike
!huh! ya ke
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
[oh]
(uh huh)
eight people
!wah!
but asal boleh sampai lapan orang buat c_p_r is it wasn't like alpha be come like on time and then
[oh]
but wonder how often it's actually being used [lah] in
[ah]
[ah]
[eh] my friend from #paya-lebar# also the madam told them don't turn out [sia]
they said they want to minimise
[ah] they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
[ah] fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
i #suay# [ah] my
it's just my d_i_c sekarang like baru like #ons# [ah] sikit
ya [sia]
don't know [ah] apparently it's the first time [ah] that
only the
they said because of the c_f_s or something [ah]
but i don't know [ah] not really buying it
ya c_f_s baru tukar about two months ago
okay [ah] #bo-pian# [ah] just go [ah]
then they also all the all the people were like
he ask us like (uh) sec com for f_m_v i left [oh] ya the worst part is that f_m_v dengan l_f is double meaning now
so like the p_l one five tu sekarang is on repair
so l_f one five two replace p_l one five two
so
l_f one five two crew also turn out for f_m_v
you get it
so i'm i am
so i am f_m_v i'm f_m_v one five one right
at the same time i am l_f one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
cause the crew is the exactly the same so macam p_o sama
ya so it's called dou~ double meaning [ah]
so like
ya [lah] so must just be extra alert
okay [lah] but as in #bishan# usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
then ya [lor] that's my last duty [ah] double meaning but i left tak ada call [lah]
ya tak ada
not bad [lah] at least i got to experience a medical call
like it
okay [lah] interesting interesting
i mean at least if ever really i come to a
like betul betul i need to do c_p_r on somebody i think i'd be a bit more confident now
ya
pasal macam before this you only pernah dengar macam belajar theory [kan]
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different [sia]
what didn't you download the app
[ah]
(uh huh)
i mean apa office cakap
i think for you all different [lah] cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then i think it's okay [ah]
download what
[oh] no [lah] i don't even have my
cert for that one
i don't know i i think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
[oh] the card [ah]
[oh] for a res~ as a reservist [ah]
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
siapa [sia]
what did i what did i teach you
[oh]
why did i
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
(uh huh)
[oh] i was reading on reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected [ah]
[oh] ya our
i was reading on reddit right like
got people who like
mpty-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
i don't know [ah]
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
that one they are not choking already [ah]
!huh!
so in the end convey ke tak convey
[ha]
in case anything happen like just cover your back [ah] is it
[orh]
[oh] so she wanted to go to the hospital [ah]
!huh!
at least rabak call like you shagged out but at least you are doing
something [lah] you feel like you are contributing it ya
siapa siapa yang call
[oh]
[ha]
!huh!
asal dia sengaja swallow ke
bodoh [sia]
so you were already were were you there on the scene already [ah] for this
this is the more all the at least this is one of the more interesting punya merepek punya call [ah]
apart from the yang the maid the kena rasuk that one
that was that was was that you
[orh] wasn't you [ah] [ah]
!wah! yesterday they were telling me like
(err) ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
after did you hear about the one the my batch as in the one that i going to o_r_d already then the guy kena rasuk [one]
ya ya that one that one
then
merepek [sia]
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
(err) something like that [lah] so macam there's this very thick
heavy door ke apa [kan]
that you can close
[ah] so like
then two of them [dah] terkeluar so got one guy left inside
then dia orang dua macam main main [lah] so they
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then dia orang tunggu kat luar then like [eh] asal tak perasan [sia]
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
banging on the door like tolak tolak tapi tak ada buka
and like the lampu was on everything
then he like
[sia] [lah] like tak ada buka [ah]
so then he don't know why okay this part this part is (err) a bit scary part [ah] he don't know why but he went to panjat to the downstairs the scary part
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
so it's like you can take the ladder to go downstairs to the first floor punya fire fighting store
then which doesn't make sense because
downstairs is confirmed locked apa
if upstairs tak buka then korang downstairs is like even worse it's gonna be locked also

the the only similarity is that i've been working in the sun

so
really rare to meet people who stay in #jurong#

i see some of the comments kat facebook [kan] dia orang kata macam
my bridesmaids [jer] [dah] ten
dah dah dah lima then groomsmen like lagi lima orang
how to (uh) get married like that then i'm like
i don't even think i have like bridesmaid you know
that's why then i was like patut [lah]
maid of honour [ah] that one different
ya that's why i'm like
ya then they were like macam bising [ah] like (uh)
we already planned this wedding for a long time and i have five bridesmaids then you say can only invite ten people so how am i going to go through with this
(uh) with my majlis perkahwinan then i'm just like
ten people i think i have eight people then the other two is just extra i have to invite because they are family you know
ya ya it's like
tak tak faham [ah]
ya
[oh]
ya ya (um) then your your brothers not married yet
[oh] that's like next month
[oh]
i don't think so [ah]
like
ya because their cases also very crazy [ah] that's why
i mean i also miss going to j_b and things like that [lah] but then
a bit scary [lah]
(err)
(mm)
i almost said city square mall but i know that's not
the mall that i'm talking about [ah] ya ya that's not that right ya
city square mall isn't that in singapore
tak tahu [ah] the name semua macam sama gitu i don't know ya
ya but you get what i mean [lah] ya ya
(um) usually woodlands [ah] i take the the stupid bus to go over
then ya ya ya
[oh]
you boleh drive tak
[oh] ya okay okay
(uh)
!wah! you busy [sia]
but good [lah] ya
correct correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
[oh]
[a'ah]
(mm)
!wah! you not bad [ah]
still going strong (ugh)
ya
(mm)
is it i love wearing the mask [eh]
it's unpopular opinion i know ya because i don't like to smile
so when i don't when i wear the mask people don't expect me to smile i mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya [lah] that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya i mean actually i'm not unhappy or you know i just have the (uh) the what they call the resting bitch face [ah]
so when i work at events because usually they pay quite high so i don't mind smi~ smiling you know like [oh] hi welcome to apa apa apa you know then
do [ah] then after that then i will just like
my my resting face will go back during break time or something [ah]
you know
so ya but then
now like go out everything like because everyone wear mask [what] then also i think people cannot recognise me so i'm quite happy like i mean not like i famous ke apa [lah]
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
you don't want to tegur like that then you just like !alamak! dia ni lagi then
hope they don't recognise me and think i'm just another malay girl
so i just like walk past them
ya ya
tegur
[oh] [oh] ya ya ya ya ya ya betul tak tak sombong [ah] nanti dia cakap sombong then you know cause usually never wear wear the mask then they'll be like
(uh) [eh] you very sombong [eh] sekarang like then i'm like
sometimes i don't even notice them you know when i'm just like blur [lah] you know like
you penat kerja then you just like you know zone out and then you just walk home or something but then sometimes i bumped into them then i never see then dia orang kata i like macam
sekarang dah sombong [eh] what what what then i'm just like what you know so
now wear mask bedek-bedek [oh] tak perasan [lah] like you know like ya but i understand what you mean by rimas also i think that one is just because singapore is hot
ya
ya
(mm)
nak snow tak nak [ah] that one kiamat already
ya
so
[ah]
apa
hello
apa
[oh] f&b but now no more [ah]
actually i don't know whether i want to still work with them i like recently i got like macam change of heart
then i want to find another industry to work at
dah tua [ah] like macam tiring [ah] events
then also
apa
[ah] ya still searching [lah] that's why i i end up
about knowing this [lah]
ya
[a'ah] ya [lah] that's why i'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that i apply for right it's either i don't have the qualifications so i'm not accepted
or they say that i'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
[ah]
apa
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
that's why
my friend dia nak jadi temperature screener [kan] dekat kedai tu [kan]
then dia orang kata mesti ada diploma then i'm like
susah sangat ke temperature screener you know like apa [seh]
tak makes sense [ah] i think dia orang macam sengaja nak
buat susah you know then they complain like you know [oh] nobody want to apply padahal
i don't know [ah] what's going on also
(mm) depends [ah]
they said
(mm)
ya [lor] recently i got a job offer
(um) the pay is okay [lah] the the work scope and time also okay
tapi the people like freaking toxic [seh] then i cannot take it then i just like say like i don't want to come back
ya
[ah] what
kerja apa (uh) teaching
[ah] tak but i got (um) biasa [ah] tuition experience and like you know
i do events so i can quote unquote handle classroom gitu
then i mean
technically i think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
i don't know about you [lah] but ya
(mm) (mm) then
(mm)
(mm) ya usually they they like (um) and they like they prefer
m_o_e registered people [ah] usually
but like
ya i
what
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's why i usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax [ah]
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya then apa lagi [eh] (uh)
ya then now also like nak classroom but then because you have to adhere to the covid regulations then like macam
every hour kena sanitise gitu [ah] like (ugh)
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope [ah]
then macam malas gitu [ah]
ya but this one dia toxic [ah] the the
the other teacher no actually actually the the other teachers are quite okay [lah] cuma the management [ah] like macam
ngada-ngada [ah] i don't know how to say
[ah]
that's why
ya
because i was there for training
then like the first three days the management tak datang so i'm like okay [ah] this job like not bad [ah] i quite enjoying myself like still not very
like macam
(um)
not very good friends with the rest of the teacher but boleh [lah] can manage [lah] you know not so
not so terrible like i don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
(um) tengok how i work [lah] you know
then then they say a lot bad things about me then dia orang
like they just like mood totally go down [seh] i don't know [ah] then
ya she damn cari pasal [ah] like with me like semua benda yang i buat which i think is like
not even her problem dia macam tak okay
then i like malas already then ya then like
because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training [tau]
then she say to me like (um) what [ah]
you come here you don't know anything (uh) then how you going to teach the kids
then i'm like isn't this what's the point of training like i
if i know everything why i training right like bodoh [pe] perempuan ni
ya
apa
ya ya
ya
she said twice [eh] in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting [what]
so (uh) she complain to the boss in chinese
(uh) then then i know what he what they she roughly mean [ah] i don't get like everything but i boleh faham sikit-sikit [ah]
so ya the i was i know already she talking about me and she say about how like
aku baru then aku tak tahu apa-apa you know things like that then i'm like
fine whatever just
keep quiet [ah] then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
or is it the next day or something like that then she like tegur me [ah] she was like
then she was like okay i'm going to test you then i'm like [eh] kau orang belum ajar aku apa-apa then kau orang nak test aku
but then i'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously i passed [lah] because i do have the
credentials like
i know what i'm doing [lah] basically it's just
i don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so i don't know what's their method they never tell me so i (uh) obviously but
if i if you ask me to do one plus one i know how to do [lah] because
i know how to do [lah] gitu so i managed to pass the test [lah] then she was like okay actually (um) i think you can
do okay you can quite teach [lah] but then
(uh) you don't know anything so i (uh) that time i'm just like malas [seh] nak datang balik
ya so that one gone [ah]
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
biar dia cari orang lain
you want kira work from home [ah] i don't want [seh]
(err)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
but in in terms of i_t what do you mean
like
(mm)
[ah]
[oh] you mean dev~ [ah] are you like developers or
not really
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
!wah! that's interesting [ah] i was contemplating learning that
ya because (um)
upper course ya
that's cool [ah]
because i got media arts
(um) diploma advanced diploma ya
so i understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it i don't know it's
pointless to go to the office i don't know
ya
obviously ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
i think everywhere is always renovating [ah] so it's okay
ya like i
okay they pause be a bit because of covid then i think because of the dorm situation also
ya
but then now i i see like macam dia orang dah potong semua pokok semua i don't know what the hell they are doing but okay [lah] i guess
ya
(mm) suffocating
like means what
[oh]
i don't know [eh]
my friends semua macam introvert dengan homebody juga so it was quite fun [lah] for us circuit breaker we just
all on our computer then we all just like zoom call each other macam
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
you ask them to jumpa right like like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone [oh] i i free then i'm not free then i'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like [eh] actually i don't feel like going out [ah] then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
#shiok# [ah] like we living our best life [ah] but then i suffocated in a sense that
(um)
i don't like my family
i think i stayed
too wild too long in that's why i'm like macam
sometimes the things they do is just
[ah] ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy [lah] because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
[oh] (um) still the same also [lah] two but (um) i'm the eldest so that's why
i don't know it's very weird [leh] because (um)
like i'm the eldest [kan]
then i got one younger sister and one younger brother
but then my parents dia orang macam nak my sis my younger sister to marry first
ya
tak [ah] i think my relationship longer but my relationship (uh) i'm also attached to a non-muslim
so
ya it makes things more complicated [ah] i guess then my sister she macam
she attached dengan muslim guy so that's already one
barrier crossed and then
(um) she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which i also agree [lah]
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood [ah]
ya but she got the cert [lah] ya
no [lah] she working in those like f&b jobs [lah]
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is i don't know [eh]
macam sekarang right i was thinking like is it
better in the long run if you marry now or bet~ better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
marriage is just like macam
law legally binding law law [what] you know
ya i get what you mean
ya
[eh] but then you know what so scary [leh] like macam
(um) recently [kan] i baca kat
facebook [ah] now now got a lot of free time [what] so more time to browse facebook gitu semua
[ah] then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then i'm just like
!wah! then [ah] so if cause to me right macam kalau kita relationship then they cheat right at least we can break off
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
need lawyer need to sign things all macam (ugh) malas [ah]
(mm)
is it
tak tahu
i thought we only need to go to the course like some
(um) relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can (um)
get (uh) engaged and married [what]
[oh] okay that one also i don't know but normally [lah] normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya (mm)
i mean that's
(uh) that's from my experience [lah] i don't know whether
not like i got married before [lah] but you know like
because i got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so i was also like
ya [oh] this is how it's supposed to be [ah] i don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have i talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
(err) (uh) (um) almost three years already
to be honest i want to get married already you know because i feel like i'm also getting old
then i think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because (uh) first of all i see many people doing it and i'm so jealous [what]
apa
sorry what
(uh) tak i think they give up on me already
that's why like recently i you know rajin-rajin in the kitchen then dia orang macam
[oh] (um) #izzati# finally can get married gitu you know but then i'm just like
whatever [lah] you know ya ya so
ya because like right now i feel like i'm not doing much kalau tahu i just
have a baby now you know i think it'll be quite fun [lah] because i don't have to work and then
i mean i'm not sure if it's will be gonna be fun [lah] but you know at least like now i know that i'm not busy working because i don't think i want to be a working mum when i'm like heavily pregnant gitu you know
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity [lah] i feel
why
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] my god
[ah]
but (uh) i think it's okay [ah] cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
apa ni
like
i i'm quite glad that when i was twenty five i
like #chiongster# also [lah] kerja banyak and things like that then my parents also not happy [ah] because like
supposedly twenty five kita kena dah married already you know but then i was still like working my ass off [lah]
[oh] okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so i was still working like crazy [lah] then but i'm glad because i worked
like crazy last time
so now in covid i'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know [oh] i'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because i have savings because last time i work like crazy so i'm quite
okay [lah] like i can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
(um) i think it's good that you are actually working not now so
i think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy [lah] you
so os~ then how !huh!
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because i have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually i i said i hate my family [kan] but then actually i'm quite okay with them
but the thing is i can't wait to move out also
so
(mm) (mm) betul [lah] then what !huh!
girl [ah] ya ya ya my mum ya [lor] that one also is like
i ya i just
i want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because i mean
kita pun ada cakap [ah] like discuss are you okay with living with my in-laws for a while
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then i don't know man
(mm)
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but i'm not sure how the family would feel about that [lah]
but so far i've been going over they quite okay [leh] it's more like okay it's actually (um) my family is more colder to him i think because he's a non-muslim
so i can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how [lah] but i'm i'm still hoping like what you said [lah] we both like have our own place already
and then like okay [lah] maybe like i don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period [lah]
but then i don't want to live there for very long and especially if i'm pregnant right i don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
i just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should b_t_o already
ya because my friend like
they b_t_o like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house [lah]
and the in-laws house
then she say it's like hell [lah] because the mother in-law macam
like have a lot of expectations of her gitu
ya
(mm)
but sometimes kecoh is fun you know
or you mean the other kind of kecoh
ya ya
because like
i feel
[oh] okay ya i understand
ya
that's interesting
no i was gonna say (um) last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so i think if i can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya i'm i'm i'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
i know that's why but i've talked to her before then she cakap dia tak nak [ah] she nak cari rumah sendiri juga
so but then she say [lah] like in now these days a bit difficult [lah] but then
her ideal goal is still to move out [lah] ya
but then (ugh)
like
why you don't like the the the partner [ah]
(mm)
ya the okay
[eh]
ask her to get out [ah] really ya ya ya okay [dah]
(ugh)
ya ya ya
[oh] my gosh that's interesting [eh]
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
(mm) okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in #jurong# no offence
i don't know what's with it with you guys ya
like you know hari raya you pergi like rumah kat #jurong# then mesti ada kucing punya i don't know [ah] i don't know how to say ya
ya
i never say [ah] bukan aku cakap [eh]
i don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
i always thought #jurong# was cool like the west side you know like [oh] cool the west side but then
i know north is crazy because of #yishun#
so that's all i know but then now you say like that then i a bit like okay #jurong# a bit dodgy
[a'ah]
but it's okay i will still think of nicely of #jurong#
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
[oh] pergi #pasir-ris# then i [oh] pergi #changi# okay then pergi #jurong# [ah] i
!wah! that sound so far away i don't know why
ya
(mmhmm)
yes it's true
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya that's right
(mm)
(hmm) do you like that or not
okay
(mm)
[oh]
those are touch and run away kind ya
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
seram [seh]
the what you do
apa
what the
[ah] ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
apa
watch group !wah! your parents also very ons [eh]
[ah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm) interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
[oh] but recently my sister kena then i was like what the hell
ya but i don't think i can be like you [lah]
like the last three times (uh) people someone follow me home i just confront them i don't care
you are not wrong i'm also very small but i think i'm just
(uh)
more like like i think too well of myself
a bit overconfident [lah] dia orang kata
ya
so so it's like i'm like !oi! (uh) why you follow me like you know padahal i'm just a
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then i don't care like you come you want to fight with me [ah] want like ya
ya it's damn irritating i cannot stand it [ah] like what you say [ah]
sometimes dia orang will follow from a distance which i can still like macam
buat bodoh [lah] you know then
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
there was one guy who even like macam
naik m_r_t [kan] then you know usually you go whenever whichever door is nearest to you and that is
empty [kan]
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then aft~
[ah] ya then after that then i like walk over to the next door [ah]
and actually because i want to lean [ah] because i malas
ya then i then i walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then i'm like what the fuck ya !oops! i cursed
ya [lah] ya [lah] so i'm just like [oh] i don't know if i can
stand it like you but then
recently [kan] i feel like macam i want to move to the west side because
most of the not most of the jobs that i want [lah] but then
like
i kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no [ah] #ang-mo-kio# also got industrial park [lah] but that one is different industry
but ya
ya so it's like macam i feel like if i live nearer to the west it will be easier for me to get a job there
i mean not easier [lah] it will be
life you know like sometimes the the kerja is like so far away from your rumah then it's like (ugh) malas ya
so ya [lah] ya [lah] macam i think if i'm nearer to the west i probably won't (uh) what
(mm) ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
(um) ya
would you rather town or #tanjong-pagar#
it's a bit far for me
(uh huh)
ya
i cannot [lah] i i just for me i feel i get
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
ya but i think like what you say right i think it's a bit too quiet for me also
(ugh)
ya [lah] cause in #ang-mo-kio# like macam nobody ever sleeps
so it's damn irritating
then sometimes like three a_m [kan] ada orang cakap-cakap kat telefon then dia orang ketawa like laugh their heart out then i feel like so irritated you know
then i'm just like maybe i should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
[ah] i don't know man
i guess everywhere got pros and cons [lah] pros and cons
(mm)
ya
i don't know [ah] i think i just
i don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan [kan] like
i wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before covid [lah] so i plan like
this year i want to try moving out of my parent's house so i just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that [lah] like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that i was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my covid like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
(mmhmm)
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
(mm)
obviously ya
interesting
ya [lah] ya [lah] such is life
apa
my plan
[a'ah]
but i think he don't want [lah]
because he also still studying then he want to like (uh) like what you say [lah] macam nak habiskan sekolah dulu
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so i'm not sure if i'm willing to wait that long [eh] like
i would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
sebab dia nak jadi teacher so now he studying the subject
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said [lah] he still need a teaching degree
because he wants to work at m_o_e punya kind of school
then i'm just like !wah! that's very long [eh] that's like almost like eight years that i have to wait and i don't know if i want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
ya and then that when during within that eight years right he still haven't kerja you know so i have i probably still have to wait another few years for him to be able to afford a house
so i'm not sure if i want to
do that [lah]
[a'ah]
i know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak i mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so i don't know about that [lah]
but
hopefully he will change his ways i don't know because he got
say before that he is macam
like when he got school [kan] dia nak
study [jer] but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job [ah] so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
(uh) but then that semester break it i think is is macam charity
that's why just like normal expenditure [kan] it's not like saving for a house gitu you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me [lah] sometimes i wish i just have a nice (uh) rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
(uh) you [lah]
[ah] chin~ cina [lah]
(uh) #qian-jin# is a
actually i don't
i don't know [ah] like when back then like cause i was your age not so long ago (um)
i was workaholic also [lah] then macam
not really keen on getting married or getting attached even
you know so i'm just like
whatever [lah] actually i was kind of those kind like [oh] i i independent woman i tak nak kahwin tak nak
ada children all then in the end
i met him then i was like actually we can click [ah] then like so we fall
like in love so like not i'm in a relationship
so i don't know what to do with that dream
(mm)
what
online [lah]
[a'ah]
saje [jer] like you know like
like
try try cause nowadays got macam banyak apps gitu [lah] you know and websites also
so just make friends [ah] because i feel like macam
my age [kan] like orang semua dah kahwin then dia orang macam tak nak hang out so much
so i was like trying to like meet new people like of same interests as me you know
then
no no twenty five was when i don't want to get married
so in that course then i'm just like ya but then now it's like
i suddenly meet him then suddenly like [eh] macam [eh] actually like if we get married and have a life together macam fun gitu juga [eh] ya so
you have to think about the past and everything
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
!whoa!

[eh] we should add each other up on like game platforms [sia]

(hmm)
(hmm)
you know #hanis# never text me this week
ya i purposely never text her you know she also never text me [eh]
i'm not
what move
ya i think like if if she's going to text me then i'm going to
i'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want [lah]
too lazy to talk to her
!hais!
i i'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how #rina# always use people to
i mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but i heard from #sonya# that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
i tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway i'm going to tell you something you know #hanisah#
was the first one to be senior teacher in that school right because she wa~ she stayed that she she she's most loyal one [lah] down there right and then after that #rina# (uh) (uh) recently only (um) enroll her into educare you know you know what's educare is like the leadership program that if senior teachers i mean if you want to be a senior teacher in that school then nak kena go and study
they have leadership this leadership program [lah] basically but like
(um) #sofia# and #rina# said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then i asked #hanisah# how long are you bonded with the school [lah] and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so i ask her [ah] because they are because only because they are paying for it so i ask her [lah] the first thing i ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
b~ if it's only four thousand dollar the i also can pay i can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in m_u you know seven years more in m_u and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
i am not sure then i think she have to pay back and all that that kind of thing [lah] but you think #hanisah# is the kind to break bond that kind of you know she's not [lah] but it's not worth it i think it's very bodoh
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only [ah] ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand [ah] like twenty two thousand i can understand [lah] but this is only four thousand i thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars i also two months of my salary i can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then i ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already [lah] anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after i question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
i mean it's true [what] like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she i i argued with her [lah] i said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk i mean the contract you can discuss again with #sufian# and #rina# [what] like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what i mean
i mean even like my sunflower right the cent~ like i got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare [lah] she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense [what]
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand [eh]
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what i'm saying
ya so i've been i don't know [lah]
i don't know at first she didn't tell me [lah] today after that then i ask i ask her again that i was having lunch with her then i ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand i literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself i don't know [lah] is it
me or is it she and then i i argue with her over it you know like i tell her don't be stupid you know that kind of thing that four thousand you yourself keep saying you want to leave the school blah blah blah and then after that you go and sign this kind of thing for seven years some more i tell her you know then by the time you leave leave you are like thirty over and then tak payh tak payah nak leave then you go to another school you have to restart again like until when you want to be like who you know sixty year old then you earn another thing again no [what]
ya and then i then she say she will talk about it after she say [ah] who knows #rina# she say this you know who knows #rina# have something planned for me like dude
even if #rina# has something planned for you #rina# is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what i mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different [eh] in m_u and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss #saba#
she's been in that school for fifteen years and now then she got to be a senior teacher you know itu pun so unhappy with her you know lately she is undergoing depression or something
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one i told you about
by the way i have a c_c_t_v footage of him rolling one of my end one child like a bread macam roti
[a'ah] during that time you will see in the c_c_t_v you know like during that time he he he he pull the the girl the girl the girl also nakal [ah] but the girl quite angel [ah] tapi macam devil [lah] [kan] but she he pull the girl and then he literally did all this then he she it was horrible [lah]
and they never say anything all
i mean ya inform the parents [ah] but we don't want to show the c_c_t_v footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the c_c_t_v [lah] what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really i should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone i have it my phone because i saw the incident happened and then i told jay directly i say you go and check the c_c_t_v you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know i told her then she really go and see [lah] and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like [lah] and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if i go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that c_c_t_v footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
i mean i mean i like to say
bad stuff
i don't know [ah]
and okay okay ya

k (err) abeh lepas tu aku we attend (err) we attend the ten thirty class and then
we realise (err) like my friend pergi tanya the instructor [lah] then instructor said
the next lesson only got five people so we can join
so we joined the eleven thirty class also so
sekarang ni
semua aku punya badan tengah ya back to back it's really very tiring
aku pun tak tahu it's more of like
(err)
[eh] you know because it depends on days some days is different but (err) you (err) okay wait ya they let me
put it in words ya sebab
aku punya word
(err) cause it's recorded
i don't know whether if this will effect f forty five in anyway but
disclaimer it's just to okay i think maybe i should but it's just like you do work out then you rest then you do workout rest workout rest macam i think it's more it's like
#tabata# but not #tabata#
but there's a lot of variation in different different
[eh] macam like there's everyday there's a lot of different variation because everyday they focus on different things
ya
ya and then different station got different exercises so you'll never do the same exercise everyday
so like yesterday i went to station four i did like a certain workout and then i went to station seven at the second lesson and then i did another set of workout which is totally different and then
ya that's why i i like really enjoy because like somemore with the environment everybody macam just doing their own apa ni doing their own workout ya and then the instructor
(err) just walk around and then dia kata
come on guys let's do it gitu aku macam tak it's it's more of like an australian accent
the pay ya
no she's not she's not she's not
ya
no [lah] but i think it's part of
i don't know but but at at least quite nice but when when when i was doing it [kan] the like dia cakap come on guys let's do it or something macam like along the lines and then she's like hydrate yourself and then aku macam
okay i i'm gonna keep pushing
and then i somehow just maybe it's just in my mind [lah] macam it's a motivation
motivasi
motivasi (err) no [lah] kau tahu yang kawan aku korean tu
korean korean ya [kan] aku post gambar [ah] yang aku post gambar aku belajar a_c_j_c a_c a_c a_c_s not a_c_j_c sorry

but [ah] ya
apa
no [lah] he just he just want to go there for fun because also trial lesson is forty nine dollars [kan] so they can do for two weeks [ah] it's just macam trial so to see whether this place suits you kalau tak you have to subscribe for like one month ke per class per class for #novena# is
twenty five dollars
(err) per month which is like unlimited bookings is two hundred sixty
ya so for them for people to try out ya for people to try that why
he let like the forty nine dollars [lah] so but forty nine dollars you can use (err) train in different different places
macam mana kau [eh]
ya there is there's a lot of outlets kau tinggal kat mana

bodoh apa
i hope it's accepted to actually talk like this but i think so [eh] because it's they say is to con~ con~ to talk normally
and then you can just switch between melayu and english
berbicara
bertukar
benda
[oh] is it yang aku supposed to join tapi
and then who book pergi dengan siapa who
#mahadhir#
[oh] #ikmal#
tiga orang [oh] tiga boleh pula
!wow!
[ah] just saying it's recorded again
okay (um)
(um) [eh] but actually you know i was thinking [kan] actually
wait sorry i had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line [kan]
like you know you want to make a movie ke nak make a television show
[kan] you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
i don't know whether they're doing it for i don't know whether they are doing it for your mon~ for your monday's one [lah] tapi macam
it's quite cool mean meaning like macam kau imagine like currently you are just having normal conversation with a random stranger then kadang-kadang [kan] you just like
menyeleweng it's not is it menyeleweng no menyeleweng is like out of topic [ah] you out of topic and then some times out of topic they can use that ideas to
(err)
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if [lah] i don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting [lah]
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
or macam berbual merepek
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
macam ni [lah] macam apa aku tengah berbual mana tahu this the idea of me thinking of this idea can be used as an idea for the show
ya
ya okay
merepek mungkin merepek satu jam dorang dengar [eh] apa ni tak ada idea langsung tu pasal tu pasal dia kata seventy to ninety [kan] dia kasi seventy [jer] kalau bagus gitu ni idea ninety
(hmm)
(mm)
c_p_f c_p_f
seventy dol~ sana satu orang ke bukan [kan]
[ah] yes a bit tak tahu [ah] yang monday
satu orang seventy [oh] surveyor survey
[ah]
[ah]
okay
entah [lah] apa
tak faham [lah] tapi okay [lah] boleh [lah]
(mm) ya [ah]
[ah] okay i
(err)
saying it to the people listening to this (err) we are currently students and if you have any (err)
part
survey offers or any voice recording or any [oh] if you are thinking of doing a podcast [eh] you can actually ambil kesempatan [eh]
[ah]
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
how from talking about how's our day to (err) sekarang we asking for job okay [lah] sorry i was cutting you short
i was cutting you so
[oh] twenty seven more minutes
[eh] that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
i think that's the main one of the few takeaways that i have
and currently all my knowledge from j_c [eh]
just gone
ya [eh] actually ya i forgot everything you know you know sekara~ yang the last time kita buat
statistics [eh]
[eh] aku bagus gila [sia] i think like i can !chey!
[ah] p p_n_c abeh lepas tu ada
apa dat~ data
normal distribution and then upper distribution i think last time i was quite good at it
(mm) i was quite good at it tapi
[eh] pure maths aku pun okay tapi tak tahu kenapa dapat b [oh] i miss out one question
i told cause i
(err) maybe bell curve also [lah]
cause i told my teacher [eh] i i skipped one question i don't know how to do dia kata [oh] once you skip one question you confirm can not get a
agaknya gitu [ah] agaknya dorang mark [eh] !oi!
!alamak! all correct but one question wrong sekali dua question gitu [eh] dua question
two mark question is wrong and then they sorry [ah] b but babi
no [lah] but actually is is is helpful for those that
(err) don't do well [eh] wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
like im~ macam how do i say [ah]
actually it doesn't help [hor]
you just fail
[oh] ya actually he's true [ah]
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
macam normally you are just a fifty fifty fifty out of hundred student
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but i'm trying to see i'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this [eh]
matlamat matlamat
maklumat information [ah]
no nobody can see your forehead
okay [ah] just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
(um)
maybe five metres

our p_d_p_a shit [oh] !oops! sorry for saying the s word tak tahu [ah] p_d_p_a ke tak [eh] i took my driving kat
that place let's call it (um)
[eh] i took my (err) i would say i took as school students so not private [lah]
so i i went through their instructors and everything i would say
(err)
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which i think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
i don't think it's random grouping because from what i heard (err) they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
just so that my group is with all the pakcik pakcik [ah] i cannot take it like okay there's a few yang like macam muda muda
but i would say the no [lah] not my age [lah]
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can i can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time i was like trying to save money so i just pick
(err) apa ni
i just pick the cheapest lesson [lah] so i cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that i get the group the person i always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when i drive and
dia kata
(mm) you think you are correct or not
you think
(err) you think you correct (err) you should should drive faster you should gini gitu gitu gitu tapi aku macam dude i'm just learning and then if you're not gonna teach me or tell me why i am wrong
then i don't know i don't see the point you know
nak
ya some more i i was so pissed [lah] but then
i think at that point i was just still
entah [lah] i don't i don't argue over !aiya! just sabar patience patience
yes
tapi okay [lah] overall but overall i would say (err) cause i the last (err) i took my like (err) test like four times
so the first two times
(err) first two times i was bad in the circuit then i failed the third time i went out tapi
(err) it was last year twenty fourth december (err) because i remember so twenty fourth december i took
(err) my test and then
(err) it was i think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
(err)
but because i didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
can i got eighteen points but then because of that one immediate failure i fail the whole test so i merajuk sikit [ah] sampai
recently then october then i took my test
and then i heard #sharul# ya and then i heard #sharul# ya this year then i heard #sharul# pass then i was so scared i couldn't sleep that night
but i was happy
then #sharul# [ah] #sharul# took two weeks before me then i met up with him for dinner he said [oh] he pass already then gini gini gini then i'm like !wah! so good [ah]
then like i don't know i think it's a bit of pressure and then somemore i i really wanted to drive beccause i
like it's already my fourth time [kan] aku macam like [oh] penat nya
and then i was
(err) dia sekolah [eh] private private
ya then some more
(err) during my
so my test was (err) example it's on monday right then on the saturday i book with this (err) i book the practice session then i was so stress that i feel like i didn't attend the lesson
sebab aku macam takut gila but then monday i just went to the place and then i
i passed it i passed it was surprise so thankful
ya he he did he stud~
he study before he failed then he
he took a break for a few years then he come back no i i didn't compare [lah] it just that
because i'm like [eh] !wah! he got it [eh] i also macam i want to [lah] because i really want to drive
ya but then now now that i already have license and
now that are [ah] [ah] i rented car a few times already
macam okay [lah] quite fun [lah] driving tapi
like
[ah] this recent one i rented for like three days
the first (err) [ah] no [lah] (err) wednesday to today this morning i send back
so the first first first day second day was okay very fun to drive here and there tapi
after that penat gila
like really malas i'm like (err) i really don't want to drive anymore
is i
i think you will need to feel it i don't know
i i enjoy driving by then i don't enjoy macam
running errands running errands
ya it's like okay like i don't mind macam
drive here drive there if i'm free tapi macam like if i have to
slot in between like errands in in between my free time it's not fun
like because this main the main reason for this was to run a couple of errands [lah]
ya and then during my free time i will just drive hantar barang gitu ya
but run~ running errands is very tiring

testing testing one two three [eh] [eh] okay okay [dah] [dah] [dah]
ya ya can can
to cope with the lesson
no i was just thinking okay because my main rationale [kan] was i i mean i could have sign a bond with like hospital tapi my main rationale behind not signing a bond because i don't wanna decide on myself too ear~ too early because i'm still year one
and then i rather use this time as an experience you know
like compare to my friends that actually sign a bond like you know
this maybe this one year that they they're actually getting allowance and everything
while they are actually getting allowance and not be able to work outside i'm currently working outside gaining that experience so it's like a headstart as compared to them
then somemore i'm like taking like
apa
i mean hospital hospital [lah] but then different hospital is different ways of like
apa ni work style environment right so i am trying to trying to like keep my options open for now first [lah]
tak nak like suddenly tiba-tiba
[oh]
macam sign to a place [ah] then menyesal
regret
ya i don't want to regret
sign on tak nak [ah]
sign on kena [eh] no [eh] [ah] i think sign on i will be a nursing officer

so [oh] [ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] but lepas tu ya maybe after kita dah makan duduk sana and then we can go over to #changi# airport can cycle look at what touristic mile thingy will be quite cool quite cool ya
then apa tu siapa lagi [ah] might follow [ah]
siapa tu
[oh] ya adam i think most likely [ah]
he will be coming
ya ya most likely now he's taking a rest to to power charge himself for later
ya
no he had nothing i pun tak tahu [lah] why he so tired
ya
ya so
[ah] ya [lah] i mean kalau kita tak jadi pergi malam ni then maybe we can think about like going maybe like the #seletar# cafe or something
[oh] [oh]
[oh] ya actually [kan] kalau kita car lite to there will it be expensive or cheap [ah]
[oh] ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive [lah]
[oh] ya true true sinopec ya very cheap but one thing [ah] i pump minyak by sinopec minyak ni macam
cepat habis [ah] minyaknya like tak concentrated you know so i'm like what's happening here [ah]
thailand
[a'ah] [lah] agaknya [ah] letak air
(um) ya so
[ah] yang your your buku you borrow you start reading already or not
i see i see
[ah] ya
[ah]
i think ada punya cari eatigo [eh] let me tengok eatigo pun okay juga [eh] kita boleh rasa makanan dia like like
harga dia pun (err) [ah] berpatutan betul betul
(um) okay by the way i baru check eatigo [ah] hari ini memang ada lima puluh percent so (err) selain dining in the garden ada apa lagi [eh]
kalau nak makan makan
tak i will i will think #changi# village will be a good idea [lah] tapi adam tak nak pergi [ah] #adam# ya
nanti i kena pujuk [lah] i punya adik untuk nak pergi kedai #changi# village cause i pun macam nak rasa makan barbecue barbecue but somehow i pergi sana akan makan cheese tofu sahaja so
ya
betul tu betul tu
[eh] lapar [ah]
ya kejap i tanya adam adam you nak pergi ke tak
adam dia cakap dia tak nak
adam needs more convincing to do [lah]
ya
(err) anyway
i pun tak tahu [ah] adam cakap dia nak #jinjja#
dekat mana [eh] dekat
[ah] jewel boleh juga kat jewel
dia boleh tengok tengok aeroplane juga dekat jewel
i rasa tak
k
(hmm)
[a'ah] [eh] dekat a_m_k hub ada [kan]
[oh] betul tu
[oh] ya [hor] [eh] but then now that you say but then i i i just remember right that i saw one telegram that it says (err) (um)
have you heard of [ah] what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like how to say [ah] it's like macam #jinjja# chicken [oh] [oh] no no it's like (uh) wing stop wing zone that one
it's like chicken chicken and all
okay [lah] ya i mean actually it's it's like the chicken chicken thingy macam chicken wings so now they're having a promo they just open in a_m_k hub twelve chicken pieces from twelve dollars cheap [sia]
so one is for one dollar
it's i would say the a normal chicken is like macam you go to #jinjja# chicken then you order the chicken wings right that's spicy or [ah] it's that one [lah] macam gitu but this is twelve for twelve dollars
ya it it's very cheap then their flavours also it's like macam got the korean chicken flavours it's like the wing zone [lah] got a lot of different flavour [ah] like all those the chicken chicken flavour so
we never go at there maybe we can go there [lor] check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces !wah! #shiok# [sia]
actually we can two person share one [what] one person six piece six dollars okay [sia] right
ya so
maybe that that's an option but i will still rather #sedap# mania [ah] #sedap# mania you when you went that time they charge in terms of the plate pricing right kalau colour hijau then this price kalau
kuning the other price right colour hijau do you remember because colour hijau is the cheapest [mah] right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
[oh] sounds yummy ya okay apa
[ah] it will be nice right i went to the website just now then i saw they got a #satay# soup base #laksa# soup base i'm like !wah! confirm sedap [ah] macam gitu
baik #satay# sauce soup base ya ya i think it's a new flavour maybe
#satay# sauce soup base i was like !wah! that's kind of cool then maybe we can
tapi i tengah diet
tapi takpe [lah] hari ini dimaafkan [lah]
cheat day yes betul tu cheat day
macam mana i tak tahu kejap i tanya adik i adam
adik i mata tutup [ah] tiba-tiba
apa b b nine
(err) bukan bukan bukan
ya bukan
so okay kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni [eh] mari kita
[ah] nak cakap pasal orang tak
nak cakap tentang apa
tak senonoh gitu [eh]
orang kasih assignment kita mengumpat
okay okay ya alright kita jadi serious (um) apa kita nak berbual [eh] (um)
kita boleh cakap pasal
(uh) kita punya keluarga or okay no [lah] no [lah] [ah] shares [lah] stock market [lah] [eh]
so (um) you ada any investment you you dah buat ke or anything you nak recommend
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
me ya
i i also don't know [lah] i i'm actually looking into the stock market also
but i tak tahu because sekarang nak beli tesla mahal tak mampu though
so
i think kalau i i will beli the stock (uh) for what i have now [lah] my capital yang ada i would probably invest in cheaper stocks [lah] singapore based stocks like
(uh) old #chang-kee# for example (err) murah [jer] you tahu tak old #chang-kee# dia punya share price is (err) enam puluh satu sen saje [tau] [ah] serious [a'ah] betul tu then kalau you ada macam seratus ke dua ratus dollar then you akan
hold a lot of shares [tau] so i think
berbaloi [lah] then i i i mean [ah] i was looking at their annual report then old #chang-kee# [kan]
dia orang akan open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like macam the demand for asian foods are rising tapi supply tak banyak
so i would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region [kan] then agaknya i would think [lah] it's a good good good you know investment i would say some more they are like (um) they are singapore company so i would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend [lah] so i mean that's my thing [lah] cause sekarang i don't think i i boleh mampu [lah] tesla mahal saje
ya tapi itu my thing [lah] on stocks
tapi masalahnya some some stocks dia orang tak how to say dia orang tak syariah on client [tau] so nanti dia orang tak
tak boleh [lah] kita tak boleh ambil dia punya (um) benefits [lah] from that stocks so ya i don't know [lah] i tak tahu [lah] ni semua islamic financial [ah] you tahu tak anything about it
i see i see i see actually now that you say it [lah] that time i went for this (uh) website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get syariah pampasan or not
so it's very interesting because macam they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's (uh) allowed or not haram or halal [lah] in that sense tapi the problem with that website [ah] they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you kena bayar
then i'm like !alamak! then you muslim pun nak buat duit
nak tengok stocks halal ke tak
but i would say it's good [lah] like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very macam you look at the platform very easy to understand so i'm like okay [lah] that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
ya i think bagus [lah] kita sekarang (err) i would say the muslim world is getting very progressive [lah]
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
so ya bagus bagus bagus
ya (um)
you rasa
(um)
you rasa
good tak stocks
(mm)
i see i see
ya anyway (err) betul tu ya but i heard [kan] itu kalau you nak pakai wahed invest then
ada some fees involved right like apa tu
but how much [ah] the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
(mm)
ya ya
(um) okay apa [eh] nak bilang you [oh] ya anyway i i found out there is days
new (um) way
technically grow your money but with very low return [lah] so macam kalau you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you tak nak letak it in the bank [lah]
because firstly kalau you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the hibah tak banyak
so if you it an alternative is i was just looking at this it's called the u_o_b money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new saham returns tapi tak banyak the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like (uh) macam it's like a savings account with a little bit more (uh)
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means dia orang tak invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
so
wasted [lah] i think like a lot of people macam lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are tak halal
so
ya [lah] wasted kalau dia orang tak invest in bonds then kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam [seh] if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
right [kan]
can [lah] nanti i call dia orang
ya [lah] i call [lah] i call [lah] i bilang [lah] kenapa ni right
that's true that's true
i i i think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity [lah] because like you know (um)
[eh] not not u_n sorry it's the i_m_f international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back i think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward [lah] for
for the idea of islamic finance because technically (um) you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also macam in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
that's why i think (err)
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately i feel like singapore macam not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
ya possibly because (um) even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
interest yielding accounts and maybe dia orang tak tahu [lah] it's haram because you would need to kind of know [mah] yang kita tak boleh yang interest and all bonds are tak halal i mean this is not like general knowledge so i think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya kita terus deep [eh] berbual
ya ya ya betul betul betul i was looking at (um) the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so i mean interesting [lah] because (uh) one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are (err) they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of socoe so
(um) maybe there's one thing we can consider [lah]
so ya
socoe will be a good tapi i pun macam tak faham sangat [lah] how how the socoe (um) investment works but halal [kan] dia [kan] so boleh [lah] [eh]
ya so
ya
[oh] kita punya trip [eh] [ah] i tak tahu [lah] i i punya adik kejap [eh] i call my adik hello
adik i baru kentut adik i kentut adik i lepas ni nak kena
bau dia kuat
i tak tahu dia punya ada like a mix of a and i don't know dia makan apa tapi bau dia like one kind you know toxic toxic
kentut [ah] i think maybe yes [lah] dia nak eating [lah] agak~ agaknya rasa gitu [ah]
so (um)
ya ya itu i i i tu tak okay [ha] [ha] so anyway (um)
nak pergi makan i pun lapar sekarang belum makan so i pun nak pergi makan actually [kan] is #hafizah# going or not to #sedap# mania like what what do you think the chances are
(mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lor] actually semua pun dah agree apa sunday semua okay
!aiyo! unless kita just go somewhere to like makan [lor]
then after that we just lepak then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like lepak and makan [lor]
i would think maybe #seletar# cafe will be good tapi sana makanan dia tak halal so mana kita boleh makan [oh] maybe we can eat at #seletar# airport the mister teh tarik express dia tu mahal ke
okay (um)
i tak tahu what are good things for us to makan [eh] (err)
i okay
okay [lah] nanti i berbual dengan i punya adik [lah] mana kita nak pergi

betul betul tu [eh] [oh] ya by the way just now i was looking at #sedap# mania punya website then (uh)
they have a lunch promo i think it's seven dollars or eight dollars and eighty or like macam let's say chicken set then you get your own in individual soup base then you get your own
sayur-sayuran condiments [lah] then you boleh like you know it's your own personalised then it's like eight dollar eighty cents tapi dia punya timing it's only from eleven thirty to two thirty p_m so it's like actually during the lunch hours
ya ya kita dah missed confirm [lah]
ya besok [lah] i i okay juga kalau esok besok i think besok confirm tak ramai orang [eh] kalau pergi lunch lagi confirm kosong habis
it actually it sounds like a plan you know let me see [ah] besok monday i think i got nothing on
kita terus pergi #ubin# i boleh tapi perempuan i don't think dia orang pergi sebab besok christina i think dia kena exam so i think she cannot then hafizah dia nak ke
ya worst come to worst me you adam
boleh juga kita cycle ke #ubin#
[oh] what's new [ah] like or rather what because december semua holidays we should like explore more places
#marsiling# tanya [lah]

apa lagi kita boleh berbual pasal pasal entah [lah]
[ah] macam nak baca buku berbual buku tapi
tak boleh [kan]
okay so we can review about i don't know
business ideas
biscoff itu tak boleh dah
!huh!
[ah] ya sekarang i see biscoff dekat n_t_u_c out of stock kat lazada out of stock
semalam i pergi cold storage ada stock so baru beli [lah] ya
makan [lah] sedap tu i buat cake pakai biscoff
ya
coconut oil i i tak jual i beli pasal itu for rambut bagus sama rambut i sekarang macam berang [kan] so bagus [ah] bagus moisturising
!alamak! apa jadi
ya
gini [lah] i sekarang
nak find ideas [lah] want to like the social mission
tapi i pun tak tahu so in singapore apa social mission you can solve
mana #boon-keng# is it
at this block block block sebelas [eh]
ada yang sebelah main road tu yang you pass by satu block macam horizontal
[ah] block block tu i dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak [eh] block tu ada dadah semua i heard a lot of stories you know about the block
i don't know [lah]
[oh] [oh] your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
[oh] distant [eh] jauh [lah] tu
[oh] okay okay
[oh]
nama dia q
ya so macam mana you tahu ni q tinggal kat #boon-keng#
[oh]
takde bapa
i see i see ya i mean is is it because dia tinggal kat #boon-keng# takde bapa ke tinggal #boon-keng# pasal takde bapa
i i curious [lah] macam you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
[oh]
[oh] dengan datuk dia
tiba-tiba letak datuk
contohnya apa khabar [eh] are you close with the datuk
mak dia doctor apa though
like !wah! so i mean not bad [eh] walaupun dia tinggal at risk block mak dia doctor
kencang [seh] then kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak take her out you know
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine [ah]
i i'm wondering (uh) honestly curious
[oh] interesting [eh] psychology
[ah] psychology you pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak i mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
!wah!
very good very good i mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify [kan]
bagus bagus bagus very good
i actually now you speaking of which [ah] i think i met someone like this you know tak tahu orang sama ke this one this doctor like i'm talking about
that time i i was near the #boon-keng# area then there was this doctor dan dia punya kucing
so i was like tapi dia tengah pakai white coat [lah] [eh] doctor dengan kucing
ya so may~ maybe [lah] it's the it's the same person [lah] loves animal right
[ah] [a'ah] [lah] agaknya vet i mean we don't know [lah] pasal career banyak
a lot of careers ya
but i mean okay [lah] so maknya consider good [lah] doctor
good [lah] tapi anaknya
(um) i tak tahu i heard anak dia
[ah] i don't know how i heard [lah] where i heard [lah] agaknya kat mothership anak dia macam
apa seorang [ah] sampai or rather act a bit pelik you know
so i feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
may~ maybe dia punya anak needs treatment [lah] like like do you think so
[oh] mother's gossip
[a'ah] [lah] agaknya [lah] however tak tahu
ya ya ya betul tu maybe what we can do is we can actually find this (um) q your distant relative we can ajak her [lah] go makan [oh] maybe #sedap# mania you know i heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
banyak banyak banyak banyak
duit so
lagi more reason [lah] takde [lah] takde [lah] j_k
(uh) maybe we should help [lah] we should help please tell
like include them into our conversation because i mean to think about it ya well what you say is true [lah] if someone is put in that environment they kind of macam angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you takde you know outlet boleh keluarkan the perasaan
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally [lah] [eh] macam mana her [eh] i [tau] eat him or her up like internally
so (um) it's important [lah] to seek medical treatment i say i mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized [lah] in
(mm) [ah] kenapa ni
[ah] ya ya i i i redeem it i put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday [lah]
[ah] #sentosa# is it
that's how [ah] we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
(um) #sentosa# i'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump itu i tak berani
so (um) #sentosa# maybe we can
picnic
i don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar [ah]
you know we can just hang around at #sentosa# #sentosa# i think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts [lor]
[ah] yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort #serapong# can just cycle there i don't think it's very far
it's like within the
tramp punya trail then we just macam
i'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
i would i would think these kind of place
they don't say [lah] they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
you cannot claim compensation [lah] because it's at your own risk [mah] you masuk tempat gitu so
ya but i think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and i think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
i think you know the covid and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good [lah] cause kalau kalau tak then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
[oh] ya ya how much is it [ah]
i'm not too sure i really don't
[oh] ya we can do that also (uh) i think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
(err) (um) can [lah] i mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
can also then luge macam laju [lah] a bit too fast don't you think so
ya as in [eh] as in the the timing also [lah]
i anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then i think will be best if we go
morning will be best tapi
we can go malam [lah] or we can go like in the evening macam cold [kan] begitu so macam sunset
dia tak panas sangat and ya
not pergi maghrib i mean
can also [lah] because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
(mm) okay okay then then good [lah] i would think of saturday banyak orang but it should be fine [lah] should be fine [lah]
i i sekarang tengah tengok harga per the hit rock v_r mahal juga
(err) let me see [eh] (err)
three rides one blue one orange one green thirty five dollars
i i don't quite understand
so many rides [lah] but i think it'll be different
ya ya that that's the lowest yang ada but other one is seven rides seventy five dollars and one ride is only five minutes yo
[a'ah] [lah] laju sangat [ah]
wait [ah] let me see [ah] apa lagi kita boleh buat dekat sana because it's only participating attractions so (uh)
madame tussauds
[eh] i heard dia banyak burung (uh) okay anyway i tengok hit rock v_r actually ada boleh [lah] (err)
ya green zone so green zone and orange zone one ride is ten token
blue zone one ride is fifteen token so boleh [lah] mampu kalau you nak two rides from green orange or blue zone
twenty to~ (err) twenty token
[oh] okay [oh] okay sea aquarium pun the token so boleh mampu
boleh juga then a bit boring actually boleh [lah] because ten token saje apa bukan ke tiga puluh apa
okay (um)
a_j hackett the jumping one right fifty five token
tapi i tak tahu boleh combine ke tak because it's their giant swing
bukan i think is bungee jump i don't know it's just says giant swing plus skyride plus ice cream fifty five token
tapi i takut [lah] i don't think i i can [lah]
there is (uh) another one [ah] gogreen segway the segway it's only five token for
thirty minutes one hour ten token by pedal bicycle
[eh] ni macam interesting juga [eh]
ya naik segway
ya i think it's okay ten token worth it one hour [seh] one hour we can it's a very long time [lah] not bad [seh]
let me see [eh] kayak [eh] takde [lah]
takde kayak
ya don't have their have eco adventure but i don't think there is kayak
we can take cable car if you want cable car is twenty token
mount faber and #sentosa# and it's a round trip
so you can take it from mount faber
budding air
actually we can take cable car i i pun tak pernah naik so if you want we can take the #sentosa# one just three dollars [mah]
ya ya ya so we can do that [lah] so it sounds like a plan ya i think it it or if you want #sentosa# island bus tour ten token i mean macam lame [lah]
ya [lah] we can [oh] got mega adventure park (um)
mega bounce ten ten token two mega two mega zip sixty five token kira mahal [lah] mega jump fifteen token
actually kalau nak boleh juga kita boleh ten token [lah] untuk segway
then lagi the other ten token kita naik this
ya so we ten ten so we get to take (err) two different attractions [lah] which i think a bit quite nice [eh] some more plus cable car then after that
ya [eh] what is mega bounce mega bounce
bike
!aiya! i guess not too sure but okay [lah] we can check there out we can check that out some more i mean we are not paying you know technically it's free so let's just do that
so i mean we we can see [lah] what else we want but i think to really maximise the segway is good because it's at whole one hour then i think
there will be a tour guide so then you can like literally explore a lot of places in #sentosa# just by the segway
[eh] boleh [lah] you jangan kita kita tak buat banyak banyak benda [lah]
ya so okay [lah] so nineteen nineteen so which is this sunday right this saturday right
okay [lah] adam adam pun nak [kan] pergi so i ajak my adik also everyone [lah] this saturday go ramai-ramai
then actually kalau nak kita boleh beli the twelve piece chicken ju~ just now i was telling you about the shake shack duck that one
ya so we can buy that one so at the same time we can bring over loaf of bread untuk makan sandwich ke apa
(err)
(err) let me think maybe dekat maple city [ah] dekat and it's halal so shake shack in a duck
ya betul tu (err) they have one in great world city
it is the nearest m_r_t station is #tiong-baru#
i am sure a bit out of the way [ah] (um) unless we can nak kalau nak kita boleh beli dekat #ang-mo-kio# hub [eh]

[a'ah] geram i !wah! not bad [eh] [eh] but i don't know whether the promo masih ada tak kalau
twelve dollars i'm not too sure tapi worth it [seh] twelve dollars
(uh) i'm not sure about the harga biasa but i think it will be much more than that [lah] definitely much more than that but actual price i am not too sure actually i pun tak pernah makan i just saw this on the telegram group
and i am like !wow! not bad not bad not bad interesting
[oh] eleven to fifteen december
so we got two more weeks actually so okay [lah] that's ons saturday tak boleh [lah]

ada ada ada s_g buy as you but we can s_g buy or we can take the tram there also [lah] if you want
so i can just [ah] so can ya ya so segway i think interesting [lah] cause one hour dia bawa orang kita jauh-jauh semua
(err) they say okay so segway one hour [eh] i salah kot kejap [eh]
[oh] dia bukan segway dia bipedal bicycle for one hour
kalau you nak segway fun ride for five hundred meters it's fifteen token
tersalah so [lah] so the ten token right is for a bipedal bicycle
i i i tak tahu i i would think so
ya depan belakang [kan]
ya [lah] kalau begitu kena if you want to take the segway [kan] the segway [eh] mana ada
segway is fifteen token tapi five hundred meter saja [lah] half a k_m
basic [ah] [seh]
kalau you nak kita boleh pergi ifly
tapi dia punya token hundred and ten
[eh] to~ okay token dia sixty token kalau you want one skydive

something like that [lah] [ah] if not at work i'll be at home [lah] you know the the deal right [ah]
(uh)
(err) sadly due to the circuit breaker the zi~ the zoo closed down jadi terpaksa cari tempat lain [lah] nak kerja [tau] (err)
[ah]
ya i i got said already ya
[ah] it is
compared the zoo they pay more but they shi~ and their shift is also slightly shorter [lah]
but (err) i would say the experience there is (err) pretty mundane compared to working at the zoo the zoo you meet like a lot of macam tourists
(err) you have a lot of fun [lah] especially with like your co-workers
but the the thing about challenger is different people works for different shift so
you you meet new people [lah] every time you work
so the
i feel macam the camaraderie is is very ya
at the zoo [lah]
(mm)
ya you know you know started from the bottom [lah] then now ya how are you i

ya i guess so i mean
[ah] ya hal ehwal masing-masing [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
i mean i don't really make a lot of friends in school i mean because of the university [ah] environment [lah] like you know people come from different backgrounds and we have different timetables so
we don't really get to see each other that often but i do have one or two few friends [lah] that i i'm actually looking forward to meeting
and (err) catching up [lah]

ya then lebih baik [lah] better for us [lah]
ya but macam not really official [lah] i i had to give up the role kepada yang
my best friend yang i feel that it's more suitable [lah] cause i busy [lah] with work

aside from that
she seems pretty ready i guess sebab dia macam revise [lah] at home

cause she's been applying for kerja kerja yang macam full time dekat [ah] those art companies [lah] last i heard is the teaching [lah]
she might (err) ajar budak secondary school so she went
[ah] ya the
the something about the diploma i think diploma in teaching

ya
ya
ya ya she's up sebagai our best [lah] ya the prestige programme [lah] in our school you know junior college ya
ya
(mm) she's not really interested into like the business kind [lah] i mean she can do like she encouraged the numbers she can like i think got good numbers [lah] graphs by by chart tax reform

ya
i try to
close to that [lah] similar similar stuff

ya
ya [lah] ya ya school starts when [ah] for you
[oh]
ya ya my the online semester starts first week of september we having like a welcome ceremony [lah] on the first of september itself so
it's all virtual [lah] a bit a bit boring but i mean
ya amsterdam
ya i feel super disappointed [ah] i mean kalau tak i already had plans or to travel around europe [lah]
you know to watch soccer
then you watch people play cricket
and then catch the the swiss alps but macam biasa [lah] people wouldn't think [lor]
true
ya [lah] not not my not my luck [lah]
ya
ya
it's getting worse [lah] in europe area
and ya and (err) on the bright side also nasib baik [lah] cause i save a lot of money i mean the money i can use it to beli rumah ke
kahwin ke
ya
ya (err) looking forward to it [lah] in the future
[ah] won't be anytime soon [lah] ya maybe after i get a full time job
after after graduating [lah] from the university
i almost there [lah] i feel that already ya
ya [oh] ya then [ah] how's your your dad's [ah] youtube channel ada masa upload upload videos tak
ya
ya betul
[orh]
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's (err) respectable [lah] for the craft of
ya
(mm)
ya understandable [lah]
[oh] ya ya she she's i think five months
so you expect the baby to appear at [eh] appear [eh] they expect for the baby to be born [lah] in (err) dalam late november begitu
so
ya all of us are pretty excited [lah] kita even macam dah buat a baby shower (um) [eh] not baby shower sorry gender reveal ya
so ya i i mean it's just to lighten up everyone punya spirits [lah] given ya this macam hard
time right
ya and i and my kakak #wen# is the
anak pertama [lah] to carry a child for the family
so
i think my dad and mum pretty excited [ah]
ya
[oh] true true
so ya my my mother and my (uh) brother-in-law punya mother both of them plan out [lah] the this party for us
so harap harap (err) it's going to be fun (err) it's gonna happen i think [ah] early next month also
near #sharmin's# birthday i think
ya her mother will masak makanan for us and then after that my mum will plan out dia punya games and
(err) aktiviti-aktiviti [lah] yang kita akan buat on that day itself
nah who who who i mean
(mm) government [lah] they will know that is more than the allowed number [ah] so
ya it's going to be a small one [lah] only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
the government punya pantang larang [kan] mesti ikut
kita respect respectable [lah]
[eh] jangan [lah]
malu [lah]
(um)
[ah] ya her maternity leave only starts i think in two months time
because she can still (err) go to work [lah] but her macam orang atas don't want her to come
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which i find it's pretty cool [lah] cause they really understands (uh) their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce [ah] in the future we work
[ah] [ah] ya he's doing fine [lah] (um)
because he works at the port right so he helps (err) he is a i think i think he's an engineer then dia tolong macam pasang [lah] kalau ada any macam equipment yang rosak
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time [lah] because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during (err) everyday day to day operations ya
(mm)
ya ya ya my my dad [ah] cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed [lah] beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
so recently he managed to land a proper stable full time job so i i think he macam gembira [ah] like !wow! finally he get a job [ah]
cause he's been doing delivery at the site [ah] to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
(err) [ah] school (err) apa tu yuran ya yuran sekolah unlike us [lah] for for
for me i at least i can work right then i can pay for myself so so side issue
(mm)
ya school fee is quite expensive
(mm) i think m_o_e really does a good job [lah] in ensuring that (uh) local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years (err) no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an o level [seh] ya
ya ya i did
ya four to five [ah]
(mm)
my sorry what
[oh] my girlfriend [ah] [oh] she's she's fine [lah] because [ah] she's graduating this year today is the virtual convocation actually
then ya she was telling me all about it [lah] how [ah] it's very interesting
then dia orang tayangkan the whole thing on (err) facebook live
so they will (err) how to say this they will
it would screen your names i think in terms of your school
so they will be like [oh] [ah] school of engineering dekat bawah [jer] nama-nama dia punya students ya in that slow
ya ya in that type of (uh)
effect ya format ya
[ah] facebook facebook live
then (uh) she that's for the general n_t_u cohort then after that they have their own specific schools so for her (uh) school of (uh)
mathematics
(err) they had a zoom
so in that zoom session dia orang ada buat macam lucky draw [lah] so you can win prizes ya ya you can get like airpods (err) jabra elite mostly macam those school technology gadgets [lah]
ya dia lagi sikit menang [seh] she said (err) she said (err) the one that wins ya it's usually like either dua ke atas dua ke bawah so
what they found out from her name [ah]
ya
i mean [ah] aren't we all sore losers some days [ah]
[oh] (uh) it ended like i think two hours ago and after that she went
[ah] she went out [lah] with her family cause (err)
ya convocation ya but i forgot that
i actually ordered (err) ice cream untuk dia so like
ya then kat rumah i think got no one so (uh) ya i ordered ice cream for her graduation gift ya then i'm not sure [lah] cause the number is
[ah] the number i gave to the company is her number so i mean worst come to worst they will call her [lah] but they said they don't provide any dry ice so i'm hoping that dia balik sebelum
they deliver
ya the they call delivers from twelve to seven
so mana tahu [ah] got nasib [ah] time tujuh then baru hantar
i can request [lah] i mean the idea of contactless [kan] but
(uh) i i
i think that's the only choice i have but it'll it'll be terrible [lah] because the ice cream will be left out there the door and no one is there to pick it up

[ah] the #prata# place [lah] because it's the central [lah] because all of us come from different part of the country
so
(mm)

he's been waiting for this [lah] dah lama [seh] he tunggu go their win right
ya
old fella [lah]
(mm)
i mean you know how how [ah]
ya how emotional the fan can get so i mean he put his heart and soul to this club
so he really it really bucks him [lah] when they don't don't win a match or dia orang tak tak (uh) perform as well as he nak dia orang to perform [lah]
what to do [lah]
[ah] ya he is he
i last i heard he he wants to pursue his degree also [lah] so he'll be quitting i think sometime this year
ya
ya full time studies [ah] i mean
ya
i'm not sure
what you say scheme [ah] is it but he's probably a playing on a private [lah] maybe james cook university
ya
he wanna pursue psychology or
sociology in that that sense [lah]
ya but ya
(mm) n_s days were with him were the best [lah] because like you know me right i served
my n_s as a firefighter ya and kita dulu masuk the station together together
so like both of us (um) kind of like spend our time there together [lah] from the start
cause you will from the academy also together and we went through our our final exam ya our trainings and when we were posted at the same station we were very happy [ah] kat #yishun# situ
the daerah canberra
so ya like when we were still freshies on the fire ground it was a bit scary [lah] because we don't know what to expect
meanwhile they told us in training is lain what from what you are going experience real life
ya but honestly the he is a really good good buddy [lah] to have when it comes to firefighting
ya
ya i'm i'm sure you have the same
experience when you what serving your time as the police right
what what what what you doing [ah] in police
[oh] [oh] so so you so you were like macam patrolman [lah] gitu ronda-ronda around the area
[ah]
the (err)
okay
[oh]
ya [lah]
!wah! they are not worrying [ah] like you i mean do you get calls often or macam takde masalah ke in the area
[oh] (err) i mean like since you are posted in a fo~ the area macam tak ramai orang [kan] so like aren't you like bored or something cause like do you get a lot of calls in that area
(um)
[oh]
understand [lah]
understand understand
ya i had i had a lot of fun in n_s yes
macam tak pressure [lah] orang tak i don't feel macam orang bully you or anything
ya
[ah] dia orang macam
hibur-hiburkan [lah] so like it's successorize the the news man to them especially i mean if you're in there yourself you know how the culture works so
you know that it was just the that's a wrong day [lah] wrong time
(mm)
ya true true
ya well how you spend the rest of your day man
[oh] lari-lari anak around area
[ah]
but but usually berapa jauh you run
[oh]
ya correct [lah] i mean there's quite the huge distance [lah]
macam the only only time i ran jauh gitu is back when i was in n_s serving my o_b_s [lah] they make us run around #ubin#
(mm)
ya correct [lah] true true
[ah]
that's not bad
ya
and i think that's the way [lah] macam orang tak tahu you cannot drink a lot kalau nak minum sikit [jer] kalau boleh jangan minum at all
(uh) habis
thirty minutes baru [jer] minum that that's the ideology that
i don't know [lah] but that's what i see [lah]
[ah] macam
ya
i see [ah] is is you want it you want to drink just to quest [eh] quench your thirst but not to
(mm)
ya cause i i got i make [lah] this (err) module in back when i was in my first year university
ya it's about biology larh and then [oh] ada mention yang if you drink more during your exercise you are kind of
making your performance worse than if you
control your drinking [lah]
which is true [lah] ya cause they also mentioned that actually heatstroke [eh] no sorry not heatstroke on the heatstroke i think [ah] ya heatstroke ya heatstroke it's not because you don't drink too much
it's because
you know [eh]
ya
ya it it can be that and also you didn't ni [lah] (um) [ah] wash your body
because everybody have their own limit right so kita tak boleh kita tak boleh push too much [lah] nanti orang cakap [kan]
correct [lah] correct
(mm)
ya ya true
but okay [lah] i mean now at least the general public has the idea [lah] that
(mm)
k [lah]
ya
drinking
[oh] [ah] nah man i
i kind of stopped drinking [ah] so
how about you man
ya ya that's nice that's nice
i
apple juice [eh]
but ya berapa banyak juice you suka minum in one day selalu
[oh]
okay true [lah] because like for me macam i want to avoid drinking gassy drinks [kan] macam air air air yang sweet ni semua
boleh mendatangkan kencing manis so
ya so (uh) at home pun i only got air masak
jadi most of the time the only [ah] the best alternative would definitely be juices [ah]
so
i will go for orange juices and carrot juice but my favorite juice will be the
[ah] lime juice [ah]
[oh] no i don't like to buy all these macam manufactured punya cause i feel macam dia tak mendatangkan any
(err) well
apa tu benefit [lah] so i selalu beli pergi pasar then i beli dua tiga macam buah-buahan
[ah] biji biji buah-buahan then i balik i potong i blend
then i letak air then i minum [ah]
ya my
it's right way ya my ni if you if you if you if you got the time my ni always recommend [lah] when you blend [kan] you blend dengan dia punya kulit-kulit sekali
[ah] dengan kulit-kulit dia but the biji the biji you take out
okay [lah] the kulit (err)
how to say [ah] mine gonna like (err)
if you blend enough right the the whole drink will will come in well [lah] smooth
[oh] ya ya ya apa dia apa i heard some fruits [eh] if you don't
do it properly right it might be more harmful than good [lah] jadi kena macam pandai-pandai [lah]
(mm)
ya [oh] [eh] grapefruit dengan grape is lain [eh] tak sama [eh]
grapefruit dengan grape dia orang tak sama [kan] dia orang two different fruits [ah] lain [kan]
[oh]
grapefruit [ah]

anak dia [lah]
#aliff#
aliff aliff boleh kita boleh cakap crack [lah] umi tak kisah
dia orang tak tahu okay not
okay (err) [kan] dia okay t_v terlajak laris ni dia banyak [tau] dia punya
okay dia dia punya video banyak okay tengok [eh] dia punya langganan langganan berapa okay satu point empat satu juta okay dia punya upload dah seribu lebih [ah] video dia dia dia naik [kan] okay (um) and then dia punya view dah banyak dia tiga ratus lebih pasal dato aliff ni dulu dia bila dia start tak banyak orang tengok lama-lama [kan] banyak orang tengok jadi
okay dia daripada malaysia okay (um) dia punya okay estimated dia punya anggaran dia sepuluh ribu lebih okay
ya sebulan u_s_d yes u_s_d so kalau convert sana tiga puluh ribu ya ringgit [lah] tiga puluh ribu ringgit so this is
i mean ni bukan dia punya ni salah satu stream untuk salah satu apa tu dia punya periuk nasi ni bukan dia punya main source dia ada business dia this is just untuk marketing [jer] buat this is channel is untuk marketing dia okay
umi buat ngaji [lah] i'm doing this i'm doing this for your ngaji no [lah] remember i take video for your masak that one i haven't upload yet
that one is okay kalau kalau masak boleh taruh [lah] cuma (um) tak kalau nak ramai orang tengok i don't know [lah] maybe like very slow [lah] kalau nak cepat tak boleh cepat [lah] kena macam perlahan-perlahan upload upload lama-lama they will increase dia punya views
pasal sekarang [kan] umi nak buat [kan] untuk umi ngaji that's why suruh umi buat ngaji punya you ajar tajwid like macam satu video tu dua tiga minute you berbual pasal qalqalah
qalqalah then you give like contoh ayat
okay then you okay ni #episodenya# okay ni dah okay ni lepas qalqalah you cakap maybe hukum lain [lah] i don't know hukum lain untuk tajwid okay episode ni dah berakhir kita jumpa lagi pada episode seterusnya gitu something like that (um)

ngaji okay kalau umi nak orang orang tengok umi [kan] orang kena macam cari umi punya channel pasal umi nak belajar sesuatu dulu kalau umi dah misal kata umi dah banyak buat video nanti kalau umi nak ngaji later later boleh [ah] tapi sekarang i think better you buat macam video yang
(um) boleh
boleh juga tapi ngaji (um)
kalau umi belajar tajwid is tajwid is better [lah]
lagi bagus umi boleh ajar tajwid dulu ngaji nanti [lah] nanti because ngaji you know banyak orang lain pun boleh ngaji [kan] i mean it's on they got all the #sheikh# #sheikh# all to ngaji whatever then ngaji can can but not now [lah] now we focus on your tajwid first or your iqra
ya boleh (mm) ajar tajwid then maybe umi boleh also ada lagi satu series untuk orang yang baru baru nak mengaji ajar iqra macam ajar dia apa huruf huruf hijayyiyah all that

[oh] macam they among us amazed sekarang baru ni came town of #salem# dah lama dah tu
(uh) dulu dulu kau time apa tu
secondary school tak main town kau tak main town of #salem# ke
ya aku time tu
when i was sec three
when i when i sec three ya (err) aku dengan #yu-ah-ning# #jun# semua kita main town of #salem# [sia]
like lepas sekolah kita orang terus on laptop kita orang main town of #salem# [sia] macam among us waktu tu macam it's much more
it is much more (err) not it's much more harder like much more thinking to do because it's a lot more roles like among us is
(err) you just come
[eh] macam they are like only one impostor right one role [ah] it's the impostor and crewmate two two roles [ah] basically but this town of #salem# is macam
ada cakap jailer ada cakap (um)
mayor [lah] then like also same same thing like
the the impostor so called impostor but in town of #salem# the impostor is called the mafias and the mafias (err) the mafias can only attack at night so in the morning people will boleh macam berbual
there the town will like discuss on who is the
the apa tu the impostors [lah] who were the mafias who is the werewolf everything that a lot more roles in town of #salem#
ya that's quite cool that's why but it's a it's a quite old game [ah]
it is actually kau kau fikir kau tengok kau kau tengok ramai ramai suka macam dah penat dah susah nak kena fikir banyak [kan]
but if we're in town of #salem# this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say i'm good at the game [lah] but like i understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore
ya something like that [lah] but you have to survive [ah] basically their task is to survive ya [lah] like among us
ya not one impostor like
like mafia mafias like got your three people together
did you watch this (err) youtube
!wah! banana
kau tak tengok apa apa benda [oh] okay i tell you story (um)
my my adik-adik semua dia suka tengok !wah! banana dekat youtube ni semua
then like sometimes they will play on the t_v dekat depan t_v room tu then aku pun macam tengok juga [lah] then dia orang pun main macam this something like town of #salem# but is not town of #salem# [lah]
it's called i forgot what is they called it
i don't know i don't know what they called it but they also they also play some game similar to that
you know that they didn't want to play properly they don't know know how to say how to like lie and everything
ya quite cool [lah] but macam singaporeans you know i don't really watch singaporean youtubers
siapa sneaky sushi what's that snickers [ah]
!huh! like vlogging is it

[oh] i think i know rice gum wait wait rice gum all talks about all the beef and everything
[oh]
so all he just talk about all the youtube beef and everything like that [ah]
[oh] so
but the thing is like rice gum right he was once the king of youtube you know like at a point of time in my opinion [lah] later you remember like the beef beef the beef between rice gum and
[eh] no the k_s_i and the sidemen and everything remember that !whoa!
no last time they make like a diss track and everything bro kau tak ingat ke secondary sec~ secondary tiga time sec three menengah tiga tu kita orang macam
[oh] (uh huh) salah logan paul dengan k_s_i
then macam
(uh huh) (uh huh) then they did a diss track together [what] kau tak ingat ke
ya that ya bro that is twenty seventeen bro it was trending that's why all of us were talking about it
(mm) (mm) now diss track macam yo that was like the
trend man
ya the prime of youtube !whoa! i was
so grateful that was alive for that !chey!
!whoa! boring !duh! kita orang macam buat podcast dah ni
now a good thing [what] like i think about it right it's like actually it's much more harder to do it's much more harder than a podcast and talk for like
hours and hours
no it's like got this [oh] ya true they have a ya (uh) (uh)
so if you don't really have a topic to talk about kita we just have been talking nonsense this whole time

i don't really aku tak faham sangat [lah] then i'm a kid dulu aku kecil mana faham
kau dah
have you like tried to rewatch your childhood shows like i tried to rewatch power rangers i cannot handle it cause like too cringey

you feel nostalgia [lah] but it's too cringey to watch man once in a while you can watch it [lah] but like it's too cringey
standard population what what standard
[oh] compilation
but the
[eh] i don't watch mask rider man

aku tengok aku lebih suka tengok attack on titans [lah] but
(err) if i'm not wrong suka demon slayer over it cause i don't know why but like okay [lah] i see i watch both demon slayer also not bad [lah]
actually dia also
i haven't finish watching demon slayer my girlfriend want me watch the movie so i watch the movie first then i finish the series
the movie is like continue straight from the series
not say finale [ah] but like continuation
ya
cause i think
cause the series
cause the series each episode is like twenty minutes if i'm not [eh] forty ke twenty minutes [lah]
[eh] forty minutes then
the movie is ya for one episode then the movie is tak salah twenty ke forty [lah] tapi the movie
one hour [eh] two hour gitu so macam
so technically you are watching
one episode
a two hour episode you know what i mean
ya [lah]
what do you mean doesn't feel like one hour as compared to movie
[oh] [oh] i get what you mean
ya ya ya ya ya cause
i know right technically series is like a very long movie if you think about it if compile everything together
(mm)
if you wanna watch you should watch it like it's not bad [lah] demon slayer
[eh] the movie
[oh] #ming-chen# watch [meh] anime
[oh]
christian [kan] tengok semua benda
i mean aku tak tengok tak i don't watch so much stuff i mean i can watch anything [lah] but like asalkan it's interesting

loki from another dimension
ya [lah] they were the one to killed the character technically the character is dead
in
technically
technically if you think about it right if they open a multiverse right dimension all these they won't die [lah] the characters won't die
and the thing is suddenly like the other character from the other universe can come here come back you know
ya
somehow or some way they will come back one day
(mm) (mm)
macam comic [ah]
dia orang nak ikut comic ke apa
ya ya macam because it's like a new dimension [ah] ya
(mm) (mm) (mm) exactly
that maybe that's why they want to do that's why they want to do with the movie they want to do something like the comics

[eh] kau nak beli p_s five
are you gonna buy the new p_s five
(uh) kau tak beli p_s five
[eh] kau tahu (err) apa [eh] kau tak beli p_c [ah] cause aku aku rasa macam nak beli p_c kau tak beli p_c
laptop you sure your laptop can handle all the games you want to play
bandwagon
p_s four kau main apa fifa [jer] [eh]
really [ah]
[oh] ya true true true true
like what are the games you actually play
ya what i i do that also i play a lot of games actually i play like
don't say first person shooter [lah]
[oh] so you like (mm) (mm) you you you will buy a p_c but you wouldn't buy a p_c because you want to play games is like a casual work
[ah] [ah] i see i see
so if you ever wanna
[ah] if you ever want to buy p_c buy a
like like (err) don't buy pre build like you buy the parts yourself okay i mean like
how say [eh] ya like don't buy a macam pre build [lah] don't buy macam buy buka macam harvey norman then you see the p_cs the guy selling like one point five
don't buy don't buy you should make yourself
but
but but i got but but but like
there are shops where they you need you choose the parts
then they will build it for you
then is also a better option
if you don't know how to like do everything [lah] but this kind of thing kau boleh tanya aku kau boleh tanya gary kau boleh tanya hackers semua kita orang semua tahu macam mana nak buat
tak payah nak high end [lah]
[ah]
kau pun tak main game kau main apa among us itu [jer] [ah] [jer]
aku
actually aku aku nak beli sebab aku nak main macam macam apa yang gary main [ah] dia main river six six [lah] river end [lah] tapi dia
apex legends [lah] aku nak main ni semua tapi the thing is laptop aku tak boleh handle
laptop aku tak boleh
my laptop tak boleh handle valorant this kind of game laptop tu tak boleh
[oh] valorant boleh [lah] tapi apex legend cannot handle
like thirty frames per second to maybe below that and
quality dia taik gila tak boleh i cannot hand~ i cannot handle
ya
[oh]
[oh] ya ya
exactly exactly like that the
like you cannot
like your base p_s four and your base x box one it doesn't work like it's unplayable
like
ya ya ya it's like thirty frames per second and like the quality is so bad tak boleh main gitu
ya ya
i don't watch tiktok [lah] but like i saw that on twitter a lot of people complaining
then but they say like the best is like p_s five [ah] or seems like the next gen consoles [lah] of course i'm not surprised [lah]
tech~ technically depends [lah] but i think what what i think is hardware problem because the p_s four
p_s four p_s four i [dah] lama pun ada i macam six years ago dah buat tapi like
(uh huh) like long time ago
so like like you know next gen they can handle this kind of thing
that's why
there's a p_c that's why people tell you kau beli p_c bagus because p_c benda benda kau tak payah beli sebab
it's high end already provided kau beli p_c macam
thir~ thir~ three thousand gitu [tau] mahal gila [ah]
i think p_c mahal

p_s five kau ada p_s five how much they sell seven hundred fifty if they have stock [lah] [eh] seven is it seven nine nine

okay [lah] so just teleportation (hmm) okay good
because they always say me like wolverine as much as i want like regenerative powers tapi
(err) macam
power tu redundant sikit [lah] in this (err) era we live in or reality we live in so maybe if i want a superpower
in this era it would be
(err)
i mean assuming my wishes are granted then
(err)
!wah! ya like if i really were to think about something like in depth quite hard [lah] cause i i i want like i wa~ i want mind reading even though i can read people's (err) (err)
even though i can read people no even though i can read people i mean you might not know whether it's hundred percent true maybe it's just eighty percent
correctness but you want it to be like hundred percent right so (mm) mind reading maybe maybe not
(err) printing money apparently i already say if i don't have my wish granted yup i want that (um) teleportation sounds good also
(mm) but is it for one person or two person i don't know
your teleportation can teleport you only or like like you can hold people and like boom tele

yup i mean
whatever [lah] let's say my money dry up i just print some more [lah]

[eh] come #dijah# i belanja tak apa [lah] nasi nak apa nak nasi lemak ke apa nak mcdonald [ah] apa nak sushi [ah] okay [lah] k [lah]
pilih [jer] pilih pilih [jer] [oh] nak atas [eh] atas restaurant [ah] apa apa nak [eh] boleh boleh boleh
today my treat
yup very convenient and easy
okay come next one i think i asked the second question already right superpower
so yup so that's my question so how about yours what you want to ask
no i i ask what i ask you superpower i ask (err) wish
you ask me what (err) what i do that one and
the i forgot what's the other one
i talk so much until semua dah lupa
i also i also short term memory
[ah]
what was i studying [ah] i was studying (err) radiation therapy so (err) radiation therapy tu kita treat (err) cancer patients [lah]
so ya my my batch [eh] kita cuma ada you guess how many how many people
[oh] very close very close so per year (err) radiation therapy is the smallest community in singapore ever so kita ambil dalam lima belas orang sahaja
ya it's the smallest (err) smallest more specialised (err) what you call that
(err) programme in singapore [lah] so cuma
i i don't know if i i don't know but it's very specialized all i can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it [lah] it's such a small community
(um) but the best part is ya i'm not prac~ i am not practising it [lah]
i don't want to practise it yup
i'm not practising as in you see now i'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so i mean because it's too mec~ mechanical like (um) i deal more with (uh) like all the machine machine instead of people
cause my kind of person is nak (uh) ya suka berbual dengan orang like make that connection feel like (err)
feel like i'm the i'm the cure for them
instead
in in a way boleh katakan (err) somewhat macam they they they they feel (err)
macam berharga [lah] cause (uh) i'm the one which help them instead of like this machine blah blah blah blah because if this radiation therapy just a bit you just shift shift shift the patient here there then after that
(err) terus treat kita cuma berbual sedikit [jer] setakat (uh) ya hi (err) sir ma'am how are you [oh] (err) any side effect you trying to stand are you okay [oh] ya ya how's the pain feeling okay k come sit down sit down
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
i i want ya i i want a heap if can i want to hear people's problem then macam tolong dia orang [lah]
in a in a way (err) the field [lah] i want to be is actually like (err) psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but i heard
you will have to go (err) what you call that (err) undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that [lah] and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
(uh huh) so that's what deterred me from what i wanna do [lah] unless i can print money right then i mean like
that's that's wa~ wasted on it let's just study
yup exactly money's a big freaking issue
(err) ya talking about it like very depressing already
like money [lah] like i i don't know now at this age i mean i feel like money never enough already sad~ sadly
(um) okay let me think of a question okay

yup there's a lot
joe biden
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
yup
kejap [ah] kau tahu kau punya audio recording apa ni ada there's another additional sounds
like like video station
no [eh]
[a'ah] i haven't mind so i don't know is it because of my (um)
earpiece i mean headset or
it's just between like this audio recording and then in front of me is his phone recording thing
let me adjust a little bit
ya
they they you know like like you go for surgery and then can hear all this
ya that's that's crazy
okay yup so let's just
do it ya so today i've been watching like people comments via instagram
so aku tengok [lah] ada orang orang ni like there're influencers in u_s_a itself so what happen is when aku tengok dia punya comments like those who especially supporting the the the winners
candidates there's two of them
(err) apa president the vice president
(um) i mean people have their own perspective and opinion [lah] but i think for those who support with the current winner apparently kena kena kata orang kena trashed kena slammed
aku tak sangka that actually trump the previous candidate have a lot of supporters so every comment is like [oh] my god i can't believe this your statement i'm gonna unfollow you
you know and they are very vocal they are just everywhere
but
the loyalty is not there towards the influencers already because they voice out except for those who has been voicing out at the beginning
[ah] itu kau boleh nampak different [lah] because
from that day onwards i'm sure si trump punya followers pun macam k i'm gonna unfollow you i'm not gonna support you but somehow they will reappear [lah] they just love to comments that's why i said there's a lot of them i'm like so surprised
and we just looking to apa ni (um) barang-barang yang kau boleh beli via carousell
facebook
toilet brush
toilet brushes crazy and socks with his hair
souvenir ya man i read
i didn't expect the socks like with his okay there's a design of his coat that he always used to wear i mean and then what else the tie definitely his face and that orange chair it's like three d version you can it's a pop out hair on your socks
nak beli [eh] ya that's crazy man like
that ya three fif~ three fifty i'm gonna buy the toilet brush
without orange sure ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya
three quarter pants ya ya definitely you have to wear shorts
cannot see
it's gonna be like the mock of the day like you're going to be the next celebrity everyone [eh] can i take a picture of you and your socks
[oh] my god
whenever
over his socks at the first place will sell it
ya man admits
and that's madness man
what else [ah] that's what we've been watching today browsing through all the trump's (um) collaterals made
there are merchandise ya he like making a lot of business on his presidency like !wah! didn't expect that but ya [lah] coming from a background of a businessman of course
and ya
plan b [lah] but sometime good [eh] kalau kita orang sekarang kena ber~ berwawasan sikit
[ah] macam dia [lah] dia berwawasan kita kita suka dia punya macam cara dia very determined [eh] tak malu [ah] so this kind of people actually it's good for (err) business [lah] actually he will likely be more drivel and you can really sell you know
but as a leader will be different game altogether [lah]
ya talking about that today what we did we did a lot of movie marathons
(um)
ya
which one there're like dank
[oh] the knives out and you knockout excuse me why don't we talk about the previous before you knockout
the knives out okay
yup
(mmhmm)
ya
ya if people watched [lah]
yup
one suspect it's like i only kind of suspect him towards close to the end
(err) he is giving it away already [lah]
(uh) so i think the police is so good to sum everything out and and make sense on why this happen and he siasat dia punya prime suspect
i think it's a good twist [ah] it's always like that anyway that's how movie works
ya
ya jangan tidur jangan tidur
sabar sama sama so semalam aku knockout then i just bangun balik perasan it's really really damn good movie
yup then what else we watched (um)
[ah] witchcraft
the craft
the best
ya so kalau korang ingat back in the days (err) maybe in nineties
kalau korang tengok the witchcraft or the craft there's four women
who in a college itself and no one can mess with them [lah] so siapa-siapa try to hurt them or try to be nasty with them you gonna get retribution but also there's consequences of doing whatever they're doing so
ya one spell at the time
tapi
(mmhmm)
in school ya
ya
so yang dia mati tu eventually it's there's another plot twist [lah] all together we thought that because of the spell by the craft actually it's not ya
then ya i think you guys should watch [lah] it it's
it's damn good plot twist of a witchcraft not so horror not really walaupun ada ada juga yang terperanjat
ya (err) but it's still fine you know it is very interesting
thrill [lah]
thrilled
okay
apa lagi ya
(mm)
the nun (mm) (hmm) (mm)
the nun definitely mata kau buka besar-besar [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
aku lagi cerita yang buat kau thrilled terperanjat untuk kau macam watch all the way yes of course
it is something that you will likely look forward to [lah]
ya
it's (err) very shocking
#mamma-mia#
here i go again
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) favourite movie ya !huh! it just comeback to horror
i have so many many horror movies but i don't know exactly which one what's my favourite but
[ah] ya conjuring is one definitely
apa lagi satu [eh]
there's (err) conjuring annabelle ada kena mengena [kan]
and then one [ah]
[oh] geram
tu !wah! rembat tu get so emotional rich
so unhinged is about road rage and it just like both of them having a bad day so just so happened this driver (err)
(err) he's a man another driver is a lady of a son
so this man is like actually just killed his wife with the hell out dia punya wif~ (err) wife remarried so he's not happy go and killed both of them
then got to met with this robbery [ah] incident it happened
i think in u_s is not something new [ah] because before that dia ada tunjukkan [eh] (err) lot of accidents or orang gaduh [eh] gaduh all this
the the ya
his madness is crazy [lah]
so this man doesn't let her off easily [ah] [kan] surrounded with dekat orang gaduh [kan] so the man stalking her wherever she go and do a lot more than that so there's a lot of suspense
and they just like couldn't understand it or something kadangkala macam tu tak make sense aku rasa marah sangat ni tapi memang orang macam begini like kata orang dah you are negative by itself so the banyak amarah yang belum unsolved it just like add on of the road rage thing
so he escalated the matter by killing by killing did he ki~ [ah] he killed he killed some of this lady punya
family members
some madness
who would know [seh]
ya
kau pakai earpiece
okay tak nampak [ah] sekali tak [eh]
(mm) (mm)

just pasal dia like junior
to the ni the main (err) ni [lah]
i tell ya
so kesian
ya
ya
ya
also not bad
not bad though that's not bad at all the efforts are (um) a bit sceptical about it nanti bila tunggu lama sikit
pasal [ah] kita dah benchmark [eh] kita dah tengok movie banyak sangat
so if it it has it first has to be a very good quality
second mesti ada subtitles because i tend to tak tak i kita tengok macam like where's the subtitle yo and how am i going to understand these they speaking english with slangs and very thick accent ya
ya
that that that's another thing you know sometime they just like speak very at at a low tone
!huh! what the f so
guys reduce her pebbles in any english movies or any just any other movies ya except for definitely that our own mother tongue [ah] never mind already
ya
must attract must captured our attention
ya
that will lose ya
forget it
ya
the director listen to it if you wanna make a movie attack [eh] (err) get our attention within five minutes
we give [eh] at least a leeway [ah] if we you want to look into resume only five second you know [ah] so this [one] is a movie we will give you a grace period of five minutes to capture
ya man
five minutes of the says is important so say wrong buat semua terkeliru [eh] kuat sangat [lah] kutuk trailer
few minutes [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya it takes a lot
ya so this is it
what else that we do (err) today [oh] kita ordered nasi ambeng [eh]

camera is sleeping and my husband like bedek [lah] ni bedek dia ni tak kelip mata tak buat apa-apa dia diam [jer]
ya
and it's moving definitely that's why i'm like away from me just in case
when the moment you say that what if it's gonna jump i'm like [oh] god okay i'm gonna back off girl back off now
you
damn
[oh] my god they can
[oh] damn damn
ya i think i was very young let me see primary school then we went to the zoo that was very small also so when i look at it the alligator like the biggest thing i've seen in the tank like super huge to me
i was like fuck this is like what a dinosaur alligator or what
ya and i will most like lead my way towards where they gonna feed the crocodile cause i didn't know that is like a way for the for the rangers rather than for the people
and then they have to shout like come down what you doing there come back now [oh] there's where we feeding the alligator come down [oh] no cause i was like run back down
but then aku tengok macam makin aku naik makin dia punya tank makin apa dia makin pendek
ya aku ingatlah towards sana lead to somewhere else but no i'm going actually if i didn't end it i'm gonna get myself eaten by the crocodile [oh] my god crazy you got my adventurous in another way ya

#mengheadache#
(err)
!chey!
apa maksud engkau dengan tak berapa takut dengan crocodile
(hmm)
dan kau cakap kalau dia jump macam mana [ah] jadi aku berwaspada
(err) aku
like
i would rather follow the makcik-makcik rombongan you know they just saw take pictures
we saw the makcik [eh] in the botanical garden
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
i think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in #pulau-ubin# or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
some rabak [ah] rabak gila [ah]
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
[ah] there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and i almost like strangle around cause i was still scared
i was like grabbing her neck i didn't realise that just crazy
she is gonna be conjuring two
ya that's crazy
ya
(mm)
i'm in a mess i'm in panic mode
ya so
i just
monkey mengamuk monyet mengamuk teruk bro
aku belum nampak or tahu satu but aku tahu member guna sepak slap on the face
so one day when she's going to macritchie i got slapped on my face by a monkey so ya
ya monkey monyet but tu dia same monkey business monyet
monyet ni
ada aku suka yang kecil [lah] maybe the baby one are cute and friendly and and playful
but not the older one
you have a lot of acts a lot of emotion has developed
and they're trying to steal your bottles you don't bring any food or drinks you know
#pulau-ubin#
ya
the mangrove
monkeys ya
no [eh]
(uh) [oh] no
hop on her bag
ya
ya
bottle cap
selamat monyet tu kurang bijak ke tahap that dia tak buka water bottle tu dia tengok takde air dia campak kau balik
[ah] tapi actually masa dekat bridge tu ni monyet ni dia ada agenda aku dah nampak daripada mata dia
because he's very sneaky you know i assume it's a he [lah] i don't see the bird bird or what you know
they were on the rail bridge and then the monkey look at me
like you better shut dia macam fine [lah] you better shut up when we're not going to say anything i'm going to jump on her bag i say okay alright go ahead
yes eventually they jump there's (err) grab a bottle from you lepas aku cakap i tahu kenapa but yang that (err) he very sneaky and he just noise trying to communicate to me the moment he hop on your bag but he look at me again
aku macam okay bro yo no monkey business
so i'm just going to like okay i just shut up let him do his business so the monkey go and took the bo~ bottle water away
and happily they keep proper padahal air takde air kosong
(mmhmm)
okay
alright
boleh apa
[oh]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
what the heck
okay
alright
[oh]
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
[ah] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
it's crazy
[oh] my god
tenyeh kat kau punya kepala kurang ajar ni monyet
[oh] my god
what do you do
!wah! this teacher scold
kau marah apa
atau kau just
ya [lah]
kurang ajar punya monyet [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ears
okay
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah] nak kasi kasi betul-betul [lah]
(mm) (mm)
apa tu
(uh huh) (uh huh)
to whack [ah] (uh)
!aiyo! so crazy [oh] so now kita nak kena bawa kayu [eh] to frighten them [ah]
[ah] singapore ni monkey kayu jalan #weh# tak tak aku rasa ambil kayu dia campak kepada kau balik
!oi!
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal i don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really [ah]
i went i went ostrich farm
then
[ah]
they don't really like (um) sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich k the one i went is a malaysia ostrich
[oh] ya man no kangaroo i got a close up of the baby because someone next to me managed to macam kasi makan
and the baby like bathing the babies
but i didn't get to touch just in case something else or the mother or the father don't like and then just hop on me mampus [sia] ya
so the kangaroo barely run away they don't really eat it whenever we offered there's there's the like (uh) we bought quite a bit [ah] tapi tak tak boleh banyak makan [seh] like we bought like two two or one [eh] i don't remember
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
get fed by us [ah] the the time [ah] and then ada kasi makanan dia apa so at the end kita kasi dengan
is it birds
birds and ni [kan] the ducks
they them datang [ah]
i like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
(uh huh)
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so i rather do staycation which i'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in j_b now we can't go there at all
i was
ya
for the living room gonna have [leh]
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
(mmhmm)
[oh]
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous [ah]
now cause
[oh] my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
i hope that
[oh] what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve a_m [sia]
just crucial
ya
that's definitely but my (um) in my thought is like kalau pasal kita balik j_b like
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else [ah] food (err) shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back i think i felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time i felt that fight of crime might be higher
because it was there usually it was there already but it's always nasib kalau kena tak kena but i think this is gonna go higher because they are
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
they have the
assertion
two weeks
(mm) higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two i didn't really keep track of what's happening about covid
it's getting vary and
i don't know [lah] what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was [ah]
the worst pandemic
and i can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself [lah] he got covid and then cured after few days the hell
we all know covid is not easy thing for those who kena
hospitalised
ya
[kan]
[ah]
(uh huh)
same ya
phase two
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
i think the annoying part is like okay [ah] aside from business [lah] like how the work function now is
it's a bit contradicting because it really depending on the government punya you know command
so (um)
how how do i put it this way like we know like work still goes on but on the same time macam
kau tahu benda ni dah badly affected and i think when we talk about k_p_i ke apa [kan]
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
ya tapi aku rasa
i don't see that we are macam lagi banyak lagi banyak benda kena push in so macam
okay like i know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chao~ chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know i'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment [ah] rather than other things
so ya i think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible [lah]
both
ya so i don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
atau it's like home comfort and thing since everything is going online then just do online [lah] [kan]
i mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course (err) because of your work function [ah] but other than that if there's not a need then i felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
ya there the other thing is your kerja jalan [lah] unless kau kena micromanaged by your own company [ah] so
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office [oh]
it depends on your work already [mah]
ya man yo so kita ada dalam masa berapa ni lagi tiga belas minit [eh] lima belas minit [ah]
ya
ya
(mm)
yup
ya
ya especially i think weddings [ah] weddings most affected [ah]
a batches
ya so we got our friend wed~ wedding coming up in november
(err) but eventually i think we they she have to be very selective [lah] who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person [ah] that kind of thing [ah] but also she can't be very
restrict [lah] about two who would potentially can be invited
and those are not definitely feel macam [ah] you know i mean
(um)
it's just (err) sad [lah] didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
that's not easy you know especially for a pengantin [ah]
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
where it's gonna be how it's gonna look like and you know having all the family friends is there and (err) ramai meriahkan wedding there's always the kids but now it's different it's gonna be very low-key kind of kau tahu macam kahwin senyap-senyap i felt that that's how it is [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
yup
(mmhmm)
ya
(um) (hmm)
ya must come to terms [lah]
so i think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
unless unless you no need to macam invite people dia macam immediate family kau nak totally buat kecil-kecil just make sure everything sah then done but if you still need numbers of people coming in and then
you expecting little thing you know then i think is not the time yet [lah] kalau kau betul wedding kau grand you have certain expectation altogether and better don't [lah] not the time yet
really
kalau korang just sebab ada mum is there then just go ahead [lah]
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
ya i think kalau cakap sah ni and dia pun ada the elderly [lah]
so pasal kalau keluar [kan] orang wear mask [kan] and and not everyone is like comfortable with it
the the the fact that i also like after i climb the stairs then afterwards i feel out of breath wearing the mask
ya have to
you know you're like
and then like the air at the air is like in your mouth [eh] it's not breathing out
ya
i see so so the elderly like most affected to it so they'd rather stay home and when they stay home too long also it's problem cause they don't really being active outside
mentally also so they always i think now they gone crazy with social media and facebook instagram all this or youtube
because that's their main entertainment like kalau dulu [kan] kita keluar i think they always go out go where pasar #geylang# [ah]
[ah] little india or wherever a shopping mall ke or visiting the bazaar ke [ah] membawang [kan]
it's the best thing for them [lah]
#mengopi# [lah] mengumpat [lah] whatever [lah] sekarang stuck at home what to do know besides on the phone then
social media the next thing [ah]
so i think they are becoming like the oldest millennial
o_g millennial like a little bit too late but it's getting there for for not a good reason
ya in their fifties and nineteen forty seven
i'm like fifty something ya and then now they started to like uploading things on facebook try to get to know the the the rad the world of online it's madness
[kan] but okay what do you what do you what do they normally watch
old songs
okay cerita lama okay
me watch
(uh huh)
me watch is not really friendly user i felt like you you know you must know [lah] a lot of scrolling [ah] i felt

[oh] ya
sis
sis
you know i'm the one who organise that
cause i was salty with
(err) this particular group of friends
ya ya ya
no no no
not #eliana#
it's about
no they were with another group
siapa [eh] siapa nama dia #fatin# #fatin-nadirah#
[ah] tu semua takde
tak payah
no [lah] cause sec one aku tahu
maybe cause i wasn't happy with #mumtaz# actually
then
ya [lor]
then semua orang macam tak nak join dorang punya group so thirteen me cause i was unhappy with #mumtaz# then i asked my friends cause they were closer with me actually
then i kept [eh] you all want to join me kita book kita sewa bus then macam okay okay [ah] okay [lor]
but in the end we didn't if there's about like thirty people then go

[oh] my god bloody me
[eh] what a betrayer
!wow! you went with their group now you're with me
bro

you hated the group that you join okay funny [ah]
ya i mean you keep blaming when like kita orang not everyone you know there's only like a group of people yang cari pasal dengan kau
okay honestly [kan] i don't
up till now i don't understand what's the problem you know
like okay wait firstly why do you remove her secondly why do you hate her so much i don't know
my job is to just collect money
i'm the estate manager so why
[oh]
actually understandable [ah] cause we were talking about class there [what] tak nak kawan macam
[ah] macam tersisih gitu
ya
that means their they want they don't want you to leave [lah] that's why
!aww!
i mean
you're still a baby

okay dah [eh] dah habis [eh]
last time [ah]
now you can't even expect to have that
[ah]
(uh)
(uh)
me either
either secondary or first year secondary four
or
poly year one
ya
before [eh] mine year one don't stay back i just take my o level
but kena force take everything back
it's just !ee! irritating i pass my other subjects
why
ya cause k
i don't want to take private okay aku tak nak stereotype [ah] but you look at the people who take private o level
[ha]
i i got that mindset [lah] last time
and cause you know you don't know anyone there then you want to ask the teacher also you are not familiar with
then might as well i just fully focus as a full-time student just retake
tebalkan muka [ah]
and apparently i i was the only one yang retake
the rest all go out cause previous batches right they do have seniors coming back just to take o level but then now i don't know everyone like very ego don't want to come back malu i guess so ya [lah] tapi ustazah siapa #masniah# tak salah
[ah] dia kata dengan aku apa kalau awak nak retake awak kena ambil fully dengan arab arab sekali semua aku macam [eh] serious [ah] ustazah
aku [ah] aku dah penat aku nak o level [jer] [tau]
previous seniors [ah] like they retake tapi they are exempted from
unnecessary modules [ah]
which what i thought it would be cause kakak aku macam gitu
tapi aku kena ambil everything then aku bingit [siol]
[ah] kakak aku retake
i was like really pissed off
(mm)
[oh] siap [eh]
jap [eh]
[eh] just now my mother enter my room sorry
sorry actually can hear the noise

sebab dia macam ada good and bad [tau] if like your your current self go back to the old times like ada good and bad
i feel like you will you would like argue with teachers more
that's the scary part [ah]
fifteen fourteen till sixteen
kau
you are just
you looking for a fight [ah]
remember everybody cannot move
[oh] my god don't forget her benci though
!aiya! i still cannot forget you know aku tengah copying notes down and she was talking i don't know about what (uh) shakespeare
[oh] she was talking about math
then she was also doing shakespeare okay so i was looking down writing notes then the moment i looked up [eh] where is she then she's on the floor kneeling like doing the stabbing thing i was like what what the
but
aku tak ingat [ah] but
kelakar gila [ah] sebab i my meja is the only one that is extended out so literally i'm in the middle of nowhere and like she's doing it in front of me i was like
cher~ cher~
cher~ you okay or not
(err) yes
it's [eh] please don't forget i sit beside #shafwa# okay shut up

[ah] patch back
whatever [lah]
kata-kata dia macam he was very depressed after breaking up with me like bullshit [lah]

so actually tak ramai orang tahu that i was in a relationship with him we study [ah] whenever we sit in the circle you know [ah] our our own things sit in circle then talk about then like [eh] #amin# like #shafwa# is it #amin# like #shafwa# right [eh] but i know #shafwa# like #amin# [ah] they always go out together aku dah macam
i pissed off
i cannot do anything it's my fault cause i keep it low
