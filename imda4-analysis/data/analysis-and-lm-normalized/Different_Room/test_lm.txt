okay
alright
[ah]
[oh] cause bilik spare
pasal okay
tenet
recently dia buat dia
he did this one thing [ah] dia
okay [ah] basically he borrowed money without my knowledge
okay and then afterwards yup ya tu the the other time different something that was something shadier [ah]
this is less still shady [ah]
what he did was he like borrowed money from kawan aku cakap kawan aku [lah] [ah] this one guy
i don't know who
i mean i think you can guess [lah] who what what this entity is [lah] rather than who abeh
abeh lepastu then
thing is
kawan aku texted me
[ah] my our mutual friend dia cakap
[eh] apasal ada orang text aku
ni cakap owe money pay money rumah tenet nya
lama
abeh like with pictures of his house and everything
tu aku dah macam
what
in a bit i thought he was kidding [ah] cause aku saw the pictures [eh] ni legit [sia]
so i call him [ah] called my aku called tenet aku cakap dengan tenet [eh]
kau tahu apa-apa tak pasal ni please reply [ah]
abeh dia cakap [oh] tak tak ni semua tak tahu ni dah lama dah dahlama aku hutang abeh aku tak kasi nombor #wafan# which is our friend [ah]
aku tak kasi nombor #wafan# abeh i don't know how they got #wafan# number
abeh aku macam okay [ah] initially aku percaya dia [ah] then afterwards aku talk to my friend on the phone [ah] yang kena
tu aku cakap
[eh] #afan# kau ingat tak that time there's this one time ada orang tiba-tiba call kau cakap they are from a_i_a
[ah] clarifying you abeh cakap [ah] do you know tenet
kata ya ya it's not my brother but that [one] my friend
macam okay [ah]
abeh lepastu [ah] [ah] then after we came to the conclusion that tu yang
that entity he borrowed the money from [ah] standard [lah] nak verify
whether
you just anyhow give random person's number ke tak [kan] ya
so that afterwards aku macam [oh]
damn
ya
ya
ya
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend ni that he didn't know that dia would be part of this [ah] macam
basically like he was caught in the crossfire [lah]
collateral damage i keep saying collateral damage [pe] semalam
abeh macam we were just
once in the
abeh terus when i call him about it aku cakap kau tell me honestly [ah] kau cakap kau tak kasi number then afterwards i ask him
yang that time this [one]
shady number called my friend tu betul tak
[ah]
what you claim it was ke ini
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
abeh dia cakap [ah] actually betul [lah] gitu then asal kau tipu
you tell
kau tell us [lah] when you already in this shit
kau tell us properly [ah] abeh macam terus sorry sorry kata dah clear
then i found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
aku dah macam dah !haiya!
last month last month not a lot [lah] close to one thousand
yup that's it [ah]
at least that's the only thing i know of [ah]
(uh) his credit rating is bad
[oh] tu aku tak aku tak sure [ah] but he can go there [ah]
i think he needed money a_s_a_p [ah]
ya
so ya aku abeh lepastu then yesterday [eh] this morning ke yesterday he said
[oh] that this is the case i mean i think i got enough problem to since i stayed over there
i'm going to move out and by the end of the month aku dah macam
don't do this [ah]
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
cause any harm to me or my family yet apa so i don't think it's fair
so aku cakap it's okay for you still want to stay here tapi like end of the month ke apa [ah]
you know right not the end of this month next month [lah] cause our initial agreement was six months [what]
ya by october that was the initial agreement abeh lepastu dia cakap [eh] yang dia nak extend until first december aku okay
then afterwards she said dia nak tukar until
(uh) next year
[eh] no ya five ke march i can't remember
ya aku okay [ah] cause he's been a good
friend [ah]
so far tapi then
one thing on top of another [lah] that happen to him abeh then aku keep telling him don't do this don't do this you want to do them not here
abeh well
no one listens to me [kan]
the voice of reason
ya
what macam very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term nya thinking
now i have problem
i have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem i don't care [ah] that kind of thing [ah]
ya
you know you know those kind of people apa
i have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later i have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it as it fixes my problem now
ya
snowball anjing
dia belum belum belum
dia belum move lagi dia cakap dia nak
actually by end of this month
abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah [lah]
end of next month dah okay
abeh like he thinks that
i don't know he thinks macam ye [lah] #paiseh# [ah]
but
kau
if he knew about shade kau asal buat ni semua [kan]
like i did tell
ya just say just say
ya
ya he should have been tapi
that's the thing [lah] that's as good as me using your name abeh aku tak bilang kau macam [eh] [ah] nak pinjam duit
but
you know aku secretly put you as the macam kau applicant [ah] without without your consent
tu shitty thing to do [kan]
abeh kawan aku tu gi #geylang# dengan dia cakap macam
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed [ah]
rightfully so [ah] to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
i have no idea i think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
not really doesn't have a place macam i dare not kind of thing macam kau [lah] basically
you have a place to go but you rather not [ah]
that kind of situation [ah]
ya bas~ basically [lah] same thing [ah]
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it [ah]
but
now seeing this
aku didn't really bitch at him about it [lah] aku tak macam bising ke apa [lah] aku tak
you know
like i wasn't really angry at him i i told i told him upfront aku i i said
i'm not angry at you aku more concerned rather than angry [lah] cause i was not in the receiving end of this [ah] so it's fine [lah]
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend [ah] rather than me but i'm just concerned that i don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
cause that time pun the previous issue pun he didn't tell me then i found out aku pun pissed [ah] i told you already not to do that anymore
i have
i have
c_c_a [eh]
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how i know [oh] but
you know people are driven by greed [what] some people do not know how to control their greed
macam it's addictive [what]
ya the other time his money at work got stolen i told you [what]
(um)
ya he left
(uh) some cash cause i don't know [ah] he sounds like an old man i don't trust banks i don't want to put money in bank
i have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
yes of course it got stolen abeh lepastu he was really bummed out about it
i keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
alright
aku
am thinking [lah] what to do now abeh ada other [ah] ada issues as well
no he borrowed me money abeh lepastu aku trying to recoup back the amount that he took
bab tu [lah] he's going to pay back i hope [lah] eventually
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap [ah]
okay
so
(mm)
sort of
#fahim# no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
i i i don't know [lah] whether
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us ke
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl [lah]
i mean technically there is a plague going on [ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(hmm)
okay
ya ya ya yup
i've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably [lah] [eh]
(mm)
fame
china boy
okay why
i think he still does [tau] maybe facebook or something i don't know
i think so
okay which is true i don't
[ah]
from what aku understand [ah] my wife said the same thing you get me
ya ya like it it's inside [lah] and so it's called what you said is right correct [pe]
ya
why you were there [lah] at your place then he said if it was
if i did that
#farid# cakap he would just salam me and just cam balik
i mean okay [lah] it's true [ah] macam you i get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
be a part of it [lah] cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
[ah] aku aku do feel that every time aku hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress [ah] now they divorced [kan]
aku every time
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend [ah]
aku do feel
(um)
in a moral dilemma every time
that
what i shouldn't be there okay [lah] #kim# said it perfectly [ah] cakap
you know i don't feel good that she's there
i don't want to validate this relationship tapi i don't want to say macam [eh] you cannot hang out with us [ah]
it doesn't feel right [what]
macam i want to hang out with him
but i don't want you to be there cause
i don't want
people to think that [oh] i'm approving this [ah] it feels wrong [ah]
so it puts us in a tough spot [ah]
back then [ah]
but then eventually what i did was aku just told him nope i ain't gonna participate in this anymore i'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
i am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced i will i will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical #farid# [lah]
like shadow boy shadow boy
lupa [ah] good names
i think eight years
twenty twelve i think [ah] aku don't really remember exactly
[oh]
tapi [eh] [eh] anal [lah] then okay anyways stress [ah] aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas think
okay
(mm)
nanti kalau rosak macam mana
what the
apa
cakap please boleh #astagfirullahaladzim#
okay
(hmm)
tapi kalau just the
okay let's say it was just aku #fahim# and
#loco# [ah]
lupa [ah] good names okay whatever [lah] bukannya [ah] okay anyway aku #fahim# and mistress lepak just the three of us the whole time
i wouldn't
tapi this [one] whole group
know [what]
she's gonna be there
tak usually we will know though
it came to a point where if #riz# there she's there
so we knew what to expect [ah]
i mean initially my wife was worried [lah] dia cakap
what if you get tempted to you know macam add in to the dark side aku dah macam
aku dah macam
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that i shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
(um) from what i see [eh]
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants i'm not sure about the things he needs [ah] maybe she fulfils both not sure
to be fair [kan] aku only met his now ex wife [lah] very very few times i think
less than twenty i've known her since two thousand eight i've met her less than twenty times
i okay i mean i mean let's just laid it all down here [ah] [ah] the good point i think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
i don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him [ah]
abeh kalau dia punya bad points aku rasa
she is too deep in this mentality where aku tak tahu it's just usually a i told you before we discuss about this before cakap macam
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
you know they don't have [eh] [eh] concrete plan to do whatever [lah] cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial ke emotionally or both usually both [lah]
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks [ah]
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all [lah] definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
ya ya okay it is controversial tapi
but aku i i don't know why i i see a lot of okay i'm not saying that i'm not discriminating [ah] this is based on i've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what i've personally observed
aku rasa
not saying that it's super common [lah] no [lah] just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
[ah] recklessness (um)
apa lagi
probably lack of ambition
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family punya background dia macam financial background [ah] more than anything [lah] of course [lah] that plays a huge part
[ah] ya privilege [ah] ya [lah]
tapi okay [ah] to be fair
usually
usually [lah] generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things [ah]
generally speaking [ah]
so based and on that
(um)
scenario like you always quite common [ah] for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible [lah] i'm not saying that
i'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not [lah] i don't have the proper statistic but i'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her aku rasa dia punya other other point
bad point would be
she aku tak tahu [eh] #fahim# [ah] probably it is [ah] maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is macam he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not macam many many many times
ya ya aku agree [lah] i mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
or fittest [lah] even
not not even the fittest man alive [ah]
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
[oh] did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already [lah]
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist [ah]
aku macam how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
tak tahu [ah]
it's nonsense
ya
no some apa no no surprise [lah] where you came from like which country you came from
[sial] [lah] brunei
aku rasa that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
ya
(mm)
[oh] is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
ya ya ya
aku believe [kan] the country could do much better if the royal family
okay let's just call them government [eh]
if the government invest in their infrastru~ infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism [ah]
for investment
attack tourism [ah]
yup that that's the thing
invest in infrastructure in country lagi sikit cakap company
country
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come abeh lepastu boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on [ah]
but they don't so aku found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia [lah] but still quite bad [lah]
if you look at the [ah] if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
i mean there's i won't say it's not free [lah] it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or p_r i think
[ah] then uni isn't free
ya it should be [lah] or very heavily subsidise [ah]
but it's not okay [ah] let's talk about
[oh] so just now you wanted
to ask about
siapa
[oh] #khai# right
ya
anything [lah]
ya
[oh]
more
when it comes to that and
other things [ah] macam #wan# [ah]
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her [lah]
so aku macam find that to be very thought superficial is one thing [lah] the other [one] is
too trivial [lah] to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen i think
lama [sia]
kau okay you you talk to the guy before [kan]
you know how we talk [kan]
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
aku tak tahu [lah] abeh [oh] anyway dia cerita cerita abeh then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
aku dah macam please [lah] get on to your next point [lah]
something like that [lah]
[oh] mistress
well he consented to it [lah] so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
[ah] aku tak tahu [eh]
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
i wouldn't know [ah]
then she slimmer
ya
tak tahu [ah]
[ah] aku find that
macam
if you want to do this
takpe why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial [lah] [eh] he said this one line [ah] aku macam palm his face [ah] he said you know initially i thought
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out #wai# was the one who needed help
aku dah macam [eh] kau don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me [lah] [sia]
aku dah macam [eh] kau please please please don't give me a
so ya
i mean that's why he deal [lah] him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
i don't know i think was just become very stagnant [lah] rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
macam there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married [lah] if you said
i advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before i met her [lah] personally
i told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see [lah] for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue ke tak if it's what you really want then go for it of course [lah] no one listens to my advice [pe] aku [kan] just an n_p_c apa
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
which which she should have done from the start [ah] aku tak tahu kenapa she still engaged p_i to follow him around
aku just find that very creepy
korang dah
takde anything anymore together asal kau do this also i don't know
ya probably yup
[oh] six
fourteen
ya
i never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
i don't know i mean i really thought he's changed cause of
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying [oh] my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter i don't really have to do much macam you know i mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her [lah]
fifty percent is fine [what] it's both of your kid anyway
macam aku don't agree with the mentality [ah] ada orang cakap [oh] tak [lah] ni semua kerja perempuan macam [eh]
[ah] ni ni untuk kau
salah tu semua salah ni
ya
abeh
tak you know some people would step up [ah] dorang macam believe that they are better at it
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause i suck at it [lah]
yes i do only aku only one t-shirt aku don't iron
the rest i have to iron
it's good to have one kau at least buy a steamer [ah]
masai [sia] tak iron
yes exactly
[oh] okay [ah]
(um) so aku
think that
i don't know
i think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
you know lose not losing weight apa
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
#safwan# told the story
or have you left i can't remember
he said that
he said he was at her play [ah] their place [ah] her place there there so long if he was their place he and #din# this mat salleh melayu aku very confused
his name is #saifuddin#
his balding tak penting [ah] but
both of them went over to #fahim# place abeh [ah] #ruqayyah# was asleep
then #zafran# i think #zafran# has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so i think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her [lah]
so i don't know
macam aku gain when i gain like what seven through sometimes i don't know how much i actually gain [lah] cause i don't really keep track
seven kilo i was so scared [sia] to the point where aku realise i must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it [lah] i'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing macam
[oh] when life is good
ya [lah] i i know [lah] but macam you can tell [what] there's a huge difference when you look at the photo macam from six days ago ke ten years ago
then macam
[eh]
i really gain like twenty kilo [sia] macam you can tell [lah] [pe] the difference
i think for me aku at most gain about
ten around ten aku actually gain more initially then i aku started losing weight
i'm on a
aku controlling my food intake these days
aku don't really care what i eat more of
the frequency of how how i eat
ya macam let's say aku the the trick is to have your breakfast as late
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult [ah]
then the second meal let's say if you eat macam merepek minang [ah] aku just had minang again yesterday best decision ever
!huh!
lepastu end up kau confirm lapar [pe]
i ate at four
[ah] minang then at night aku makan cereal
so eat something light at night ya
it's
sixty one
ya
aku started at sixty six
when we started going to the gym
[ah] still very very slightly above average very slightly
and based on b_m_i [ah]
tak not there's some most b_m_i nya chart would say aku average [ah]
healthy [ah] range
but [ah] same [lah]
a
[oh] local h_p_b nya [eh]
ya louder that [ah]
true
didn't factor that in [ah]
[sial] [lah]
yup you have a point [ah] pasal the whole ya shouldn't have
(err) should be more
i should look into the maybe h_p_b atau kalau malaysia nya pun boleh pakai [lah]
actually should use the malaysia malaysia [one]
[eh] should be more accurate for malay
aku tengok benda-benda bodoh macam dia cakap nanti [ah]

so like y~ you won't get scared but you will laugh at it
so like and then like you will try to figure out who is the culprit and everything dia macam put thinking skills in you [tau]
so like you fikir siapa agaknya culprit ini [oh] bukan ini then after that turns out it's orang ini so like that kind of thinking skills so that so that's the type i like [lah]
ya it's all ya dia orang acah-acah macam hantu
it's very funny then like i suka sangat scoody doo sampai beli dia punya (err) apa itu plush toy

but what am i saying uniqlo punya baju semua comfortable
yes i love their material
very nice
ya uniqlo punya memang really the best [ah]
i like uniqlo
the bomb yes
tapi if you want to find like macam vintage vintage and oversized shirt [kan] cotton on is still the best though
okay i tak suka oversized shirt tapi depends kalau dia punya
dia punya how to say graphic dekat depan itu cantik then i will probably buy it
ya
ya ya ya
if macam tak cantik i tak akan beli [lah]
ya
ya
tapi honestly
banyak orang suka pergi thrift shopping
(err) i think at
(err) lucky plaza banyak
ya
don't come on sundays
ya
i think
i think you pergi yang tingkat atas atas punya
(err) more variety
really
[oh]
[orh]
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
the best [ah]
i can't believe you know baju champion yang our parents wear last time
can fetch up to fifty and above sekarang
ya
okay no not bad today was good (uh) you know as usual sunday (err) pergi football [eh] hang out with the kids had lunch a little bit did a little bit of admin and now i'm back home doing this thing with you how about you okay tak
ya [lah] biar [lah] i mean like ultimately kita berbual pun dia orang tak faham context pun then [ah] so [lah] [kan] but anyway kita boleh kill two birds with one stone [lah] orang cakap [kan]
ya so for me ultimately i i don't mind [lah] apa-apa topic pun sembarang pun boleh (uh) and but since this is useful okay [lah] a little bit of update on myself [lah] (uh) i've been touching base dengan orang-orang yang you know those i can get into contact with but [ah] ultimately what is happening is
(uh) the feedback i'm getting is cannot start (err) straightaway and then ask a lot of people tak nak (err) tak nak (err) not willing to [oh] you know ret~ (err) reticent or unwilling to support right so ada chance kita tengah buat case work kecil-kecil dulu then after that (err) with whatever budget yang kita ada dulu then after that
baru kita boleh expand from there [ah] so kita in in essence kita gonna start with whatever yang kita ada sekarang
!wah! then hopefully maybe kalau boleh kalau orang nak support dia orang datang join tapi price dia kecil [ah] starting tak kita tak boleh macam price dia besar macam (mm) the other tournaments [ah] itu [lah] the masalah dia
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
i i i think okay yang yang league yang yang itu dia punya response takde orang nak main [ah] so registration dia tak successful [lah]
tak
i
ya [lah]
penat
yang yang siapa yang organise ni league pasal like ya [lah] dia memang you you gonna obviously tell yang it's a little too much terlalu panjang [lah] for for like the amount of effort you get and the the amount of money that you win [lah] so is it organised by yang the s_f_l_b tu betul tak
ya [lah] okay cuba nampak dia punya sign up punya link saja tak tahu dia punya number of peserta belum tahu [lah]
(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] dia dia okay [lah] this is a bit a bit too long for to justify whatever is going to they're going to be naik even i see okay from my point of view right i i think the one tournament thing we can just run it anyway it's just okay there are two two benefits for it [lah] the first thing
kita dapat (err) to gauge the response of (err) the people who will watch a tournament that we run that's one second thing is (um) anyway always goes on a portfolio apa-apa yang kita buat we go on the portfolio and this is also a plus point it goes into two portfolio it's running in organising an event plus kita punya
(uh) short casting the (err) portfolio [ah] so i don't see any harm in it i mean whatever we get from it right screw it anyway because we are going to have a (uh) the weekend is pretty much free anyway just clear up a weekend and then just
get it (uh) you know running [lah] the money isn't the particularly important thing for us per se i mean like money is always important [lah] but i mean the grand context of things right if you wanna run something then at least we have something to show for it giving successful then kita boleh run
weekly kalau orang nak
i mean kalau orang nak join weekly
then kita boleh run weekly if you if you want to spice it up a bit more pun boleh so at least we have a gauge to see if we if we run it habis tak ada orang tengok
and then after that at least we know takde orang tengok then we we must improve on marketing or whatever then we get feedback from them from the people if there instantly kita ada stand up tapi takde orang respond langsung takde orang nak join
[ah] itu pun masalah then after that we also know that probably we're not reaching out to the right people or the right people are not interested and then we can also can do market feedback and ask them
okay why you not interested kalau ultimately if nobody signs up in that way then we put it out then at least you can scrap it move on try it and try again
ya so but at least we find out what in the universe is wrong and for this one right (err) maybe the ones who organise this upcoming d to d league [kan] they obviously didn't foresee that you know they they they banking too much on the people's (err)
(err) goodwill they are gonna play for cheap many games they are hoping but the price doesn't justify it's too much work just to go and get the amount of money [ah] because people are gonna just end up playing macam weekend league and stuff
because why would you play so many games just to get like a hundred bucks when you can play weekend league and then earn like [ah] you're in game players you don't get anything out of the hundred dollars [what]
it's a bit predatory [lah] you can see that he is if it takes fifty percent out of everything right and then he barely barely has to do anything then administration pun okay [lah] only only problem only headache kalau ada orang not happy ke apa-apa and then he has to resolve the issues [ah] but apart from that
it's a really long tournament for really very poor pay off [eh] if he eats half of it no
i i mean if we pitched it right no no tournament sponsor or whatever right it's going to say okay you can take half of it
ya because most of the it is is a is a norm right like seventy percent or whatever goes to goes back to the players
ya it it's almost every tournament that we casted will begini apa it's it's mostly goes back to the players it doesn't make any sense in my head why anybody would join this in the first place [lah] when and i get why the responses are so poor [lah]
so that's what i think that (uh) on the flipside if your tournament is like that and then we take barely anything kita just take as you would say [lah] duit kopi [jer] just for like a couple dollars just to
pay for our refreshments or whatever ya
people people will be and and then and then we get pitch it like like
and i mean ho~ honestly if you want to be completely benevolent and make it selling point [lah] hundred percent of the thing so i honestly think yes we don't make money but if if it won't suck too badly if we didn't take anything out of it to be perfectly honest
ya but but the most important thing is then we get the numbers then we can go and pitch with numbers
and if you can sell it to many people to go and watch it right then those numbers should convert into dollars and cents later on in our other planning for the bigger things [lah]
(mm) that's just my opinion [lah] so i i don't mind i don't mind trying i mean anyway there's a there's a lot of people staying at home right now budak-budak also (err) tengah holiday
ya so might as well try and organize one soon
for christmas ke before before christmas ke
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya [lah] dia dia takde continuity between one week and another week [lah] that's the only that's the only weak point of having this weekly thing [lah] i mean maybe the weekly thing like i say it's just a
stepping stone or showcase [ah] we gotta we gotta think of it that way (uh) because if you don't put anything out then we won't get anything back in
correct [lah]
okay [lah] then i think maybe we can we can work it [ah] then after that the number of players right we just need to use the standardized [ah] the thirty two sixty four will be nice
then break it down cause it makes it it is a direct number right because it's like thirty two sixty four hundred and twenty eight right
ya but i don't know if we're gonna be able to get a hundred and twenty eight people
kalau kita punya prize money is at ten bucks each and then after that if we vinyl back
(um) next to every single cent back into the thing if we making a hundred and twenty eight with a total of a thousand dollars worth of prize money right
as easy we can we can make some there also honestly little bit [lah] not not not a lot [lah] but we can make a little bit for ourselves also [lah] so with a thousand dollars is a is a nice number [ah] if you can see a thousand dollar price part
cause everyone loves a a thousand dollars it sounds like a nice four figures [ah] like sounds big enough for one day event but then it's only con~ contingent if we can get a hundred people [lah]
i i honestly don't know i i never entered tournament tak pernah enter tournament so in in in any case i think we should ask guys who entered tournaments your kawan-kawan on the chat do they entered tournaments
[a'ah]
okay so
(mm)
(mm) [oh] ya that's also true [lah] so so kalau let's say we take a i mean i don't mind putting in a little bit to to sweetened the board [lah] i mean
ultimately you know put in to get out [lah] (err) in my opinion it's like i i i don't see any other way
because we cannot straightaway get (uh) sponsors to do anything
(mm)
that's what my hope is that kalau kita
(uh) show some sort of (uh) viewership numbers then after that maybe (err) people will start to see and then will like okay we will chip in with some of some part of the
the prize pool [lah] like little bit here little bit there then hopefully we can get some people to help us [lah] but that's why i say [lah] like if you don't if you don't kick off with something we will never start
ya and that's the that's the that's the problem [lah] so kita
kita dah boleh kena kena
kalau keluar duit pun kena keluar duit [lah] sikit [lah]
i mean in in in essence i don't even think pasal pasal nak buat duit [lah] like now so right now it's just i wanna get something off the ground and see [lah] at least nama kita ada juga orang dengar then after that kita boleh boleh juga pakai
pakai footage [jer] ke pakai the numbers then we can just shop it around to other sponsors [lah] ya
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm) more
okay boleh
(mm)
you know ya that make sense macam orang senang ke apa duit datang balik apa
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya hundred and eight dollar tu
(mm) (mm)
(mm) you once you get the the quarter final [kan] then you get something back [ah]
forty percent pasal eight times four eight times five ya
jap jap [ah] forty (err) forty percent is sixty four dollars [lah]
okay can
okay jadi kau bawa balik dah lima belas peratus [ah]
top four ya [lah] ya [lah]
also it increases the amount [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
twenty
yup
(mm)
the amounts that we need to be at [lah]
[ah] masih ada fif~
(mm) so kita masih ada fifteen percent to blame with [lah] whatever it is [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) so the incentive is banyak banyak orang sign up [lah]
tapi kalau dia punya number uneven nanti matchmaking pun susah
(mm)
that's why then they automatically capture the buy and automatic dapat duit balik pun pun tak achieve mesti orang argue punya
[a'ah]
tapi very hard to determine who gets a buy nanti orang mesti cakap tak achieve punya
pasal aku kena menang dua dia menang satu [jer] mana boleh [sia]
(mm) so nombor dia nombor dia thirty two atau sixty four itu yang masalah dia
nombor dia tak boleh uneven
cepat [ah] cepat dia orang dapat
itu pasal [lah] and i i know sixty four memang susah mes~ regularly kalau five dollar punya registration fee [kan] sixty four
i mean macam dia orang yang cakap one hundred twenty eight tu pasal dia orang tak dapat apply apa-apa free saja masuk taruh nama [jer] tu pasal taruh nama ada orang tak tak datang apa
[ah] so this one is a bit more [lah] so the numbers may be smaller but i think they'll be more invested in trying to actually play in the damn game [lah]
ya
i don't know i think i think we can start with thirty two i think it's a good it's a good idea
and like breaking it down
then we we if we work on the premise of thirty two open then obviously we have (uh) a number that we can
play with you know but this is only season one if it's macam let's say macam season two [ah] there's more people then we will open it to sixty four
but the the numbers then become bigger because the end prizes become bigger we we need to gauge i think initially the first (err) the first round [lah] is to is to gauge interest and to see how many people we can drag in on by sheer force of personality heater
(mm) that's that's the one thing i think
if macam kita buat ada memang ada thirty two players tapi takde orang tengok pun hard to go and pitch the any what else apa cannot justify
to others
(mm)
okay boleh kalau kita nak pergi end and (um) i i am no qualms kalau kita deal kat n with who is he working for scoga or is he working with scoga itu yang question dia
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) so so tak ke sama macam all the other events yang (um) itu macam supported by scoga you know apa we can still have branded our way but supported by scoga
while the other events pun nampak macam dia orang is put (err) supported by scoga it's not even really truly sponsored by scoga
[ah] so maybe it is not a bad direction to go with scoga kalau scoga is the best way to go and find funding for this kind of things
i i would don't particularly mind kita boleh set up kita punya entity and our entity will work with scoga
that scoga event [eh]
(mm)
so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
i i get
i get i get that tapi macam
sometimes it
i i it not keeping keeping the idea is one thing [lah] like is there a way that we can some sort of legal binding thing where this idea is our idea like we can't copyright an idea either [what] to be perfectly honest
ya
it's not novel in any sense it's just bet~ the the u_s_b [ah] unique selling point is it's better run as opposed to macam like dia dia dia dia tak unik dia cuma dia cuma macam dia lagi bagus you get what i mean ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's the thing [lah]
we kita kena establish the the who does what [lah] i mean like
but i think also part of the reason [lah] is if we don't let's say we don't know we try to be very insular habis tak tak tak cari pertolongan dari orang lain [kan] ada chance tak akan menjadi juga because
sometimes people's expertise in different areas might might be better because we played to our strengths apa yang kita tahu kita boleh tolong tapi ada benda yang kita tak boleh buat
ya
itu [lah] nak cari tu susah and it's a it's a circular thing [lah] you know macam kalau ada other sponsor datang
[ah] ada and then after that more sponsors will come by getting the first one everyone will wait for the first mover everyone will wait for macam siapa yang nak masukkan duit dulu you know who wants to put their money where their mouth is
that's the that's the thing [lah] that's why like right now my my confusion is every time i i kind of mood ideas to people then after that people will be like okay who else do you are you gonna get or who else can you get
then the thing is if i don't get you i cannot get anyone else in if i cannot get anyone else i cannot get you you know like pusing-pusing
ya
it's it's a that's the thing
tapi siapa yang nak pergi start siapa [lah] nak ambil belas kasihan kat kita
itu [lah]
(mm) (mm)
that's the thing [ah]
ya [lah] that's the best part [lah] (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] that's true [lah] i mean my my initial idea is that if i come in later on with the thing right then after that it makes a lot more sense i won't mind like topping up and getting making it bigger
cause you also you also kind of benefits me but you all you all right i cannot be the first mover that's why i am hesitating also with the the first mover thing pasal ya like you know like you ultimately like okay who are these people nanti dia kalau check nama aku yang keluar
(um) that's the thing [lah] unless we move in the fact that macam (err) tak boleh okay that doesn't work either i was just thinking pakai nama kau aku kat belakang then after that aku come in as the sponsor pun tak boleh apa people will people will smell smell it a million miles away [ah]
ya
ya true
and
ya [lah] i i get that but my like i think ultimately right i still don't want to be the first name in there
i i don't mind i don't ya i don't want to support it first and then people come in the only the only reason you putting this name is because it's you are putting you are putting your own money so that doesn't come then i got nowhere to calculate already apa
(mm) (mm)
j_f_s
football school
no problem no problem
[a'ah]
monitoring board [ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya
like i mean okay we keep that we keep that as a as a possibility most definitely
that's what i cakap kalau kita dapat decathlon [ah] will be accident pasal decathlon sports company
adik adik aku the only thing that dia boleh cakap is okay decathlon has no direct line for this kind of things because so far decathlon kalau kau tengok decathlon memang tak sponsor banyak benda
ya dia cakap but you can you can just randomly throw into their macam [ah] macam it's a very generic which punya contact (err) email [lah] so ya you can just throw it there and see what happens [ah]
you have to do it i guess ultimately it must be done [lah]
okay so this is the thing we need to go and extrapolate the viewership from a previous
events [ah] and macam mana nak buat itu previous events punya nombor [eh] itu pun masalah because who will hold these who will hold these data people are
ada viewers tak
ya ya helen pun register this tournament
the latest kalau nak pasal bola is itu safra punya
[eh] tak engkau punya [ah]
v_p_g
n_v_p_g n_v_p_g format dia lain sikit [lah]
okay aku pergi cari safra
tapi ada orang tengok [kan]
nine hundred and ninety ever
how much is that words to people i don't know
!wah! berapa lama
not bad not bad boleh tahan
(uh huh)
(mm)
one point two
one point two k
that's not bad
(mm)
#aiman# will blast it for us
(mm) (mm)
he gives a platform [oh]
(mmhmm)
ya kalau dia kalau dia free [kan] best
he's the he's the voice that people people want and he is the malaysian pool now even in the philippines
ya
it it's been a problem that that #aiman# has talked about so the the sending of money overseas like that it's a it's a headache and a half [ah]
ya
(mm) (mm) dia busy gila
[a'ah] [seh]
dia orang pun nama dah lama [seh] tak tak tak appear
dia takde langsung takde that's the that's the thing
[ah] yes the wrestling
[ah]
ya
dia taking it to heart [lah] then pasal itu dia punya aim [lah] i mean dia dia dia miss out on dia punya the disappointment is is evident [lah] but i i get it i get it dia dia dia upset tapi macam ya [lah] in in the balance of things and an impossible given tak teruk sangat [lah]
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and and we can get and we can get #sekaiichi# to come and help us out
that's not the easiest thing in the world [lah] to be honest
(mm)
you can try i can try and pull whoever i can possibly pull also [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) that's good
i mean i don't i don't see the problem kalau kerja dengan dia
i i think in my lesson our burden in things that i think we can
honestly spend less time on cause our value comes elsewhere
he can if we can work around the the sponsor thing the money thing like once the money thing is out of the way [kan] if he can run the event proper right no problem i'm i'm very sure that once it gets up and running like we can get it done cuma the the the negotiating for this kind of thing maybe it's not
the best use of whatever is my ability you know (err) our ability as well cause like
finding sponsors is not something that we particularly been doing with our lives i guess dia orang lagi pandai but i i think [lah] that's that's my opinion [lah]
i mean kita kalau nak nak nak nak cari sponsor [kan] the right now the foot through the door pun tak tahu macam mana nak masukkan tu
i i can't even get a headway into anything right now i feel so defeated
tu [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
understandable [lah]
that's why the the the logical play in my head right is scoga cause scoga's only aim
is this
but scoga right (uh) what kind of organization are they are they a profit making organization are there a benevolent and do you know organisation are they like aku nak support any pasal aku nak e sports mengembang dalam singapore where or are they like
aku nak buat ini pasal aku nak buat duit where the hell do they get the funding
okay
(uh huh)

aku macam i want to find c_c_a that is fun but kalau ada sikit macam not much commitment [lah] gitu
macam aku okay aku contemplated a lot of benda firstly ibadat secondly aku nak masuk (um)
apa begitu macam (um) voluntary work tapi dekat n_p macam banyak gila voluntary work aku boleh buat

macam commitment dia macam kau tahu tak aku punya course macam mana my course is a very
(um) how do i say

agency i would say ya
aku nak belajar overseas like aku nak belajar overseas aku nak belajar overseas sebab aku nak rasa ya
being independent
being independent ya because kalau kau belajar overseas kau takde you have no excuse to know not how to cook
you must know how to cook to survive because kalau kau cakap home mak aku masak aku tak nak masak
kalau kat luar i have to cook for myself
so at the same time kau belajar untuk berdikari do household rasa macam mak aku rasa
so aku macam nak experience that thing tapi macam kesian pun [lah] tinggal parents aku

aku anggap kita macam like more toward like bual-bual kosong
random
#iffa# is like something knowledgeable
[oh] yang lelaki tu [kan]
[eh] they gave him macam
apa conditional a warning
aku rasa itu macam ada orang ought to see
like it's me kalau benda seorang yang benda sama ya
and you just you just given warnings
i mean like this is so
is it isn't inhumane
inhumane
but macam kalau if you put it in term macam macam kita as a human punya equality
macam diri kita sendiri macam tak kisah orang tu race tu apa what is his race but logically like if you murder sama macam aku seorang you have
macam it's logic for someone to kena gantung ke
ya true
macam you murder someone
logically who kena gantung this is like (um) like the basic macam law that we know [lah] but
i don't know what derives dia punya court macam kasih conditional warning see the word conditional warning

ya betul betul actually kita boleh makan kat ni garden you want or not
dining in the garden #ang-mo-kio# [ah]

(mm) selain daripada dining in garden apa lagi ada
[oh]
[oh]

i mean ya kita boleh ada alternative kat sana banyak alternative
[oh] jom [ah] kita pergi sedap mania
[oh]
kalau tak pergi sadap mania pergi mana
katakan adam tak ikut
[oh] #jinjja# [eh]
boleh [lah]
jewel
[a'ah]
betul
ya i mean apa tu okay [lah] kalau nak kita pergi cuba so our trip can be from
#changi# village then after that
you know maybe bau [jer] #sedap# mania habis tu kita nak bicycle
tengok jurassic meyer habis kita makan #jinjja# chicken tapi [kan] that time i went to jewel (um)
#jinjja# chicken like like i think it was like a few months back
then [ah] the queue was like really very long at jewel that time #jinjja# chicken [lah] i don't know why was it so long also i think i went there on
(uh) ahad punya malam
so (um) the queue [ah] panjang [ah] lepas tu tempat dia duduk kena like they put us in front of the entrance so it was very awkward [lah] duduk kat depan orang nak lalu-lalang lalu lintas so
i tak tahu [lah] apa tu (um) macam mana begitu but
ya like singapore memang got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated punya food places [ah] the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about a&w baru halal [kan]
dekat jewel pun ada
kita [kan] nak pergi cycling
twelve chicken pieces for twelve dollars how big is the
how big is it
ya
!wah! cheap [eh]
[a'ah] [seh]
ya true also tapi tak boleh cycling
not really sure i think macam crab meat
hot dogs
cendawan
shi~ #shiitake# cendawan #shiitake#
ya memang yummy
ya ya ya
#satay# soup base
!huh! really
[oh]
[oh]
hari ini cheat day
k ya so macam mana
[oh]
bukan b b nine [eh]
bukan [eh]
[oh]
(um) k boleh [ah]
(err)
ke cakap pasal shares [lah]
so
so far
i nak try [lah] baru try try i nak try stock then i macam rasa-rasanya tesla will grow [lah] in the future
sebab ya because a lot of countries are macam adopting (err) are banning petrol vehicles by
in the future
so
by investing in macam electric car company ini [kan] all those clean energy ones
(uh)
the shares would probably go up [lah] in the future like maybe not now maybe dalam lima sepuluh tahun
macam bitcoin dulu [lah] bitcoin dulu also low [kan] but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya i feel like for now ya maybe i'm gonna try with
electric cars
so hopefully that one day i will reap the benefits [lah]
so what do you think how about you
!huh! serious
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
i'm not really sure also but islamic finance tapi i think like macam those stocks yang
yang permissible macam you know yang tak go against the basic purpose [ah] macam those thoughts yang deal with (um) vices then
alcohol
you know all those macam clearly apa ni
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so i think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
that's my pandangan [lah] on this
okay for me [eh] i think kita kena macam
diversify [lah] our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like macam
segregate your assets [lah] so i think one good (err) platform to that we can use is
(uh) #wahed# invest so this is a macam
i as far as i know this is the
only macam
syariah compliant punya stocks trading platform [lah] so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
commodities [ah] macam cash ke gold
ambil bonds and all these are like certified to be syariah compliant so i think you will feel safe
investing in macam these kind of companies
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
you don't have to put in effort [lah] you just letak your money then you just
(uh) forget about it
so i think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
based on my experience dia punya fees is
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars i think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside [lah] of of using
#wahed# invest
tapi like maybe this is one
(um)
how to say [eh]
what (err) things you have to face [lah] if you want to go through the halal way
right because i'm sure there are other than other platforms yang offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
ya so you have to put up [lah] with this all these service charge [lah] when these banks
new way
true
maybe you can feedback to u_o_b jangan invest in bonds
macam bank bapa kita
[oh] like betul [lah] i mean yang what you say is true cuma
i mean you want apa ethical investing [eh] in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so i mean if you can like
do it the halal way then it's the best [lah]
[ah] correct
[a'ah] deep
ya correct [lah] i mean because anyway singapore there's not many options i don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if i'm not wrong ya so i mean you must start with with
those the regular accounts [lah] me you have no choice [what] tapi that's why (err) you have to do your own research [lah] if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
(err) mana-mana company i mean mana-mana banks
betul
cakap pasal investment ni macam mana kita punya trip ni
bau dia macam apa tu
so dia punya kentut signify more to yes ke more to no
okay [lah] ya
kita (err)
i think she i mean she's free [lah] it's whether dia nak ke tak
ya maybe dia malas [lah] tapi anyway dia dah agree apa sunday dia okay
ya mahal sikit [ah] situ
#jalan-kayu# [ah]
i okay
ya correct
[oh]
#ubin# mana makcik punya
ya that's why
i mean good [lah] good i mean next time next time we go we should try [lah]
#mee# soup
boleh actually boleh tapi semua orang kena okay [lah]
besok tak crowded
[oh] so kita dah [dah] missed [lah]
unless kita pergi besok
kita pergi terus pergi #ubin#

environment [ah] i'm talking about the block [eh] bukan the orang-orang [lah] block [lah] you put in that kind of block macam lonely [kan] takde family i mean takde support adik-beradik so any human being will also macam experience something will experience the same thing [lah]

because then again she's the one that help me with my
[ah] application right to a_d_m itself
ya
true true true true ya so that was just a
you know sedekah
some something small [lah]
to give back a token on my appreciation

get into that ya
tu [lah] it's the standard [lah] you know how
generous my parents are
they like to shower
her with gifts [ah]
from time to time [ah]
(mm) tau
(mm)
but ya [lah]
that there's been that [lah]
[ah]
so still close friends [ah]
but
(uh) but i have a girlfriend already [ah] so
ya shuttle correct correct
(mm)
ya
[oh] i mean any i'm a kind of guy anything goes [ah] you know you know it is [lah] just so happens [ah]
that
ya that is that is her [lah] so ya but it's quite funny though
if you i mean you know that she was from our j_c right
ya or i think cause she was like a year younger so
#wei# i haven't i haven't told you this [sia] how would you know [eh] true true
ya it's actually same
ya
ya we met at a bus stop at (err) near my ho~ my hostel there [ah]
ya ya ya correct correct
but but she same year i think same year as you (err)
(mm)
how many what
[oh]
(uh) i think she #wee-kim-wee# [ah]
the communications ya
no [lah] no no dude that one that one purely my rezeki [ah]
(uh) it's
nasib [ah] nasib
no no i always i always thought she was a science kind of student [ah] like take engineering and stuff
but ya
correct correct ya i also quite surprised
well i guess communication is key [ah] yang penting [ah] so
you know what i mean
ya
well it's only been a a few months [ah] since the start of the year
[ah]
ya [lah] as of now just chill [lah] just ya
occasional stuff
ya don't want to get my head too high
in the clouds
ya
(mm)
ya later you know my
potential nak kena backfire [ah] you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it macam tame first
ya
before it gets ya
ya pretty i pretty sure i already told
a handful of people only
[ah] including you
ya that's the thing
see
ya i've been wanting to
have this conversation quite awhile [lah]
i thought we could have played games you know during this (err) holiday period like like how he used to [lah] but
ya i guess this busy schedule
right i mean
furthermore kalau main also like
how many hours
and we don't have that kind of time [ah]
so
(mm)
so cannot play sampai lambat also [kan]
ya
so that's how it is [ah]
if not i would have updated you about more of this kind of stuff [ah]
but it's okay [ah] (err) i have i have this time now to you know
[oh]
(mm)
[oh]
(um)
[oh]
(err)
can i do it i actually don't mind [lah] even though i'm not close to loofy
[ah]
i would i wouldn't mind [lah] ya i mean
as a natural bass player i
i think i can handle
the the responsibilities of a lead guitarist [ah]
ya shouldn't be a problem [lah] but when is this [ah]
(um)
tak betul [ah] [ah] i know [ah]
ya that time [lor]
[oh] apa ni
baik [tau]
[oh]
(mm)
he quit or kena buang
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] but ya i heard back then dia punya temper also quite
quite serious [ah] he was your classmate [kan] j_c
(mm) true true true
[oh]
(mm)
i see i see
but kalau i think
i should be down to jam with you all [lah] kalau jumaat lepas solat
probably four [oh]
together
[eh] but
i heard
if you want to go together then kena apply online [kan] to get the queue
[oh]
so should i apply like
like how long how much in advance can i apply now now can already [leh]
[orh]
[oh]
dia orang fast game [ah] [dah] apply online
ya but how's the slots like though
the best seats is tingkat berapa
[oh]
cause closer to god [kan]
(mm) so that means the the
takde yang rapatkan saf [lah]
kena expand
(mm)
do it [lah]
(mm)
i heard
the wuduk area now they dia orang taruh apa sanitizer
[oh] no [ah]
[oh] okay okay [oh] so they they
they close off the area [ah]
because then again it's a
to prevent the spread of
the water borne infections [ah]
(mm)
so then that means salam pun tak boleh [ah]
[ah] okay okay
the gentle gentle tap [lah] at the knuckles
speculation [lah]
situations ya
i mean
ya
orang only the orang atas would know [lah] all what is set in stone [lah]
ya
[oh]
yes
[oh]
suggestions [lah]
(mm) i would say i've only been out a few times for work and
ya i didn't get get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
and that one pun mostly kat my
housing area
ya
ya so it's the same old kedai kopi and (err) you know the p_p_p mall right ya
ya
ya the standard breakfast punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng
ya
ya
ya that's why bro i've been meaning to on that [ah]
[oh] ya i did (err) the west ham versus watford right
[oh] my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
(mm)
[ah] okay okay ya i also thought i thought you would also do that macam dah second nature [kan] ambil wuduk
(um)
ya i mean
it's quite impressive [ah] that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years [ah]
[oh] cik jamal [oh] i always thought he was
ya all this while right i thought he was like a nottingham forest punya supporter
[oh] at any pressure [lah]
(mm)
but ya [lah] i i think end of the day
jokes jokes is on him [lah] cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true that's true
i'm quite happy [sia] for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya (mm) i would say they are doing fine now
but i'm just just stress [ah] bro for the last last two games [ah]
cause you punya opponent (mm)
ya correct correct
mid table but kalau menang the last two matches then
confirm qualify [ah] europa europa
ya champions league [dah]
dah tak boleh dah
a bit out of reach [ah] ya jauh sangat
[ah] ya [lah] so that's that [lah]
quite sad [lah] cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean sean playton [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya that is expected of them [lah]
ya so
tu yang quite disappointing [ah]
but (uh) you know you know foot~ football just football [lah]
it just a game so
(mm)
ya
correct correct this [ah] can't be predicted [lah]
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
(um) win [ah] so syabas to them
yes
(mm)
true true true
ya
[oh] ya speaking of liverpool right so how is (uh) your good our good friend [ah] #havi#
ya
[oh]
[oh] the usual springleaf or the #prata# place [ah]
(mm)
ya that's true that's true
!wah! so you'll be meeting him later [ah]
[oh] !wow!
ya
that's good that's good
ya just send him my [ah] regards [ah]
(err) like him to know that
i'm always happy for him [lah]
cause this is like first time in
dua puluh tahun is it ya liverpool won punya premier league
[ah] ya ya ya correct correct
yes yes
(uh) that's amazing
ya now he already ya [sia] he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time [ah]
[ah]
but i will have to say [ah] dia punya though he quite semangat [ah]
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be melampau [ah]
how emotion emotional football gets [ah]
(mm)
ya true true
but [oh] wells
is he is he still the regular kat your fire station
[oh] so what to to go into full time studies is it
does he does he say the requirement for like what do you call it [ah] the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme [oh] the
something to do with like mature mature student or something [eh]
[oh] james cook (mm)
[ah] okay okay
he but his passion nice [lah]
under him [mah]
(mm)
(mm)
trainings
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm) no doubt [lah] he is really a budak baik [lah]
and (uh)
polis
ya
ya i was at (err) i was at the n_p_c and #ang-mo-kio# over there ya
ya correct correct
biasa [ah] you know just
you know drive around the neighbourhood
(mm) do roundings only [ah]
ya but i would say i never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years [ah]
cause no one from my from my my squad [ah] actually went to the same ya n_p_c as me
ya so a bit sedih [ah]
cause they cause they base you based on your
where your where you stay your residence ya so ya so i kena posted kat foxtrot division [ah] tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat this area [ah]
sorry sorry can you repeat that again [ah]
(err) didn't get to hear clearly
(mm)
[oh] i would say there's a fair share of calls [lah] there's there's still ongoing back then [lah] (err) but i won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like macam woodlands #jurong#
ya i would say that central area quite tame [mah]
ya
but no doubt [lah] there's always calls here and there [lah] whether their severity macam
whether it's like (err) important or not [ah] it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was [ah]
ya but all in all
okay [lah] n_s life
valuable [lah] ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya i i feel the same way [ah] as as much as like you know the berita dia orang cover and all these cases of
macam mismanagement
ya
i think it's isolated punya cases
cause
(mm)
ya correct correct
(mm)
true true
ya
cause biasanya macam
tak macam gitu [ah] usually it's more civilized and laid back [ah] i would say nothing much going on [ah]
ya
but [oh] well that's
it was a good times [ah] back in the days
ya
so ya man
i wish (err)
i wish i have plans after this [ah] but sadly i don't
(err) you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct correct yes around
this (err) my vicinity [lah]
correct [ah]
[ah]
i usually go for a minimum ten k_m [ah]
ya
you know ten k_m run ya
i think i mean
[kan] kena stay active [kan]
ya
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya but i think is tak susah [ah] tak susah sangat [lah] but it's
kena biasakan so
ya i think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
(mm) cause when you when you first start [lah] like after one ten k_m and then usually you togok air like melampau [ah] but
now i barely need a sip of water [ah]
ya
ya correct
(mm)
ya
ya correct correct correct i that one i fully agree [ah] [kan] i mean cause banyak orang banyak orang tak
tak begitu informed [lah] about this kind of stuff [ah] so
macam
the
it is the right way [lah] is to jangan minum banyak [ah] you have to conserve
cause if you drink too much then later your system
like macam
it's it's it's hampered with already [ah] so you need to stay stay clean [ah]
ya
ya but but not to you know pam~ pamper it until to to make it seem as if like you have to go full
kena full cool down mode already [ah]
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
(mm)
ya correct correct
heatstroke [ah] heatstroke
no it's not it's not cause you drink to little [lah] it's cause you you minum melampau [ah] basically
(mm)
correct correct
[ah] that's true [lah] cause kalau kau minum banyak [kan] the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
you more vulnerable to heatstroke [lah]
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
kau punya badan is like you know get gets in a shock
(uh) so the more you biasakan with more water then the more likely you will
kenakan the effects of that heatstroke [ah]
[kan]
ni semua kena belajar [ah]
(mm) yang tepat [ah]
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
(mm)
ya
well
(uh) i haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages [ah] but i've been (uh)
(err) a good a very good consumer of like (err) juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice [ah] yes you as you as you saying
(uh) i would say at least
two bottles [lah]
two bottles (err) five hundred m_l kind [ah]
of juices ya correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
yes yes yes correct correct
ya
[ah] okay but where do you get this where what what what what brand are your juices
benefits [ah]
(mm)
[oh] the biji [ah] biji
biji-biji kecil [ah]
!wah!
!wah! that's
i think that's (err) that's the right way to go [ah] to be honest
[ah]
[oh] serious
then
the biji take out then you blend the kulit but but then
bila kau minum [kan]
then is the texture smooth
kalau
[oh] do you blend the kulit [ah]
ya ya correct correct then i think i read somewhere that if you blend the the fiber
it will be drinkable [lah] but
you need to use a
good blender [lah]
ya i would say that [lah]
ya
but kau kena
kau kena like see first [lah] whether this the the type of fruit
already has natural sugars [ah] before kau tambah extra sugar or anything [lah] when you blend

monyet business
girl every baby is cute
the older one is like macam
ya man i mean i was shocked because that was where where was it [eh] that was at (err) [oh] ya #pulau-ubin# i was walking along this bridge and then there were a lot of monkey i was so happy because i mean
monkeys are cute [lah] so we we enter #chek-jawa# so when we were entering ya so when we walking walking there's would like there were like what like
over twen~ twenty over thirty over monkeys were there
while i was walking i all of sudden had a feeling that this thing was behind my back because it just literal just jump and i thought it was #sab# that was trying to pull me away
and then i heard she call out my name i'm like [oh] no
it's a monkey
so
because my backpack has a water bottle has a but that but there's no water inside [lah] so
so the monkey actually (err) jump on my back and still stole my water bottle and you know trying to open up the cup the bottle cap cup [eh] bottle cap ya so
campak kat muka aku
[ah]
dia macam sign kau [ah] dia kata jangan bilang dia jangan bilang dia
ya
[a'ah]
[ah]
[ah] pasal kau dah pekik nama aku
next kalau ada next word coming from your mouth he's going to come at you
ya
takde air because okay that time [eh] bila aku pergi #bali# [kan] then lepas tu they have these tourist place whereby kau boleh beli kau boleh beli banana and it's like the kecil-kecil banana in a bunch
for like two dollars so lepas tu kau boleh feed the banana the banana pulak kau boleh feed
kau boleh feed the monkeys there [lah] and there were a lot of monkeys there where tapi kat situ ada rangers [lah]
so
there's this one monkey aku rasa maybe dia macam (hmm) primary school monkey
dia tak besar dia tak kecil [ah] he's not an adult he's not a child so probably maybe it's like (err) teenager so this monkey actually came to me and then he just snatch this banana from me so lepas tu i think the banana was rotten
so dia buka he peel peel peel peel
and he threw at my face [lah]
he throw the banana at my face then i'm like
i was shocked i was like [eh] ini biadap [eh] like i paid because it was so i was so (err) interested i mean i was so having i was so much having fun
so i kept buying the bananas like up to ten dollars dah so kau imagine ya aku beli two dollar two dollar two dollar so i kept buying and then i buy lepas tu
aku dah kasi kat semua monyet and the monkeys will be like macam dia tak ada datang kat engkau macam simpati punya macam kucing takde [eh] dia tak nak engkau turun dia jump on you and jump on your head or your body there's like three monkeys four monkeys on me
wanted that banana so i gave it ya gave it gave it gave it then after that satu tonyoh kepala aku okay like after he ate the banana he actually just like
[ah] [a'ah] like like that like okay so i'm like okay okay it's okay i'm fine with that but this [one] that actually throw the banana at my face
ya
rude you know that's very rude
so (err) aku takut [ah] aku tak marah [lah] kalau aku marah dia sekali dia bawa the gang [ah] mana tahu dia faham bahasa aku so
so bila so that time bila aku tengah jalan-jalan then there's this one #ang-moh# ada this orang putih mat salleh [lah] dia
i think she was trying to play with the monkey but the rangers suruh kita dah kita masuk kita semua orang masuk dia dah cakap don't try to be funny [lah] kalau ada
(uh) grab your banana grab banana [lah] kalau dia (um) you know you don't like macam main-main dengan dia [lah] so aku rasa this orang putih main-main dengan dia so he actually wanted to bite her ears
ya the monkey actually wanted to because because she was
aku rasa dia angry [ah] or aggressive [ah] because dia main-main the rangers tu dah kata jangan main-main so so he actually wanted to bite the ears [ah] so dah macam just
maybe just one bite
not really that deep bite [lah] sort of one bite so the [ah] the caucasian girl was at shock [ah] dia pekik and in the ranger was like i think they had this macam
kayu ke apa aku tak tahu [ah] i don't know what's that [lah] so he just like macam whack it so that the monkey will go away
so the monkey went away [lah]
so ya
aku tak tahu [ah] that is that is because they are rangers they know their monkeys !aiyo!
[ah] tahu tak apa [ah] nanti dia panggil dia punya gang lagi [ah] tak payah [lah] terima kasih sudah

all we want is just maybe to go to our neighbouring country you know like malaysia
(err) i i'm not sure because i don't think they have like us safe entry or maybe trace together
and (um) i'm not sure whether it's compulsory for them to wear masks there
and then (um)
because #johor# has (err) strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so i don't know whether because (err) the last that i heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if #johor# (um) numbers demote back [ah] but i think after a week it does in its red zone
(mm)
ya i still have my dirt bike to go [oh] my god
ya it's on the date it was it's on the day that
(err) the government of malaysia actually wanted to close down the borders
i was like [oh] my god
i i paid two hundred do~ sing dollars for the dirt bike you know
i didn't even get to go and i was like should i and and we were like should we go
we were like should we go home that night or should we go home the the the next morning
actually we wanted to just go for the dirt bike and book a train ticket at night so that we can go back to singapore
but then i think a colleague of mine her mum was quite worried that we don't even get to
(err) ya get on board and get back to singapore on time ya because it closes at twelve a_m you see ya just say twelve a_m so
i was texting i was texting the dirt bike organiser i was like !hey! i get this (um) news about your government closing down the borders blah blah so how how is it now then she says that okay
(err) we will put aside your name and all those stuff so once everything get back
to normal and all those stuff and then you know
(um) she she will email us and we have to confirm the date in within six months so i'm like okay
(mm)

ya i saw like (um)
the europe
country is new zealand and i don't know which other country allow the singapore is allow certain countries okay example one of it is our country [lah] singapore to actually go over there without having to (um)
isolate ourselves [lah] but then again you know if you were to come back to singapore you still have to abide our the ya the rule by isolating yourself for
two weeks
so i'm like and the cases in europe [ah]
you know higher
ya actually [lah] because it's like you know
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
i think this is the (err) this is worse than sars man
[ah] okay [lah] that's nonsense [lah] we all know that's nonsense you see
ya there are some like you know they are being hospitalised for a month or so like six months three months four months and some are in i_c_u
so it's like if it were to be that easy i don't think any other countries will have second lockdown you know
that german is having a second lockdown europe is having second lockdown and then
(um) we are having this thing we call circuit circuit breaker for like two months after that phase one phase two and now when we want to open this phase three also government is thinking twice thinking twice whether to open and they have this pilot thing going on like you know you can go for clubbing but you still have to wear mask
(mm)
(mm)

we'll be back as how we used to be i mean
i mean we
okay [lah] i don't like that you know we take things we take life for granted we thought that you know you could travel as much as we can we could go out as much as we can you know but when this kind of thing happen we will like macam
!alamak! tak boleh buat tu tak boleh buat ni
we can't get to travel as much we can't (um) and then when we now we used to have like gathering kita ada gathering we used to like just book chalet and invite you know like what twenty thirty forty people and then birthday celebration
we will invite people over but now is like macam
even though i mean i believe there are some people that you know even though they says that five or ten people that are allowed in your home there's like
orang lagi banyak yang hush hush you know coming in to celebrate birthday and all those stuff
and then like your recent family gathering you know like (uh)
you just have to hush hush so that you know your neighbours won't know about it and all those stuff
so it's a sad thing [lah] that what we used to do you can't now so ya and and then they're and then

and then the pengantin okay [lah] kalau aku pun aku pun rasa macam i just wasted my money you know like few thousand dollars and then now the numbers is like that so and then vendors pun
kesian juga [lah] like macam aku dia also want to earn a living you see so there was a point whereby there's (err) apa (err) miscommunication between the pengantin and vendor like asking for refund and all those stuff like even vendor also didn't know that this thing will happen
and it wasn't even in the contract so some of them that i heard is like blaming the vendor you know of not giving me back tak highlight dengan duit [lah] you know and those stuff but
(err)
aku rasa it's it has it has to be (um)
communicate both face sekali [lah]
like pengantin pun tak expect numbers will drop vendor pun tak expect numbers will drop so you know it's only fair that vendor (err) apa (err) maybe gantikan dengan something or the pengantin kurangkan something so that you know both will be happy about it [lah]
