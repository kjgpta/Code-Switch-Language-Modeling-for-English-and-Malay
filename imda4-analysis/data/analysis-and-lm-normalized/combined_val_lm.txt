alright
alright #mahirah#
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
[ha] nampak
beauty in everyone okay this is a
topic ni berat [eh] topic ni is very this topic is orang kata very wide dia punya spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance tapi beauty in terms of everything not just
(uh) look wise tapi beauty in (uh) nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is memang kita boleh counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic i would say for the first
(uh) time kita berbual
so okay kita start gini [lah] [eh] kita start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay kau kau start dulu apa kau punya definition of beauty pada kau
yes
okay
[oh] that would tu bagus tu yes that that is bagus (err) bagus bagus
for me
for me okay ak~ aku
i don't see myself as kau tahu [kan] macam victoria's secret punya type punya ke lawa memang tak [lah] memang not even near that [lah] but because i i have my insec~ inse~ insecurities (um) based on appearance juga which itu pun is another topic [eh] kau kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu about me about
but but what can i say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble i think that is the overall beauty which
which people in our society is blinded by that sebab
standard kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
tapi for me beauty kalau kau lawa pun mana pun but if your if your attitude is macam gitu then
then memang you know what i mean
memang kit~ tak boleh tak boleh dianggapkan as beauty overall and it it this is our perspective ramai orang ada different punya perspective but we're gon~ we're not gonna touch on that but d~ we can just (uh) it's between the both of us what is our definition
boleh boleh
beauty in a long term !woo!
(mmhmm)
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so se~
(mm)
betul
[oh] okay for me my kawan the friends that i go like the friends that i cari atau dapat it's okay we we can talk about poly ya kita punya poly days is kita tak i i don't see like [oh] kau lawa i'm gonna be friends with you no no no no i woul~ never sebab
kau lawa i was going to say you no no no no i never sebab
i mean i don't know for me memang i don't see
like okay because you are pretty i'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome i'm gonna go to no i rather i rather not
go towards that sebab it's not gonna be a genuine punya relationship you know
sebab it's just gonna be
for clout macam you know you know some people (uh) there there is some (uh) cliques ke apa whatever in school yang macam okay sebab kau lawa kau popular i'm gonna to go to you because
i'm gonna get that that that popularity i'm gonna get that that fame dia ada attention so i think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can that can last you know
which is memang may~ maybe not because during after kalau your your school is is done then that's it will you ever meet the person yang macam will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
macam for me and you [eh] macam this is kita pun semalam baru jumpa [eh] we just met yesterday with our with our friends and that is like kita punya relationship first first kita start from sec one
and until now it last ramai of my other friends macam kita dah macam you know after that macam dah start to putik putus but with you and (err) (err) our friends yest~ yesterday it is a long lasting macam kita tak awkward [tau] and that that is something that i see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever #inshaallah#
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what i what i see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know kita punya chemistry kita punya behaviour
kita punya personality because okay imagine kalau the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine kita takde macam makan orang makan orang you know what i mean like like betray or
or jealousy no that it it is really a general rela~ relationship that's why i find that if you want to find friends in the future
tak payah cari beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any betul tak tu
apa kau rasa apa kau rasa
cerita sikit cerita sikit
(mm)
go towards the beauty or
[oh] damn
(mm)
(mmhmm)
like fashion wise you know is it [oh] damn okay i think i get what you mean some~ my my course pun ada juga yang those type of cliques that
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not i mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are (um)
(uh) handsome (uh) lelaki kat dalam my course yang baik yang humble yang tahu yang dia orang tak stuck up but there are also cannot deny that that there are also (um)
(uh) girls that they they dia orang punya dia orang macam you know they have that that beauty standard [lah] dia orang ada that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and and they are not they are sombong they are arrogant you know
so so macam it's a
i don't know (err) macam for me that's not the right i mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know you know they say kalau kau lawa you should then (uh) take advantage of it like you know you should your personality pun kena bagus
sebab but but people people who are lawa usually you know you know dia orang dia orang i'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna ada that ego you know that ego that that it depends [lah] how you are brought up you know
which is (um) it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them [lah]
ya very subjective
(mm)
true true but overall selecting friends with with (uh) with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not (uh) it's not the right way to do [lah] i would say
so ya it's not
not just that [lah] beauty in terms of you know right k~ (uh) now we are all going to that stage of working [kan] it's always kalau it's always macam you see this (um)
if there's if there's a competition you know what i mean
not just competition but macam okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this i had experienced that macam sebab this person is sexy ke apa ada landed job
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
i mean that is for us yang mungkin macam of a lower standard
it's not it's unfair [what] because you should pick someone of (uh) of ta~ of talent of skills instead of beauty
(mm)
[oh] yes
pay plays an important role e~
(mm)
design
f&b
social service ya
true true
betul betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur [eh] i mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
tapi (uh) beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that (uh)
this we can say about our macam okay in the future kalau you nak cari (um)
a a partner in life your (uh)
wh~ is beauty important macam appearance wise or the best is macam mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
(uh huh)
that is true of course of course first app~ ya you will see the appearance [one] or not
ya tu memang tu memang tu memang
ad~ ada yang suka cute cute ada yang suka macam e-boy e-boy
true true true true
(uh) no (err) not not not the first (uh) judgement because because first judgement memang is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but (uh) overall macam to to find that the quality wise for a for a future partner
me too me too
i think i think
okay kau okay kau kau share kau share dulu cause ni pun (uh) is an interesting fact
for me for me right i i got a
okay i will share you later you you share first
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
what's the point [kan]
true true i mean for me i think that is considered beauty sebab okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is no~ is nothing macam okay [lah] first judgement yes appearance tapi [kan] peop~ people say kindness is beautiful to me int~ intelligence is beautiful to me or macam
(uh) macam the the act of (uh) sharing macam
(uh) car~ caring the your you punya personality that is beautiful so
macam i think beauty [eh] is is
is again subjective sebab
ada orang [eh] they say macam asalkan kau kemas [kan] macam kau (err) you are clean you clean yourself macam it macam bukanlah you yo~ i'm asking you macam pergi plastic surgery to be beautiful no no i think i think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your of your the state
(uh) i'm not i'm not gonna talk about myself (err)
but but overall macam the of how you take care of yourself macam for the macam kita how we how we like its like macam you know like we we kita basuh muka something like that you know
things like that this little things that will build up (um)
the sense of beauty sebab okay macam beauty [eh] is again macam very it can be very (um)
stressful for some people
sebab
nak trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what i mean
you know (uh) i i got this macam macam experience kalau we we talk with our friends ke apa we always like ada juga topic topic yang macam ini maknanya macam anxiety anxiety of being in a crowd of (uh) people
(uh) again it's it's about slo~ un~ (um) macam low self esteem you know kau ada face gitu tak aku ada i i have low self esteem you know cause i do have insecurities insecurities that macam to me i find that
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what i mean but it's hard to get rid of it
macam kau do do you have any like (um)
insecurities ataupun macam low self esteem towards this kind of (uh) topic
i pun sama
handsome
sama sama sama sama for me sama (err) like i think
susah [eh] macam
unless kita kes yang macam our confidence level is very high ya but of course
terdetik [lah] kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang very kita rasa macam [eh] !alamak! you know what i mean
ya
i i came across this one (uh) (uh) apa tu (uh) it's a meme [lah] the it's a kid the kid says macam the kid was saying (uh) dia like macam to god [tau] god (uh)
if (uh) can you make me (uh) beautiful because i don't think i'm very smart
okay but i think betul [lah] macam
for me pun ad~ times yang i i i would say to myself like
if i'm not smart then at least make me beautiful [lah] you know which is a wrong mindset sebab that means [eh]
i'm i'm okay this to me towards me i'm i'm scolding myself that means i'm trying to say that
[oh] that means when if i'm pre~ beauty
if i'm (uh) pretty i will get somewhere i would get (uh) at least a modelling job ke apa you know at least i have something tapi
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
tapi sap~ okay siapa tak nak lawa [kan] siapa tak nak handsome buat apa dalam dunia ni
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
(um) tadi nak tanya tanya seribu question boleh
yes yes
yes
[oh] !wow!
girls or boys
i think [kan] for me okay kita kita perempuan [kan] but i i think (um) generally generally speaking [kan] i think it's the girls is it but not me [lah]
subjective subjective but but i think [kan] it's more towards the girls sebab [kan] kau tahu [lah] macam we have like boys and girls is different [what] kita punya how we hangout how we
ag~ again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
pergi towards that that
that apa tu tujuan like okay i'm gonna find this kind of clique
but
to you apa to you which one for you
ya
physic~ really physic~
practical
(mm)
ya ya ya macam in terms of gossiping also [lah] you can say that dia orang macam more towards okay maybe gaming or like like like
some other stuff which macam for for girls maybe some of them will talk about [eh] look at that i mean [eh] macam [eh] yo~ have you heard this about i heard about macam some of my friends (uh) classmate dia macam [eh] kau tengok tu [eh] kau tengok dia ni [eh] kau tengok you know they we they are always macam
you can say (err) comparing [eh] comparing
(uh) judgy but
that's kind of the topic yang
for you know me and you kita tak kita we don't go to that because we we have other other better topics to talk about
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then (uh) (uh) most likely is the
kaum wanita [lah] it's always kaum wanita
tapi ya ya but (uh) (uh) (um) to mention macam orang yang tak lawa
tak but it's kini it's how society pandang you know what i mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know sebab this is how society looks sebab to be honest who started this thing called macam
(uh) okay (uh) kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau if you're not if you're not handsome or if you are like this (uh) or if or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing mesti ada dulu maybe in history ada [jer] yang macam
okay kalau you macam ni i you see it all started it's not it's not it's nothing to do with (um) you can say ni lumrah manusia [tau] you know kau tahu benda ni macam this human standard the world doesn't do this [tau] it's us the humans that
that did did did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually kalau kalau we all treat people the equally (uh) got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having (uh) insec~ insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem sebab it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
macam okay i'm not gonna i'm not sebab you get it's subjective it depends some ada some parts of the world takde macam gini but some parts some of the world
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
that is very macam sebab it's all about the fashion it's all about the the the vibe that is very is very concerning [what] that's why ramai orang macam ada yang every article is that people suicide you know
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
tak payah cakap pasal you macam gini [kan] it it can be because maybe sebab (uh) you are having this disabilities which i i very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people i mean they got they they never do anything to you [what] betul [what] macam
dia orang tak kacau kau apa or like they judge you base on your (uh) clothing ke based on your i'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can (uh) about also about also macam status
hierarchy system macam kaya and poor
this kind of thing is what
it's all lum~ lumrah manusia it's all (uh) human standards
which i think is
is is tak berapa bagus
betul tak
not just beauty [tau] macam pasal poor and rich pun boleh jadi problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people i've seen (uh) kau tahu [kan] macam kat sekolah kita kita nampak [kan] macam budak budak ada yang kena outcast [kan] you know what i mean
this one is is this this kind of thing [lah] that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what i mean
[oh] dear i think i heard a dysfunctional something [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
functional [eh]
[oh] ya
that macam (uh) the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what i mean
ya comp~ competition (err) competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
that that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that (uh) after this dysfunction but i tell you a bit macam betul [lah] like
there there will be a president there will be (uh) our manager there will be our the boss
takkan semua sama right pekerja then if like that if like that some people also don't want to do work [what] because
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
true true true so memang ini
lum~ lumrah [lah] [eh] memang memang it's the world [lah] it's just it evolve like this [lah] to be honest mesti there is there is gonna be (uh) plus minus there plus minus macam you know macam kau tahu okay (uh) dunia hiburan
about okay (uh) western world atau k pop [eh] macam for example that kind of thing
usually yang lawa [jer] pun yang disanjung disanjung disanjung
usually it's it's gonna be the pret~ the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be (uh)
[eh] actually no actually no i think it just it just involve in the korean punya
the k pop world you know what i mean sebab in western world we don't look at beauty [what] we we we judge based on (uh) music wise kalau kita suka kita suka macam for example like
(uh) there are (uh) idols macam mana [eh]
macam okay (uh) like
tak i think macam it's different kita tak boleh compare we cannot compare like western punya industry like the hollywood and and also k pop sebab k pop i i it's always gonna be the most handsome idol atau the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
yang lain semua you know especially when you're in a group of (uh) like ch~ of kau pernah kau pernah (uh) come across this article tak dia macam there's this one idol dia punya member tak berapa lawa [tau] macam
to me it's fine [lah] but it's ada sikit macam different daripada ada ada lain lagi lawa then all the all the macam the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where where the the other member that is tak tak not of a pretty tapi is in the middle
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
so i think that is also rabak [lah] to be honest
[oh] my god like
[ah] memilih kasih padahal sama group [tau] padahal they are in the same group
to me i think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead [lah] like like why sanjung (uh) idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people sebab ada [jer] yang news turns out that [oh] this idol did this this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans tak boleh tak boleh percaya tu the fans doesn't (uh)
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
yes you said it betul apa
(uh) same like macam
macam you have to move on because you you know this idol this idol doesn't know you
you wish tapi okay but see this is how beauty
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side (err) but the the the the negative side about
beauty [eh] macam
the look at the people will just support this (uh) this the group of
based on their
(uh) sexiness ke based on their face ke or whatever then then it's it's it's gonna go towards (uh) bad punya
okay not i'm not just talking about the k pop there i'm just talking i'm talking about okay perspective as (uh) the macam those those fans yang sanjung sangat [kan] it's not (uh) it's not it's not a good habit for them [what] sebab
sebab right when things doesn't go their way then they they are not inside the reality world you know they they maybe can start to like macam harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
so that is the negative side [lah] about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
macam kau tak payah ada beauty then you you you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know i mean
tengok [jer] macam (um) o~ oprah oprah oprah winfrey you know she's not like the lawa the most beautiful whatever right but she got that that that kindness in her she got that skills she got that (uh) hosting punya and she can be successful you know what i mean
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way [lah] but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
yang benda apa tu yang benda
yang benda (uh) success
(mmhmm)
true true
it also goes with macam top (uh) fashion wise you know what i mean
macam kau tahu [kan] dulu (uh) okay zaman sekarang right you know if you were to just wear like (uh) sloppy
macam t-shirt and cause that's what i i do sometimes you know but and then kita pergi kedai mamak something like that right
kedai (uh) #kopitiam# or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think macam they they will look at us like [eh] dia ni biar betul you know what i mean like
like are you are you are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where kita kita i'm gonna feel macam
(uh) it's okay (err) but like [eh] like it's i'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
tapi get it it's it's how era goes you know sebab zaman dulu imagine if okay right now this is the the beauty standard is like this right dulu time maybe like early two thousand
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what i mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example [eh] and then you call you wear (uh)
a dress with heels to a #kopitiam# people will look at you macam [eh] you biar betul
lain macam but but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
(uh) think macam [oh] kau lawa macam it's fine
so see how this (uh) the the era macam how (uh) move [eh] you know what i mean
lain [eh] which is weird [eh] macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir !wah!
as time goes by
as technology becomes more macam
(uh) better and more (uh)
orang kata apa lagi gempak then
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay (um)
jap [eh]
(mm)
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
!wow! okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what i mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it (mm)
true true
[oh] yes
but you are not a hipster you know what i mean (um) ya ya ya
tak tahu no no no no no i'm not talking about you as in macam those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters dia orang nak step [jer] macam they just follow the trend you know what i mean
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
i think saturated
i think there is like macam photos trend i guess kita kita use simpler simp~ (uh) simpler terms [eh]
i would say today this
(uh) of (uh) twenty twenty of the twenty first century
as you know macam around starting to see because here i feel it
it's not (um) it's because (uh) as technology evolves we evolve
you know what i mean sekarang (uh) is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is (uh) macam instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what i mean
(uh) facebook twitter youtube
(uh) this kind of thing (uh) macam pinterest (uh)
dulu tumblr okay tiktok sekarang tiktok [kan]
sekarang tiktok where
the you you i mean you we see everyone's punya life you know what i mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols ke your punya favourite punya artist (uh) kim k ke whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
t_v you know what i mean so maknanya
due to that that's why (uh) people are like following macam okay macam e-boy e-girl you might not be an e-boy e-girl tapi you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
tapi to me i think
you can you can follow whatever you want tapi kalau you have that mindset of because i wanna look cool i think that is not the right thing (err) you know what i mean why say you you if you want to dress up because you you you
you kind of like suka dia punya style macam some people you can we see [oh] i like i kind of like this style i want to try
ya go by all means tapi you shouldn't change your attitude your your personality because you are now in this this group ya macam that is that is not the right way sebab macam kau kena genuine with yourself [lah] macam
imagine you are not like that right tapi sebab kau nampak (uh) your maybe your cliques are all macam
(uh) going towards the the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you coul~ if you (uh) if you just change your clothing then it's fine tapi you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing kalau if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good (uh) circle of friends that is a good company tapi if you start to macam okay maaf cakap [eh] this can be very sensitive sebab imagine if your circle of friends (uh) macam smoking
then you you follow but actually you you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right tapi you buat
because you want to fit in then i think you shouldn't (uh) people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right macam you you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in macam
why i mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
with people macam mana [eh] i i say you don't need to get okay macam mana kau nak get this thing
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a comp~ (uh) company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
(uh) stage you know what i mean
so macam you know like (um) you know they say there's a saying macam (uh) everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like macam macam mana [eh] like
(err) macam the journey like imagine you you want to go to the next level
ya ya or or you you find someone that have that same mindset tapi you you don't
(uh)
have the same people that will hold you back
but because everyone's macam kau
needs a level up you know what i mean macam level of for the good
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
tak bagus [lah] tapi macam like see this is how (uh) trend setting macam
fashion wise (uh) people are now using (uh) fewer are following the more of the k pop
it's not gonna be is is is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it tapi if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later tapi if you follow that kind of group yang buat benda tak elok then (uh) then you should
you should have your own pride [eh] macam you know what i mean kau punya pride kau tak payah follow orang lain punya orang lain punya instruction ada betul
boleh boleh boleh shoot [jer] shoot
go [jer]
(mmhmm)
value is it popular popularity (mm)
(mmhmm)
self love
pandang rendah is it pandang rendah you look down on them [oh]
okay for me
as long as you know
where you stand macam mana you know what i mean like if you are going towards that big group macam tadi kau cakap
as long as it's of of a good value then by all means go ahead macam if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your macam it will lead you to a success atau macam lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead sebab if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead tapi kalau you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's sebab you nak ada you nak ada friends you know what i mean like quotation macam you nak ada friends punya pasal then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that that popularity then it's that's not a good (uh) there is not a good tujuan sebab kalau kau really nak
i mean you know some people macam for me no [eh] macam for me i got this thing where
kalau aku takde kawan then i'm not gonna i'm not desperate for friends like i just i i mean you know there are some people
kita nampak i've i've i've seen this
where
they they they okay they got problem with the friends and then they they dia keluar from the group [kan] dia keluar from the clique and then dia cari orang lain immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but but then then then like that much macam you like like tak bagus [lah] i i rather be alone you know what i mean i i rather people see me as alone
and i have my own (uh) pendirian daripada
i i think (uh) i need to find i need to find a friend because (uh) because people might think nanti macam i got problem
but i mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that (uh) circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find (uh) someone that really is genuine in your friendship
same goes like your question tadi whether that loner is degrading themselves no i don't think so sebab if the loner if that loner sometimes loner tu feels that
there's nothing wrong (uh) he he or she is of a good (uh) direction even if the person is alone go ahead i i woul~ kita support aku support tapi kalau
sebab you know people who are alone they might they might have problems or or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on [oh] kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish [lah] i think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know macam they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
sebab if you want to go for me [eh] aku aku i like to keep my circle of friends close macam just a small circle of friends that i really call true friends you know sebab to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what i mean and is it gonna be beneficial macam mana [eh]
ka~ you know kawan kosong and kawan that is really true
ya so back to your question where kalau the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to to to degrade you whatever but kalau you it's hard it's hard to say macam for me you know i just say but if i were to
to be in that position then maybe i'll have i'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and i will be very depressed full or what~ whatever right
tapi what i i can advice macam
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab they they they don't deserve your friendship they don't
dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau they they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
so go ahead like (um) move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
kau kalau kau macam mana
yes i i still remember our first our first

macam !wow! [lah] you know what i mean
there are some macam kau tahu you know mira filzah tak
okay #mira-filzah# is the (uh) pel~ actress in malaysia
dia punya beauty [kan]
and her personality [oh] my god dia full package you know she got the personality she got the great voice dia punya voice [kan] lemah lembut [kan] and then dia pun lawa dia dia okay
dia tak lawa lawa [tau]
but her lawa is very sweet type you know what i mean macam kau like sedap mata memandang you know what i mean macam you you you can just like look macam
that kind of beauty aku macam respect [sia] aku aku aku tabik
aku tabik
full package full package
!wah! that is good that is the best kalau you've you got the full package you know that you are beauty and then you are humble about it !wah!
that's a good recipe
kalau kalau western pun kau kau handsome tak western kalau western hollywood style
kalau aku
kalau aku siapa [eh]
okay we we okay we we don't know like their personality how [lah] but but there we but we appreciate their dia orang punya beauty
you know what i mean
yes we appreciate kita tak macam
jealous or judge you know like [eh] rambut kau lawa tak tak [eh] no no (uh) when when we judge is because kau punya character
like like you you are you you you are pretty but then you are like very snobbish or like you are very arrogant and that that is when we like macam !alamak! come on [lah] you waste you waste your beauty
why waste your beauty but you know some people don't know that macam
like macam you know what i mean it's it's how you are brought up juga [lah] how does everyone
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay role model to me
in my family i i'll have to say my mum [lah]
my mum is someone that
she's beautiful to me and her character macam yang moth~ macam motherly kind of (uh) you know what i mean of how she brings me out aku
if some if some if someone that
of a role model like !wow! like like macam
macam kita kita we wanna be someone like that you know what i mean
we wanna be someone like that that's that's what i see macam
and and how dia macam ajar like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
although that she's tired but she still
macam ajar then !wah!
(um) tak payah cakap pasal beauty [lah] it's macam dia punya attitude wise you know what i mean
ya so role model
the is that tapi kalau macam if you want to say like like western punya or like macam barat
(uh) pelakon ke apa [kan] then i would say #neelofa#
#neelofa# #neelofa#
is the ya malaysian punya actress host (uh) business woman sebab [kan] (uh) kalau kau tak tahu [kan] dia buat this brand apa yang neelofa punya tudung and then she's she's she's successful sampai pergi (uh)
milan (uh) to the the business berkembang
like real be and and she's very #muslimah# also so i thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
she is a great (uh) host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty i think she's thirty right now thirty one or something dia masih belum berpunya she's still single but her driven of (uh) being that success both dunia and akhirat aku boleh cakap
it's it's like !wah! macam
it's something that macam you god bless you you know
ya i take that as a as a
(uh) role model because some more is a woman ya women and and malaysian and (uh) of a islam (uh) muslim also so ya that's that's a great thing apa tadi kau nak cakap
#wallah#
betul betul betul the i mean the the the life the hereafter [lah]
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
(mm) (mm)
ya tu [oh] my god singapore living ya
(mmhmm)
why ya true true it's hard to find someone that of both that is !wow! i think memang it's very rare no not just both tapi your character pun baik your personality pun baik
those who have that
i have the most the utmost respect the utmost macam
role model [lah] i think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man yang macam you know that you have okay for the guys handsome (uh) bekerjaya and (um) (uh) apa we can cakap apa faithful is it faithful and then (um) of a good personality then
memang susah nak cari but these are the people yang macam you risau tapi again to those yang kita okay kita boleh ran~ ran~ (uh) rumuskan [eh] sebab we got like a few more minutes tapi (um) what i can say is that we shouldn't just (um) we shouldn't just
(uh) okay what's that word [eh] i want to say that this kau tahu [kan] macam kita kita jangan just tengok yang lawa kita just tengok yang handsome you know what i mean we we don't we don't (err) okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance sebab
it will just make you rasa diri you yang kalau you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it it will decrease your self esteem also
so i feel like we atau whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down [what] like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this macam successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself kalau just you know what i mean like
(um) like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
betul you know what i mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just just be of (uh) just be humble be kind i think kalau at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character betul tak
so just ya just be on that don't worry kalau
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same [lah] just human being
ya
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to to directly macam choose to that but slowly slowly i think i think as long as you macam you work hard to become what you want to be and then you you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know bila
whatever you have would be taken away you know what i mean
so then you just be humble [lah] macam
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself [lah]
(mm)
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no (uh) okay how about before that we say
(err) the one thing we regret
you know what i mean macam we get five years back what we we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then baru kita move on to ten years down the road what should we
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
!wow! that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
i tend to look down on myself
very low
macam it it it has come to a point where
macam because of beauty [lah] because of like insecurities and like low self esteem i tend to like
i i think myself ni macam takde value
and it has come to a point where macam whatever people take one for me aku macam mengalah aku like okay give in give in give in cause i felt like
like i should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
to have like prioritise in me sebab i i tend to like
to like macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang [seh]
you know what i mean so it has i should be more macam have that confidence which i i aku tu tu last time [eh] tu last but right now i have i work on that and it's it's i find that
(uh) re~ the respect that you you're given by society that is more
so to the next ya (uh) future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road apa kau punya advice
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
[oh] message to [oh] okay okay
[oh] okay that's good that's good
(mm)
true
true true that is that is important and macam to just have that little selfishness in you so that
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued [lah] in this world into serious [eh] for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
ni is important betul okay
ellen punya ellen put aside [eh] tapi tapi
betul this is my pendirian i know where
and i have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
higher status kau manager your kau they treat me they treat us macam kita ni beginner but we because because of our age then they they they degrade us you you know what i mean so i aku macam to me i would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day aku
have my own (uh) business or i i'm (uh) i'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever [lah] bigger title whatever
treating people nice is you is a must sebab how can you judge sebab i got people around me macam they they judge okay for example
kalau kau punya job (uh) macam (uh) cleaning wise ke apa [kan]
i mean you shouldn't judge
kau why would you (uh) i've seen this this is another topic (err) like for me okay i just share a bit of my intern [eh] i was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because (uh) kita they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like (uh) kuli we are like beginner
kita macam baru masuk industry then they they they bully us they they not just (uh) okay if we if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means i deserve that treatment tapi if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you you treat us like macam kita sampah or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you you you call you are racists i i got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then i felt like [oh] my god you you you you forget where you where you start you kau kau dah lupa diri [kan] this is what happen when kita lupa diri so i i i just want to advice myself that [oh] my god please
#nadia# don't ever lupa diri sebab one day kalau i get that extra money ke i get that extra title ke i might forget about myself and people below me
bad which i don't want that to happen and
because i myself experienced it how bad it is and i know how it feels like to be treated that way so in the future i advise myself that never treat people that way because you will never know bila this (uh) blessing will be taken away from you you know what i mean that's (uh)
that's a wrap
we shall end this okay #mahirah# see you in the next one
alright one okay one two three kita press [eh]
one two three

i don't know if i got tell you before like i keep forgetting i think i told i told or some shit but like me me and this girl right we met in (um)
madrasah [lah] like i think primary two but she was like one year older than us so like is in the same class but she's just one year older then her abang also inside and her abang is like
okay we're like two thousand right she's ninety nine
then like i think her brothers like ninety eight i think but then we are all in the same class so i'm just like so confused like like i ask her like why are you older but in my class then she say [oh] cause like
my parents register late now i didn't know madrasah like if you register late they will put you in primary one so like you can be old and be like in primary one also
then
then i knew
i also don't know [sia] but like that madrasah doesn't exist anymore so like
i don't know
it was like long long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years
but we were in the same class
ya and then after that one day my mom was fetching me right
naik
this is at the you know masjid #ghufran#
the in #tampines#
it's in #tampines# the masjid in #tampines#
ya then after that
then my mom found out like
[oh] (um) this girl her name is
mum is actually
my mum's j_c friend
it's like you and me but like not that close but that we had children then our children are like
friends
ya so like me and we like
grow up together [lah] like ever since like that that whole encounter in like primary two so i was like primary two primary three
[eh] ya ya something like that
ya
ya but they weren't like very close so it's like i think you know [eh] it's like (um)
if me and
[oh] it's like if you and (err)
how to say [ah]
[ah] it's like you and like
(uh) got kids and then your your kids and kids
like become friends
and then like you become closer to
no no no but they're closer than that
i don't know [sia] okay like i give up explaining but like whatever yeah they're like quite close [lah]
then [ah] like you and the other your class punya
yeah so
ya ya ya ya ya then after that
[oh] my god i miss her ya okay anyway then after that right
stop laughing then after that
then (um) so like
we grow up together [lah] from like primary school madrasah then after that we go to like you know like like (um)
they have like the #macam# kids alive teens alive tweens alive
kau tak pergi madrasah [eh]
kau tak pergi madrasah
[oh] my god you andalus child [oh] my god okay so like okay let me explain [ah] like when you go to madrasah right like at at a masjid
they used to have like madrasahs
like
let's say okay let's say you go to a madrasah in (um) masjid right like dulu dulu punya format [kan] is like madrasah #macam#
(err) it's like literal school but just madrasah like you got exam and then like got report card semua then like they band
ya ya okay so basically it's like an andalus [lah] then then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session [lah] yah so like
i think
i think like
the first few years was
(um)
like afternoon session or whatever [lah] that's how i know like that's how i know a lot of people in the in the #tampines# area who are like malays cause like i go to like this masjid punya madrasah and then like
cause you mix class every time [what] so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
(err) the primary school like when i was in primary school right they created this #macam# new syllabus abeh like is everything #macam# in english [ah] english [ah] then like #macam# tak ada exams everything is for like
(uh) you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand malay or anything
ya is yeah yeah so cause dia dia nak #macam# like
(um) integrated society or whatever so they so they like abolished they abolished the madrasah the madrasah punya system so there's no more like exam or anything cause we actually had a chinese girl in our class
and then like she kesian [sia] all the textbooks all in malay abeh dia tak faham like she was just like so confused and the only thing she could can understand ya the only thing she can understand is the arab cause like
the teacher teach in arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in english and the textbook is in arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in malay and then like she just couldn't understand
ya so like
like imagine a literal small inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows chinese
apa kau okay maybe cause like he learn cause like n_s what then n_s
like s_c_d_f banyak melayu [kan] but then i don't know [lah]
yeah
you know that time we go to his house for raya right then his nenek ask siapa tu then after that he just shake shake he just like !huh! he just like shake his (um)
like shoulders then i ask you understand malay [meh] then he said
(err) i don't know [lah] but i just anyhow just give her response then she just [oh] okay then i'm just like how you speak to your grandmother like that then then after that he say [oh] [ah] usually when i go to my grandma's house right she will give me food then i'm just like (um) sedap sedap sedap
yeah it's basically ya food related
i don't know i don't even know if he knows lawa
but he listens to malay songs now
tak faham [sia] aku tak aku pun tak faham bro just don't ask me
okay so so this girl right okay the chinese girl is named then this girl she
(um)
she did she got transferred out like after primary three she tahan from primary one all the way to primary three bro then after primary three right when they introduced the alive thing then she transferred to alive so there's like kids alive tweens alive teens alive then youth alive so it's like technically like
(um)
kindergarten then primary school then secondary school all the way until like you finished poly or whatever [lah] then
then after we finish our madrasah
then me and went to
teens alive
[eh]
is it teens alive [oh] ya ya ya secondary school is teens alive ya then we go to teens alive right together with her brother and then like coincidentally
(err) her mum said [oh] i put her in the sunday class cause like confirm secondary school saturday nak kena balik sekolah punya so i just put her in sunday so she can go on sunday then my mum was like yeah yeah i put her in sunday also so like we just ended up sticking through like four plus
two

ya she was like
[eh] ni blah blah blah blah mat
(um) mat selenger blah blah blah blah blah
ya then after that everything then like [oh] my gosh then she told me this like funny story also
like when they were dating right like he wanted to watch a movie like they wanted to go watch a movie after school then like he took a bus
from his house woodlands i think all the way to
s_r kat mana [ah] #serangoon# [ah]
[ah] then he took a bus to like kat luar s_r_j_c [lah]
then he said [dah] [dah] [lah] he lambat for one hour you know
and then like he say he nak terberak
then she say how about you go berak first then you meet me then he say tak nak tak nak tak nak cause like nanti lambat then she just like (uh) okay then he ask
so ya then after that he say
(uh) your school punya toilet boleh masuk tak cause like he want to berak kat dia punya sekolah then i'm just like
berak kat kedai kopi [jer] [lah]
[kan]
ya so like the funniest the funniest thing is right he like
the the funniest thing right he keep begging and begging and begging her to let him go inside the school to berak like as if like she's a security guard or something then after that he dude he terkencit kat dalam his seluar bro
yeah
(mm)

uh-huh
[oh] my god ya you know (um)
[ah] ru~ nya adik [kan] i think like when we were in j_c nya adik was like dating someone who's like
much much older i think she was like i think

and then
and then like (err)
they they started a joint bank account cause like nak kahwin
[a'ah]

bank accounts cause we know we're gonna get married and that one is like the money for them to use like #macam#
no then they broke up
dude like they didn't even last like more than one year i don't even understand
like he halfway masuk jail
then abeh like so like while wait so like i think like half of the relationship right was her waiting for him to keluar jail abeh [dah] nak [dah] nak
[dah] nak [dah] nak like almost one more month before he nak masuk
he nak he nak keluar then she broke up with him over like this like #macam# you know the letter they write to like prisoners ya then she wrote letter to him
and then say like [oh] (err) i'm breaking up with you cause like (um) i met someone else then i just like the
the fuck

is it fun intern kat rumah
bukan ke a lot of distraction like that
really
[oh] i don't like to work from home especially
ya so i work from home for macam
about one month
then i feel so like terkurung dalam bilik and the wifi is not strong
so that's why i rather work kat
i rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different [lah]
ya
how long how long
only like macam about two weeks
ya only two weeks dua minggu
duduk kat rumah and you know what i don't even do in my room you know i do at the living room
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
that's why i tadi i ask you to take a picture of your your work~ working setting
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
that is me in the office kalau kat rumah i will just like duduk depan depan t_v then my laptop
then my drink then how con~ how how is that
effective ya
(mm) it's not at all also
ya ke
[oh] my god and the
and he he is used to that
[oh] make the home macam office like that [ah]
[oh] then what your wifi around your houses [eh] around your houses around the house macam good [ah]
(mm)
and your room
[oh] okay
ya [lah] then how you do your work [seh] macam gitu
like because your work from home pakai zoo~ pakai pakai apa microsoft or
or
ya the google hangouts you they you never break out [meh] macam never lag or what
[orh]
(mm) okay so the experience is quite
okay [lah] for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
ya so now buat apa
back to school already right
[oh]
[oh] one more month !wow!
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
!wow! you got
two months of holiday [ah] not bad [ah] you
(mm)
[oh] you've been working part time kerja apa [eh] cause i saw on your instagram you work night shift all
(uh huh)
like what
why
but you are still working [what] okay [lah] tu means you [dah] survive sikit
spent too much on what
[oh] how much you earn [ah] that that that job
(mm)
hundred per
[oh]
ninety nine
per night
!wow!
okay
kerja apa why you never explain
[oh] pack apa
makeup stuff
then you work alone or what not alone right ada orang lain juga [kan]
[orh]
kerja kat mana kat warehouse [eh]
#tampines#
!huh! then how you travel [seh]
ibu cik nya rumah
i~ #yishun# correct [orh] so you got straight bus there [lah]
technically [lah] a bit [lah]
lama
compared to staying at hou~ [ah] compared to where you are now until
(uh) at ibu cik house [lah] the difference right
(mm) okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience [what] you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
one week and then you cannot tahan
(uh)
it's just too fast paced [ah] macam (mm)
ya one day berapa
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two k [lah]
(mm)
!wow! not bad [ah] you q_c
do you know you know in cause i did packing job also but the best
(uh) the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the f~ in the emtire human line
if you are at the first first person [ah] then paling senang
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up [what]
[ah] [kan] so if you are the first person it's the easiest job [ah] but quality check a bit hard [ah]
quality check and need to buat cepat cepat then that's crazy [ah]
i did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
macam from
(err) we start at about nine [kan] then we need to
pack for [eh] no we start at about [oh] macam lapan setengah then lapan setengah all the way until pukul dua belas
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so i usually need to scoop the [ah] the rice is either you
(uh) scoop the kuah then after that you #kiap# the container then you
then total the whole day must i don't know what's the target [lah] but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
[ah] pack kat kitchen [ah] so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because panas [lah] then when you #kiap# the container then you also will #kiap# your finger [lah]
bla bla [lah] then lepas balik
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person [ah] so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
kat mana kat
the industrial area at #woodlands# there [lah]
(mm) so they needed manpower (uh) so they asked manpower from my company so so ya [lor]
(mm)
yup my current wor~ company [lah] so this this this the the the the workplace that i work for
i mean the the packing place yang i kerja is (um)
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them [lah] (mm)
(mm)
ya [lor] so that's why i whe~ when i ask you how how was your experience for the packing i understand [lah] what it means when you say fast paced
express gila [lah] especially when you do quality check how to quality check cepat cepat [seh]
so that's how tired you are then now kerja apa [seh] kerja malam
[oh]
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience i mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can [lah]
no [ah] you will learn [one] usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
like few months ago sekarang baru dia dapat
and the pay is quite good [lah]
three k [lah] three k for i don't know how many weeks of working [lah] so ya
ya so kerja apa
[oh]
kenapa
[oh]
so you what you
[oh] okay okay can
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
then kenapa you leave
[oh]
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest pa~ packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup [one]
then besok buat apa the pharmaceutical one the pharmacy [one]
you just sign up only
(mm) then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
[oh]
[oh] but night shift though
(mm)
okay then kerja ini kat mana
[oh] dekat [lah]
technically [ah] what time start
pukul sembilan eight thirty
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight a_m
so eight to eight (err) eight to eight [ah]
[oh]
okay [lor] can [lah] then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
(mm) i understand
how's you and andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
(mm) !ee! i ask you first how's you and andy
you've been closer right every time sekarang i always saw you and
you and andy on instastory
that's why selalu macam spend time sama sama
dia pun holiday ke
[oh] okay okay okay okay
[oh]
that's why you guys spend time together
(mm)
ya that's why that's why macam selalu when i see your instastory macam [eh]
andy andy andy but then got one time no andy at all
kenapa
apasal [seh]
[oh] i mean
[oh] gitu [eh] macam mata merah [ah] kirakan
like jealous ke like [oh] i have a boyfriend but you don't like (err)
[oh]
but you always prioritize your work from what i see also
you i think you know how to balance so they have no say
ya ya ya it's how but good thing andy faham [lah] that's the thing
understand each other
meet tapi masih berbual [kan]
like on whatsapp or at least berbual on the phone
good [lah] good [lah]
(mm)
not talk
(mm)
well good [lah] good [lah] at least
in in this relationship the two of you
kau orang dua faham each other the needs and the the wants
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
bagus [ah]
ya how long already [ah]
what
three years
not bad [ah] three years [ah] this is this the longest
(mm)
i actually forgot who is he but ya i understand
okay i cannot recall
i okay okay i think i remember i think i remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay [lah] actually i don't know if you realise anything on my instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you li~ like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya [lah] because his side he don't make it he don't
show it dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan so
(uh) his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya (mm)
ya so sometimes when i see you and andy i'm like !hais! [eh] cause at least sometimes andy will show about you then you will show about andy that kind of thing
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is macam
(err) me and him are dealing shitty stuff now [lah] so ya
together and individually so macam okay [ah] let's say [ah] so [ah] cause sekarang dia [dah] o_r_d right
do you know what he's working now
(mm) you have no idea you never follow him on instagram [ah]
[oh]
[oh] that recent stories dia tak appear [lah] that kind of thing okay okay
cause [ah] dia sekarang work as financial adviser
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya insuran~ so he's an insurance agent
so under a_i_a but (uh) under a_i_a there's a sister company called
m_f_a_g
so (err) basically how to plan your financi~ how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
(mm) so okay [lah]
(uh) you ask me kenapa dia kerja ni pasal one day he was just scrolling through facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and dia dapat [ah] itu [jer]
[ah] so so he invest i mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified f_a
so sekarang dia boleh go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start s~ selling insurance or any plans
(mm) so that is his career so his career now [kan] dia [ah] dia
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people [kan]
ya so you will meet new people of many age~ of different ages (uh) different character
(uh) gender and everything else so macam
okay [lah] i get his point where i get where he's coming from
so (um)
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
i
kita is fourth we're this october we're coming the fourth year already
fourth year in the relationship
ya ya so [ah] so macam macam mana [eh]
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his n_s pun pernah happen i don't know [eh]
so macam this thing happen for the third time already
okay so okay [ah] now i explain to you what happen
so (uh) basically dia dia bilang me ha~ hans punya type punya orang is dia he's very honest
so dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa his perasaan everything to me
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me [ah] [oh] (um)
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
so at first bila dia cakap macam gitu i thought
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like (uh) means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing i thought that was it you know
tapi it's not explore means dia nak explore dia nak jumpa orang baru without feeling (err) bad
get it so means [ah] means [ah] like for example i'm hans and
you are the first the new person that i met right
then i don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about #lina# that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so i told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his n_s
his n_s dia ada group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for s_a_f
[ah] so that is the first time it happened
so when he met new group of girls then tiba tiba dia macam
!wow! macam okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay [lah] sakit hati tu sakit hati [lah] tapi at least
[ah] it d~
saki~ it it did hurt me but it was the first time so macam okay first time let it go that kind of thing
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
ya but that someone that v_c lady dia macam
not interested [lah] because that v_c girl also have a boyfriend
vol~
no v_c is (err) volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for s_a_f
[ah]
so
okay so when it first happened i take it like okay never mind
okay i do have my emotional (uh) breakdown [ah] i mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his n_s
dia macam sampai berbual on dia macam my me~ no [ah] like
memang dia o~ they know each other on phone i mean they know their phone numbers so
hans until talk to her on the whatsapp [lah] like
like made a move [lah] macam message [lah] message the perempuan nak nak know better
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating [lah] but but but but
i don't i don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay i let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct [a'ah]
so during n_s is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
kelakar [kan]
[kan] (uh)
ya
this is what i'm trying to say [lah] don't know why until i hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
it's just dia punya tiba tiba the way dia layan me the way he he behave around me change
macam in terms of not good [lah] macam macam he he he he tell me things like (err) i want to explore he don't want to feel
like limited talking to new people
get it because in this in dia punya line of job dia akan jumpa
jumpa orang baru
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
betul [lah] ya [lah] professional that part it is [lah] but at the same time dia nak
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is (um)
(err) way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the yo~ he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say [ah] this is me [ah] this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
at any point of time in his life dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang better than me that kind of thing
i said that thing tu juga i said macam i ca~ i say to him [ah] i also can say the same thing to you [what] but i choose to focus what is in front of me
i said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
faham tak
let's say if i leave like for example
if i leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit [lah]
so ya !hais!
no i don't know because
from the start of the relationship i got even i pernah bilang you [what] bila kita nak
together remember we had this night calls
i tell you that hans really want this relationship to to end up (uh) like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why i'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me [ah] if you ask me now why are you still with him
then i i then i will reply you i also don't know
so ya [lah]
like that's why when you things like (uh) on twitter will say this and that right you w~ you wait sometimes you need to leave you mu~ you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
[ah] i've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know [lah]
boleh [lah] i mean you nak comment pun comment [lah] because honestly
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
ya and there's no there's no end to it macam there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion macam do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with li~ like endless
ya so so macam
that's why i was i was quite impressed with how you andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but i cannot do on my own thing because i'm already
i've already so called shaped my life around him get it
macam okay
macam dependent [lah]
not exactly [lah]
bukan macam okay so
i don't see
i don't see other things i don't see other parts of my life without him get it
ya [ah] so macam my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
is i don't have my own like self goal
okay
i got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
it's stupid [lah] tapi macam
yes sure up to you s~ you can go ahead and share
(mm)
(mm)
but you you do try to recover after that right
(mmhmm)
(mm) ma~ [ah] that's the word make up
(mm)
ya [lah] faham [lah]
ya [lah]
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
[kan]
dia belum n_s [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] faham [lah] but at least now kau orang at least ada ada so called same goal in the relationship right
(mm) (mm)
with him
(mm) at least at least a goal with him [kan]
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
get it macam
we like i say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like (err) am i getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe i don't know but
for me now with han is really macam
a total switch a total change of goals which is now tak match
ya so now i'm just like
(uh) like that ya so
i'm taking day by day but really i feel that at the end of the day maybe
i don't know [lah] i really don't know i don't know whether kita are compatible or what already [lah] because dia memang [dah] ada other mindset juga
i
everyt~
met his parents
spend time yes tapi macam other stuff to talk about the future no [lah] because dia punya parents obviously is supportive of hans
han~ his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time hans' father also said don't make her just like a
like a like a person like like a gundu like that tunggu macam macam
macam badut gitu th~ but the (uh)
!haiya! ya [lah] the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether i'm hurt and stuff
it has been weeks already [ah] so if i cry now also macam
it's just tears [eh] macam really legit [sia] so macam ya [lah]
so well i'm just updati~ updating you my relationship status so kalau we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no hans already now you understand [lah]
tak apa (uh) it's okay not to make assumption [ah] but
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
kalau kita so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
my my type my type right
my type right is if i break up with somebody i want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
(mm) [eh]
like
[kan] [kan] s~ so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him o~ with him right
(mm)
ya so but this thing is special case as~ i told hans the same thing if i ever break up with you i will totally cut my ties with you then dia macam disagree [ah] dia cakap
di~ (uh) (hmm) no he i don't know dia cakap (um) why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just (um) be friends
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so macam
if i cut ties it means i have to sacrifice in terms of kalau dia orang hang out and there's hans i might
i might think twice of hanging to hang out macam gitu (mm)
so far so far during this period right
where (uh) like
i (mm) only just now i met him [lah] after like a week tak jumpa
but few days ago when my friend ajak me hang out then i asked ada siapa ad~ kalau ada hans i say to them i tak nak join
(mm)
so ya i'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that i've shared there's no bad guy
in this story [lah] okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because i i'm getting hurt
for no reason i could actually just leave
ya i could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants i can i can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is i choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see i am aware [sia] ch~
(err) like i don't know a week ago maybe
(mm) tapi ya ini susah [ah] susah
he's
i know i understand
!hais!
!hais!
no
i want to tell but i don't know how to tell i want to tell also but i don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
i i hint only [lah] i hint to my mother only [lah]
macam
she she sense it [lah] so macam (mm)
i don't like to tell cause i just don't want to (uh)
the group of friends yang i bilang pun macam
i think i tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why i'm feeling like this during work time so ya [loh]
so this issue macam i really tak nak bilang orang but
on my instagram i think people can like [oh] okay hans and #lina# is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
(mm)
ya tak [lah] i think pasal i'm just too macam
too f~
i have fallen for him too hard that (uh) now i cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two masih boleh jumpa orang lain and stuff tapi
i still stick i can say that i'm quite a loyal person [lah] but
ya [ah] so ya [dah] itu [jer] [lah]
that's my that's that's what i'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my instastory and more to green colour right
[ah] it's just me expressing my emotions
(mm) and and now i'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
!huh!
ya it affect
kadang kadang [seh] dalam kerja so macam if i don't have any ideas right like for example if i zone out [ah]
then suddenly benda tu come in
then when benda tu come in i need to talk to that guy then when i need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when tadi you bilang me [kan] [ah] what time you sleep and stuff right
when it first happened i've been going home late from work
so i left work i left office at about twelve
twelve a_m tahu
sometimes i habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan
lepas tu i'll just hang out talk i just like (err) but sometimes i have zoom meetings so macam
okay i do zoom meetings at at the office then i just chill then wait a bit more then i baru balik that kind of thing then once i go home
i'll just knockout [ah] so knockout about maybe sometimes if i decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him i'll sleep like i'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but i sleep as late as three but the next day i have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing [lah]
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
tidur pukul tiga bangun pukul lapan
then
then it affected my work in terms of productivity [lah] i lupa benda i forget things i forgot what to do and shit
and i really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so (um)
so ya but i'm catching up on my sleep already [lah] so that is good enough
(hmm) ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand [lah]
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya i think i don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
[ah] your rumah macam tukar hari hari [seh]
ya ya ya ya
then ra~ ray~ before raya i think i went to your house once also different theme then raya also different theme
then sekarang
ya your kitchen got the vine right i saw your instastory what
cree~ busy [seh]
it's only your room tak involved [lah]
ya i can see that
but at least you got a working space [seh] that is good that's what i need [eh]
but the thing is i don't like to work in my bilik pasal wifi tak strong legit tak strong
ya (mm) me an~ me and my adik already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
we just need a different type of (um) router ya
because this wifi sucks you okay for example [ah] kalau sekarang you co~ go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
ya
[kan] that's why i rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
i always do outside kalau tak i'll just do at other places
(mm)
ya means we need an addi~ additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the t_v
so macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi to my room
how many wifi you have at home
[oh] you have two
one is at
(mm) so you are connected to your
parents' [one]
(mm) patutlah boleh [lah] gitu ya then i need to pasang one more [loh]
(mm)
ya
tak ada [lah] but
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know i
i now conduct workshops via zoom
(mm)
just now punya meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy [kan] no it's macam gini so you kerja macam biasa
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got zoom meeting zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
like on the same track check in apa task you buat [ah]
macam gitu [lah] penat [seh] so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay i tell you now [ah]
(err)
mo~ i and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one (err) some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at m_s_f to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
they also have still to do they still need to do their kerja kerja biasa
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
(mm)
that is why at night we need to do meeting pasal everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
[ah]
(uh)
(mmhmm)
macam gitu [lah] ya ya ya correct correct ya
no jus~ just now [one] is because i had to do a trai~ a mini training for this up~ [ah] tomorrow's training
ya
(err) at pukul sepuluh no worry [lah] can can
ya so ya [lor]
then anyways so i am starting a~ another job again cause i was just
i was like quite happy that i i'm out of the community club
then on tuesday i am back i'm going to m_s_f
[ah] ya is to i'm going to do some homeless job you know as in (err)
(err) inspe~ macam jadi inspection macam inspect the homeless [ah] i don't know [lah] apa [lah]
merepek gila [ah] because i mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
pay to maintain the mon~ the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just covid things [ah] it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
(uh)
(mm)
[oh] so you your pay macam mana bila internship
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
!huh!
your i_t_e is
!wow! ya it's just it's just poly things poly memang
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why i never ex~ like you get to experience i_t_e internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
is it tak tahu [lah] sekali five hundred juga [eh]
as an intern
it's okay [lah] you already pass through the (err) internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
[ah] then go ahead bro ambil [jer]
being what broke [oh] you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go
september ap~
ya you're graduating april right
ya then after that you can decide bila you nak continue degree or
ya
or you can take a year break and work then go and study or you can study part time and work up to you
you're you're the type yang boleh belajar [what] i'm not so
it's your choice
(mm)
but what degree you want to take same similar or
similar as your the things you are doing now or
or you want to try something new
business [ah]
(mm) explore your options ya
ya [eh] not bad [seh] you went through like different certificates [seh]

me
no need [lah] [ah] no~ now i'm like thinking nak ambil h_r ke tak [ah] tapi tak apa [lah] no need [ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] that is because they have the knowledge
they don't just like assume [oh] i am from h_r
then they treat you like shit ya
ya i'm thinking of that [lah] but tengok [ah]
i got no motivation so ya
okay
[oh] [eh] [eh] (err)

talking so slowly and plus dia start the lesson lambat
by fifteen minutes and today i decided to wake up earlier so i won't be late
but dia datang lambat
ya he started fifteen minutes later [what]
(uh huh) because some people actually know how to be on time you know

i take a like you know those people keep taking the aesthetic boomerangs so i try to i try to be aesthetic as possible but i'm just
cannot make it [lah] cause it's just me
and then he will !wah! tempat ni kat mana [seh]

he said it in malay and then
no tapi actually dia punya his malay is
his the way he converse in in malay is okay [lah] but it's quite limited
but i don't know why he suddenly replied in malay but (uh) (um)

(err) he like he usually he will start off the conversation by talking about school
so dia macam tanya [eh] this week intern apa [eh] this this week is what week of internship like as if he tak ada classmate nak tanya kenapa dia kena tanya aku and then
[oh] and then (err) i will reply [ah] this week this week twenty then the next week he will ask me this week with apa untuk intern

tak tak tak (uh) this one he asked me during the week of internship
while kita tengah masih intern not after

if he was actually trying if he actually ada motive [kan]
dia tahu [pe] aku ada mata air so why would he even try
i told no i didn't tell you i was overthinking about it
and then my my replies to him
my replies to him are like so boring like literally if when one talks to me they will just tidur
exactly i am the most boring person in the world and i aku tak suka social interaction
what
when when do you even reply or message me on instagram there is like the no
no no you only always reply if i message something inside the instagram [ah] direct message group with #jannah# and all that
kalau if
[ha] i don't want to talk about this anyways back to the story back to the point

then he said !alah! university kalau university pun (uh) he will go to plymouth
apasal you like he is it !ee!
k k kau suka dia
no i i have a resting mingles face you know
tapi but we are the same height [what]
okay okay okay let let's not talk about this let's not talk about this it's a very sensitive topic okay
[ah] ya ya can you please tell me what happened i want to know nak tahu
notice apa why [ah] why [leh]
ya ya you don't have much friends
what what
!huh! siapa yang reject kau [sia] i mean you're like damn pretty
okay i want to know what happen
you went on a date with someone and i didn't even know
aku feel so betrayed
it was just an outing sure [lah]
(uh) west siders what is it with you guys
jauh [pe] orchard is so far
kena~ kenapa dia block you babe
maybe it's the jokes that you told him
pasal your jokes can be quite
kau tahu the wing wing joke
or is it had no [ah] there was very no offence stupid
exactly kau tahu it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny tak kelakar pun
ya
is it is it macam blind date like you
just did not know him or kau [dah] nampak muka dia and then you decide to go on a date dengan dia
it's always the cute guys yang buat kita orang macam like this
i think i think you kau ada cakap telegram [oh]
ya he was practically ghosting kau kesian
it is what it is
ya
actually [ah] i have one calon for you
and he is he is actually mak aku punya friend punya anak
so like but we kind of grow up together [lah] so sejak kecil until besar
tapi [kan] the thing about him is the thing about him is dia pendiam so
[eh] no dia macam pendiam with certain people that's what i notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so i think it's like secucuk for you [lah]
no but you like you like guys who are older what you don't like guys who are younger than you right
adik-adik ya stop it [sia]
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then i know kau suka lelaki yang boleh fight dengan kau
but he's the only candidate that aku tahu [ah] yang i can recommend to you
no i i told you [what] he is my mum's friend punya anak
so like i kenal him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends sejak dulu so (mm)
(mm)
you you like guys yang suka bantah is it
i don't know
(um)
ya i faham i faham
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
but that kind of person susah nak cari [seh] because like nowadays guys are just
the most meanest guys are like very very mean and like the most nicest guys are like too nice
bye bye and (uh huh)
he's more on the mean side but there's like
no he's only mean to other people
i don't know you tell me is he is he like really kasar dengan kau
(hmm) i know actually now right is actually so hard to find a partner that is truly down to earth for you and really down
to to like date you and then to kahwin with you
act~ actually (uh) after the truth or dare game right i thought dia
tak suka aku because like i feel like maybe
he feels malu because he had to do it so from then on macam it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that dia just start to tak suka me
that's what i felt ya because that time when you know after that they ordered mac right
and [ah] i wanted a straw or something so i said [oh] !alah! can you pass me a straw i don't know why he like he just ignored me
then i am like wasn't the tak [oh] is he not at me
ya [lah] tu
she loves loves me
!huh! i don't think it was love yet because at that point of time i think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know kau tahu
dia masih berbual-bual dengan ex dia [seh] ya
ya and then [ah] he was actually low key hoping to get back with his ex but then his ex was just like [eh] i don't know
ya
yes yes there was the story then [ah] you know then after that i teman him to go for one office takraw
punya sessions just to watch [lah] and then we were walking to the sports hall abeh i think kawan dia saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then [ah] kawan dia upload to
snapchat and then [eh] his ex nampak [lah] then
(err) his ex message him and ask i thought i thought there was still something between us
yes dia playing hard to get but then she's also like macam
not sure about him but also playing hard to get macam mana
so dia orang dah break up [lah]
exactly
like
exactly there is my point that is what i mean
but
ya ya
[ah] aku just tak suka when like (uh) apa tu girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend punya kawan i mean just make it clear [lah] that
you guys just kawan and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what kau mean by that ular ular kepala dua is it
what
it's not just
how will wait so the guy is gay
[orh] okay okay [dah]
for years
but why would the girl buat such a thing to the mata air [sia]
i mean i don't know that guy
so aku rasa it's okay if you want to buka aib dia to me because i don't even know who he is so
(mm)
wait so does that mean at some point kau pernah suka lelaki tu on
[oh]
(um)
ya
like kau orang are just platonic friends [lah]
the mata air dia just have issues [lah] i think because remember remember when aku used to have issues dengan #yasmin#
ya
i don't even know why and then now kita we're friends so like look [ah] the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference entah [lah]
speaking of the office you know my sister [ah] i told my kakak about (uh) all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
maybe (err) your boss should hire a cameraman and then like cameramen will like every time when there is a fight in the office
the cameraman kena zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then (uh) dia akan (uh) bend into like the people around dia punya reaction that will be so funny and then the title should (err) the office two point o
ya
well anyways i didn't tell you about one of the main drama in my intern office
so basically [kan] [ah] logistics and accounts just cannot get along for some freaking reason and then
aku is the middleman because i'm the intern and i'm supposed to buat kerja for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they macam how is the company going to maju right and then
and then so i have to be the middleman so for finance i have to scan (err) purchase order and invoices
and then after i no i will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance habis tu
[ah] after i scan and then i will pass to the finance person [lah] and then mesti perempuan finance ni pun cakap
asyik pass kat aku [seh] this one you pass back to (err) si logistics dulu then i'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is dah kerja kau [pe]
(mm) it's like macam as if they make it look like macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal
they are the ones that making kerja aku susah you know so frustrating
(mmhmm)
(um) i i get what you mean though because macam [oh] at n_u_s
speaking of work also you not because of the covid kita kena work from home
so i have to bring back my laptop and usually kat kerja i will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so kecil dari desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and plus i'm still new to the system
and then [oh] and then aku punya boss every damn day dia akan suruh kita on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
(mm) i mean [ah] almost hari-hari [kan] my boss will tanya everyone [oh] what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
macam every damn day hari-hari nine thirty a_m sharp zoom meeting without fail dia akan tanya
[ah] my office hours is nine thirty to six thirty
[ah] you end earlier [what]
about one hour
lima belas minit
ya
from
(um) #kim# #yam# road nak pergi #sengkang# okay [lah] and then plus you know bila nak pergi and balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit [oh] my goodness
so tiring
ya so depressing tu turbine intern so !huh!
what topic though
j j
[oh]
#jannah#
!wah! so jangan [lah]
is it #jannah# dari mata air
kau tak [eh]
who who who do you have in mind to be #jannah# mata air
but
honestly i cannot wait until #jannah# kahwin though because like
i will feel so happy for her macam yes
i know right
any guy yang dapat #jannah# is a very very lucky guy
is it
no because you kau tahu [pe] i don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
!hey! what do you mean by that
no my cousins
sepupu aku they are either lagi tua or they're younger than me
so like i don't think #jannah# will be interested in dia orang
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have [ah] girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and i knew #jannah# tak suka lelaki yang younger than her
so like scrap that
it has this is a very hard thing to do
[kan] saya ni like #shaza# really shaza pula jap i mean you deserve the best also but #jannah# also like deserves the best
why (ugh)
we
we all deserve the best
feminism and empowerment [oh] my god speaking of empowerment do you hear about the u_s elections
it's so merepek
did you know did you know that kanye west is really running for president
it's like americans don't even take dia orang punya elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
ya
you know actually actually [ah] u_s should take notes from singapore and make voting
a compulsory thing and not give them a choice because that i see
orang dekat u_s dia orang like [oh] have you registered to vote
i mean you have a choice to register or not
ya but
to get whether you get involved or not in politics
it's your masa masa hadapan that you are thinking of it's the masa depan masa hadapan of your children
so like
you get what i mean right
yes
[oh]

woke culture has been like taking over singapore punya twitter and it's really really annoying especially those influencers

ya call for equity
ya cause it's like
no no no no not not financial management it's (uh)
macam
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time [ah] seek catering to their needs better it's like macam for example you're looking over fence [ah] this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
these (uh) but this other person cannot see so if you give both of them
ya actually i know
aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut okay nevermind

it's the same [ah] the makan all like sama the menu and everything all
[a'ah]

i think normal platter like say chicken chop [ah] only four fifty or what
with two sides
(uh)
what's that chicken chop
(mm)
(uh)
tapi
ya ya ya that's the thing about school (um) food i feel even if the price they say not say
(um) cheap or what right my portion is like still worth way more worth than what you are getting outside
[oh] it's too much [ah]
(mm)
no no they don't
ya ya ya
this is where kat koufu
[oh] sebelah japanese shop that [one] [ah]
[oh] okay i think i know i know but i never eat never tried it
[oh]

[ha] play [ah] more you can play more pub games [ah] i feel bots like no point [ah]
because all the toxic (uh) opponents or teammates right
it's because your op~ team is terrible that's why you feel like opponent is good
sometimes serious [ah] especially the filipinos and the pinoys in dota !wah!
damn toxic man they like i don't know what they doing most of the time
then they will just start blaming you all these kind stuff but entertainment also [ah]
[eh] walls aku merepek [sia] like try to download all sampai sekarang tak boleh pun

[ah]
ya ya ya
that's a like chakra
(uh huh)

(uh huh)
[orh] so like leceh [ah]
[ah]
then after that you got to wait until the thing will recharge or what you gotta hunt for the reason the resin
[oh] i see i see
but like
ya ya
so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
(mm)
ya right right right
the best so far
one of [ah]
[ah] better than runescape
[ah]
ya confirm laze [ah] after a while
ya ya
maybe [lah] perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but i think they earning a lot [sia] this game it's like available on all platform except like console [lah]
console also ada
!wah! gila that means like it's quite a lot [ah] this
you can whale on #genshin# also
(uh huh)
!huh! !wah! this crazy [ah]

so you think this [one] more
you know money intensive or maple
[ah]
do you even spent money on games
[oh] tapi m_l punya skin is like one-time kind of thing right like you purchased once then you can use all the way
[orh] okay ya okay makes sense
(uh) berapa yang
[orh]
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
[oh]
ya ya ya
[eh] semalam you tengok bola the #bayern# dengan #atletico-madrid# game
[oh] why [eh]
how i know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
but the game gerek [ah] the game
#bayern# very sick
ya ya okay
ya i know stop back forth back forth [ah]
(hmm) ya each to its own [ah]
esok buat apa
[ha] when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
!fuh!
when's the last time when's the last time you went
[ah]
berapa lama [eh] kena book in advance
[oh] so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
(err) they you know kasi chance (uh) to (uh) other people [ah]
cause your name busuk already bin masli</p1> banned
and then esok tak ada apa-apa teman me [ah] pergi tengok kro~ (uh) what's this kerusi
[eh] rasa
can [ah] try try
you know the apol chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like secret lab then royale ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then apol
ya here it quite prominent [ah] and like
they really build up their name [eh] you know like
those dota players e_a players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) secret lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands i would say
pricing mahal secret lab paling murah four nine nine [sia]
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise i mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality p_u leather like they add in all the other i don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why i'm deciding [eh] i want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the secret lab chair
than [eh] apol is three nine eight
ya
similar tapi (uh) apa ni secret lab ada five years warranty apol dua year [jer]
so i'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya ya
no [ah] it's like covered a few stuff like you know (um) for secret lab they have this tear protection thing so where like if the material kalau terkoyak-koyak [kan] kopek-kopek then after that
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
tu [ah]
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
i
tapi air tumpah tak damage apa you can just straightaway lap the thing then the water is gone already
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is it is
ya
tu
ya aku nampak i saw that [one] basuh the lantai then all the stains all just come out right
that's true [ah] coke like damn sweet [eh] i i'm not a fan of coke [ah] it's too sweet for me
[ah]

(mm) seasons the blue colour [one] right
hijau [eh]
that's the green tea ice lemon tea [eh] is it
ya that [one] not bad because dia punya ice lemon tea flavour in that tak tak as strong [ah]
sugar
ya
ya i agree i agree
[eh] wait seasons
[oh] i think i got i think i never try seasons (uh) peach tea before [eh]
[oh] no i don't think so [eh] the i can't recall
maybe [ah]
[eh] so bila nak beli ni table tennis punya racket paddle
(mm)
(uh)
!alamak! pergi club room [ah] you cukai the paddles
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
[oh] like as in you just lepak tak belajar this kind of stuff
because you got the mindset [lah] like you know there's a
relax corner in school
potong kaki [ah]
ya
ya true true
(uh)
i also finding [ah] i want find like (uh) you know like stable kind of part-time
tapi cafe
ya exactly cafe semua gaji like they don't pay you that well then at most kurang-kurang
and nine dollars [ah] if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want f&b you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time i told you marche
then like a bit more established kind of (um) eatery
but banquet malas [sia] bro banquet kerja lama kena diri then like it's not my thing [ah]

ya ya #sheikh# ya okay i tell you about banquet the #sheikh# and this another friend [kan] dorang kerja banquet lepak [lah] because dorang dah kerja lama so they got a lot of seniority
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so this #sheikh# and the my this friend right step manager dorang tak buat kerja just like manage them tell them what to do then lepak so basically for like let's say maybe ten hours of work right they only do
dua dua jam tiga jam
tapi dapat gaji for the whole thing then they just lepak makan
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already [ah] that's why

it's like what's the valorant

okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like pubg but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
i plan to but then tengok [ah] dulu need to work [ah] then like don't have much time to play games this [one] now dota also i don't really play that much
ya
p_s five i don't know [ah] i never see since the pre-order part
i think no [ah] like they still publish [ah] it's just that it's out of stock on the main (uh) website if i'm not mistaken
gila gila [kan] right
pasal kau dulu budak-budak town east [kan] p_s one p_s two
[ah] but you don't actually own you didn't own one right
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
[oh] i understand they control with the time guard [ah] ada time limit all these
ya
ya ya funny [ah]
!fuh!

i see
but all the while you did well not
above average [ah]

[orh]
yang gemuk punya [kan] bukan yang slim
[eh] don't terasa [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] wasted
okay [ah] p_s_p was short-lived also [ah]
it
it's good good actually i quite surprised the thing (err) like just die down like i thought it will be a continuation but
i think p_s and
say again
ya no it's because the sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that [ah] p_s_p vita
[ah] vita vita
p_s vita that that
part of i mean that that series was like the downfall i feel
then just nice d_s came up also then people just i don't know actually i quite surprised why d_s became popular
because of like pokemon and what
tapi macam tak necessary [kan] dia punya touch screen and all
i think
(mm) i think the main appeal is just because d_s can support the
(uh) what's pokemon games people literally buy d_s just to play pokemon games
ya even switch also switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya i don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
macam minecraft [ah]
but it looks like minecraft is just i don't feel appealed in playing the minecraft kind of games
ya ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick sick
or is it just to garner the support of like i don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad
that's why every single move they made it's all got (uh) impact they want to achieve you know
!duh!
(uh) not !duh! [lah] but like possible
fortnite aha bro [eh] you never play fortnite [ah]

no plasma it's plasma something [ah] i forgot what's the full name tapi the game play macam
this you (uh) you and your friends are like ghosts investigators or something
then korang (uh) kat korang trapped in a room [kan] then after that kena cari clues on how to solve a crime or something like that
then like ghosts will just appear all that kind of stuff

just
in school
one very funny fellow [ah]
ya
then look at him now [ah]
family man
!hais! time pass by so fast [sia]
today
nothing much [ah] i tadi cause i got sekolah [what]
so it's just school from home [ah] h_b_l sekarang
so
in the morning i just stay at home
just listen to lecture
pay attention sikit sikit
then
after that i stay home [ah] the rest of the day
lazy [ah] but nothing to do [ah]
i want find job [eh]
part time [ah] now still schooling [what]
but then cause my fridays free [ah] so i got nothing to do i thought boleh kerja sambil-sambil
but then
malas pun ada
i don't know [ah]
[eh] i wish [ah] can go back there
kat sana kerja dah pu~ punya [lah] senang
thirty
tapi
like
it's legit [seh] it's like you never do guard duty before right
a
like when i do there is like [leh] really i work for two hours then i rest for four hours
but then my rest also dorang bayar
then
but then s~ s~ dorang tak nak ambil cause i still schooling [ah] then they say like apa ni
they want people that can commit more days
means
ya
but actually last sem
aku actually boleh kerja [sia]
cause last sem last semester is everything was h_b_l
so i can h_b_l while i was working cause it's four hours rest [what]
then gitu duit masuk so senang [ah] but then wasted [lah] i never think of it [lah]
#al-ameen#
i not sure [seh] i think around
i think until two a_m three a_m like that [ah]
if i not wrong [ah]
ya
dah lama [ah] tak makan sana because like
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy [ah]
diam sudah no [ah] i mean like
if if i'm not exercising already all the more i shouldn't eat there [what] correct or not
ya diet [ah] if cannot cannot exercise then diet [ah]
but i think i want to start back soon [ah] exercising
but hijrah barang lama [ah] now the people there all
extreme [ah]
he he he
#faiz# #faiz# lagi extreme no i think #faiz# is like the epitome of extreme you know
(mmhmm)
but then i don't know [leh] like i feel like
going to the gym person pasal like my friend all say like if i go gym all [ah]
(uh) since i got the height already right
dorang semua cakap like macam confirm badan pau punya [ah]
ya but
the effort [ah] and like
i don't know [eh] i feel like going gym
but gym just very intimidating [ah] like aku rasa macam
seram [ah] like go there people all tengok-tengok semua
okay
tak tapi
tapi kecil is okay you know kecil cause
like
i don't know [ah] like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
but like if you see orang gemuk [kan] orang gemuk confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy semua [pe]
so but that stigma also like
i don't know [ah] later people kat gym tengok like [eh] try hard [pe] this guy
a bit
a bit #paiseh# [ah]
but i feel like if i don't start like
forever [sia] macam gini
[eh] you know i i looked through my gallery right
like
last time during n_s
i skinny [sia]
okay
not not not skinny [ah] i'm i was skinnier
like i was still big but like
at least i looked proportionate [ah] like don't look so bulat
i think hundred and four [ah] (uh) last time i checked was hundred and two
then these days i want to check already but my parents tak tukar the battery [ah] for the
weighing scale
so now
i just take as my weight still at hundred and two [ah]
i don't know [eh] my
cause since after n_s right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five [ah]
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
no not really after b_m_t [ah] after b_m_t still got a lot of outfields semua [pe] so we still keluar banyak-banyak
so
not say maintain [lah] but (uh) after b_m_t can order in already [what] so i always buy #nasi-lemak#
makan banyak [ah] cause of
ya
then it's cause of n_s [ah] always order in asyik beli [jer] then sekali
like before i know [ah] like towards the end of n_s [ah]
dah getting rounder [ah]
cause army [kan] army the the longer
the longer you are in army right the more lepak the
the superiors all will be [ah]
ya
so towards the end is like every week
i eat #nasi-lemak# i eat fatty bom bom
[eh] fat~
fatty bom bom free [ah] i want to eat [ah]
[eh]
watch your language man
woodlands have at #marsiling#
no no no no no no it's (uh) you know where #marsiling# m_r_t is
it's it's opposite #marsiling# m_r_t [ah] but not to the polyclinic side [tau]
you know you know #marsiling# got new shopping mall the where the police post is
rumah ella kat mana [eh] [oh] ya ya ya correct correct correct
(uh) (uh) rumah ella
kat belakang [ah]
towards the m_r_t tracks
like from rumah ella you walk to m_r_t tracks
then there's a coffee shop there [ah] fatty bom bom kat sana
[oh] ya ya ya
but what's the difference [seh]
[eh] it doesn't make sense [leh] i mean like okay like kau tahu (uh)
like fatboy's and fatpapas
that [one] is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
but then in this case like abang gemuk and fatty bom bom no difference [what] both halal already [what]
so like they tukar nama for what [sia]
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name [mah] it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know [ah]
but
that time also ada [ah]
so like like when i go #lia's# house senang [ah]
like if got feels for fatty bom bom [ah] it's just like
think like if we grab like twenty minutes sampai [ah]
no no no it's not at #afghan# there it's at
(uh) kau tahu #dunman# sec kat mana
ya it's opposite #dunman# sec [ah]
then #lia# my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
[ah] dekat [ah]
malas [pe] dah cakap malas nak exercise
like really like it's it's like
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance yang jauh it's like
#yio-chu-kang# to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far [ah]
may half half the journey [ah] from #yio-chu-kang# to your house
ya but like macam
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
confirm malas [sia] nak keluar it's easier for you to just order
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars [ah]
the
(uh) #tampines# [one] not so bad [eh]
i know
usually me and #lia# buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
but that [one] tengok [ah] kalau
if only kalau ada discount [ah]
usually i get the
cajun cajun [eh] cajun cajun chicken [ah]
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
i think i prefer rice [ah] the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
(uh) then then got the then got the telur so it's like more like fried rice like that [lah]
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken [ah]
i never try abang gemuk before [ah] so cannot say [ah]
fatty bom bom or fatboy's
ya
depends [ah] some
you know some of the hawker centre [ah]
the western shop got like secondary school feels [ah]
#idah's# kitchen
i don't remember [sia]
is it the one the the thai shop take over [ah]
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
[oh] [oh] [oh]
i that [one] i thought that [one] is korean food [what]
[oh] i don't think i ate there before [ah]
now they got new [one] [ah] at koufu
but a bit mahal [ah] that day i eat it's like six ninety
that kind of price [ah]
(uh) the
the whole range [ah] like you know chicken chop (uh)
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff [ah]
tapi macam
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it [ah]
pasal dorang ba~ dorang bagi banyak [ah]
tak tapi even though the portion worth [kan] but i feel like it's like two people portion [ah]
macam
macam the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
usually they give like half bowl like that right
but over there they give the full bowl [ah] then the ayam pun dorang bagi dua
koufu you know where the (uh)
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
i think new [ah] the shop dulu takde [ah]
but i not too sure [ah] maybe
i don't really remember [ah] because usually dulu kita orang makan sana
always makan the
japanese shop [kan]
[eh]
how [lah] i want to get better at dota [sia]
no [eh] but i play
i play public game like macam
always kena thrashed [ah]
it's like
if i get toxic opponent [eh] like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good [ah]
maybe [ah] maybe also
but i don't know [ah]
then aku tunggu kau download warzone sampai sekarang belum download
kental [lah]
i don't know [eh] like
i don't know how come your computer semua games tak boleh [sia]
like
the #genshin# impact also cannot right
but okay [ah] nevermind [ah] because #genshin# like you can't really play with friends [ah] like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode [ah]
like it's more to like main sendiri
then you just explore the world yourself [ah]
then
apa
i mean like now i toned down i don't play as much anymore [ah]
like cause dorang ada macam like a energy system like that
like the call it resin
so
you know [ah] so like (uh) this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge [ah] like i think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by [lor] then it recharge slowly
then kau boleh buat the stuff you need to do [ah]
so it's mostly a waiting game [ah] like you finish
you finish what you need to do already then just tunggu [ah]
i don't know [sia] i see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
l~ like like really the game play is
fantastic [ah] phenomenal
but
i would say [ah] m m_m_o_r_p_g i've play [ah] so far
tapi
better than runescape [ah] tapi
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
like kau kena tunggu [ah] resin kau fill up baru kau boleh main
ya so it's more of a waiting game [ah] so like as much as i want to do a lot of things i cannot
i think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term [ah]
ya true [ah]
[oh]
console pun ada
p_s_four ada
ya like i saw on youtube got the whales [ah] they spent banyak [ah]
dude gila mam~ like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
they spent like
like empat ribu lima ribu
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
so it's like really luck based [ah] tengok [ah] your luck macam mana
i think maple [ah] cause this [one] is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me i never spend money but i'm still
quite far in the game already [ah]
like i i complete all the story mode already
pernah pernah [ah] m_l [ah] last time i buy the skin
ya ya ya it's like dota like that [ah]
so macam i bought their equivalent of the battle pass
i think i paid like lima belas [eh]
fifteen then
so i just complete the tale like until the max then i get the skill already
then after that i don't spend money already [ah] like
wasteful [ah] spend duit kat game
ya some more it's like
ada [ah] additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
like
it it makes a difference but like macam
tak leh nampak sangat [ah] like you need like
an advantage is advantage [ah] but like they make it minimal [lor]
so tak rasa sangat
(uh) (uh) kau macam tak you like don't know me like that [ah]
since when i even watch soccer
(hmm) sejak bila
sejak bila aku tengok bola
i don't know [ah] like
i never i've never seen the the
what's the word [eh] the
the attractiveness of watching soccer [ah] like it's just
so slow
like kau compare dengan basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
[a'ah] tapi tapi bola macam
you wait pass pass pass i don't know [ah] maybe just not my thing [ah] i guess
diam sudah
[eh]
tomorrow tomorrow i got no school [ah]
like i book my solat jumaat tak dapat
dah lama [sia]
wanted to book [ah]
tapi tak dapat [ah]
(mm)
since the booking start i never i never kena dapat i think cause i always book late [ah]
so dah semua all the slots dah fill up [kan] then dah tak boleh
dah tak boleh dapat slot [ah]
i really not sure [sia]
i think the same week [ah] on monday i think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
i think now is five weeks [ah]
or four weeks i not sure
so like let's say i do today already right
[eh] i do tomorrow already
then (uh) aku tak leh buat for the next five weeks
[a'ah] so other people can get [ah] but some more aku selalu tak dapat [ah]
it
[eh] i think they blacklist me already
tak tahu [ah]
tak nak [ah]
tengok kerusi all
where you where you (uh) where you plan on getting
apol
(uh huh) i only know se~ i only know secret lab [ah]
(uh) and s~ streamers (uh) aku tengok mostly streamers pakai the ini [ah] secret lab [one]
but then the pricing [eh] similar [ah]
paling murah
asal mahal sangat [sia] it's just a chair right
like
tak [ah] tapi tapi even though
aku bayar banyak-banyak
but
i'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself [what] like it's not genuine leather right
it's p_u leather you know p_u leather actually murah [seh]
[ah]
tapi
tak tahu [ah]
(uh) five hundred dollars on a chair
kerusi
(uh huh)
i mean you you said it yourself right like dorang apa similar [kan]
!huh!
worth it [ah] got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site [what]
sama [ah]
i mean okay warranty dia is apa one for one exchange or what
macam tak masuk akal right like
ada koyak sikit
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya i think this [one] must ask [ah] i think if
if really one for one exchange worth it [ah]
every other week
kau ambil pisau kau potong [seh] already
[oh] really [ah]
okay how about macam kalau air tumpah
air tumpah on the thing
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but wh~
okay but what if it's like kau tumpah [kan] coke
like you know coke is very very corrosive right
that time that time siapa [eh] tunjuk aku (uh) i think
#achap# [ah] #achap# tunjuk aku the video
orang pakai coke
untuk cuci toilet
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya i also
i've never been a fan of fizzy drinks [ah] like even time hari raya [kan]
like
(uh) okay usually guest just [eh] (uh) tuan rumah dorang selalu just tuang [kan]
f&n [pe] f&n is like the standard [ah] the (mm)
my my nenek punya side more of coke [ah] so they got like
they got like a lot of coke
like one one what do you call that [eh] (uh) basket
not basket [ah] they got like one they got one but container full of coke
then another container is all just (uh) apa ni f&n
s~
ya hari raya
so if i go my nenek house
it's really just gassy drinks atau teh
so for me i'm more like ice lemon tea
like you know pokka ice lemon tea gitu
ya different
syrup also not a big fan [ah]
i think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established [ah]
like pokka seasons
seasons (uh) (uh) the ice lemon tea is the blue colour [one] but they got the
apa [eh] the other one yang [ah] the hijau [one] the hijau [one] sedap [ah]
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea [ah] but the blue colour [one] is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness [ah] ya the sugar
tak tapi the best [one] i think is the seasons peach tea
seasons peach tea but susah [ah] nak cari like everywhere i go like most most kedai tak jual [ah]
i don't know why
seasons not pokka
it confirm pernah it's the orange colour [one]
but sekarang susah nak cari i think they stopped production already [ah] i haven't i haven't seen it
for for a while already [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] (uh)
wait from where
wait i still looking for a job [ah] dude
takde takde ga~ takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit
takde duit takde table tennis
i think no more already confirm dorang dah buang punya like the thing so #lup-sup# you know
haven't [ah] but i heard they going to open already
so i don't know [ah] i just scared
macam repeat
like history repeat repeat itself [ah]
lik~ (uh) ya that's why
then macam
tak [ah] tapi sekarang not that bad because like
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like i think i'm not able to
to bond with them as much [ah]
so maybe not that bad [ah]
but then [eh] you got #lobang# for kerja or not
ya but like
i don't know [ah] like i want to do cafe all but like the cafe all semua yang tak halal
in the one that pays well [ah]
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet [ah]
okay [ah] honestly [ah]
aku tak pernah kerja banquet
that time you work [what] no [meh]
yang sebelah yang sebelah hard rock cafe
[ah]
(uh)
[oh]
#sheikh# also work kitchen [ah]
[oh]
the one a
[eh] but that [one] also see your manager also [ah]
because
ya cause (uh) my friend from n_s dulu kerja
it's not really banquet [ah] but they set up for the banquet people [ah]
kat
#shang# shangri-la
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
(uh) like the table chair stage semua dorang set up
then usually it's for like reception gitu [ah] wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just tunggu for the event to finish then they teardown
i think so like who
[oh] yeah yeah yeah but
but dorang punya is more for ini [kan] is like
like apa ni concerts semua [kan]
[ah] ya then this [one] is only for
like wedding reception only [ah]
kat shangri-la that that type
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager [ah] so
the manager is like #sheikh# and that [one] also
(uh) like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay [lah]
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much [ah]
he just delegate the work semua then duduk goyang kaki goyang [ah]
ya
ya
then i don't know [ah] i think everywhere you go i think as long as you make friends [eh]
ke~ kerja senang [ah] tak yah buat banyak sangat [ah]
[oh] ya but marche tak halal [lah]
[eh] jangan gini [ah]

ya
#rehan# why #rehan#
nanti nanti nanti there he sn~ he sniff all our cigarettes [sia]
[ha] funny guy #rehan#
[eh] then how later later want to play dota
i play for a while [ah]
(uh)
i want to get better don't know
tengok [ah] nanti i play for fun [ah]
apex apex game dia macam mana
tapi dia punya graphics semua macam cartoon-ish [kan]
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress [ah]
valorant is not [sia] actually it's quite realistic [what] is like same as almost c_s go but
only the suit like a bit
[oh] (uh) kira [kan] macam halo kind of graphic [ah]
[eh] how
are you are you buying the p_s five or not
sch~ busy dengan sekolah
tapi sekarang p_s five berapa
is now is mahal cause orang resell [eh]
[oh]
i don't know [ah] like semua orang like rebut nak beli p [eh] actually not ya i don't know i never see the hype of console [lah]
ada [ah] main [ah]
like when i go to my apa ni cousin's house
(uh)
ya like the first console i owned was p_s_p
(ugh) cause okay
aku dari dulu [kan] like
when i growing up like i never had all these things cause
my parents macam
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing [ah]
so
like
i didn't have much distraction other than computer
but computer pun my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
ya so
dorang like cakap okay (uh) #haris# (uh)
kau main twenty minutes
then after that [eh] you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so i only got my first console after my p_s_l_e
[eh] [eh] no primary five exam primary five exam i got all a
ya then my
my father [ah] my father cakap like [eh] #haris# (uh) okay [ah]
they never even tell me you know cause i always tell them i want game boy i want game boy
not really strike a deal [lah] like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three [ah] so like i never really believe them [ah]
(uh) wouldn't say well [lah] like
so so [ah] a a b b
like a b b b
like i would say it's ave~ okay [ah] above average [ah] slightly above average
but then
i think primary five i don't know [ah] one day i just come home [eh]
suddenly like everyone kat (uh) kat luar then i was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the p_s_p
then turns out one was for me [ah] one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted p_s_p i wanted game boy [what]
so my father cakap dengan the salesperson the salespersons cakap like
[eh] cik if you want to buy game boy
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no [ah] but wasted [ah] cause my parents bought p_s_p when it first came out
so it's p_s_p one thousand
[ah]
dah [ah] tak [ah] tak yah panggil gemuk [pe]
[ah] ya so
like
i think a few months after i got my p_s_p the slim [one] come out
the once the slim [one] come out semua beli [ah]
ya
but then that the closest to console i got [ah] p_s_p
ya but actually the games there quite good [sia]
ya
d_s [ah]
i think d_s take over [ah] the market
p_s_p vita vita p_s vita ya ya ya
downfall [lah] ya
then i
but i
i think
i think it's cause it's different [lah] like you don't really have any console yang kau boleh use touch screen kat bawah tapi still got the tactile buttons
ya it's like
just want to show off features [ah] ada dual screen kind of
[ah] that [one] is a pokemon brand already [ah]
until now right ya switch
no but switch still got ada ada animal crossing ada
got other games [ah]
but quite popular [what] aku tengok banyak orang [sia] main
ya don't know [ah] mayb~
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked [ah] don't know [ah] this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing [ah]
ya
the (uh) he got post on twitter [ah] i got see a picture of his (uh) like office like that
i think
publicity [ah] like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that [what]
got a rea~
probably that [one] also not he play [ah] maybe his p_r team play for him [ah]
ya
!hais!
tak pernah [ah]
[oh] okay okay faham faham ya
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice [leh]
like i okay this [one] is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular [ah]
until now i i looking to play it again you know but tak [leh] jumpa [ah] it's called what is it called [eh] (uh)
adventurer concourse i forget [ah]
it is [ah] it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
(uh) medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself [ah]
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war tak pernah [ah]
total war is what [ah]
is it
[oh] no no no
ya apa [eh] got once got one game quite sick it was on steam bro yang
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from [lah]
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so i forget [ah] (uh)
i !wah! i forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side [ah]
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
korang boleh like form a squad then do like
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
(err) (uh) quite cool [ah]
i forgot what's the name of the game [ah]
apa [ah] nama dia
plazma burst
(mm)
isn't that just (uh)
escape room
[oh] [oh] is it is it the one yang kau kena kena fix the generators semua
and then there's a ghost chasing you
[oh] is it
i'm not sure [ah]
#farid# all [ah]
skipper
#aiman#
#aiman#
[oh] i don't know [ah] i never see [ah] they post on twitter [ah]
i never see before [ah] #ipin# i only see him post m_l punya video [ah]
okay [lah] not bad [lah] he was top top in singapore [ah] one point of time
for one hero no cause in m_l is as long as you play a hero banyak-banyak [kan]
then your
m_m_r for that hero will increase
[ah] so like (uh) he play this hero i think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again [ah]
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore [ah]
for me the best i got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands #yishun# ya
i they don't have singaporean server i don't know
i think it's (uh) asian server [ah]
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so kalau kau nak clamp the ranking kena main banyak [ah]
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you i think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
ya for other country is by state so like #johor# macam #johor# will be
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in #johor# top in #selangor# top in #sabah# that kind of thing
ya that's why
i think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to macam separate semua orang
singapore is one state [ah] singapore is a state [what] it's a state country right
(uh)
out outdate outdated information [ah] that [one]
okay i can say also [lah]
!hais!
(mmhmm)
how you know
of course [lah]
(mm)
the malay [eh] actually this [one] i can ask my friend [lah] you know #khai#
[ah] she very interested in like malay culture and all that [lah] so like
okay [ah] for me i find it interesting also but i not so into it sampai
i do research on it also
on it but #khai# like he can tell me like

he travel with (uh) columbus
around the world
so [ah] he say it's a malay it's a malay guy [ah] that travelled with columbus to find out that the world is round

so macam like the
(um)
malay heritage semua [kan] dia tahu [ah]

the different type of culture semua
quite cool [eh] actually cause like apparently orang melayu really
(uh)
how to say [eh]

cause dorang beli semua is to promote their channel [what] in the end
so like if you
that [one] i not sure maybe now cause he quite big already [kan] maybe he can get sponsors [ah] but at the start i'm pretty sure i think he buy himself [ah]

so he memang nak
he buy the good stuff [lah] like his knife semua bagus punya all like

the knife all very nice and very sharp

that [one] quite ni [ah] he but that guy keluar [kan] #samurai# sword [ah]
to potong someone
okay
ya i'll open the prompts
okay
then to start with the first question
granted
is it tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu
okay i also wait you think for like one second
[oh] cannot [lah] that one is too gila okay maybe i start first
okay
if i got three hajat the first one would be i want to talk to my kucing
cause because i just like like every time i always like talk to my kucing and then i i become like a gila person and i like berbual merepek i legit like talk like my kucing is my kawan
so if i if i can actually talk in cat language maybe my kucing will talk back to me
(uh) (hmm)
but macam fun [lah]
!alamak! if macam tu then
i will be so scared
[oh] [oh] in the in the bathtub is it [oh] you
(hmm)
but i want to like faham what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
ya
you say something
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) ya ya
if you get to like pilih if you can only travel to the future or to the past
what would it be
ya ya
ya actually
like kalau i'm given a chance to travel back right i want it to like
just be macam what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya
ya ya ya
ya i tak nak apa tu i don't want to travel to the future
cause i takut that if i see macam what my future is
and then i'll be scared to i don't know go to the future or
macam i risau [lah] that my what my actions will
will affect the future
[oh] ya that's true but okay example [lah] if if in the future i see that i become doctor and then abeh i i don't know i
okay no no no change change change okay in the future i see that i'm some~ something that i don't want to be macam engineer ke
or cikgu then i'll be like [oh] okay okay [ah] try to like then i'll try to do something that won't make me like a cikgu
but actually like in the end also like i don't know then it will affect my like what i'm doing right now [lah] and then macam tak ada thrill if i know that in the end i'll become doctor then
ya
then i'll be demotivated to study cause i know my future like okay [lah] later i become a doctor so tak payah belajar banyak sangat
cause i think i'm smart already or something
ya
tapi fun [lah]
okay next wish (hmm)
i want to [oh] if i got a power
i want to
not need to sleep
ya but as a wish [lah]
cause macam sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my cikgu always say that [oh] kalau example if you sleep like like okay for imagine if you sleep macam eight hours a day
that means like your whole hidup right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
you'll sleep for twenty years or something cause like eight hours of twenty four hours is like one third right
so he say like just sleep like empat jam cukup [lah] tak payah tidur banyak-banyak
then i fikir also like betul [lah]
but if i tidur
sikit sangat also i also ngantuk
i not sleep at all
okay ya okay
ya ya i understand okay how about like tak rasa ngantuk
[oh] ya [hor]
okay how about tidur sekejap tapi can still work the next day
ya ya ya
feel like sleeping legit bazir my masa
i can
ya i understand
(hmm)

okay maybe that wish not that good
you [eh]
[oh] without gaining weight [ah]
[oh] i faham
[oh] [eh] best [eh]
ya
that's nice
that'll be good for me also cause i
makan so much gula
and all the merepek food
abeh i think i think
i think really i got diabetes
cause my ibu and my ayah they dia orang got diabetes [lah] okay not my ayah my ibu
ya i a bit takut but at the same time tak kisah [lah]
cause life

i don't know why everyone say indomie so i like [oh] [oh] okay okay sama sama [lah] indomie indomie also
the flavour macam lain sikit right
the flavour
it's like lain sikit
!huh!
[oh] [oh] [oh] that one is #mi-sedaap#
i think
#mi-sedaap# they legit like tak lokek their bawang
it's so much
but their bawang a bit macam
weird [lah] cause their bawang is bulat-bulat
it's i don't know it's bulat-bulat and then when you gigit right like sometimes it's so keras
ya and then i don't know i'm eating what also
[kan] maybe it's like bawang but
apa tu
covered with tepung
so it's just like they goreng the bawang already
[oh] i tadi i eat (uh) #briyani#
okay [lah] tapi macam apa banyak sangat apa tu minyak
ya
ayam
daging i don't like
!huh!
what the wait they jual where
(mm)
we're still talking about the wish right
i i want to like tahu what like what others are thinking about me
or what they're thinking in general
ya
i feel like pelan-pelan i will i will adapt to it
i don't know
[oh]
[oh] ya
you know what i'm thinking of
and like what you know during the time i go up to to to #aqil# to ask for the gambar
and then imagine i i tahu what he's thinking
and then legit like if if like he tengah fikir something bad about me i'll probably like okay tak payah gambar then go back
ya
(hmm)
actually takde power yang
yang i don't know
that's good [lah]
maybe is
is ada hikmahnya that
you don't have powers
sebenar ada hikmah
(um) ada udang sebalik ini semua
ada udang di sebalik batu
(hmm)
apa
okay
[oh] (hmm)
same
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
chickadee
tak pernah [eh]
i don't know i don't remember
cause
i legit tak pernah dengar
if me
if my time capsule
okay if my time capsule i will have
apa [eh] let me think
(mm)
maybe pictures
okay no no no i really like
okay wait let me think
(hmm)
i don't know [eh] time capsule
[oh] ya
[oh] ya (hmm)
but actually sometimes
if macam if you don't simpan the benda right you won't even remember that it used to exist
then you don't really rasa anything
so maybe sometimes macam lebih baik [lah] if you don't already have it
(mm)
you want to
move to another question
okay
(mm)
what is the one okay wait i read in malay also okay sabar sabar [eh]
okay apakah alasan yang paling remeh yang menyebabkan anda tidak suka pada seseorang
it's like the most pettiest thing
okay i can i think of one
alasan that is paling like is okay
okay
i can think of one alasan that is very remeh
and and it's okay
the alasan is like is that maybe dia orang punya suara is a bit weird like if it's macam you know like if you dengar like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way macam entah [eh] tak tahu macam mana nak explain
ya faham [kan] ya tapi like that's macam legit merepek [lah]
[kan] [kan] macam nak sepak [jer] [kan]
[eh] but sometimes right they actually like turn out to be annoying [lah]
but sometimes is just macam salah anggap salah judge
ya that's why it's like legit remeh merepek
(mm)
macam menyampah
(mm)
[oh] [oh] ya #allah#
that one legit
!wah! that one i tak boleh angkat also
ya kadang-kadang macam geram nak tolong angkatkan kaki dia orang ke
you want to move to another question
okay this one like fun
(mm)
[ah]
apakah genre drama atau rancangan t_v yang paling anda gemari
maybe can macam berbual pasal a recent (um) drama you watched
you want to mulakan dulu
(oo)
(mm)
i think i faham a bit
is it macam
[oh] it's it's not like action [lah]
[oh]
(mmhmm)

okay for me [kan] like a recent okay a drama okay a genre
okay it's not really gen~ genre [lah] but okay as you know [lah] i suka like #anime# like recently like i watch a lot of #anime#
and
i think like
the reason
like why i like #anime# is cause the apa tu the characters legit macam cute gila and you know like they're like the the guys
they !alamak! i don't know how to explain they are so handsome
and okay like handsome tu satu [lah] but and then they they are macam they are so perfect also
ya and ya and macam kat singapore you got like you cannot find anyone macam tu and so like ya [lah] like #anime#
it's like very fun to watch cause they are also cartoons so faham-faham [lah] it's like
i don't know if got
okay but
ya and some more can beli all of their stickers or baju and stuff
and usually the #anime# their their plot macam very exciting and very fun [lah] cause it's not like real life so there's banyak
that you can you can do with the plot
you can tambah benda merepek that doesn't make sense or something that isn't macam logical in real life
and it will still be bagus
ya
and their o_s_t !wah! very nice
(mm)
[kan] macam
(mm)

(hmm)
actually growing up is a (uh) is like growing up is a little scary
ya sometimes you must apa tu enjoy the moment tak boleh cepat sangat [lah] kadang-kadang we cepat sangat nak grow up then we put in like so much effort
to not macam live your age and then in the end also you regret
you want to bertitik tolak to another question
(mmhmm)
(mm)
apakah sesuatu yang anda harap percuma

so
i had to focus [ah]  macam
every weekend i book out right  aku terus macam malas [ah] just
like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like (mm)
don't know what to do [ah]
okay then once my
that (uh) batch  habis okay that batch finish
then i was like okay [lah] i need to do something [ah] the deadline coming close
okay i start i do i do all the needed documents
i print (err) not print i search for all the
(err) (err) what what all the
courses that i whatever paper whatever certifications that i got i
 cari [ah]
i dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig
then (err) they want us to submit that online
okay so (err) at that point of time i applied for two course
which is one is the course that you're in what is it [ah] what is it called
okay okay so i applied for the is honours [kan]
okay okay
ya so i applied for that one and then  macam
like okay [ah] maybe one application or
one choice a bit too little [lah] so i choose one more
ya but i only applied for one
like i think
they gave me four options or six option i cannot remember but
i don't know i and [ah] [eh] is it i don't know okay okay
so i was like okay (err) maybe i i put two [ah] so one was
infocomm security then the second [one] was
(err)
i think some design or
i_t course [ah] i don't know it's related to i_t but  macam they asked for portfolio

that (um) the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about (err) entertainment or something [ah]
they requested for a portfolio because  macam they want to see what what i have done
back (uh) any  macam past experience or whatever
so that i can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should [ah] so
ya that was when i realised [ah] so
what i did was i
like (uh) screw it [ah] i don't want to apply for this course then i delete it from my option
the moment i delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then i was like [oh] okay
ya i only applied for one option [lah] i only put one choice
second course s_i_t [ah] [ah] infocomm security
is the [one] i'm saying [ah]  macam the editing or (err) digital entertainment or something like that

that lady was like [oh] (err) are you still are you still in n_s are you still serving

was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
(mm) !huh!
!hais!
you know you know my my  encik wanted me to extend six months [eh]
i was like nah~ nah~
the the amount of work i have to do
two point four
three is that [one] is before (err) [ah] c_p_f but six months is a very long
think so i don't know [lah]
no but the thing is i don't i don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing [ah]
[a'ah]
i would extend if i'm doing like admin work [ah] honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months i'd take it
i would not
[eh] i would not think twice
(err) i i don't like my  encik (uh)
i just
i just don't like my  encik [ah] that's all
ya serious [ah]
one last talk
[oh] i see
[oh] [ho]  dua jam
[oh] i see
 kau punya
 kau punya boss  apa umur
okay [ah]  muda [ah]
 aku punya kau kau rasa aku punya berapa
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
 apa otai [sia]  orang tua
i see i see
no [lah] okay so (uh)
 kira i don't like working with my  encik [ah] it's just like  macam
 kau bayangkan
(err)  kau kau ikut apa dia orang dia suruh kau buat tahu
okay then  tiba tibs
ex~  dia tambah lagi dia tambah dia tambah dia tambah tambah tambah aku [dah] tak boleh tak boleh tahan [lah]
then  macam
when we expect him to cover for us [eh]  macam we do what he expect us to do
and then
there's a second layer so basically  macam my  encik is my first level
to [eh] no sorry my p_s
is my first level to le~ to complaint [lah]  katakan
and then followed by my  encik
and then basically then go up to o_c [ah] so there's this
thing in s_t_s [eh] there's one more layer in between my p_s and my  encik which is that directing staff
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
(err)
(err) expect a lot from the from us [ah]
basically so  macam
s_a_r standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he ex~ they expect us to be there before that
i don't know
[a'ah] ya
and okay so you know how in
(err) b_m_t they say [oh] okay (err) the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the [one] doing all this (err)
all these checks right correct
(uh huh) okay
so we also have the
 macam what's
we also had the schedule [lah]
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
(err) the [one] that we don't like [lah]
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about (err) the duty (err) is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
for example i have five sergeants one person will do the check for that day or for that morning [ah]  katakan
then
so this directing staff came down he was like [oh] (err) what time already i was like !huh!
what do you mean he's like (err) why i only see one sergeant why i don't see all the sergeant here then it's like !huh!
what you expect [sia] you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check [ah]
you get what i mean
ya [lah]
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check [ah] rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like [ha]
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
check  gitu something like that [lah]
so we're like (err) when when i going o_r_d it was like [ah] don't care already [ah] because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so i was like i don't care already [ah]
ya
i mean i i just worry for my
under studies [ah]
(um)
okay okay
what you have done [lah] [ha]
sometimes like i think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
[oh] don't have [eh]
okay then i guess (err)
(mmhmm)
okay [lah] but okay that
and he still cannot
(mmhmm)
last week
that one your problem [ah]
just say that [lah]
[oh]
(err) you feel bad for him [ah]
okay [lah] okay [lah]
your brother [ah] your brother [ah]
i guess ya
 aku lain aku everyday [jer] stress [ah]
i have to
 kau imagine okay  kau imagine (err)
let's say okay you you're taking this batch for one month
like then (um)
within that four weeks there is a few weekend correct
are are you di~ being disturbed on weekends or no
sometimes [ah]
then for me if i am every week every day
my phone will ring my phone will message got ping [one] confirm i tell you vibrate or whatever [lah]
everyday will do and everyday !hais! th~ that's why i'm getting tired of it
example like (err) interacting with
well
i have to deal with forty two recruits
[oh] then (err) the the recruit asking me if i single also that one s_a_f [ah]
is it
serious i got
like (uh) no [lah] no no no i got one i got one guy during my n_s right
he he was in a relationship with one other guy pin pin in his
in his (uh) vocation training
okay so what happened was (uh) they broke up
they broke up and i was and i was the direct (err) seccom
so ya so like i have to  macam
coax him [ah] like [oh] [eh] don~ don't like (err)
(err) feel bad [lah] don't don't think like it's the end or something [lah] whatever
then finishing the course [ah] he come to me he say sergeant single or not what the heck

(uh) like you know those proper interior design stuff that sort of thing we just put whatever wherever that is
make it make it more unique [lah] like more us got more personal touch you know
like let's say (uh)
it's more of a mix and match kind of thing it's like
and not
you know but then still have a theme

ya
like maybe (uh)

ya
ya [lah]
ya
(hmm)
macam mana nak (hmm)
nothing
i mumbling i mumbling
tak ada
ayah dulu first kerja ayah kerja apa
!wah! kalau gitu ayah kerja lama [seh] adik tak boleh imagine [seh] kalau macam kerja lama gitu
sampai about how many years [eh] ayah kerja dekat #alfa-laval#
sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun !hais! macam tak pernah dengar [seh] [ah]
so bila ayah kerja dulu dekat (uh) #alfa-laval# then you don't think macam maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
memang dah planning [kan] dah [kan]
so ada apa yang macam very interesting tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke like the machine dia style tu
tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa sledgehammer
yang the the like the big punya sledgehammer itu [ah]
!wah! kira [kan] bagus [seh] pakai allen key [jer] senang [seh]
[oh] because it's much easier [ah]
nowadays macam actually banyak like really a lot of things dia orang nak tukar
jadi macam manufacturing [kan] even macam sekarang
like now my workplace macam construction [ah] pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam manufacturing
(mm)
ya ya ya ya actually true [ah] so macam dia orang [ah] actually dia orang nak buat [kan] benda tu [ah] datang [jer] [kan]
terus terus in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish [ah]
ayah rasa the houses [eh] because now they actually want to do a house
[ah] yang pagar kayu tahu the whole you imagine [eh] macam the whole building
dia semua pakai kayu ayah rasa ayah ra~ ayah tinggal tak kat tempat tu
so so you it really depends (uh) [ah]
(mm) actually kalau macam they use wood [kan] dia orang ra~ cakap [ah] it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like (uh) the wood banyak tapi macam macam (uh) the besi is steel [kan] dia orang kena mine
[ah] so that's why like (uh) kalau kayu [kan] senang dia chop [jer] lepas tu dia dia process
[kan] cepat habis dia punya plank tu banyak
[ah]
sekarang macam dekat dalam news [kan] dia [kan] ada banyak cerita macam climate change ayah dengar tak cerita ni
macam dia cakap [oh] dia ada per~ [ah] perubahan alam
[ah] dia ada tukar macam [oh] ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula [ah] you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly [eh] tempat tu tak banyak snow
[oh] yang itu ada [ah]
so kalau macam ayah
ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak over the years [eh] yang in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the udara ke or anything like that
so ayah rasa macam tak apa [ah] kalau dia lagi banyak shopping centre then
this climate change tu kira [kan] boleh boleh adapt [ah]
tapi [ah] so far [ah] ayah tak tahu anybody yang got this covid right
(mm)
so [ah] pada ayah macam yang this [ah] covid ni [ah] ayah think will last how long
tapi dia orang cakap fav~ (mm) dia orang cakap mula mula it comes from china [kan] because like dia punya china tu dekat situ [kan]
dia orang ada dia orang they like to eat a lot of like macam weird weird punya animal tahu
[oh]
[oh] so macam ayah fikir actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
(mm)
ayah baca tak yang there's this (uh) group of people [kan] yang dia orang army plane habis lepas tu dia orang
[ah] dia orang fikir [oh] never mind [lah] because it's a private plane habis dia orang tu~ turun [kan] lepas tu yang eropah punya
the europe punya people say [eh] [ah] don't come because you're from u_s [ah] please go home
[ah] ayah baca tak
[oh] ya dekat dekat [eh] the inside of the dormitory [kan] it's really (uh) it
according to my workers [ah] dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada [ah] but unfortunately [lah] kirakan kalau you're from china [eh] yang the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix dengan yang chinese because dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay i want to stick to only my people ya tapi sekarang is like tapi of course in the news i think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the (uh) sickness because if not then people will be very macam macam racist [kan] dengan dia orang [ah] pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak [ah] actually
[a'ah]
do you remember the sars actually not so bad [kan] macam aku i i i don't remember cause i i was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
[oh] is it abang abang punya party
which one is this [eh]
[oh] the the khatam quran party is it
[oh] i don't remember kena check temperature actually
[oh] dah boleh clear [ah]
mineral water [jer] [eh]
tapi ayah rasa like is this covid right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada benda lain in yang ayah ingat [ah] that is the worst thing than this covid
so (uh) apa tu kak~ jadi if now [eh] bila ayah tengok macam movie movie macam zombie zombie [kan]
[ah] ayah continue tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang [kan] now you feel like you're already in the movie
ce~ ada cerita yang paling takut tak wha~ what story is like super takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang [ah]
[oh] like like cannibalism
tapi that cannibalism is not even fake [seh] it's not it's not like zombie
tap~ but in the story [kan] dia orang macam cepat gila [kan] like the they the they run you know
orang hantu apa [seh] itu
human that
[oh] so you're actually like actually the actual human yang human yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada
so macam hantu biasa macam [ah] you can just
walk away [ah] katakan
tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah retire [kan] so ayah rasa freedom tak macam
i i don't need to care about like all this you know hantu or all these you people
so like you don't even need to think about like the basically no stress at all [lah]
so [ah] apa tu jadi bila ayah dah retire so after dah you retire you feel like
do i really need to go back to work [ah] macam gitu
so [ah] apa itu bila dulu [kan] ayah
(um) mula mula start kerja then you said that the [kan] ayah ada kerja kat tempat glass [kan]
[ah] so dulu dekat singapore dia ada banyak factory [eh] pasal i don't think sekarang ada company glass dekat singapore
dia punya cerita semua sama [eh] kena retrenched [ah]
macam kirakan fated [ah]
so sekarang kirakan macam free and easy
[ah] then everyday bangun and then just macam
(uh) buat itu [ah] (uh) if there's planning today then just buat [jer] [lah] gitu
so ayah rasa macam hidup gini all the way till the end okay ke tidak
so kalau actually [eh] macam sekarang [kan] dia banyak gila technology [kan]
[ah] ayah rasa technology ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam technology ni macam
susah [kan] nak cakap
(mm)
dulu ayah favourite subject apa [eh] like when in school [lah]
(mm)
[oh] okay
so bila ayah when you read [kan] those kind of stories [kan] do you feel macam actually bila dia jajah satu country tu dia bagus ke (um) good or bad
so bila dulu (uh) [kan] yayi is actually malaysian right
[oh] yayi
[oh] actually so pasal tu nyai will come to singapore
[oh]
so tapi yang that time yang yang yang apa tu the the separation [kan]
dia dia announcement ke apa
is it an announcement on t_v
so it was actually senang gila [seh]
immigration centre [ah]
[oh] so actually you got lucky [ah] kirakan
so actually macam ayah pun tak march sangat [ah] kirakan
[oh]
actually dulu pun like when i first (err) fikir [kan] like what to do [kan] actually i also wanted to join (uh) the army
because like the army macam to me macam dia semua macam easy [ah] [kan]
[ah] then lepas tu you you you can rise up the rank and then kerja dia macam not so bad [lah]
tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam army pun macam apa tu ston~ stoning [kan] dia orang ikut the rules and then
marching wha~ what's the point [sia] ya
!huh!
[ah] macam pelik [kan] it's like what what what's it for [ah] but i mean i can maybe understand [lah] dia orang semua nak untuk buat
like you're disciplined tapi there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
[ah]
macam somehow dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu suddenly everything macam not so bad
quite positive [kan] [ah] macam [oh] you can remember the good times [ah]
[ah] it it like life is like that [kan] macam dulu like apa tu (err) that time when the adik dalam police [eh] [oh] my god [sia]
like so hot and then lepas tu dia punya push up don't say [ah]
[ah] dia punya push up dah apa tu !wah! sekarang sekarang nak buat push up macam gitu pun tak boleh [seh] tapi dulu !wah! you know so good you know
ya
[ah] and then lepas tu dia orang and then dia punya army officer semua cara dia sama [kan]
[ah] dia
muka kirakan semua macam yang itu [ah] m_p yang kak #inah# tak minat
[oh] ya ya ya that guy is also before army right ya ya ya ya
so macam dia orang semua nak kena they have this macam angkuh punya muka [ah] [eh]
[ah] tapi tak tahu [ah] maybe it's just not fated [ah] that i you know that i didn't join the army [ah] forget it [sia] tengok
[a'ah]
[a'ah] tapi bagus juga [seh] kalau hari hari pakai uniform senang [seh] like you don't need to think you wake up
ya ya ya ya ya
[ah] so macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam mindef [kan] so like although he's in construction [eh]
dia nothing to do with him you know [eh] whatever that happen outside [eh] dia macam [oh] okay
macam mindef [kan] is very big so kalau dia orang if there's anything [eh] dia orang nak kena buat
[ah] in within the mindef itself ya dia orang mesti nak ada manager yang kat dalam yang boleh buat construction
so he's the construction manager for mindef [lah]
like [oh] i got no feeling #liao# no work no work also everyday i will come to work [lor]
macam ya like no feeling to scared ke takut ke kena buang kerja nothing ya
[ah]
tapi ayah dah nor~ (err) i mean like i you speak to them sekali sekala [ah] at least
[oh]
apa sal ada banyak secret ke
so mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya then (uh) too bad [lah] because like you're in warehouse [pe]
m_o_m
actually ayah dulu ada license apa [eh]
ayah ada license forklift [kan]
ya [lah] macam wasted money [ah] pasal call crane
[ah] [lah] pasal macam sama [ah] macam construction kalau ada crane masuk [kan] it's like [oh] my god [seh]
like dia orang semua like you cannot even walk there and then ya
[ah] actually servicing kebanyakannya is really buang habuk
dia dia buang habuk [jer] lepas tu nanti is if if really something wrong [kan]
[ah] dia cakap [ah] change part [jer] [ah] semua
ya ya ya ya it's true [ah]
maybe pun tak gerak [seh] pasal there's not much things [kan] sekarang
!huh!
ya so sekarang macam the situ~ situation dengan si covid ni is a bit weird [kan] pasal banyak benda macam just stop
pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang [kan] macam like ke apa tu yang the funny thing is that yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik [ah] habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru [seh]
[ah] is aku i don't even use the baju half of the time in pyjamas macam i pergi kerja pun pyjamas [ha]
dulu kirakan macam so bila ayah dah masuk warehousing tu then lepas tu like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard [lah] kirakan
(mm)
ayah tak pakai itu ke umbrella
[oh] ya [ah]
!huh!
so it's like macam after you get out [kan] macam lain gila [kan] macam
itu [ah] kerja actually macam technical officer is actually pretty [ah] se~ dia dia actually quite senang
[a'ah] so itu [ah] so tengok [ah] maybe adik pun will just become a technical officer [ah]
pasal kau if like you kerja all the way construction
is like lagi senang nak check orang punya kerja [kan] daripada nak buat you punya kerja sendiri
[ah] itu [lah] dia tapi actually sekarang [kan] dia orang banyak yang [ah] banyak
dia orang suka just berdiri and then suruh orang lain buat they don't want to go down themselves
itu yang masalah dia [ah] itu yang banyak yang macam singapore punya manager [ah] yang susah
i (mm) so you're saying like dia tak tahu [ah] actually
actually that's true [ah] itu yang dia punya the difference [kan] i think we talk about this before yang macam if you work for a m_n_c
[ah] if the kalau dia punya engineer turun [kan] daripada australia ke apa then kalau kau tak turun dengan dia [kan]
[ah] then dia macam tengok engkau hello i'm going down [sia] you not going down [meh] gitu [a'ah]
[ah] tapi kalau macam singapore punya !wah! clean [ah] berdiri [jer] kasi yang the poor bangla [eh] [ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah] tapi tu tapi sekarang bangla semua pun tak ada
[ah]
pasal sekarang pun dah [ah] semalam i met my friend
dia cakap on construction site [kan] cuma ada enam belas orang
adik cakap construction kau kau buat apa [seh] pondok
sixteen people to finish one construction !wah! bila masa nak habis sepuluh tahun pun tak habis
aku rasa [a'ah] satu swimming pool habis dia cakap no no no no i need to bui~ to build a school
habis adik cakap habis adik cakap dia punya school ni
dah setengah jalan ke or baru start baru start [seh]
tak cukup [ah] [ah] habis dia orang cakap [ah] they keep saying [eh] macam [oh] [ah] they giving green light green light
tapi yang green light ini actually belum
not not many not many of the bangladesh or or the workers [ah] are actually
(uh) still go to the construction site mostly all cannot [ah] itu dia punya problem [ah]
[ah] so [ah] itu yang i don't know when to finish [ah] dia punya project habis dia orang kita so macam sixteen [eh]
then you do what sweep the floor [ah] what else you want me to do [sia]
[ah]
[ah]
habis kau imagine [eh] macam nak carry benda tapi nak kena distance (uh) tak boleh [kan] very weird [lah] dia punya rules
[ah] tapi tak tahu [ah] ini bila nak habis [kan] (mm) so tengok [ah] macam mana
[ah]
[oh]
(mmhmm)
tapi apa tu ayah ayah tengok tak yang macam yang dekat america banyak orang tak nak pakai mask
tapi pelik [kan] i don't know why macam dia orang (err) apa tu really really go against (err) apa tu dia or~ [ah] nak pakai mask ni padahal pakai mask tu macam tak ada apa apa per
[a'ah] [seh]
[ah] i don't know [ah] when when is this going to end pun really not sure
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
ya so tengok [ah] apa tu harap harap everything is okay [lah] [kan]
so tak tahu [ah] tengok [ah] macam mana habis mummy tak cakap apa apa ke
yang pasal yang macam covid ini ke apa
(mm)
ayah ada berapa banyak [seh]
[oh] okay
!wah! dah dah dah planning [ah]
!chey! pasal dulu [kan] apa tu [kan] susah [kan] nak dapat singaporean
ten years tak boleh masuk malaysia apasal [eh]
is
so is apa untuk tunjukkan like you're patriotic [ah] kirakan
[oh] so dia dia really macam nak (uh) apa tu
tapi kalau macam if you go back kalau then you must take some some
letter ke atau pun macam tak atau they just tak tak tak consider you as patriotic [ah]
[oh] ya ya
[oh] so kirakan macam apa tu dia dia really control [lah] ya
(mm) habis nyai is nyai singaporean
so dia bila dia convert [seh]
[oh] on the independence day itself dia boleh convert tapi apasal ayah tak convert
macam there is something [ah] to show like you really want to be a singaporean [lah]
bila ayah first (uh) cakap that pledge [eh] tapi ayah ayah sekolah pun kat singapore so it's not that hard [lah]
[ah] yang itu actually adik pun kena buat [lah] benda tu [oh] zaman zaman silam [kan] [a'ah]

hello this is recording pertama kita bersama saya wesley because this is our first recording okay i akan explain apa [jer] yang kita akan berbual so please bear dengan kita kita (err) recording ini akan berlangsung selama satu jam so every recording kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
(err)
bersama conversation partner yang i dah pilih
so (err) untuk conversation ini yang pertama sekali i have my own sister nama dia #rismah# okay
so for this recording's conversation partner (err) #rismah# akan (uh) introduce herself you can start now
thank you so much okay so (um)
(uh) are you studying now are you working tell us more
okay that's very nice okay thank you so much for being a part of today's conversation [eh] [ah] terima kasih banyak-banyak and sekarang kita akan (err) bincang
jadi setiap conversation kita akan berbual pasal satu topic
atau lebih [lah] kita tergantung (uh) it depends so untuk topic hari ini kita akan berbual pasal
mango buah mangga any thoughts okay so bila dengar bila first dengar [jer] (uh) this word what comes to your mind bila dengar mango [jer] when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing apa [jer]
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great [ah] okay
i happen to like mango juga so (uh) bila dengar mango [jer] [kan] macam !woo! sedap [ah] like
nak
rasa macam !wah!
macam nak makan [jer] mango [eh] macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal mango [jer] macam nak makan sahaja so (uh) first [jer] kita (uh) bila dengar mango
actually bila first dengar [jer] macam rasa
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
i don't know if you've (uh) i don't i don't know if any of you dah pernah dengar ke tak but
the brand mango ni memang makcik i memang suka pakai ba~ baju mango this t shirt from this brand nama dia mango (err) by the way ini
tak sponsored [lah] [eh] so kita ya faham-faham [jer]
okay so what comes to mind bila dengar mango kita dah berbual okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay
okay jadi (err) buah mango ini kalau kita berbual if we talk about the shape we are
it's it's not a definite shape i can say [ah] it's not a definite shape it's not a pat~ it's not a a shape that is
is precise or [ah] specific is
it could either be a it it could be ei~ it could either be an oval or it could either be i don't know
(um) it's slightly bended it's bengkok sikit ke dalam kalau you tengok betul-betul
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
something macam apa benda ya shape dia so
mango ini memang interesting memang it's
unique
selain daripada bentuk dia ini
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can somehow cut it well in a way that kita boleh makan betul tak
(mm) so kita boleh potong belah dua we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so dia macam kotak-kotak gitu so we can we can eat it like that atau kita boleh
kupas kulit dia and then kita boleh makan
macam gitu [jer] macam
apa (uh) we slice it we sl~ we can just slice the
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
and okay shape it's memang irregular tapi dia macam bentuk yang okay [lah] macam [kan] macam tak
tak pelik sangat bila kita makan
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
(uh) selain daripada ben~ besides the shape
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
about one or two colours so dia ada colour yellow dia ada colour oren
and dia ada juga colour hijau so yang
hijau itu
okay selain hijau there's also there's also red betul tak
okay so (err) these four types yang paling banyak kita like the ones that we see a lot
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
usually the the ones that we usually see betul tak so
(err) yang paling sedap
i honestly tak tahu yang mana yang paling sedap because i've only tried
a few types of mango
and yeah
but honestly mango is my favourite s~ my favourite fruit as well macam memang se~ i don't know it's it's nice so (uh) the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about ho~ why it's our favourite fruit
i agree like i don't know i've never tried the red one but
if given the chance i would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite fr~ my favourite fruit
so ya moving on (err)
mango where can we buy where can we find mangoes nak cari dekat mana [eh] mango ini
kalau
dalam context singapore [eh] kita boleh cari mango ini
senang nak cari sebenarnya it's very easy to find because
dekat mana mana ada like dekat setiap penjuru singapore mesti ada mango
nah when like i don't know supermarket
pasar
(err)
mana mana mesti ada [lah] mango
kadang [ah] sometimes there are li~ like fruit sellers that just
(err) hangs around the m_r_t station
like late at night
just so that they can sell their fr~ their fruits [lah] gitu jadi dia orang jual buah-buah yang dia orang dah tangkap ke dia orang dah
dapat ke tak tahu dapat dari mana but dia orang jual [lah]
literally dekat m_r_t stations and
di dekat singapore ini like we all live (err) somewhat we we kinda all live near an m_r_t station betul tak
so
(err) besides supermarket pasar mana lagi boleh nak cari mango
okay thank you so much
(uh) ya ex~ exactly like i mean (uh)
in singapore it's it's a very common fruit to find
(err) as in it's very easy to find mango [lah] dekat singapore ini [kan] pasal it's it's a common fruit
(um)
and as products they they come in varieties a variety of products
product apa [jer] yang kita boleh pakai kita boleh cari apa (um) tak tahu [lah]
makeup makeup mungkin ada kot [eh] macam pro~ yang rasa mango i i tak tahu tapi so far macam okay let's say kalau macam product kalau betul betul ada mesti ada macam (uh) shampoo
conditioner yang rasa mango
[ah] lip balm pun ada
what do you think
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(err)
there's a lot okay okay besides like beauty products okay tadi we we were talking about
beauty products so
okay in other forms of food
mungkin kita boleh talk about mango tea
teh man~ teh yang ber~ berperisa mango (err) mango
banyak juga tahu and it's it's (err)
like like my sister said it's (err)
it has calming effects (uh) i don't know honestly mango just makes me happy maybe not everybody feels the same towards it tapi (err) definitely
for me it does makes me feel happy
i bet yang those of you who are listening to this you all already feel like you all definitely want to get mangoes right now betul tak
so (err) apa lagi [eh]
dalam segi product kita tadi dah berbual pasal beauty products kita dah berbual pasal
(err)
mango tea [kan]
but kita belum sentuh ini
dessert
memang dessert paling banyak have you tried any desserts yang ada mango
exactly cause
entah [eh] when okay when the colour mang~ the colour of the mango [kan] yellow [kan]
it's
bila the first thing when you see
yellow
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly i think the colour is betul-betul attractive
and
it just draws
my attention to it so bila nampak macam colour colour #bingsu# like she said (uh) she mentioned earlier bila nampak colour colour #bingsu# macam
!ee! nak [ah] tengok macam the first thing i see is the the
(err) mango #bingsu#
(err)
apart from that i feel like dia consistency dia memang
memang cukup [eh] macam it's not too watery dia chewy dia macam
just nice [ah] texture dia dekat dalam mulut it's
perfect
sunshine [eh]
macam it's it it it seems like she's explaining a little too deep but it's okay
i mean (uh) we're literally just talking about mangoes for the next one hour maybe we would just you know if we can finish all of the things that we can talk about nanti kita boleh berbual pasal buah-buah lain buah-buahan lain pula [kan]
okay jadi dari segi product kita dah berbual pasal #bingsu# sebagai dessert
apa lagi [eh]
(um)
(um) maybe itu [jer] kot maybe that's all we have for mango products (err) i mean
if we're going to talk about benda-benda yang kita tak boleh ma~ tak boleh makan there's definitely mango as a brand itu
(uh) itu macam
it's like a brand
yang quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a mang~ (uh) (err) a fruit name for a brand because
(uh) they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all [lah] because you know the way they design the the logo i mean it's just
cuma word mango [jer] kot i mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like macam betul-betul macam !wah! nampak [jer] macam !wah!
macam
i guess
that's interesting
okay
(uh) besides that (uh) kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi mango ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu
betul betul i feel like [ah] okay but honestly i think (err)
i feel like
mango cake is something that you would find easily
(hmm)
exactly
exactly i feel that
sure i mean (uh) that th~ whatever that she said was right because i feel that
ya you can do anything you want dengan mango cause i feel that
entah [eh]
we don't really think about
talki~ the it's interesting that mango is the topic untuk hari ini pasal kita actually tak
kita suka makan mango tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
[oh] my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs [ah] we there's also
mango pudding we always have mango pudding dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari mango pudding especially dekat wedding
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
atau dekat rumah kawan
like at your friend's house mesti ada (err)
pudding [kan]
like
it's amazing how how much i love mango pudding
process
that's true
because kita tak pernah i mean jarang [lah] ya berbual pasal mango that's what i find it interesting kalau kita berbual faha~ untuk our first recording kita berbual pasal mango pasal
entah i feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
about having mango soda
tak pernah ada [kan]
do you have have you had any mango sodas
i really wish ada mango soda
(um) that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time kot
okay
(uh) do you know that (uh) in some parts of the world dekat luar negeri some parts of the world dekat tempat lain
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking [kan] (um)
the fact that dekat southeast asia dekat asia tenggara kita actually the king of fruits ini
actually durian i don't know if you guys know du~ durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about (um)
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now i'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
buah mangga
okay
so besides that (uh) okay the the scientific name [eh] untuk ini ini buah is actually mangifera indica
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
okay it's a drupe or stone fruit itu macam semacam buah itu the type dia nama dia stone fruit
[kan] (uh) ada berry ada apa apa semua then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because memang if you look at it
it actually looks like a stone i don't i have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
okay so it means [ah] okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so dia punya biji (err) biji buah dia itu memang besar
buah mangga betul tak
and
i think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
okay and mango itu actually juga native dekat india
dekat india itu
senang nak cari dekat situ
(uh) southeast asia asia tenggara that's why that's why we said that it's really really easy to find mangoes here because
ya i don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
how interesting is that macam
lama gila [seh] like what the hell
it's way before all of us
now we're born okay at this point of time i have no idea what i'm talking about but kita go on [jer] [eh]
and there are a hundred types of mango
each with a unique taste shape
size dengan colour dia juga tapi dia (uh) lain-lain
so
apa lagi apa lagi kita ada

an impressive nutrition profile ini betul betul
it's actually quite true cause
(err) mango ini memang penuh dengan khasiat there's like so much nutrition value value
that

question dia tadi satu question [eh] tapi dah melalut [eh] tak apa it's okay
so for my day i def~ today i
okay this week actually is my first week (err) since (err) holiday that school resumes so (err) as per usual i had my class today tapi because you know [kan] sekarang tengah pandemic tengah
tengah corona~ you know like the the virus is you know masih dekat singapore masih ada cases [lah] [kan] so today we had
for a month actually we have to be (uh) doing classes online
it's really it it's it's really sad because i see i pun dah melalut tak apa it's okay
i mean
we're just talking we're just having a conversation just chilling
okay back to the topic (err) seriously i think quite sad because dah berapa bulan [seh] dekat rumah like
i was hoping that we could go back to school because i really am productive dekat dekat sekolah like my brain my work like [ah] i can just think and do work
like
much more than i can do work at home macam macam mana [eh] macam susah [lah] buat kerja dekat rumah cause you know you have your bed you have your
your i don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily dekat rumah so your productivity level is not as
much as when you're outside
in school especially
i'm sure some of you would feel the same
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that dekat rumah lagi (err) productive [lah] but today is (uh)
quite decent for me
nothing too extreme nothing to some macam okay okay [jer] [lah] i still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work wh~ or who is more productive dekat rumah ke or is more productive dekat luar
betul exactly
okay so
now that we've (uh) talked about our day
let's talk about okay before we going (err) we're going back to talking about the fruit [lah] [eh] cause
i don't know let's just talk about this it's more casual [lah] [kan] so okay (err) what [eh] what food did you have today
(mm) (mm)
i had sambal fish and sambal egg
then (err) ada this apa nama dia macam soup petola gitu
dengan bihun bihun [eh] ke suun
so
i think it's suun this dia macam bihun but it's like (um)
i don't know it's similar to glass noodles yang dari japan so i think that's what it is then apa lagi [eh] (um) ya that's what i had today and i had a sip of tea
today (um) because you know (uh) work's getting really really stressful jadi macam you know we just had have a sip of cam~ cammomile tea then (err) lepak lepak [dah] itu [jer]
then okay let's (uh) start talking about next thing shall we talk about fruits still or shall we move on to another topic
okay if it's up to me i would like to talk about apa [eh] apa yang best [eh] nak berbual okay let's talk about our favorite music
okay what (uh) which artist do you listen to the most
(um) kalau kita berbual pasal
artist okay kita berbual pasal genre first okay we'll talk about fo~ genre my favourite genre is very (err) much the same as hers (um) it's very wide i don't have a specific genre
okay but
(um) i wouldn't say okay my favourite song
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what i mean macam
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in d i think you all know this song [lah] macam okay that song is my favourite song
it
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that i rarely have jadi macam bila dengar [jer] macam [oh] my god my emotions semua keluar but like
that's just what you feel about it
(err) i rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that i'm talking about it now
okay so (uh) besides that (err) canon in d [eh] that's one genre that i don't listen all the time but that that's a song that i really really like above all the other songs that i hear
and okay
let's talk about the next genre my next genre yang favourite itu let's see i think for now i don't have it's a tie between (err) western songs dengan
k-pop
they both have very distinct (uh) features they both have
however macam similar dia itu macam sama tapi lain [lah] you ge~ you ge~ you get what i mean
dia punya upbeat dia punya instrumental semua sama tapi it's just that the language probably different kot macam that's the distinct difference
okay and then (um) my favorite song from western and let's see i think it's u_s_a paling banyak lagu-lagu western dekat u_s_a kot that is the one that's very popular
i i would say lagu (um)
(uh) dah lupa tajuk dia
[ah] i will never let you down by rita ora i think that song is very empowering
besides that okay i i also listen to spanish songs and
[ah] i tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini but
it's called #mevoy# m e v o y daripada [eh] the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice dia
the the background music has this (um) hum
accordion and i don't know it's just it's just very
it's very cute like when you listen to the song you would think of being in the
feel and what not
okay because we're (err) recording at a very late time because my sister just got back from work so please
just
hold on we still have about twenty minutes left like less than twenty minutes left
everything is going great
apa lagi [eh] [ah] [oh] ya so that song in from spain i don't know if he she's from spain i main asal asal [jer]
sebarang [ah] apa lagi [eh] okay from korea i guess i would say my favourite song is
entah banyak man i have a lot of groups that i like
(err)
i cannot name any of them i'm so sorry
then (err) okay i also because (err) this is my family is an (um) indonesian family so kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada indonesia juga [lah] so (err)
we are actually from
jawa pulau jawa
or
we would say it as pulau jawa
that's where we come from and then lagu-lagu from there is semua
variety juga [eh] macam they have (err) songs yang macam western western gitu dia orang pun ada songs macam ballad
dia ada genre genre [ah] koplo [oh] my god koplo my favourite genre
it's dia macam traditional gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu bar~ lagu-lagu barat
that's very interesting (uh)
we'll have this (uh) genre thingy conversation in another recording [lah] [eh]
so ya
lagi [eh] ya so that's my favorite music okay kalau let's say your favourite food apa what's your favourite food
talk about it
i mean i'm i'm feeling it right now cause ya i mean tak boleh tak boleh avoid [lah] pasal kita berbual pasal makan [kan] so automatically as human beings [kan] kita first thing berbual pasal makan [jer] mesti fikir pasal makan betul tak
betul exactly but [eh] tadi you berbual pasal tenderfresh [kan] i tak pernah [seh] pergi tenderfresh is it
is it murah ke mahal ke
sure sure sure but
it's okay i mean (err) okay kalau macam okay li~ (err) for me [kan] kalau makanan favourite i is
it depends [ah] it doesn't have to be western but honestly my okay
i categorize my favourite food dalam dua
categories tahu macam satu i like (err)
satu is comfort food dengan lagi satu is food
that
i okay comfort food ini [kan] is the cate~ the the category for comfort food ini [kan] is the type of food that i can eat
everyday tak jelak-jelak like
tak bosan bosan every time every time i can just i can eat that everyday literally tapi kalau macam let's say kita berbual pasal (err) the food that really like macam
the the one that tastes so good but you can only have that like once in a while as a treat
okay so my first one my comfort food [eh] is bakso mi bakso i don't know if you guys know that
that's the that's the type of (uh) indonesian meatball soup that exist
in this region so we can find that easily in any parts of indonesia (err)
mungkin dekat singapore ada singapore definitely ada
tapi kalau dekat malaysia i'm not so sure dekat brunei pun i tak tahu sangat
but definitely dekat indonesia dekat singapore ada confirm
so that's my comfort food (err) mi bakso
i would have a lot of sambal to go with it and i also have [ah] pansit goreng
pangsit goreng in (um) english is basically just a fried #wanton# [lah] [kan]
that's that's that's about it
i like to have that because i like my food to be hot
(um) if it's soupy i want something crunchy to go with it
i know it's like a little bit like !whoa! apa [sia]
so yeah
then my foo~ food that i would have once in a while as a treat would be
i would say (err) korean b_b_q
but that's like really macam once in a while gila like when i have money that i'll get that
kalau tak no usu~ usually my friends would be the one that would bring me there treat me
i feel bad but you know it's a it's a good treat i mean kalau macam birthday [jer] [kan] macam confirm da~
confirm dia orang plan dekat situ situ juga pasal they know that i love the k b_b_q
and they really really
!aww! really nice friends shout out to them
okay so now we talk about favorite food apa lagi [eh]

you know why it's because [kan]
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day [what]
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous (uh) homework [lah]
the later you do the more you'll remember

it's like
okay for example [eh] you
i don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember [what]
until now i still do that
[ah] [lah] primary school not that hard

in my own world in my own bubble you know shiok sendiri
and then apa tu in secondary school more people seem to like me so i talk more to them then i became the leader sort of (mm)
that's how i got into dikir [what]
it was because
ya at first #hannah# say (err) we got this this and then we need people then i was like okay [lor] sure [lor] then just join
then every there everyone there was so nice and i feel i liked it
so i just joined it
but it was kind of
how to say i don't think i want to relive my secondary school live
cause so much drama
[oh]
sometimes i was the middle actually it's hard to say [lah] there was this [one] big drama i think in sec four
i wasn't i wasn't in any of the side
but then i didn't i really didn't like it
ya
how to say
not the whole cohort [lah] but the whole
(err) apa tu the whole cohort for dikir and dance
ya the whole c_c_a
(mm) because we were the leaders [what]
like in sec four we're already leading the whole team
and then after that
got drama [lah] and then i was just like
ya and something that i wouldn't do
so when that person do i was just like (ugh)
was pissed off [lah] then okay i will just say [lah] it was #hannah#
the one on one end was #hannah# the other end was #azirah#

i remember got that one time
there was this game we're supposed to play it was a spoon in your mouth and then you have to balance the ping pong ball
ya ya
and one of this this one girl was picking on this other guy
he's a very small guy [ah]
and then last time i was very i wasn't big [lah]
but i was bigger than the rest for some reason
which is hard to ya it's hard to imagine right cause right now i'm the smallest person
you know last time i was big (err) kind of big
bigger than everyone else
[kan]
ya and i was very how to say gangster
[ah] gangster ya and then after that
he was picking on this other guy then that guy apa tu was starting to cry not cry [lah] he was like tearing up
was his name #afiq# i think his name was #afiq# he was a really small guy
no [lah] but he was just [ah] he's a very small kecil kecil pendek pendek
like those flimsy
you know and then she was pic~ she was picking on him and then after that i was just like
si kurap of course i didn't say [lah]
i was just like what
(uh) [oh]
sorry
sorry

[a'ah]
sweet nya
annoying
then nanti you nak tengok cerita apa
[oh] that's some random thriller show right
what you mean bridge the cursed bridge
so is the cursed bridge
so it's about a bridge
i don't know now got what movie
can we watch the hunt
intruder we already watch
greenland
want to see this one of the worst show in the world
greenland apa lagi
to be honest kan i don't know how they record
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
like macam mana macam mana dia orang record
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
so then tiba tiba kerja continue continue continue then (err)
april [kan] lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
but what if they start recording okay tak apa [ah] then that means the movie wouldn't be out [what]
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
i mean pernah [lah] macam let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel [kan]
then macam [oh] disney channel then got #mulan# then tengok [ah] then like [oh] whatever
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
ya then the i think like was it because of the dad macam rasa
disappointed pasal anak dia perempuan so tak ada orang yang boleh carry on
[oh] so which #mulan# have i been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would #mulan# do that
what do you mean by no choice
i think i watched [lah] but i don't remember [lah] [kan]
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about #mulan#
so #mulan# [kan]
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
okay what do you mean by terpaksa because if she's terpaksa [kan] okay at first she's a guy [eh] she's a woman
woman is not required to go for this [one] [what] this [one] n_s
ya woman cannot go
but then why is sh~ she forced to go
[oh] okay okay okay i
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
tak tak pernah tengok that's like okay i watched the movie but i don't know what the hell the movie is about
i watched before
dia
no no no i watched already you see
#mulan# go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then (err)
she she sakit then she baring i think sick or whatever i don't know
then the doc~
[ah] sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check (err) then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander (err) leader [ah]
[meh] she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie [what] right
she got caught in the se~
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
#hans#
so is #mulan# like
based on the real life
orang tengah berbual pasal #mulan#
let's finish the #mulan# first [lah]
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
#wushu# finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay #wushu#
#wushu#
okay #wushu# then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why i just help me understand
no you make me make me understand #mulan# first then i'll make you understand #aladdin#
what do you mean i know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
[oh] so even okay the dad tak boleh pasal dia sakit
tapi in the go~ in that government even though kau sakit ke apa [eh] sorry
even though if you sakit
okay even if you sakit or not tak kisah you have to go is that the rule
so the the #mulan# dia macam kasihan [kan] that's why she left that note
(oo) makes sense
nineteen sixty five [eh]
!wow! that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about #aladdin#
okay [ah] honestly i think it's stupid [ah] because
okay because
she don't let me drink water [ah]
cause he
cannot [meh]
then you want me talk for one hour no drink [ah]
!huh!
okay
dia pasal
this one guy
[eh] wait how's the show [ah]
how how did he find the lamp
[oh] what to curi
at the lion place
ya the lion cave
know your facts man
okay whatever okay
so in the
(err) go inside the movie [eh] go inside the cave
then he climb climb climb get the lamp then he rub the lamp [ah]
he met the genie inside he met the genie inside the cave
ya
ya
ya
you know #aladdin# is the monkey [what]
#aladdin# was just like on the cliff
tell me your wish
then they sing a song
but i don't know the song is in the original movie or not is there a song in the original movie
then they sing song
then they rub then he rub rub rub already ask for the first
that was the monkey's first wish
ya that was the genie's first wish
(oo)
okay whatever then after that
the three the three wishes no we have to end this
podcast
no tak the first wish yang dia buat is dia nak jadi prince
know your facts
the first [one] is is he wants to be a prince of
(mm) i don't know [lah] what's the name
you asked what
ya i'm telling you how it goes
so the three wish is the want to be prince
then second wish
was it was it about the girl no it wasn't about the girl
no you let you tell me the second wish first then we talk about something else

i don't know [lah] i i i need to ask the maintenance guy
main slides are out the
tsunami
yang wave wave pool the big [one]
dia macam very mundane the wave not really like power

okay i'm going to kill mine for five seconds [kan] then you talk
but look at the wave okay
grey tuan

okay okay
[oh] cause my [one] dia gerak banyak [seh] maybe because my voice is loud [ah]
okay okay you see [ah] my my wave besar tahu

i guess but it look shouldn't be a problem right
but there shouldn't any there shouldn't be any m_r_t [what] you're supposed to be in an enclosed room
ya just kidding
okay so the second wish
but we haven't finished
okay okay okay okay let's talk about (um)
so primary school i had no ex
don't have
don't have
there's this okay
there was this one girl yang
i was with macam sama sekolah
since nursery
so kita just grow like from nursery k one [eh]
nursery k one k two whatever whatever whatever [kan] sampai p six
we're together so our family very close from
this
then my adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas
so then dia orang macam kacau kacau my adik [kan] adik dia [lah]
but then i was just minding my own business
then my mum you know [lah] my mum you know ac~ actually any mum
kalau they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume yang kau orang ada benda
ya so begitu [jer] [lah] tapi
it was just like macam
how to say [eh]
a topic in macam mak bapa berbual
they both talk talk talk talk talk talk talk then
bila primary six
after p_s_l_e [eh]
[kan] then i tak tahu kenapa [ah]
then macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa
ya allah [eh] wait [eh] belum habis [eh] jap
ya so macam (uh) apa ni
suka nak jumpa that kind of thing
so that time i don't know why i had the balls to do it
so just straight tell her
[ah]
macam cute [kan] p six
[eh]
[eh] [eh] [eh] [eh] dia ni
!ee! p one

so p primary school got four guys for different guys
then secondary school
but we didn't start with secondary school we start with primary school
[eh] wait are we not supposed to have the red
mark is it cause it's too loud
okay (um) i'm so sorry (err) there was like three red marks but then i think

but i think i think my [one] is amplified [eh] like berbual
tak pasal i berbual biasa tahu this is considered normal to me tahu but then it's like act~
okay then i just shut up [lah] [kan]
okay i i mean i've been talking for the past twenty minute [ah] so now your turn
okay okay you talk you talk i shut up i shut up i shut up i shut up

but were they together
for how long

who knows you jealous now
why
(mmhmm)
i can see that
i can see that
i don't see that
no [lah] it's fine [lah]
at secondary school [eh] primary school i was like more of a yes man
yes man is like
you know there's in a group there's that [one] that takes charge macam let's say kalau you nak keluar
there's that one guy okay [lah] kita gini [ah] then everyone macam okay [ah] go [ah] no problem macam yes
so there's that one leader in that group
and there's one joker in a group
usually the joker is either small or fat
[kan] it's always like that joker is always small size or fat
yes
gemuk
actually when the ro~ robot tu dengar gemuk
then the robot ro~ dengan a_i dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk
okay
so ya there's leader ni
and the rest [kan]
actually just just two people tahu
then the rest [kan] is the yes man
so macam let's say okay
who
i wasn't like it's more of me like ya ya background dancers ya
so everywhere they go [kan] [ah] okay [lah] jom [ah] like then okay [lah] pergi makan [ah] okay [lah] jom [ah] jom [ah] main bola [ah]

if you were to drop anything [ah] you know where it will land or not
badminton court
yang public punya i don't know it was raining or not i don't think it wasn't [ah] that's why they panic

so kita main frisbee
then my class was just winning like every single game [ah]
i don't know how
[kan] okay dia punya frisbee punya court [kan] dia macam let's say okay there's one triangle [kan]
okay you imagine this triangle [eh]
then you draw two lines inside
so this is the field this is the goal this is the goal so maybe you just throw to your team mate that's in this (uh) right rectangle he score
so what my team did
kita okay my rule [kan] at that game okay dia i think is seven versus seven or something like that
so
i will just in the middle again all i had to do
was to capture that intercept the frisbee from the opponent
okay
so once you okay let's say i scoring this [eh] i scoring here [eh]
so i kat tengah tengah main main main ambil frisbee [kan]
i will throw to one guy at the back
this one guy at the back
just throw to him
then this guy will just throw the frisbee to daniel you kenal daniel [lah] [kan]
ya just throw to daniel
ya but daniel [lah]
and then catch and we win
every time [oh] just like that gitu gitu gitu pass belakang gitu dah
one point

okay [lah] i will try [lah] this monday when i meet him
(mm)
portrait the fuck
(mm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
!aiya! i i give people the benefit of doubt [lah]
so anyway (um) so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump [lah] i think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this [one] [ah] this [one] i think last year
last year or last two years
i think so
ya
[eh] no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so (um) the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
this girl you know macam pergi date semua [kan] he she doesn't even want to be macam macam sekarang kita tengah lepak dekat macam playground gini kita dua [jer] [kan] let's say you are a guy
she doesn't want that
macam berdua-duaan abeh lepas tu kalau macam nak pergi
tengok wayang cinema macam dua orang even though there's there are other people but
is tetap macam korang dua orang [jer] [kan] in a dark place also she she's not comfortable with it so
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and (um)
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that i am not sure because
i think she has already said [lah] what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good i'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
(um)
that's the thing i don't i don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should i don't know i never ask
how he ya
ya so dengan dia [kan]
macam i think he is ready
ready to settle down i think [lah] almost there [lah] but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me i'm not ready i'm sure as hell not ready man i need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if sh~ if i think he really likes this girl [lah] but then this girl wants to get married
but i don't understand why he cannot pursue that
(mm)
tak she didn't
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason [ah]
ya
(uh) i never ask for details
(mm)
you know when they first went out right
sh~ he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really [ah] i no one has no one has asked me
at all
[orh] ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya
[ah]
!oops!
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
acts of what passive aggressive [ah]
[orh]
it's weird
in the media
[oh]
[ah]
because before this we talk before [what] and we clicked
got [lah] then
no message
agak then shut the fuck up there and there's so many people adopted messages and i don't give

#rashid# nama bapa nama bapa-bapa [sia] ya ya but anyway he was
he did all the things that i would want
ya
and then it's just that there was no chemistry and i just don't like him [eh] ya so even even like that right i was already on the fifty fifty then he did something that i really
i really i was really pissed off [lah] so which was wait wait which was he did ya he did something then
from then on i just cut him of because i i'm not fond of him

kau [tau] yang first date tu [sial] [ah] we went to picnic and he did all the work [sia]

we haven't seen each other for
long time
[kan] dah lama [seh]
#ira# camne dengan dia punya
ya dah tunang tapi (um) bila kahwin
i so happy for her [kan] macam
wedding [eh]
kahwin [eh] kahwin pakai gini cantik [seh]
[ah] nikah cantik
but do they have a
a great wedding
kau nak kahwin ke kahwin
dia ada size kita ke macam gini
what's that
[oh]
who's that see
why
okay jap later
nanti [lah]
hello baby
who's that siapanya baby [ah]
ni kau gi mana [seh]
[oh]
korang tolong [eh]
(mm)
okay [lah] dah [lah]
dah dah habis
dah dah okay
okay sini sini
mana kau punya web whatsapp
[ah] aku belum synchronise
so #fathul# i have a question for you (mm) if you have three wishes what are (err) what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes i think you would (err) void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that i would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that i can attain whatever i want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say (um) by giving others you feel happy i think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things (hmm) maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and af~ after all to live happily is what everyone wants [lah]
and lastly (err) the last wish that i want to have is to have the all the skills that i can attain in this world sebab bila you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good [ah] when you can do things yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat
(mm) and some skills that i want to have (err) maybe include (err) having all the capabilities to al~ all the knowledge that that exist in this world [ah]
(mm) pasal ilmu ni but dia ada banyak (err) rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi (hmm) kalau dapat ni best [ah] pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat (mm) and bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni (mm)
so ini adalah yang tiga wishes yang saya nak (mm) so kita (err) what about you #fathul#
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right i think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily (err) to us to some people to live happily is to have (err) the money and the wealth
pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh spend on whatever and what not and bila awak dapat spend whatever and what not then means (err) with every spending awak akan rasa this happiness
(err) so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy [ah] and intelligence also [ah] this is to me i think it relates to me also [ah] because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
(uh) so maybe for now we move (uh) to the next question which is (err) superpowers #fathul# what (err) if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
[ah] [eh]
actually i disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of [ah] the number of covid cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
i see where you are coming from but i still hold the view whereby you (err) by accident
kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang teleport ke tempat lain so dia jadi the source of this (err) kuman [lah] so dia yang spread to others
dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus (mm) so i stay over this view whereby teleportation ac~ could actually increase
the the
the amount of (err) infection or the possibilities of (uh) infection rate [ah] you have anything to argue
yes correct
okay mungkin awak dah cakap ini okay maybe saya agree sikit
maybe awak ada point over there
tapi yang contact tracing tu mungkin tak tak senangkan [lah]
pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia teleport kalau dia sendiri dah suka teleport
(mm) tapi ini interesting point of view (mm) so kalau awak tanya saya apa superpower yang saya nak saya nak power of regeneration
so contohnya (err) jari saya terpotong [ah] nanti dia akan heal sendiri
saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki dislocate [ah] dia genera~ re~ regenerate sendiri
so if this regeneration ability i can do whatever i want all the high risk activity or all the high risk (uh) ambitions that i have
or maybe (uh) i wo~ i can take risks without having worrying that i might (uh) injured too much of my body because i know that i have this regeneration ability
so i can also maybe (err) get into fights knowing that i can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case i will definitely win [ah]
provided i am strong [ah] and maybe with this regeneration
(hmm)
i can donate let's say some parts of my (uh) limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
(hmm) where i have this ability so i can do is (err) i request my leg to be cut off and then give away (err) in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard (uh) tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
(mm) what do you think about this regeneration ability
(mm) it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then i would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that i want to indulge in
dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak [kan] nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang high risk
itu me~ meminta kematian [lah]
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then i would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that i would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what i think is i can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having (uh) to be looked at or without (err) being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility i can do whatever i want without anyone noticing where i've gone or where where i'm heading towards cause i have this
(hmm) i have this
think of living in isolation (uh) maybe one maybe satu hari bila dah dah experienced everything yang kita nak [ah]
i want to be (uh) isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self [ah] to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when i when i'm around people at times i feel whereby their worries and problems (uh) affected me so with that sometimes i prefer to be alone
(mm)
how long maybe until i feel peace [ah] so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
i couldn't give a i ca~ i cannot give a number of years or months [ah] but maybe for a start maybe i will start by months [ah] then slowly maybe i will
(err) increase the number of the period [ah] slowly
okay mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya and betul [lah] yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena
bergaul dengan orang untuk mem~ untuk memahami keadaan orang
sebab tanpa kita me~ ber~ bergaul dengan orang we will never know what they face
(hmm)
we can never do something to improve the people around us
so for example bila kita tahu orang ini mengha~ menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong so kita akan mencari solution untuk menolong seseorang itu
so mungkin apa awak cakap (err) betul juga [ah] and tapi bila awak (err) saya
(hmm) hairan [lah] kenapa awak (err) question bila seseorang itu nak isolate maybe for months
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable [lah]
but it has to be looked in a certain way [ah] whereby the person
(err)
he is not affecting badly (uh) around the people (uh) (uh) he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state [ah]
(uh)
interesting question
in this case i think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
his child behind then anak-anak dia akan merana [ah] and
kalau months okay months maybe saya rasa maksimum (err) maybe not more than nine months [ah]
lesser than that mungkin okay
kenapa nine months sebab within this nine months (um) budak tu dia akan grow and after this nine months
they will change a lot [lah] so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small (err) goals small (err)
small achievement so this child will live without (uh) having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife [ah] he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife (err) agrees even with that i think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then i think he's free [ah] to do anything that he wants
do you think so
[eh]
okay soalan tu interesting sepuluh tahun mung~ means sebelas tahun yang lalu
sebelas tahun yang lalu okay saya definitely akan suruh diri saya (err) ini [ah] invest [ah] invest in bitcoin
(uh) cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you k if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what i would tell my ten year old self
(err)
if if i were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary [ah] but in terms of my life i would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams [ah]
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now i'm actually quite satisfied with what i've done
so i'm i will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart [ah]
(mm) so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when i said tell my ten-year-old self (err) i don't mean to start at ten years old what i meant was that maybe if i'm able to convince him then i would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich i think when i say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self [ah]
sebab at umur ten years old memang awak cakap betul (uh) nak nak faham tentang certain barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat convince [ah]
se~ se~ sa~ satu orang ni at ten years old dia akan ingat
and maybe along the way mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas and then dia akan start
(err) thinking back (err) apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak
[ah] adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya ten years bila saya ten-year-old akan betul
then maybe if i if i have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby i can reap what i sow today
(mm) and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
(um) what is a time capsule
yes yes i think i've heard of this before and i think so i think is not limited to videos (uh) i think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe i will start
start doing that myself and (uh) an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud [lah] or maybe just email yourself [ah] so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting i think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this i i remember seeing
(err) a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself (uh) since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is (err) i think about early thirties
it's interesting to see (err) how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe st~ (err) start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
so mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan (err) (um) akan interest awak [ah] pasal maybe one day juga awak akan jadi famous because of this [ah]
(mm)
k
you maybe you next we should talk about (um) near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
(err) some luck you managed to stay alive [ah] so for you (err) apa yang experience awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian
i need to add on apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati
okay for me my near death experience that i remember maybe quite clearly is whereby i went kayaking it was maybe when i was (err) i'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
it happens whereby we have to train where (err) train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so kita orang kena capsize habis tu bila capsize ini kita kena grab kawan kita punya kayak
and get back up [ah] so bila saya tengah practice capsize ini
instructor jauh so kita jauh daripada semua orang
habis tu kita bila saya tengah capsize kawan saya dia lose control of dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah capsize terus saya tap saya punya kayak
bila saya tengok terbalik ini so kawan saya punya bot tak ada
saya dekat situ saya stuck [ah] saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada skirt skirt ini akan prevent water from entering our kayak
nak keluarkan skirt tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh so saya tap kuat-kuat
tap kuat-kuat (uh) in hope that kawan saya dengar saya [ah] pasal saya tengah dekat
dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia so saya tap tap tap dia tak dengar alright bila dia dengar ini dia kata [ah] lepas incident dia cuba paddle tapi i tolak dia so dia nak paddle susah sikit
so saya dekat bawah air maybe for one minute [ah]
and that one minute i swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when i was (uh) stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience i almost drown cause i drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that i can recall (uh) is when i was
(err) riding bike (uh) it happens maybe due to
(err) rushing factor that i i wanted to go home fast cause i just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially i didn't know there was two lorry i thought it was just one so i was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so i decided to (uh) overtake him when i wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then i decided okay give him way to the right then i overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane i arise my engine to move on his left
that was when i realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time i had to break because i already speed up and when i break i
free still my back tyre and i almost skid but i managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened i did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience i i really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next (uh) topic that i have in mind which is (err) a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
(uh) ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
(hmm) whereas for me if i were to start a hobby ten years ago i would start skateboarding
cause now i see skateboarding as a interest so if i were to start maybe ten years ago i would definitely be good by now and
now that i want to learn is also skateboarding in fact i just started and what made me start is that (err) there was one one of the days i had a dream whereby i was skateboarding i don't know how to dream come about
but i was skateboarding and dalam mimpi tu saya rasa best nak bila skateboard ni rasa seronok [jer] and
bila skateboard tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun [oh] [eh] rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak skateboard [ah] [ah] dari situlah saya start
start skateboard tapi nak belajar skateboard ni dia susah sangat (err) it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
(um) synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where i start skateboarding
it's difficult because once i injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example (uh) few months back i accidentally sprained my ankle
(err) i landed wrongly on the board
and then i sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks i i feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks i tried to learn to get back on the board but i still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had i start ten years ago maybe i would i wouldn't have faced what i face today
but i see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so i wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe i would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future (um) a hobby that i would pick up is maybe
diving i have an interest for diving also and to me i find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go (uh) deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why i took (uh) i looked at is at it as interesting is because i tried to hold my breath in the water and i managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers i i'm actually a noob
and bila dapat tahan breath saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar (uh) free dive and that time bila kat swimming pool (uh) saya ada swimming dekat nine metre pool [ah] [ah] itu saya cuba
and dapat [lah] dapat sampai ke bottom tapi ter~ i was having difficulty breathing [ah] and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that i have
so you have anything to add on
okay
you may start
semalam we went to east coast park then
no actually like i fetch her at (um)

ya i think okay #macam# like you need to incorporate your whatever theories that we learnt in class right just #macam# relate it to the movie
ya
is about (err) old people like elderly something like that [ah]
then
like there are some #macam# theories and all that thing cause like up [kan] is about kau pernah tengok up
pasal apa
[ah] okay okay dia ada rumah ada rumah
ya cause the the story is like
is is cen~ centered (um) centered on like this old guy [pe] ya so i guess that's how like my prof thinks that it is relevant
join [ah]
(mm)
[oh] yang yang that time tu dia kata [ah] socially constructed
apa [ah] what was it [ah]
[oh] [ah] [ah] [ah]
#macam# make you make you !wow! gitu [ah]
[ah]
so
so what's your what's your take on it
asal asal still kena cause kau jiwa melayu apa
in the future but why is the future is now
okay like in the future i kau
mix
okay
okay
tapi like (um)
[ah] kalau #macam# like
a lot of like
(um) mix re~ [ah] apa mixed racial marriages gitu [kan] then anak anak dorang semua mixed like muka campur gitu [ah] then
like on their especially in singapore like on their i_c it will state
what race they are what
ya [lah] then it will never never end what gitu
apa [sia] lapan bangsa from where
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
like you are only from your mum and dad [pe] tak [kan] like you want to kira your nenek moyang semua
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
[oh] okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
tak ada kau kata like it's not (um)
(err)
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's punya race [eh] tapi at the same time kau kata like they shouldn't choose so
apa yang
like what's your point
(uh huh)
(mm)
like you say they shouldn't choose
[oh]
do you know that got some #macam#
[ah]
like kalau
okay kalau kau chindian [kan] like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the h_d_b race racial apa tu the quota that one right
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
(um) probably indian cause
cause like
i mean okay i don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
cause like kalau this one h_d_b
dorang [dah] ramai gila cina
then they need indian [pe] and then that their open slot is only indian like #macam# that open open #macam# the empty house is only open to indians
so kalau kau chindian then kau identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for chi~ [ah] indian
ya
[ah]
[a'ah] i i don't know if like we can jual like jual to melayu [eh] jual to india or not
then i know like you have to jual to like
probably the same race
[a'ah] [a'ah]
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to #macam# some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying [ah] so it's like
(um)
(uh) it's like a social social inequality cause kita minorities selalu
okay [ah] i don't want to say selalu cause it's too like absolute but
(uh)
(uh) banyak kali
(um)
!chey! dipinggir yes ya yes ya
ya dipinggir is like [ah] #macam# jadi outlier gitu [kan]
ya
(um) honestly aku rasa
okay honestly maybe for me like i still support it but is just that i feel like (um) there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of [ah] like #macam#
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now [ah]
so aku rasa #macam#
cause kalau tak ada quota ni semua [kan] confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation [ah] cause like #macam#
[ah] yes [ah] #macam#
kau imagine [ah] woodlands confirm kampung melayu [sia] woodlands #yishun#
#yishun# tak sangat #yishun# maybe like #yishun# maybe like chinese a bit ada indian aku tak tahu
[eh] [eh] kau takmo
yeah (um) abeh #punggol# probably
i don't know #macam# cina maybe
ya so to a certain extent i guess like it's justified but did you know that #macam# this (um)
this like racial quota right is only applicable to public housing so #macam# all those like private private properties semua [kan] #macam# like rumah sebuah sebuah semua
dorang tak ada [seh] that's why like they can get away with all this like
racial enclaves
ya
ya true [lah] true
ya and also #macam# there's a lot of like (um)
i mean this is what i learnt [ah] (um)
[ah] there's like two different kind of #macam#
[ah] like segregation so it's like in private housing private housing there's like the kau tahu #macam# dorm
that foreign foreign workers punya dorm so it's like
considered private housing [pe] so they like they have (um)
actually not dorm more like rental rental places so like they can choose their roommates kind of thing then
like [ah] for workers and from china semua they live together then from india bangladesh semua live together since like the segregation is there already and then also like in in like
like those big houses [kan] it's like that's the
(um) expats [ah] #macam# those orang putih then they tend to live in like bigger houses [pe] so there's the #macam# they are quite detached from our society
yes
(um)
i think
condo
maybe condo okay i have a like #macam# a dream house that

to i guess us
ya kau [dah] baca [ah] tu
skim
[ah]
okay okay
[ah] okay [ah] that's all [lah]
[dah] okay bye
(hmm) three wishes right
(uh) aku rasa wishes ni mesti lebih realistik [lah] tak boleh yang merepek-merepek [lah] okay kalau realistik wishes aku rasa aku nak get rich [lah] one of it [lah] one of it maybe untuk get rich
the reason aku nak kaya pasal actually (err) aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan
i want to help the poor maybe (uh) i feel that (err) it is my destiny to help others i feel happy and enjoyment when i help others
then kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi fit [ah] aku nak jadi fit aku fit aku rasa macam aku pergi lari [ah] (err) dekat #bedok# reservoir ke macritchie ke i feel that (uh) my body feels good [lah] so i think getting fit is one of the wishes that i want
then next (uh) the third wish i want to be i want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent i can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes i can achieve anything that i want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes #furqan#
(uh)
my views on what your wishes are it's actually (uh) is very good from what i see you are a people person like (err) like to give back to the community i think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and i really respect them
superpower okay so (err) we are moving from realistic to not so realistic [ah] okay so superpower kalau boleh aku nak teleportation teleportation kalau tengok cerita x men [eh] dia sikit-sikit macam night crawler
(err) so kalau teleportation i can go anywhere anytime that i want
so let's say i want to go to orchard and i'm at #tampines# i can just go there in a blink of an eye i don't need to take transportation like m_r_t (err) taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so i save a lot
i don't need to i save my time i save my money i don't need to interact with people i don't need to squeeze in the m_r_t i will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example covid nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation i think they spread of covid nineteen will be reduced so i think maybe maybe i would i would suggest the government to research on teleportation
i think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
(um) to a certain extent pasal [lah] tu (err) bila teleportation okay kononnya tak ada teleportation [eh] macam sekarang ni
kita dah kena expose more (err) how should i say it (uh) more unknowingly for example kita naik m_r_t kita squeeze squeeze dekat m_r_t
tak ke lebih bahaya kalau kita tak teleport
kalau kita squeeze squeeze naik m_r_t atau naik taxi grab driver ke taxi driver ke [ah] kita expose in that (uh) area kita duduk kat dalam m_r_t ke kat dalam kereta ke
kita dengan orang yang suspek tak kita tak tahu ni kita tak tahu dia ada ke tidak ni
untuk beberapa minit ini [ah] ada yang research cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang
jadi kalau ada measure measure contohnya macam (uh) sanitisation
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say (uh) for example i i share an example [ah]
let's say nak pergi giant okay i teleport to giant i take i buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then i teleport back
to my home then after that
i can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food (uh) food court i teleport to the place
then after that (uh) i eat then i back home teleport back home from there i think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay (err) you said it can increase because the person (uh) didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so (err) let's say you are not talking about teleportation you take~ you are talking about (err) going to work
i don't know that i have this disease i don't know that i have covid nineteen i have been infected with covid nineteen and then i am going to work
okay i'm going to work i took a bus i took an m_r_t i took m_r_t i took a bus and (uh) maybe i have a fifteen minute walk from m_r_t to my office
then i reach office to my office okay so i am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's m_r_t
there's (uh) maybe (uh) the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
i i'm i am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
and i rest at work and exposed again ini tak boleh kalau kita dah teleportation teleportation kita skip all the buses ni semua [ah] all the transportation ini exposure
we only expose to the office
[ah] which is easier to contact tourists
[ah] tak kan begitu
it is (uh) something
(err)
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
itu haram tu
i agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know (err) be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
(err) i think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one (err) mental health
i think k maybe if you will say one two days of (uh) being alone just to reflect on yourself
i think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe (uh) act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so i think it can be tiring but (err)
not exposing to them can be quite how should i say it (uh)
i can't put the feeling into words
i feel that (err) you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them i feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what i believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to (uh) ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that (err) you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then i think we feel i i feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months i question that actually i'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means (err) if a person is a father
okay so (err) what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of (uh) two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man (uh) should isolate himself
for months
i feel (uh) i i agree to a certain extent (err) where
let's say this person have (uh) no responsibility maybe (uh) no parents no siblings no children no wives then (uh) i think it is okay i guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say (err) okay maybe one or two month is not so bad i guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second i phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should i say outdated
like okay for example (uh) a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
but then when this (err) banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan (mm) di~ apa ni orang kata
kena pergi kursus [ah] kursus-kursus (um) macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer
menggunakan aplikasi word excel kenapa teknologi telah berubah
jadi mereka dah behind time so ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin okay kut
okay [lah] [eh] jap (err) kita (err)
saya teringat something [ah] yang pasal teleportation [ah] kita (uh) ni [eh] reverse sikit [ah] [eh] teleportation [eh] kononnya teleportation ni kan boleh kita boleh teleport
(um) bila kita umur sepuluh tahun
(uh) kira-kira ni macam so called macam time machine begitu [ah] (uh) macam advance yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya invention tapi tak tahu [lah] dah ada ke tidak ni
(uh) jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh teleport reverse time [eh] maybe kita teleport ten years old
nak cakap apa dengan awak punya (uh) diri tu okay kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia
actually (err) pretty similar [ah] on on the investment part because (err) actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves (err) a lot
i wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do i have at ten years old do i really want to think about graphs statistics
i questioned it
(err)
if you were to tell me that investment is (uh) is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old i don't really think so
but i mean it it is good it is i mean you can you can grow your money but i think i prefer
to not do it when i was ten when i am ten
i changed my mind maybe
i'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe (err) last time i was maybe too good [ah] i'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe i will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now i'm twenty four years old i should not be naughty already i'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society (err) when they see [oh] a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now i'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think i'm crazy
so maybe i will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much (err) about monetary (err) maybe maybe on investment but maybe i will tell my mum about it
when i go to when i when i meet my old (err) ten-year-old self i would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe i can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more (uh) gains from the investment
and because of what i said to her she might give this (uh) money to me a bit so like i enjoy more on life i can go travel
i can go (uh) anywhere that i want because (err) there's a certain level of (err) financial freedom i would say
second topic
[oh] my my memory memory is (err) de~ degrading
i lost my memory already i can't even remember what i said
[oh] i admit (uh) do you have you heard of (uh) about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the ne~ the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what i trying to say
i see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep (uh) items
or (uh) photos [ah] to then (err) to keep in a secret place or maybe (err) some people put it in a bank even
like for me i did some video (err) it's like a conversation with (uh) my old my my oldest self so let's say (err) my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but i'm still waiting for i i did it actually (err) when i was i think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually i'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so (uh) i just hope i don't lose the video [lah] actually i don't even remember where is it now
(hmm) i like to be famous yes
but
but (uh) i think is (uh) if i were to take myself a picture of myself (err) every month i think i would forget to do that easily
so i'll consider it i'll consider it
(err) salah satu (err) experience yang aku pernah mengalami [ah] adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit [lah] [ah] tapi dia real [ah]
dia (err) it was when i went diving okay so i went scuba diving (uh) at #tioman#
one of the nicer waters in (uh) asia that (uh) that is cheap you can go is affordable so i went there as a as a basic (err) trainee
or open water diver course i went i went for a course open water diver course
so (err) i think there is (err) what what i faced was i forgot to breathe
so i thought i was suffocating i was diving normally was diving i was enjoying the the views of fishes and sud~ suddenly i forgot to breathe and i was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have bre~ you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
i think i forgot to breathe and it's kind of (uh) funny where
i was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know i am so called so called suffocating
so because of that (err) short forget to to breathe i think there's one of the near death experience that i faced then (uh) another (err) much more serious (err)
(uh) experience that i faced is a so called a near miss i would say a near miss
where it makes me (err) makes me (err)
bulu roma ternaik [ah] bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku
jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga so (err) saya tengah bawa macam biasa
tiba-tiba (err) saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan (err) di road tersebut [lah] di jalan raya tersebut
jadi (err) bila saya bawa
then (err) maybe it was at the i can't really remember it was (uh) i think five six years ago so it was at the i think one of the junction near expo
so i was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that (err) jam brake
i see i see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to (uh) go into (uh) into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so i was i was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so i thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then (err)
he didn't so as a singaporean i will sit when i see an am~ amber i'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and i
was lucky that i was wearing a seatbelt usually i don't really wear seatbelt because i feel that (err) it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
i was relieved that i was wearing a seatbelt because if i didn't wear a seatbelt i'll fly out of my lorry and
may might i might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually (err) and even (err) just now i was riding a bike
(err) due to my negligence i almost caused an accident where i thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so (uh) i was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
the person a a driver the driver that (uh) was (err) almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and i also swerved so luckily (err) nothing happen tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja
tapi itu pun okay itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa
[ah] itu adalah (uh) experience saya [lah] yang near death experience or rather i would say a near miss [ah] how about you #furqan#
!oho! dah macam pantun berkerat
(uh)
i agree on that point where the accident happens when
(err) someone is (err) or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of (err) delivery riders who is (uh) riding very recklessly around (uh) (uh) on the road [ah] because they are
(err) chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe (uh) road (uh) sorry (uh) lorry drivers lorry drivers
yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen (uh) yang tu semua [lah] (uh) dia orang kerja trip
lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut number of trip kalau dia orang
(err) less trip
kan kurang [lah] gaji dia orang [ah] mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya (err) sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak
(err) lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin (err) anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa [jer] [lah] dia punya dia punya alasannya (err)
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and i agree i agree on that it causes some negligence because (err) (err) when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example (err) if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so i think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can (err) plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering (uh) maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that (err) we are not so (err) i would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if i give you some or maybe (uh) three hobbies one is (err) maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that i will start (err) ten years ago something i will start maybe soccer
(err) i would know i'm i'm not really a good (uh) soccer player or i can't really play soccer that well maybe because (err) i didn't play or i didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now i realise that (uh) soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me (err) easily when whenever (err) people especially (uh) in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said [oh] let's play soccer outside
(uh) this way you gain (uh) relationship or some
re~ relationship ya i would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so i guess soccer would be one if i were to start ten years ago
and (err) in the near future maybe i want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems (err) i think is is is quite interesting
(err)
because i because my my my social media friends are always pull some (err) activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me i'm not sure (uh) how would i do but it is really something that i want to try
in the future what hobby that i want to try is golf because (err) in the future i see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what i know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals (err) so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less (err) how should i say formal
less formal so it is it is i think (uh) as a business man i think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
(err)
so far i think [eh] all the (err) hobby or ambition are very subjective so i see where you're coming from (err) we are kind of (uh) similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so i think we are brothers
okay
so these days
aku kat rumah
buat crochet [jer] [kan] tapi aku macam nak try
to design more
benda other than just macam bag pasal aku nak jual a few bags
tapi macam i want to try cardigan [lah] skirt
tapi aku takut because i need like macam time to try it out
macam model it out you know takut dia macam for sizes and all so
ya i think i want to i need your help
to macam
advise me on the sizing and then macam so what kind of design people is interested in
so ya
because my instagram shop is not
progressing at all
i don't know
cause i don't have like banyak content cuma aku aku post apa yang aku ada dulu
tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya self bukannya orang beli then macam
sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku [jer] i don't know how to macam reach out to
because you know instagram ada yang promote punya function tapi kena bayar aku tak ada duit dah [lah] aku tak
tak dapat tak payah cakap pasal kerja tapi aku tak ada kerja macam untuk tanggung aku punya
(uh) hobby punya expenses [kan] so ya
hobby is hard i want to try new things you also want to try new things right
but tak ada duit so what's the things yang kau nak try
[oh] i think
aku start pasal aku ada duit [kan] so aku the first step i did was aku beli mesin
that's that's the first step [lah] then even after that
that step i felt very macam !alamak! abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli ruler
apa ni
all the materials [lah] because you know starting a new hobby is always so expensive but it's always been my interest and actually now is my passion [ah]
but i i still have not macam masuk seko~ class atau macam any course yang will teach me
professional way ya so i think itu pun aku nak kena belajar so kalau if you want to join me
i think we can always join yang macam you know the skillsfuture kind of thing
yang i saw at instagram the one that you i send you that time then you were like (uh) but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
aku nak join the highest level the terus buat baju kurung that [one] you know
ya but i think if we want to do we can find a time then we join this course together you know there's this thing that this (um) school
yang that time i was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
yes
i think that [one] also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like macam after school (uh) part time i think we can join that
i mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents punya
you can just start [lah] you just go for it just invest a bit of money on like necessary items
ya
(mmhmm) yup
ya aku pun rasa sama i think that's why i started my shop because i've been following so many macam kedai dorang semua sama like i don't know what i think i there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon [ah] they hyping all these kedai too much no offence
i saw one kedai dorang jual tote bag like
like basic gila tote bag dia abeh ada macam embroidery macam
macam pathetic [ah] to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out i'm like [oh] my god like i can do so much better
and some more kita [kan] daripada artistic punya course
that's why we always feel like [oh] no we can we can apply what we know and we can do so much ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya that's why that's why (um) apa ni
that's why because because dekat instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always kita selalu macam bilang you are artist you you gonna charge
punya harga mahal it's a piece of art it's a service people not tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu [pe]
so just charge lebih jangan jangan cause some more kalau kau charge low nanti other artist kena macam compare macam then the customer macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila
ya that [one] satu [lah] itu betul
tapi macam
apa ni benda-benda simple gitu
okay [lah] like i i guess rezeki dorang [lah] you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine atau machine just help you stitch atau
is it tulis letter punya atau
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm) pasal my brother dia selalu buat commission work
so orang yang order dia punya commission work is like kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia
tapi dia pergi charge murah [seh] like a four
oil paint [eh] not oil acrylic punya paint they charge twenty dua puluh dua puluh dolar [jer] hello i'm
untuk dia senang [lah] memang untuk dia senang dia dia draw satu kali satu malam pun dah habis
so dia cakap tak akan aku nak charge mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap
benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang there's people out there yang charge benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau just macam
aku agaknya tak confident [lah] [eh] macam insecure macam aku nak jual tote bag aku berapa
macam mahal sangat kawan that kind of thinking you know
but ya so i think kita people like us kalau nak
buat benda-benda gini we should just do because we i don't think we have like necessary knowledge in macam style no offence
no offence some people just no style
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing macam no offence like
like instagram shops now locals semua macam they all have the same style
and people dig for it so
[ah]
atau macam
apa ni
scrunchie ada banyak kedai scrunchie
pasal scrunchie senang nak buat
just (uh) just kain straight abeh kau tahu getah abeh jadi scrunchie ya
boleh [lah]
tak prof~ professional
looking [lah] ya
but i like how macam sekarang punya instagram shop is like a baru punya like a new platform to jual and you don't have to take rent right itu satu
macam kedai physical kedai [ah] tapi dorang pun aku follow a few kedai yang buat baju
and is (um) free like made to order
so kau kau beli dia jahit dia tak jahit dia tak stock up
so kau kau beli pastu dia jahit pastu you can
(uh) measure yourself and then you have a like a tailor fit
baju ya i think that's very important
satu kali ni aku nak tidur abeh aku teringat [eh] i can't believe people throw around that that that term free size
apa kejadah tu free size
how can anybody have the same baju badan like kalau macam aku dengan kau kita bukannya
size jauh sangat tapi kau [kan] tinggi sikit
like i don't know my my legs bigger like you cannot just free size like you know t-shirt
m s s tu pun macam okay at least you got like a few even though is like usually just s m and l
tapi
ya what about all those people yang tu macam kecil sangat atau besar sangat dorang kena dorang kena macam
apa ni grief give up sacrifice their style just for their size like very sad
(mmhmm)
which is like lagi mahal [lah]
which is sad why must we pay extra just for having our body you know like lol
(mmhmm)
m [ah]
[oh] ya
it's like a range
(uh huh)
[ah] tu pasal
(mmhmm)
loose
lagipun sekarang macam kita our world or our like i don't know maybe people around us or my generation [kan]
kita more to macam a sustainable lifestyle
so banyak orang choose to beli
local atau secondhand atau thrift tapi
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand atau hand me down dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju [kan] kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal
pasal apa ni
itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam smaller than people so kalau banyak orang yang macam
besar sikit then macam mana dorang nak like
sustainable dorang nak macam [oh] macam long don't buy from fast fashion tapi actually fast fashion pun baju semua kecil [lah] tapi
ya that's why aku suka sangat dengan this new macam trend of kedai instagram yang buat
custom fit is i think is very important i think kalau aku boleh jahit i think that's one of my goal macam
i like it's always at the back of my head to buka kedai baju [lah] actually tapi just i don't have the necessary
skill tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak [seh] aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai like yes
like yes the baju really is your baju it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your apa
your apa ni
wrist length ya
and like lagipun baju yang tailor is always last longer
aku ada banyak baju nenek aku daripada
tahun pasal [kan] ada tag ada nombor [tau] and nombor dia belum nombor singapore yang
modern punya you know macam nine tu ya number dia lima or something like that how old is that ya
yup
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
loop garms
[orh]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) chris #jericho#
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mmhmm)
pasal pasal (um)
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting [kan] thrift is macam cheap murah
so kalau kau sustainable is when you buy something that already exists tapi macam at the same time
[ah] so you don't have to buat benda baru so it's not wasteful [lah] kirakan tapi kalau vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is mahal hundred dollars for a t-shirt for people apa [seh] t-shirt one hundred dollar tapi macam is
it got it got apa ni is valuable is got context [ah] there there's a history to it
lagi
lagi apa ni
(uh) (uh) abeh yang thrifting ni secondhand murah macam kat lucky plaza pasal is
people tak nak i feel like value a a a object is based on the
people nak ke tak nak is demand versus supply [lah] that's what makes the price
so ya i think kalau orang confuse i think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price kalau two dollar that's not vintage macam
entah kenapa
(mm)
collection like people like collect things like (um)
[oh] ya lagipun
benda yang kita kena tanya ni actually kenapa baju sekarang murah
what makes it so like orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah
cause there's actually a cause behind that murah you know
pasal orang yang sepatutnya dia bayar tak dibayar
until very sad that's why aku macam sekarang aku dah hundred percent
(uh) prevent myself daripada beli baju dari uniqlo cotton on
ya actually aku tak beli baju baru [lah] actually pasal
actually no offence tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju and baju kau semua lawa semua my size like i want to give people like i want to macam kasi kasi tapi !alamak! lawa pula pakai [lah]
abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar family aku dorang semua pakai baju kau [sia]
like the whole family went except for ya [oh] my god
you give me i i wish orang lain pun ada this kind of macam relationship with friends atau macam ka~ macam
nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung [kan] dia orang kampung boleh gather baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil
dia kasi aku so aku selalu ada these people around me yang akan kasi baju but then i i don't think other people
have that kind of privilege ya
so got a lot of people cause i some sometimes i ada orang tanya aku pasal this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get baju yang macam
bukan fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion tapi actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad tapi susah [lah] [kan] tapi ya i also don't have macam
much to say other than macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau tu [jer]
yup
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
melayu
sorry sorry sorry
(mmhmm)
ye pasal [kan] actually kalau kau fikir fikir balik [kan] all this (um) wasteful punya life
cepat sangat is like so fast like it's sudden
macam actually kita yang boleh nampak [lah] the drastic changes actually dulu-dulu
how to say [ah]
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish lelaki dia nak create plastic bag pastu dia nak
dia nak he wants it to be a more sustainable (uh) alternative [tau]
dia tak nak pakai tree dia tak nak pakai paper bag pasal is from trees
abeh dia tak nak pakai macam cloth bag because it's (uh) to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is macam [oh] macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang
kita salah guna [lah] kita ada convenience kita buang after every use which is
that that whole term of disposable is very
crazy to me disposable how can satu benda kau buat susah-susah
terus kau buang plastic bag macam factory kena
lagi kalau kau belajar chemistry you know how all this thing is created daripada element dorang semua
kalau if you really look from the root [kan] kau macam [oh] my god i can't believe i throw that after one use you know
[eh]
(uh huh)
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
effort is put to
so going back to yang cakap pasal kedai instagram and orang sekarang banyak buat benda
the (uh) it's a ba~ like bagus yang orang sekarang (uh) try their best untuk belajar all these skills balik buat apa ni
just buat benda-benda simple [lah] tapi at least dorang ada apa
ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini once you buat you akan
hargai you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
that's why you you know like you shouldn't take all these thing for granted you know
once you because we are so jauh daripada the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people kita tak
tak macam [eh] [a'ah] [eh] macam mana macam sayur sayur orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang
ya so
it's actually not our fault [lah] it's just how time has changed abeh macam tapi #alhamdulilah# kita dapat this
ilham this know in our head that we get to apa ni
belajar [lah] just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
so that future generation
we we can lagipun kita bukannya sustainably more aware [jer] i think we just more aware of everything
include the discrimination
which is sad
ya
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
satu satu pending belum bayar
interested
satu lagi satu satu tengah buat
yes
(uh huh)
compared to that tote bag no offence
that's six fifty nine dollars
agaknya [lah]
okay anyway
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
seventy
(uh huh)
okay
(mm)
is it lagi mahal dorang akan
macam kat mana-mana advertisement tu or what
fashion
explore page nanti ada keluar [kan]
explore page ada macam yang fashion
shopping all that tu [kan]
(mm) (mm)
[ah] ya ya ya
pasal actually ada satu dua orang tanya macam berapa gitu tapi dorang overseas then
actually i can i can ship overseas tapi dorang macam [oh] okay thank you pasal i i think they prefer to buy local [lah] obviously leceh [kan]
ya but i'm just so happy that people people even ask
ya
ya from like u_k like that
cause actually crochet kat singapore ada a few kedai crochet kat singapore you know the #farah-lola# that [one]
ya that [one] but then it's like to me i don't really like singapore punya crochet punya
design design wise they more like for public friendly [eh] macam colour dorang macam
black grey tapi crochet it's still crochet but it's just like not as like my style [lah]
ya it's not like quirky ya pasal kat u_k banyak [seh] kedai
macam banyak gila and it's all so cute and i like most of it i like inspired from from dorang [ah]
aku tengok dorang that's why aku nak macam i think that's a good thing about social media kau tengok !alamak! what am i doing so kau pun
(um) do something about your life you know
ya
i love it too [oh] my god
lagipun kedai tu dia actually she used to work at kedai kain pastu pandemic kedai tu tutup
so dia selalu bawa balik kain yang dorang tak nak [tau] just scrap it's it's kirakan scrap tapi banyak [lah]
so dia bawa balik abeh dia collect over time abeh waktu pandemic ni dia jahit
dia jahit bag just simple bag it's all shou~ shoulder bag
lagipun dia dia baru graduate daripada university of textile or something like that [ah]
so
so i like her rezeki like so good [lah] pasal dia start baru waktu tu yang quarantine tu
abeh banyak orang beli habis tu sekarang all of her kain is dead stock
you know dead stock kain like no more like it's just orang tak nak macam she's already
having at home like that
her lining all recycled (uh) [ah] not recycled apa ni
upcycled ya
so good [lah] and the her design all so
cute she make it cute [lah] then the kain not that cute tapi she make it cute
abeh sekarang dia ada lagi satu size kau nampak
size dia panjang sikit sling dia abeh it's like big
ya !alamak! i think one day aku beli [ah]
tapi susah nak order tu dia drop terus kau kena order
pasal dia punya collection dia tak akan buat balik [pe] dia satu kali [jer]
damn
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
aku pun nak buat gitu tapi kalau buat gitu then aku kena constantly come up with new things
kau tahu tak tapi kalau orang nak yang itu aku macam [ah] okay [lah] aku buatkan kau pasal i obviously i want money right
but i also customer i also don't know [lah] actually i need to think about that [lah]
aku cuma buat aku tak tahu apa plan for my
plan
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
aku pun nak buat gitu but then
aku punya followers tak banyak sekarang so
tu [lah] actually kau tahu #farah-lola# [kan] dia punya design satu [jer]
cuma colour lain
so like everytime dia nak buat [kan] they just buat that thing and it's like how to say [ah]
design dia satu [jer] so kalau imagine
and she will drop that thing she will drop and say okay hari ni aku jual hari ni korang boleh pre-order
then people will
(uh)
order that [ah] senang kalau kau punya design satu [jer]
so you can keep doing that same design so you can stock up [lah] kirakan aku nak made to order actually if can that's why it's a bit
and some more she artiste [what] so it's easy to get
she artiste her model is #aisyah-aziz#
i can do that
(mm)
(mm)
on her on her main
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's why
and it's quite a small bag [lah] actually
tak ada
so like that's why ya aku hundred percent will like
except unless i make cardigan
i don't know how long it can last tapi macam kalau ada kain it will be more durable
it will be more durable tapi kalau cardigan [kan] there's not much weight to it kau taruk kat badan kau [pe] tapi kalau bag kau letak botol
taruk botol tapi it will stretch [ah] eventually no matter how tight i make it you know
ya then macam quite fun [lah] because aku follow a few crochet punya kedai and they all so supportive they always share story of the design they like
then got this one kedai she daripada philippine then she say [oh] (uh)

the acting is not that great the the s_f_x also not that great [lah] but
quite fun [lah] to pass time pasal sekarang aku dah tak kerja apa abeh tengah tunggu cari kerja [kan] so i just watch like whatever i can find [lah] on netflix then that popped out so i watch it it's not bad got four seasons and each episode macam empat puluh minit gitu
no it's british ya u_k
it's quite interesting [lah] i mean the storyline also not that amazing but it passes time
ya
the boys
on netflix
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
[oh]
okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
like what what's the storyline about like what basically happen
okay
amazon prime i don't have [sia] but might i might subscribe cause got a lot of like interesting shows i've heard and netflix is like running out of stories
isn't much left
ya
amazon prime
[orh]
tapi dia orang pun baru [pe] so that kind of standard [pe]
ya
(mm)
interesting
(mm)
i know you take forever to watch a show
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm) true
(mm)
abeh sekarang kau masih bayar untuk netflix
berbulan-bulan ya berapa [ah] dia orang naik harga [kan]
i think they did it was like fourteen the last time now it's like sixteen
[oh] great
!haiya! it went up
banyak benda [sia] naik harga my google drive also naik harga
ya they added g_s_t now
ya
(mmhmm) that day i received this
ya but i don't know [ah] i think not yet
i haven't seen any updates on it but i know google dah ada
true
(mmhmm)
tapi gaji sama
abeh nanti kau nak buat apa lepas lepas ni semua
[oh]
assignment apa [sia]
[oh] !wow!
what is it about
but what is your course like mainly about
!huh! okay
[oh] yes
i mean that's fun i guess managing a business
(mm)
(uh huh)
i mean it will get better [lah] i mean yang covid ni semua bukan like forever [what] they're working for a cure so maybe in a year maybe in a few months it will get better tak tahu [ah]
tengok [ah]
(mm) that's true
pres~
i don't know
i mean
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on cari kerja ke start business ke
kau nak buat business apa [sia]
apa
[oh] ya ya ya
i saw i saw your masks how was it
(mm)
but ada juga [ah] macam sikit
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
abeh kau masih beli benda kat habbo
(mm) masih spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
[oh] how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like jual your benda and quit or
(mm)
banyak sangat benda [kan]
(mm)
not like what if it gets worst macam like dia orang remove banyak benda from the game then orang semua macam tak nak main
then what happens
true
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but like
sad [sia] they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya i guess but like i mean i guess it is a market (uh) like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game [eh] without the players what do you have like an empty online page
(mm)
ya i mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
i think dia orang macam tak fikir they gonna cause
macam like to them at the end of the day kita like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
and that's what has been happening [what] like the
macam like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then orang masih beli [pe] it's not they like everyone just okay no i'm not gonna buy anymore
so i guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
[kan]
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
habis smite apa jadi
ya
[oh] really cause i know that day (uh) siapa naim asked (uh) #ilyas# to join but then #ilyas# said like the file was like twenty one g_b he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that [lah]
(mm) four days ago three days ago ya macam
the file got too big for #ilyas# so like p_c dia tak boleh download then sampai dia have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why [ah] ilyas dia cakap dengan aku like [oh] i cannot play with you cause sekarang dia main among us [jer]
ya
i think baru [ah] like three days maybe three days ago ya
i don't know but dia cakap dia delete semua benda tinggal yang programme files
like dia basically formatted his p_c ya
ya that's why that's why i don't understand why is it so big i mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
dia cakap dulu file dia macam fourteen g_b and then then after that it went up to sixteen lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu
it's probably him ya
i don't know [sia]
cause that time dia cakap dia punya app ada issue [lah] he couldn't log in so dia delete then bila dia nak redownload balik tak boleh
so dia format like remove everything from dia punya p_c lepas tu semua benda like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
ya and he spent so much on that game also [what] i mean we all have
i guess
i heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya i heard i don't know someone said spongebob then i was like i don't know
[oh] ya that one i heard also but i heard i heard spongebob i want [sia]
i don't know
that'll be cool though can you imagine yang character character dia semua jadi spongebob punya character macam mister crab sandy
cute [sia]
(oo) is there a snail god
i don't know maybe
who could be that
#kumbhakarna#
yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(oo)
and another person [orh]
(hmm) that's hard good looks or fit body
probably go with good looks but i mean pasal kalau
badan sapau pun i mean you can just go to the gym boleh pergi gym boleh pergi like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that tapi kalau nak muka baru i mean you can't really do that also [what] so probably good looks
(mm)
ya i guess banyak banyak duit at least about ten k for a nose or something i don't even know probably will be too much but like kalau nak like make yourself fitter and stuff boleh pergi lari and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
then yourself [leh]
(mm)
yes
ya
true
i mean to a certain extent semua orang pun macam at least a bit [ah]
true
(mm)
i mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
with like the fitness level and stuff i mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff [lah] kalau tak then there's really like no point
good looks
ya
(hmm)
after this i don't know never really have a plan today but kalau
no any other day (hmm)
kalau ni hari not much [lah] i'm just going to go home and like rest but like kalau esok maybe maybe i might go cut my hair
nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang haven't dah lama belum potong rambut so maybe i shall do that
and
ya
[oh] ya not not bald [lah] no [lah] like as in like short
i don't know i
rasa macam free [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
i just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
i don't know like
sekarang muka macam maybe i want to keep it a bit like short but not too short macam medium length gitu [lah] tak nak panjang sangat pun
but ya
kalau kat rumah (hmm)
netflix lepas tu
[ah]
main c_o_d and playing a bit of c_o_d
(um)
apa lagi [ah]
(mm) ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
(uh) no i haven't played cause like i don't know macam
main dengan naim and #muhammad# they very competitive and then like if #ilyas# is not there like can't really
like tag along so like
so i usually kalau dia orang dua [jer] then i i avoid
but like kalau the rest main then aku main [ah] cause i
!huh! really i didn't know
[oh] you didn't say
did you say [oh] i didn't see
i didn't
[oh] no he means he can't even play at all ya
i mean the same thing happened bila that time i tried to download kat my macbook apa
yang
i i don't play with my macbook i play on my p_c
cause i don't think they have a i_o_s punya file
ya
(mm)
satu benda
just one (mm)
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but i didn't
[oh] ya kalau satu benda dapat rumah [ah]
ya so you like
(mm)
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine i mean it's one item
[kan]
ya i mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
kau nak beli rumah punya susah
you don't need to work anymore i mean like you can work like small little jobs
i know right
ya basically that
i mean kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah then at most kau kerja untuk
maybe your savings and then like sikit untuk makan minum bills
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
[oh]
i guess
i guess
(mmhmm)
ya
but like i guess that's how the
the world has come to [ah] like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
#yishun#
we move to an island yang tak ada orang
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
i didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya i've heard of it i have never been there though
(uh) pergi [ah]
ya let's go look for that cow later
hantu
so what the cow is the hantu or like
is there
interesting we go find out [lah]
[kan]
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
i mean
maybe orang maybe like someone like dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa
macam buang kat sana kesian
dia lari
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
i don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
[oh]
i mean the
the latest the one i think just got removed what the kampung
i mean there's still one that exists that like
i don't know #buangkok# some some no as in like an actual kampung macam
(uh) orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu ya
yang that time i went there untuk yang satu filming for this
cerita hantu [ah]
ya went there and then dia orang cakap (uh) tempat tu memang ada benda [ah] like there's there's actual hantu living there ya
and then like there's this one makcik [ah] like this chinese auntie
she owns the place basically and then like (uh)
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
abeh dia orang cakap macam (um) like kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam have like
good intentions like you can't be there to macam
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened [lah] when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya i think i was telling
(mm) ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like [oh] i see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
she said like kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur [lah] just let it be
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
we film from i think like we arrived there at six [ah] so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the hantu was late
like really late and then [ah] they wanted to start filming at like eight
and then we had to delay and then wait then (um) when the actress finally came i had to put her and line her s_f_x punya costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the hantu it was quite quite interesting to see her change [ah] cause
dia [ah] she's like i think some
model or something
so she's quite tall [lah] and then like (um)
her features were like pretty [lah] like
like a model person's features
abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu and then it's kind of fun [lah] but macam
(mm) that part that was the one [lah]
ya
(mm) ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying [lah] cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal yang kecil punya contact lenses it's a full eye one
so like
we were kind of worried [lah] that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god [lah] like nasib [ah]
benda tu jadi so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary [ah] to see her in the dark
like wandering around and shit
ya [lah] but then it's the only kampung i know that exists in singapore [lah]
ya
that kampung
i think the aunt~ the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they are very nice and then the when we were there kita nampak macam (uh) tiga caucasian people #ang-moh# like white people
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
col~
they were like dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok [ah] then dia orang nampak then kita punya filming punya benda then dia macam [oh] what you're doing
then we just like like we told them [lah] like [oh] we're filming a horror movie here
they like [oh] okay cool cool and jalan
but it's quite interesting place [ah] cause it's surrounded by h_d_b
quite a few like (um) there's a lot of kampung houses [lah] but macam maybe ada lima ke enam orang [jer] tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang [ah]
that's the thing i don't really know i only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that kampung
so macam she does the upkeeping and stuff [ah] and then like i know there's there's like one that they that
that hut that looks like a #kopitiam#
like ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam i know that that place they close down already so i don't know what they use the space for
but it's exist now ya
ya it's very close it's like macam kalau
h_d_b dia like here and then it's just kat bawah
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the kampung area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the h_d_b so it's quite quite cool
besar juga [ah] like maybe it's about the size of like one small h_d_b area
like maybe like eight blocks gitu
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor [lah]
so like ya
it's all kayu and then like very old school [lah] semua macam
like no electricity and stuff
but then they i think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
stay in the kampung
[oh] visit !huh! there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing i just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven a_m
ya it's quite gelap i mean there there is a few street lights [ah] like around the area but it's quite dark and then (um)
the there's a road that goes through the entire place [lah] so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people [lah]
tapi
tempat dia memang besar like really quite big ya
and but we only hear like
like explore like one small corner of it cause bila kita masuk kita naik lorry kena bawa semua equipment [kan] so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like i mean kind of like #paiseh# [ah] cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the s_f_x stuff
so like
aku datang just tengok-tengok abeh like macam tolong sini tolong sana
and then (um)
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like [oh] !wah! so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya dah pukul lapan gitu then she came over
then she was like kau orang nampak apa-apa tak and i'm like (um) no and then she said like kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut nothing [one]
dia hantu baik then i'm like okay
ya
she just goes around does that every time
[ah] but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice [ah] it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
(um)
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting [ah] the place
interesting
(um)
m_b_s
i honestly don't know [ah] i
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night [lah]
ya i think same [ah] if like i had to like
if i wanted to explore and then go to places i think i will tunggu malam baru keluar cause panas sangat like everyday it's so humid and hot
true
but
[oh] ya i'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
(mm)
(mmhmm)
really
that's interesting
(uh) the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes [sia] is it even open i think it is already [lah] if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
#pulau-semakau# that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
i haven't been to the zoo in years
tiga tahun [eh] it's quite recent [sia]
three years quite recent [lah] ya
i mean honestly nothing much has changed so i don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
[orh] [orh]
catty
catty enclosure
(mm)
and jumping on things
(mm)
like the other time i went i saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed [lah] like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like i mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that i guess it's really horrible [lah] to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age [sia] the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
i don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya i just feel like it's from #yishun#
#yishun# has cold weather and move it
but like kesian juga [ah] like you when you tengok the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life i think
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
i feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
i want go yang tempat apa tu yang dekat gardens by the bay [ah]
pergi satu kali [ah] when in maybe secondary school
poly ya secondary school the last time i went
ya
it was not [meh]
it was
it was [lah] cause i don't remember wearing for r_c things in poly
no it was in secondary school i swear i think i don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
i opening
(uh) five a_m to two a_m
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya [sia]
sec four [lah] so probably in sec four cause i don't remember going in poly
like i always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
[orh]
it's quite pretty [lah] the the indoor garden is nice
i like
plants
that i don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and #changi# airport
tiga wish
(hmm)
that's a hard question
aku nak rumah
but legit [lah] like
basically the first thing i would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
(oo)
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
(hmm)
i would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job [oh] my god
i would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so i can own him
and then i take all his money and give everyone else
entah abeh
but ya i just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money i think that would solve a lot of problems
(mmhmm)
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole h_d_b filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
(mm)
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
[oh] ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
(mm)
ya previous
(mm) money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
i don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
i guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so what the hell
!wow!
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
[oh]
(mm)
fair
why
ya
yes
right
covid has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your q_r code
everywhere you go
and
i guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya i love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
(oo) okay [lah] kalau dia orang nak kasih free ambil [jer] [lah] kalau kalau bayar then okay [ah] aku bingit but then kalau free
then collect dekat c_c_ dekat rumah aku okay [lah] and
i mean ya memang [ah] like buang masa juga cause
they tell you like [oh] you you don't need the code i mean you need the token thing abeh it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your i_c right it's literally does nothing different
(mm)
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
i don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has covid then they can track
but like from what i've heard there's no g_p_s in it [ah] so like
probably not
(mmhmm)
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
i didn't even know
(mm)
(mm)
no one was interested
ya
(mmhmm)
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
i mean okay [lah] to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their i_c and that's something i know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
(mmhmm)
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like i'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like !oops!
i mean if it had if had g_p_s like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
but i don't think macam
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
true
(mm)
but i mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
(mm)
i guess
i miss cats
ya
cat cafe
[orh]
same
i just i cannot imagine like
tak suka
[oh]
i was like !huh!

kat bawah block
!huh! sini takde banyak kucing
[oh] that's weird
the hell
only got lembu
(mm)
(mm)
have you seen your cat luar
have your seen your cat
that cat
i also haven't see
when i go down
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
your cat is wild

that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
seram [sia]
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
[orh]
(mm)

that's weird
(mm)
you know when i first got my cat it was that bad [lah] macam
(hmm) bila like i have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then i'll be coughing
abeh batuk rabak [sia] it's like cannot breathe and stuff
and then ya i would like cough and then have trouble breathing
sekarang if i carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy [ah] like if he comes too close like my face
and then kalau when i mandi him like
that's when it gets bad [lah] like he i really cannot breathe like i will start coughing
and stuff
but i don't know what is the reason for it i think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it [lah] but like it's fine (uh) it's fine [lah] he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
[oh] really
[orh]
i mean get scared [lah] like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like i think he's fine [lah] like cause i i usually carry him while i bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
(mm)
(mmhmm)
i guess but
i don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like i mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic [what] then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
i don't think it would wipe out the human race like but i mean people will die [lah] confirm but like
[oh]
(mm)
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
i think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
ya i mean like really at what point do we stop having to macam pursue technology
cause like i feel like everything is fine as it is
like i mean if you want to find like cures and like
(mm)
is put to use
ya
(mm)
somewhere else
that needs it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya i think the next u_s president should just remove money
there is not no money
the u_s president speaks in malay kau orang semua stop it [eh]
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay i think kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi i just i just want to give you a warning [eh] kau stop [jer] [eh] jangan buat lagi [tau]
then okay kau balik like
bro~
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
siapa
[ah] ya
ya
ya
murderers
ya
[oh] well
ya [sia] and then the girl got like sponsorship opportunity and stuff
nonsensical [sia] like how
why
(mmhmm)
are we
bye bye
okay
[oh] my god stop
okay so (um) actually he was one of the first few (um) like accounts that i watch on tiktok [lah] and i started it obviously time c_b [ah] times you lane
time semua orang tak ada kerja lain
ya so he was on my f_y_p list like [eh] local (uh) local account [lah] like [eh] this one look like singapore like that ya so then i went to see then actually the at first the dia punya videos was all quite macam angsty [ah] like
[oh] you see this vulgar #tat# #tut# #tat# semua basic~ basically like macam all the people like being annoying [lah] time dia tengah nak deliver
and then it was very weird because i also saw one video of dia pergi #tampines# mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and i was and pasal tu time c_b [kan] so we cannot go out [kan] and i was like [oh] my god i've never seen #tampines# mall look like that
ya serious macam like like some horror story is here
i can't remember c_b april april may ya april may ya
i'm like when did i stop my attachment
ya then only okay i'm not sure if it's recent but like i only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like malam-malam buta like nine plus i was like [eh] this guy doing live live what [sia]
because at that point in time i just thought macam he records and then edits and then posts right so i was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then i was just like [oh] !wow! !wow! he cause it p_o_v
yes abang grabfood p_o_v
and i think the funniest part was that (um) based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind yang like cause of like his friends dulu kat secondary school semua [kan] and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like apa ni bro
ya so (uh) people will like are you malay are you malay then he's like what only malay is it do grabfood
i was like boo
ya i know right ya then ya but (uh) turns out he's chinese [lah] so and then i thought he was #ah-beng# actually
he actually he has the #beng# vibes but the most kekek thing is like the way he talks is very macam narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
then it was like !whoa! wh~ you all think that my voice very mesmerizing
kelakar [lah] like
ya it's quite bahan actually
ya
exactly so i think actually by right dia punya target audience is
(um) like fellow riders but then like [oh] my god they're all this like
all following you it's so scary you know [oh] my god like there was this kid dia macam
i was like i say asal this budak like freaking thirsty you know
macam dia kata come live with me apa apa apa then aku was like
!eww! then aku press dia punya profile then i was like [oh] my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing i'll just like get off tiktok
ya [oh] it was so scary so and then (um) so he d_m me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk [kan] is macam corporate gila
tu [lah] pasal dekat dia tanya (um) in which area do you reside i was like reside [eh]
first off aku dah block dia i was like saying (uh) don't worry i'm not under age i'm like i'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because of a small lampoon like there was this cause they remember me under sixteen year old girl then i'm just like okay you could in some ways typical is like the wild wild wet
ya because (uh) and then semalam pun like there was this girl that was like remember me i'm the sixteen year old girl then i'm just like [ah] [eh] awkward
technically [ah] i mean it makes sense because it's like their generation yang pakai [kan] but it's still very disturbing [lah] but i'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like tak layan and then he doesn't assume anything [oh] ya then he was like how do i address you [ah] aku was like how do i address you macam then
the next for me macam the automatic response is miss #farizan# takkan [lah] [kan] apa [seh] macam merepek [sia]
#zan# [ah] actually aku was like !alamak! aku terlupa nak tukar my (um) name pasal it's still #zan# a yang ikut my (um) i_g and aku was like
!alamak! too late to change to air [lah] takpe takpe [lah] #zan# [lah] zan jadi [lah]
yes [oh] my gosh he was like i'm very tired right now but if i'm not wrong you asked me to call you #zan# right and i was just like yes #senpai# noticed me [ah] terima kasih terima kasih
[a'ah] i was like opocot aku jadi marauder i there's actually like no real function to it [ah] cuma macam bragging rights [jer]
[a'ah] so i macam [ah] my dreams
#oppa# noticed me grab ge</mandarin> grab
ya i was i was like planning kalau macam ini hari [kan] kalau aku jumpa dia i will be like grab ge</mandarin>
probably dia macam siapa then aku was like confirm tu kena instant block
you need only direct ya but
[oh] ni dia [eh] yikes
#tampines# that's why so dekat
ya actually dekat and i kind of roughly know macam tempat dia lepak
no [lah] not his but his route yes because like like kat kat tak banyak tempat yang that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs yang dekat the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king dekat the c_c
so i don't know like actually his account macam supposed to be like educational ke apa at an entertainment but it's so true i think like now i can identify like know the back models and shit in case like aku yikes
i don't know [ah] if i should be like like impressed or disturbed or what
right like all the super wholesome and educational tiktoks that you have been like sharing on your i_g i mean thank you for like getting me into
thank you for getting me into this man
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya
ya and then there's the mat minah tiktok
ya
(mm) ya ya ya ya
okay
[ah]
[oh]
is that is that the meaning of pull like can i pull you i don't know because i keep seeing it on my feed then aku macam what's this [eh] like
i macam pull apa [eh] macam pull follow ke apa ke macam but it's like those thirst trap punya videos
[ah] [a'ah] [kan] i tak faham
we'll find out ya but (um)
what is it
okay but macam maksud dia tu apa
[ah] (uh huh) (uh huh)
[oh] ya my god you never respond to that when you eerie is so true [oh] my god like once you just wanna be
i i was just thinking of the mat minah call
[oh] my god you must never respond to that when you hear it
it's like (ugh) i'm one of them
[ah]
your true colours are showing your true colours are showing
(mm) same t_b_h
right
(mmhmm)
okay
boom
just macam
what
#astagfirullah#
ya correct
ya [kan]
that's the teas
yes actually how did how did you get into tiktok
macam how did you discover that app do you remember
right right
it's not a part of or to share or if you share like a an instagram post it always comes in and link right (uh) whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on a anti a and anti social media app
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
right
social media right
native post [oh] hashtag today i learn
(mm)
ya ya because macam at the start that was what it looked like [kan] it was macam in between musically and vine
[kan]
macam there's the reputation [kan]
(mm)
technically those people must be underage juga
[oh]
(mm)
i don't know how though but
no it doesn't come too often i think that one is just macam by proximity like you know the few local
(mm)
you're talking about macam algorithm dia
sometimes you will realise you videos what have i got fifty and just kept yes doesn't vote so once once you realise just that it's video isn't as popular as between other users then it just doesn't show any
[oh]
!wow!
ya
yes
!huh!
[oh]
that's the thing which i'm god i'm very surprised because like once i post terus like it's very fast but then it like just dies off i macam okay all right
like then the subsequent macam views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one macam the benda-benda bodoh i don't tag it i just macam
i don't know i don't put anything in the caption you know if you find me it is from the song
ever since (um) but ever since (uh) grab ge</mandarin> i privated my tiktok
wait you drunk courtesy and he's already falling
i don't i don't i don't want i don't want weirdos following me
[eh] he's already following me
so now we're friends on tiktok
i do
apparently i'm one of two people who know and i'm just like ya okay
ya so that's the thing right i was like !wow! i didn't know that tiktok ada live firstly so then like his live was the first one that i watched
actually i was like should i watch ethnic live no let me watch guide to grabfood [oh] my god
ya so it's (um) it's really interesting it's like you know how (um) i_g live [eh] no not i_g live [eh] i_g live and f_b live ada like the likes [kan] but it's just macam free [kan] you press
jadi boleh spam ke apa entah so apa ni like tiktok ada like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
so they get i guess the creator gets like part of it but tiktok gets like a slice of how much you send
ya
ya so just like [oh] thanks you know it's like ya
ya ya ya
i don't think it's that much [lah] because like i said macam dia punya follower base is more like budak-budak kecil so macam he will he will say say like [oh] thanks for the like double like i send the rainbow puke
he was like [oh] thanks for the rainbow puke and i pun macam he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap i mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk sekarang pun like dah lagi mahal bro
but it tells you [lah] something so i was like okay
so like everyone is always saying stuff like [oh] come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel [lah] [kan] and aku was like what is this thing he's talking about
so i went to scroll a few pages of emojis right
!wah! that's like that's fair
it's like sixty bucks
towards #jurong# island girl ya ya then you all get to see new kind of contact you know
and i was like that's fair that's fair
ya to what #jurong# island ya
he was like ya then you all get to see new kind of content you know
you see that's why you should donate to me dia cakap kelakar gila dia macam his humour ya
i know i love it
[oh] my god i read your your bottle is !alamak!
mata-mata dah malam
afro
my goodness okay so that one
is like i signed up [kan] time (uh) it was like there's no physical lindy class
and then like i think i finished my virtual punya class and macam they just started opening that time face to #babad# like
cause i cause i saw the thing is i saw #insyirah# (uh) dance is it first like pre c_b
then i was like my god because (uh) i was i was into the music
like middle of last year or something so i always like holy shit like how i know i i i (uh) i recognize the dance moves [kan] then i was like !hey! #insyirah# like is this afrobeat standard like ya macam how you know and all that then aku aku was telling her [lah] that i listen to the songs and all this
then she was saying [oh] it's that this studio #da# #da# #da# #da# so (uh) it took me like damn long like aku just took the information and just like buat bodoh [ah] until c_b happened
and then phase two then aku was like okay if i were to do a dance class that is not a lindy i'm gonna do this
ya so that's how i started [lah] s~ so the first my first the first class i went was with her and then it was very #suay# because it was like
a super fast one and aku was like aku nak mati [eh]
ya because unsubsequently it was like slow and chill and guess what today also was fast for me i was just like !wow! do you just not like me
after a long break it's just like rombak rombak and i was like [ha]
(um) okay so it depends on the studio but like that studio because of the size they can accommodate (um) three groups of five
like and then like each five ada like segment [ah] then you cannot mix
okay like and then like each each five i do like segment are and you cannot mix ya by right [lah] then that one [ah] because you maintain two meters with grammars
ya by right [lah]
then that one (uh) because you maintain two meters tak payah pakai mask
[kan]
ya my lindy punya yang solo pun begitu (uh) our capacity is about twelve
so sama [lah] two meters and all that tak payah pakai mask tapi tu recently (um) because of (uh) partner work and then like we are constantly sanitizing then tu kena pakai mask [ah] pasal like contact
but itu pun they try to minimize like they try to do more solo dance sikit [jer] partner ada ya
dah lama i tak joget penat gila [sia] i was like (ugh)
stamina dah turun muscle semua dah macam dah layu
ya right
right
right right
already
that whole album
right
yes yes
yes yes [oh] my goodness
(mm)
i can i have my !alamak! #yemi-alade#
that's the one yang i i started with ya so a lot of my songs are #yemi-alade# songs ya
it's like !wah! i love him macam the dia punya beat dia punya percussion dia is like is like
it's not as tacky as like e_d_m macam ada like dia punya [ah] rentak [ah] dia like #kebak# #kebak# means like cool
and macam i feel like dia orang punya bahasa is actually quite nice also
ya then recently like (um) the class introduced me to all new like new songs [lah] as in new and macam different artists [ah] artists that i don't listen to it's usually like this guy artist
i don't know if it's cause like he only listens to guy artists ke apa besides beyonce
ya his name is #zul#
ya [oh] my gosh okay so that's the other thing like i feel so macam at home like finally an instructor who's not doing zumba
okay
[ah] confirm zumba
like that's the only thing kita boleh buat like hello excuse me hello police
[oh] my god
ya so and macam the group feels very nice and chill and he's the kind yang like having fun is more important
macam you you just try and do like it's okay if you don't catch it exactly but macam he wants you to like feel the music and like enjoy
macam buang tabiat gitu ada orang cakap
ya but he very cool [lah] macam even the recep~ not the okay sorry he's the receptionist but he's the studio owner he's also malay
no [ah]
no no no actually k k jap there's two people the receptionist is called ash so he's she's owner and then #zul# is one of the teachers
he teaches afro
then #hakim# also teaches like (um) dance fall but i don't like dance fall dance fall macam a bit macam sexy [ah] i macam !oof!
i'm not i'm not ready for that
ya i'm not shy
ya then okay it's quite kekek like last two days [kan] i went for the same studio i tried (uh) homerun choreo
that one like ma~ aku nak mati [sia]
the person [kan] like mellow she's a good dancer but dia punya ajar dia macam like from the get go is like super detailed
macam my brain cannot
macam badan angle tangan angle
[ah] kepala angle i macam (ugh)
goyang
ya so i said i don't like i don't get the i don't get the flow for k pop i macam
ya
ya so i was just like (um)
yes and loncat-loncat
so i mean at zero point six it was okay zero point seven still can point eight (mm) i'm starting to fall apart
nine i'm not very sure what's going on i'm definitely at least two counts behind
but it was but the the first then she did the chorus in two days
so the first day (um) afro was like in the corner
then macam i felt so demoralized [ah] like it's so susah and like
so for me the thing is that like kalau stuff that is not a lindy end i don't want to use my brain so i have to use my brain after and then i get very fed up
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
i think cause i'm not like a fan [kan] i just do it cause macam it looked interesting
right
so like the first day cause i will maybe i was too focused on like myself but i didn't notice the second day it was fun because i was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me
so that says something
and then the ones next to her friends semua they were like [eh] today i become chicken [ah] i was like that's not wrong macam a lot of them their position i'm just like kenapa ayam kenapa ayam
!huh!
ya macam cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
homerun
[oh] no sorry sorry the studio beat factory fitness
sorry [ah] pekak
(mmhmm) apa-apa pun pekak
[eh] lupa [ah] k jap
[dah] [lah]
okay okay i have i can explain i can explain this is my old one
(um) actually no (uh) this is the one for my games
ya
no [lah] okay so ceritanya is apa [tau] this phone the near ram only three gig
dia punya internal kalau bukan sixteen thirty two [eh]
basically it's more [lah] then after that i download a lot of okay i did not download a lot of games i just download maplestory
and then [eh] i try to log in from outram sampai past series belum log in you
disconnect lag crash semua the whole cycle
ya ya ya [a'ah] soon
!whoa! macam no ya so then i could i could i really cannot yo~ you like besides gaming macam
apa [eh] like it's just super laggy [ah] macam everything keep crashing and i was getting very frustrated
and macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal (err) internal memory dia dah habis [kan]
so like literally i was running on entah something macam hundred m_b of free space ke apa entah
exact~ exactly so that's why macam dia punya performance pun dah macam tahi [ah]
!huh! but anyway dah dua dah dua tahun [ah]
so i'm not sure what i should be using this for i i might use it for macam work taruh like (um) prepaid ke apa kat dalam tu
ya so then i don't need to like bother using my
!huh! then like bye ya
because actually phone ni tak rosak ya it's just and after i bought it over i i can uninstall all the things i'm not using ya so
i uninstall [lah] everything and now it's okay [ah]
(mm) it's okay then now i found a new use for it [lah] because i was thinking [eh] macam mana kalau i want to game but i also want to watch his live
i akan dengar i just dengar suara dia [jer]
ya dah suara dia sedap
serious
suara dia macam macam dia punya voice quality is very good
like macam okay k k (uh) i once irritated my friend then by sending him like a maplestory m punya guide
he was like okay hi everybody (um) [ah] [ah] this a guide to ivan okay so the most important is you take the debris okay the debris is very useful [lor] can boost your damage
macam kau dengar aku macam nak sepak [ah] (hmm)
but this guy [ah] macam kau just dengar just like ya macam cool like night setting you know
ya but ini hari i think ini hari dia main muzik so
sekarang you you'll hear him like sing and stuff
ya
yes i know ya
ya like (ugh) [ah] ya he is singing okay nice great
ya so so my dilemma was his live starts at eight thirty but my maple boss is at eight forty
so i'm like i need to be able to do both at once ya
help what what who is #fizan#
i don't recognise myself anymore
ya if you told like
how will you be like
not even not even twenty nineteen if you told like pre c_b #zan# this is what you're gonna be up to i'll be like !huh! for real
you'll be like gaming and listening to guide to grabfood like reading chinese novels like what bro
macam daripada mana [eh] tiba-tiba [kan]
ya right right right
ya i thought so too
[oh] i got range
righty
no
(um) it's it's more slice of like okay parents (um) so i i guess i prefer that time rather than much of anything with actually make the things i haven't watch you must be you weird okay but it's just very very promising and stuff ya that genre is is i mean that's microwave you genre which is shown and
[oh] but then again cause i'm not keeping up with the new ones
what is it about
okay okay
okay
ya that genre is is i mean that's my favourite genre which is #shonan#
ya
okay
dia lelaki perempuan
okay
but like why dia need to pakai okay sorry no no no apa dia punya power actually
[ah]
explode
[a'ah] [ah]
dia macam apa gravity ke
okay strength
i was like !huh! macam-macamnya power dia
okay
[oh] okay !wow!
i thought i thought you were gonna say set stuff on fire remotely because that
because pyrokinesis is
but no one else has powers
kesiannya
(mm)
!huh! then how does he talk
[ha] so he just hears his voice in other people's heads
so people think he's stupid
[oh] my god
okay okay okay
you watch two episodes
three episodes how do you watch three episodes
right [oh] you skip you skip the
you don't you skip the intro and ending right
!huh! serious [ah]
how many episode is it
kalau kau kalau kau watch three a day
kalau twenty three sikit [jer]
[eh] kalau you tengok six a day [tau] six a day by right empat hari dah habis twenty four
kau rewatch [eh]
[oh] you mean like each season got twenty something episodes !chey!
no i'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that i never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
rasa macam escapism which i'm like [oh] macam i don't like to be too close to reality
actually i want to see i don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite #gundam# series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do i really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
(mm)
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy [lah] like
like you know brings us together
it was the most merepek [ah] okay okay no that's not okay i take that back after seeing things that #bandai# has released recently that's not the most merepek
but it's the most macam fantasy [lah] like super idealistic you know macam the guy must must always get the girl and then ada rival ada love triangle
that's rude ya macam
habis orang mati one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
that's rude
ya macam [oh] and then (um) they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere macam
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
because at that time [kan] that (uh) macam the way you pilot is still macam pakai macam like you driving gitu [ah] you akan pakai (um) got the apa macam clutch semua and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so i thought that was quite smart macam the later on the #animes# [kan] they they used macam (uh) like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much [lah] you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it (uh) i was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves ke apa entah like okay sure like that's fine
like macam if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like macam gitu [lah] they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like [oh] macam drop drop from the sky gitu like merepek
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
(hmm)
ya because it's (mm) it's a bit dia punya plot
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
there's then #gundam# got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the o_g #gundam# sampai like
and then they continue macam star wars gitu [ah] so it's like !wah! the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya
ya but that one was okay but it was macam [eh] a bit too that one a bit too fantasy [ah]
although it did start [lah] it did spur it it started my my thing for #gundam# so okay fine fine i give you that #bandai#
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was i thinking
ya okay [lah] fun
(hmm)
ya
yes so how did it go
(hmm)
she's like tall she's so tall
(hmm)
right right
ya betul
i really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
!oops!
!huh!

ya
bracket in singapore [oh] okay she knows [eh]
!wow!
they're so savvy i swear i feel like i need to be on reddit but i'm just like i i don't like i don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
(mm)
(mm)
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing i've i've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
(mm)
ya ya ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
i've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments [lah]
ya
ya it's always senang kalau nak cakap
because you're not in that situation apa
ya i see that a lot on twitter also macam they will like (err) retweet those those (um) am i am i am i an asshole punya post
and then dia orang just like throw the whole man away [lah] apa you know macam like ya like macam
i guess you can write that way but macam think about how that person is like going through right
correct ya ya
ya
sassy [ah]
ya
ya
but ya actually i asked (uh) #najhah# about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many [eh]
ya macam kau they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something aku rasa
maybe at most twenty plus [lah] but that's what i was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as #naruto# and all that with like five hundred and two seasons [eh] three seasons [eh] in all that kind of
then macam !huh! okay itu [jer] like ya that's what i was thinking [oh] actually kalau i wanted to catch up session quite easy
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like i said just now the japanese narrative is p_g twelve
and like the singapore people don't even bo~ the singapore punya what i_m_d or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
ya but that's the thing [lah] macam i_m_d
i guess ya [lor] like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff i don't know
but macam it's very like we we call it like what #anime# typical [lah] canon typical violence
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know i didn't realise how important do you think so when i watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area
ya
so macam entah [leh]
but our censorship selalu macam tu
[ah]
[ah]
ya
jesse
kau rembat [jer]
me and my western pop culture
kekek [jer] [sia]
ya
ya like [ho] kita cool
cools
[kan] kita dah besar
in this show in full !wow! really
i mean i don't
i have so many replies but i'll just i'll just keep it to myself
serious [ah] a full frontal is an eighteen [jer]
okay okay
okay
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
i mean it's different when you own it
#yikes#
how did #shah# react
so i was like [oh]
i mean it's different when you own it
[oh] my goodness
#yikes#
[oh] my goodness somehow i'm very surprised okay
you're prepared
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like d_v_d's and stuff right they will put like macam n_c sixteen then i said they will put the the like triggers kat bawah macam
ya nudity
ya
ya
it's like ya
and then it's like !whoa! full frontal !wow!
what
okay [lah] at least you were like considered legal
[oh] ya that's true
it sound so weird but macam
like in the science textbook they always show you macam
so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly [lah] it supposed to be a little like #teng# #teng# #teng# i mean
[oh] yikes
it scarred you
!alah! benda tu macam benda biasa [jer] bagi dia
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about macam like
and is it okay but i think it's really like macam commendable [lah] that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but macam
it's nice to know like someone cares for you like someone's looking out for you
i mean i know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
(um)
kenapa
[oh]
wait kejap dia interested ke dia macam intrigued
okay okay
[ah]
ya ya ya
it's true though
i wonder like how many of my stupid decisions can be attributed to like
the strange perceptions that i had of like relationships (hmm)
it's just like macam thinking about it
(mm)
ya
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar
!oof!
masa tu like my god is sixteen
we haven't even graduated
right
[oh] my god ya
so it's like so meluat
that's that's the thing [sia]
when i jumpa that my malaysian friend i was like !duh!
as in i didn't say it macam explicitly but i was like dia baru keluar dari sandiwara ke apa
macam the perangai and cara dia cakap and cara dia like (um) carry himself is so reminiscent of that i just i was just nice i was like you sound like (um) i was just trying to be nice
[oh] burn burn
give the full burn t_v satu
ya
(mm) [a'ah] yang mana
[oh] pasal apa [eh]
okay
[oh]
[oh] typical
[oh] !wow! mesti of course and his father is like
pre~ a celebrity preacher
[oh] !wow! mesti of course
okay
[oh] i was like what's up with
totally wrong ke it's okay it's okay

!wow! habis no one was able macam curious cat version
versi masjid
check check
girl
!wow! so romantic [eh]
okay
[oh] #shiok#
macam he's trying [lah]
did they show the questions yang she wrote
it's not like macam lame questions [kan] like those questioning the fundamentals [eh]
okay okay okay
he's not provoking
ya [lah] pasal hari-hari orang just setakat tanya (um)
[ah] is smoking haram
macam dah stop it [sia] like
okay sorry
what
i know i know don't read the question [mah] so there he was
that that pause of me with the math the meme
okay for her everywhere and jalan
okay so orang ni tanya soalan and then they
and then just left like without waiting for them the question to be answered
so dia dia received the question so ustaz tu received the question lepas tu dia dia just simpan dia tak address on the spot
okay okay okay okay all right fine fine okay
who is sending them
peeping
okay but
okay
it's just unrealistic
[ah] she would have slapped him
in-law
[oh] my god okay okay i i see where this is going [oh] unhealthy expectations
it's true [lah] i guess it's macam it's getting better these days like definitely but macam
okay ya
is it on #suria#
ya ya like kat rumah ya
ya like you know we can do without this scenes it recruits is it
sekejap [eh] dia actress dia pakai tudung
macam macam like if it does not add to the plot right kenapa nak bagi sangat orang tu
ya that's why i already feel damn sorry it's so so christian michelle
so kacau macam kau nak tidur lepas tu dengan pin pin dia semua
e
[oh] macam (uh) yang instant [ah]
i see like unless dia orang nak cakap orang-orang malaysia semua like sleep with tudung like that [lah]
step like i was going to say step alim but is that rude
bodoh [kan]
[oh] my goodness
[orh] macam
macam tak ada ke tak ada ke model lain [eh] kata shampoo [eh]
atau macam at least just maybe like say macam the fragrance is nice or something and then like
okay
[a'ah] so kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap like in both like melayu dengan english so boleh tak
so
okay maybe kita nak cakap pasal like kita punya favourite show boleh tak
ya i think movie also can so should be okay
[oh] movie apa
okay
why it is sad like
wait like buta like like how buta hati atau like you know
like [ah] okay
[oh]
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like kenapa dia buta
tak senonoh then after that
[ah]
wait tapi the guy know yang like like
the guy is dia apa tu yang punca yang the girl punya
[oh]
[oh]
[ah] [oh]
!wah!
but then how [ah] like
lelaki tu !wah!
ya
why so weird
memang macam like i don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya [lah] but like macam it's so coincidental you know like macam the girl dengan the guy is like
you know always meeting is it like fate but i know that's what korean drama always like
[oh]
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
kedai ya
what
but macam it doesn't make sense like
ya ya i think kena tengok right
but that's really your favourite movie
your abang is my adik
!wah!
(err)
okay okay actually like
nah i like to watch a lot of show [oh] then [ah] my favourite show is like the big bang theory i don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
i think it's kind of takde lagi is it
pasal dia ya dia orang dah remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like perempuan you know like the girls and then like [eh] like macam like when i watch it i was like [oh] my god that's like so me you know like i like to like you know (uh) macam baca buku all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then lepas tu like
(um) they suddenly
(um)
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
then lepas tu he i think dia orang ada like sepuluh seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like i think like twenty years old and all that lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai like dia orang like tiga puluh lebih and until like
all of them i think almost all of them get married
and then it's like i think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you tengok like macam dia orang like grow to become like a better person
so macam damn cool because i also because like dulu [kan] macam banyak orang ingatkan like orang yang suka science semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil like very awkward right like they feel like they macam cannot fit into the society
ya
socially less awkward and also because like macam if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
[kan] like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
because like i remember one episode [kan] like macam young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy nama sheldon
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young [lah] so the thing is like he's (err) like professor in this like
school like not really a professor [lah] by research scientists and then lepas tu like (um) banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh fit in
but then over the years apa dia dia dia cuba like fit in to like parties macam because ada seorang perempuan popular ni neighbour dia
[kan] and then like (um) dia like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then lepas tu they will they will feeling very awkward because dia orang dia orang like cuba to interact with like the rest
ya dia orang semua ingatkan dia weird sebab like dia datang pun like dengan baju tak senonoh
until the party and cannot fit in [lah] but then lepas tu then he realise that [oh] my god
like (um) over the years [kan] they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like [ah] people who are like basically like
apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok show ni daripada kecil call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing [lah] because like dia dia dia pun like was single all the way then lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan [ah] kahwin then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then tak he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that (um) apa tu to like
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met [ah] through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like i think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise betul tak like he cannot like
(um) you know like straightaway
like realise [eh] tomorrow you gonna get married this person
ya so they actually show us yang macam love
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
terus jump to it
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast [kan] dia orang carry macam opposite of each other
ya so dia orang cuddle cuddle dia macam like [eh] let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu then like
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world [lor]
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing [lah] that's why i love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool [kan] i feel like it's damn cool ya
ya i know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker [lah] don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
[oh] because you pakai like all the duit birthday for all this
[oh]
[oh] ya you told me [what]
[oh] ya ya the cafe thing then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
i know you said you show me the photos [mah] and then macam it's damn nice [what]
[oh]
!wah!
#oma# spoon okay
ya i i know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
no [lah] but waffle [kan] macam murah takkan they will charge you [lah]
okay but #haji# lane is overpriced sebab tu [lah] you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually murah ya but it's at where somerset
farrer park ya but the thing is
that means like macam kalau they are not like at the central area of singapore [kan] it's usually cheaper
very circular
ya [lah] that's why it's cheaper [lah] kalau if it if it's at town right confirm mahal
actually ya
(uh huh)
what no [lah] but tu untuk buka like cafe in singapore quite
like tough [what]
so you become like ibu
but you know
design the place itself [kan] macam they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
ya but it's not
it's not it's very mahal and like ya
it's like macam you know like we we it's like our like previous kedai [lor]
ya it's like you need to know makanan apa sedap and then like sometimes [kan] you hire the chef and the dia tak tahu masak
ya
no but actually makanan tak sedap pun tak apa [tau] cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like macam it's cool [lah] like
you know like your makanan k cause your makanan tak sedap [kan] at least your coffee sedap or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
[eh]
ya
maybe you are just like picky
ya ya [lah] you see i love coffee you know like i can drink like coffee macam tak ada gula
ya like takde gula is like totally fine with me ya
tea without sugar can but coffee [oh] because of the bitterness [kan]
it's just weird
k [lah] okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
actually i want to ask you [kan] macam like k this is a weird question because i just see at the prompts (um) if you have like tiga like wish that you wanna wanna
you can fulfil [lah] okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
ya like okay like kalau tak ada macam k if like there's no boundaries because you know like macam you tengok aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
make you fall for anyone and then i think i forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya re~ re~ resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so (um) out of these three [kan] like for me i feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay k that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay [lah] have ya it ya you can i think think you cannot like like have money ya
#lee-kuan-yew# no [ah] is it you can be rich i can't remember
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like [oh] i wish that i have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like [kan] like duit apa tu apa tu it's just ya cause if you just say like i have a million dollar [kan] tak fun
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish i know [what]
what
okay i think that's a bit far [oh]
okay okay so your wish is to pass a level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then i say my first wish k because like i feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that i like in life
cause like i feel like i'm macam sangat lost
ya because like i don't really know what i want
ya
not purpose i already know what's my purpose in life
(mmhmm)
ya
no because like i think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
there's too many like macam like direction that you can go like because you imagine kalau you stay in malaysia then like ya tak banyak ya like i think you will only get like
like [kan] siapa like most people will go either retail and then like or office world [lah] because in singapore we kita kita believe in like equality right
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya i think it's also because i think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries [lah] our neighbouring countries [lah]
so ya like you know like
i see like in other countries [lah] if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore [ah] no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
so that's why i like i like the so for me macam like i'm so spoilt for choice like even after working [kan] like i don't know whether that's the thing that i really want
like you know
even though i know it pays well like gaji besar but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's penat and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun [kan]
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like i don't think like you can okay [lah] maybe you kalau you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start macam betul susah
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case [lah]
ya bukan like the
ya
like malaysia
ya
i know what you mean
then
hotspot [lah] hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national rail~ railway railway is [eh] you know the train [one]
[oh] my god
ya
i know the whole railway right
ya but okay [lah] (um)
i think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
ya cause you know like if you go #jakarta# like i don't know you wait did go #batam# ya you went #batam# before right and you know like macam some places are very crowded then you know they don't care [one] ya
no but maybe maybe because like
they do though because that time i went national gallery then dia orang semua duduk dekat
[ah] dia orang semua loiter dekat you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then lepas tu the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then kena pekik [sia] they were like !oi! is you new like why
what you doing there !huh! (uh) you never read the sign is it
and then lepas tu the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then i was like they talk back to the person then i was like with my friend [lah] then i was like [oh] my god what's this maid doing [ah]
[eh] ya and then okay but i feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
i call your employer right now okay i call employer right now then then after that the maid was like [oh] my god
like [ah] like the maid was shocked [lah] when i was in then after that before they even like i don't know i don't know what happen there that's why i don't and before anything else happen
i walk off already because you know me
i don't i don't care
ya i tak kisah so i just like walk away and then lepas tu they were like i i don't even know what happened next but i just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
ya because it's okay [lah] but i know what you mean like i don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
tapi like
(um) you need to
like you can achieve now [lah] i think i'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy [lah] to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
you are just lucky cause like in singapore macam even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
!huh!
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and (uh) cambodia and
i forget one more wait china cambodia [ah] and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya [lah] but i think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account i think
ya ya your edusave p_s_e_a account
post secondary [ah]
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya so we all ya i think singapore bagi kita like money to like spend for all these trips [sia] so i think it's like i think that's a good thing [eh]
ya
so can use that
(err) if it there's one country my wish list [lah]
i've already went to that country though
i actually wanted to like when i was younger since young [lah] i always wanted to go japan
cause like when i was younger you know like i don't know i like to watch like #naruto# like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing [lah] last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly #naruto# come in ya po~ [ah] pokemon all this you know and then i was like
[oh] my god
i always wanted to go japan like i see the temple see the ninja and then i was like
!wah!
i'm like it's so nice then you know i got a chance to go
japan for like four months
dia sounds like internship [kan] then i was like !wah!
i'm like so lucky cause like that one i think i i spend like two weeks travelling around japan i don't know whether i got tell you
ya so i went like #osaka# #kyoto# #tokyo#
and i when #nara# i went like #kanazawa# then i
ya i went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no [lah] i went with my friend but i went (um) i think i went #hiroshima# alone
ya
k i don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous i think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time i went was autumn slash winter [eh] wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing [lor]
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like #tokyo# and #osaka# they rarely snow i think
#tokyo# ya #tokyo# rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is i thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like k i been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
[oh] you didn't know i went korea [oh] my god
i showed you ya
[oh] my god you didn't know i went korea
for the competition the comp~
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that i bought is only [ah] it's like for for all the countries that i've been except for when i was younger
so like china cambodia what do i have [ah] thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no [lah] i went for like five days only
there
i went to this
#wei# you didn't know i went korea
ya
there are friends i made
ya macam like people from korea guam that's why
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition [mah]
ya
no [lah] (um) i think k because
macam like banyak orang that like
most of them [lah] actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like i mean they are from international school basically so (uh) it's their first language [lah] english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so i went to
(um) you know the #seoul# tower
i went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya #wei# you didn't know i went all these !wah! it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
i don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also [lah] that means i have to present
i won third place
i was in the newspaper [what]
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in #temasek# my microsoft
korea bought my bags [mah]
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but i i stepped out of it cause i don't have the time
than i want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though i think like business macam it's easy to
okay [lah] it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can i can do it but like macam i don't feel like i want to pursue it cause i want something to like fall back on like a safety net
ya
[oh] you so you don't know i went korea so sad
ya there's so many places i've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really i went there during winter
!huh!
you should go with afal adik
i feel like going with your friend [kan]
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like i have a friend that i'm very close with then i went
i i wait
i went #batam# with him like my best friend then i think you know right i remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip

ya
what that's so random
no [ah] we're talking [what]
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail [what] if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya i know
i know
ya
interesting [lah]
like ya
but i think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other [kan]
ya
ya but i feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
like selamat datang ke podcast saya
ya but i don't think macam like podcast [kan] ada
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between [kan] ya
(mmhmm)
ya i saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a #suria# actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts i think
ya
life
(mmhmm)
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no [lah] like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya e news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why bapa all listening to podcast now
ya
ya i didn't expect
him
except for me
i never use
ya
the only time i actually use that day was to watch
no ya big bang and then after that i was like [oh] my god i found a website like no no not not no (err) because like i my friend bought the whole
i think d_v_d ya the whole box then my friend give me lend me [lah] then i watch everything finish then i stopped watching already because the only reason why i watch netflix is because of that
ya unless i won't use it so actually i wanted to subscribe i tell you [ah] like i just want to try so i actually could just use the one month free or was it three months but then in the end never [lah] then you guys all use free i never rely on anyone [lah] ya i very independent
you know i have always been independent not like you guys isn't it true
!huh!
ya i know
why
no but the air cooler
but it's not even cold
it's not bad
no but it's a waste ya it's a waste
[oh] ya the small
no i i don't know what they were thinking also
!huh! what
now i feel like she should fix the wiring
and then
fan
but
but you know like i've been living with fan i'm just saying you
doing your room how
but my room nice [ah]
okay fine
no but even if it's not alone also because i'm an i'm a neat freak
like even if like it's it's like i i live with my army friends i will make sure like everything is in order unless i have to do work no i'm not a perfectionist [lah] unless work right you see so for me right i have like a space where i can be very messy
but then i will clean it up at the end of the night
ya
ya i know what you mean like macam but for me right if i clean i'll be happy
like it makes me happy to clean
therapeutic
ya
[oh]
!wah!
ya [oh] my god okay
so late
still early
hey #nurul#
apa khabar
thanks for coming here
ya i want to know right (mm)
what is your ideal vacation like
[oh] for me [kan] i think i i really love planning i have to like
i have to know where i'm going i have to know what time i'm going i have to know what time this place close i i love
planning and then i
i may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here jadi kalau you like told off what if sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup then like kita dah jauh perjalanan [kan] telah tutup so like
ya [lah] for me i'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
i would like to explore i wanna have a lot of nature in it so i ada orang suka bunuh very curious about bunuh [ah] and then i also like to tengok pokok
and then i also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
sometimes i wish singapore has like four seasons so i can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window [eh] hari ini ada pokok this colour [eh] hari ini ada salji [eh] hari ini ada and then like tapi kadang-kadang i fikir macam like
[eh] then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting [ah] like (err) summer panas so like the material lain and then winter sejuk and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then i also think about [orh] the money
and then also like the rumah like
(um) we have to have heated floors ke heated jamban atau katil ke
lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil [kan] bila kita tidur like ya it's it's so it's so when i think about like why singapore don't have four seasons i also think about [oh] so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
this small staff [lah] these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then i don't know
cause i never gone through that ya [oh] (mm) so i wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about i say first then maybe i give one then right
so untuk saya untuk saya ya untuk for me right i want to bring them to
gardens by the bay i'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because (uh)
it's to me it's one of a kind [ah] and then like (uh) so many different
flower species and then can can exist all in one place habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada four seasons every country not [ah] countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since kita takde four seasons kita boleh [lah] kita pergi gardens by the bay [kan] to look at the different flowers and also different (uh) month would have different themes so i think that's quite cool so that's one place i would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
see experience all the different species in one area [lah] in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the #kampung-glam# area
ya about the old school stuff like (uh) sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
family is it poor family happy family [ah] sorry so like when i i i when i look at it you will still have this like !wow! so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like (err) last time it was easy to get right tapi sekarang macam like
mana [eh] nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda modern so macam i pun fikir [lah] like !wah! how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also macam not so complicated and then also about games
(um) nanti kalau like if you bring tourists over to play games kalau kita tak berbual the same bahasa pun takpe because you know you just gitu gitu gini gini then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya [oh] ya and i want to know (mm) which genre of drama or t_v show do you enjoy the most
for me i really like (err)
drama like between people i mean i prefer (uh) movies [lah] because i i usually cannot sit in one to watch t_v series so if i do watch movies i like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed [lah] i also like reality (uh) so if it's based on true story then i can watch and then i will be like quite amazed like !wow! so this can happen in real life [ah] then like because like macam i'm quite curious [lah] on like
people story tapi takkan macam i nak keluar habis tanya orang [eh] jadi macam mana you punya life story ya i want to know more about it so i guess for me movies are one way to find out about people punya
jalan hidup without being so #kaypoh# about it
and then like after that (uh)
(um) [oh] there are some reality t_v shows that i like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and i also love catfish
ya it's so like like whenever i watch this reality t_v show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right i always feel angry then like tengok dia orang macam like kitchen nightmare dia punya
[ah] chef of the restaurant then dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak gordon ramsay pun bantu dia punya restaurant kasi betul this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no i'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then i still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so macam (err)
naive and like [oh] or tapi (uh)
muka dia macam gini mesti orang dia macam gini juga
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so macam senang nak percaya and then tapi like when i watch this also i can feel sad [lah] because when say if i watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and macam they cannot dapat that connection dalam real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing macam have you experienced something like that or like
then then then that's the thing i like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya i if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun [oh] then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
for me my favourite movie banyak juga [lah] tapi macam ada satu jadi ada satu movie ni yang i suka
(uh) it's called #kahani# ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that (um)
i watch this movie i think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch t_v series let alone i watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time i watch the movie was during work
so (err) ya it wasn't even during lunch i was just like
macam my kat my handphone kat tepi jadi i tengah buka my computer jadi tangan tu i took out a keyboard my kepala facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
tengok i tu tengah macam [ah] bekerja ni [eh] tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata i tu tengah tengok bollywood kat tepi tu
and like cerita bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
yes
i think (uh) also the thing about watching this (uh) a lot of times with different people right it makes me (uh) find out more about (err) the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan [ah] then dia orang akan pick up different things that you didn't see
ya so like [eh] i watched this the second time but i didn't see it the first time but this person that i'm watching it with
picked up in this movie so i think macam gitu it's quite cool to like tengok (err) with lain orang [ah] to see macam dia orang punya perspective tu semua ya and then like (um)
[oh] what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
(mm)
i think
cartoons i don't watch some cartoons that i watch (um)
i really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like (uh) this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like !wah! damn cool [leh] macam macam and then like
(mm) i pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini so it's actually dari sana [lah] tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that i that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive [lah] it's like
millions of dollars and i only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's i i think it's still very important [lah] so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters i think my favourite character do i have a favourite character i like big bird
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also macam quite interesting
ya so very cool cartoons [lah] and like just now you were saying about k dramas right so the k dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first (uh)
first korean drama that i watch and that's also how i got into k pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
the soundtrack that i listen to and the actually bila i dengar soundtrack
(um)
sometimes when i watch movies also lepas saya tengok movie tu i like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause i curious right i want to know (uh) how the song sound like all that ya what what
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
[orh] ya [lah] soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like [oh] he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the [ah] every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
bercinta
[oh] i like this question because i like wishes
(uh)
honestly right i want a thousand more wishes kerana saya seorang yang tamak
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace jadi pasal (err)
lebih ramai [lah] jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati #blah# #blah# #blah# and then also i want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right i don't want us to be sad i don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
[oh] not a lot of people will say food why why why food
(mm)
unusual superpowers !wah! i've always wanted to try to be invisible because i think when i be invisible right i can like go anywhere i don't have to pay for my bus fare i don't have to pay for my ticket fare then i can do whatever i want so i can like eat
stuff i can just go behind the counter i can go to the cake eat or maybe if i want to try some clothes right then i can like masuk dalam and i pakai baju and i tengok cantik ke tak [eh] and then also maybe say if i want to go to like amusement park !wow! i don't have to queue [eh]
i just go inside i sit down and then i enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then i pay nothing so i think ya [lah] that's that's what i want to
do wanna be invisible because macam quite
(uh) apa ni freeing [lah] ya freeing then (err) nobody knows
who i am i can do whatever i want so [kan] i can beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa i [kan] pasal tak nampak pun ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think i am thinking of right now
it's always about food i think (uh) the reading about minds one sometimes (uh) i think it's cool but i'm also scared about it because like what if i find out something that's
i'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that i wish was free is (um)
actually why one thing [ah] why cannot be many things i say education ya
because like to put in perspective right this year i try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni mahal [lah] satu tahun lima puluh ribu so you imagine kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu (uh)
(err) ribu puluh ribu kali tiga it's like hundred fifty thousand where am i gonna get that money you know
yang tu caranya a lot of money so then and then (uh) i think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where i don't have like a lot of money and then like what if i think about other people like (uh) i remember (uh)
saudara where they had to lay antara dapat duit bursary atau budak tu move on to a better education so kalau budak tu dapat duit bursary maknanya dia kena stay in
(uh) not so not the best education untuk dia and then if that that budak goes on to (uh) a better education he might not get
(uh) the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because i think education macam it helps to break poverty cycles [lah]
ya so like the example i just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they [ah] have to choose between these two and both are important right [ah] yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran ya [oh] ya another thing actually very important (uh)
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay kita pergi dia punya (uh) apa ni petrol station nak pergi toilet nak pergi toilet tak kat [ah]
[ah] petrol station dia nampak tak dia punya jamban so many different
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so i cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
[oh] if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
okay so my friends and i kita selalu berbual how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies tapi kita tetap couldn't kerja because kita perlukan duit right
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so i guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing i think that (uh) people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
[oh] ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right macam people ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening (err) she has made a lot of friends [eh] from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya
[eh] awak sini berkebun [eh] then they ask her [eh] can i join or not like
[eh] then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like [oh] it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
!wah! so nice and like she she she's i i like to see her having fun [lah]
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like !wah! how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
for me my hobbies has always been arts [lah] i really like arts whether it's like macam music atau
makeup eye makeup lukis ke apa [kan] it's very fun and like (uh) i think about hobbies
say if i were to play like music or like (uh) art right i have to practise so i really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true [oh] then i wanna ask (um)
see like (uh) what sort about like music right cause i'm interested in music i really like music right jadi apa you punya favourite lagu [eh]
apa-apa genre [lah]
(mm)
think for me (mm)
kalau lagu melayu [kan] lagu melayu i ingat macam more
to bahasa indonesia i don't know why but i really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff [lah] i think my bahasa indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia [kan] macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam memory [lah] dia nak simpan memory tu dia tak nak lupakan (uh) actually i got this song right from a drama a a drama on youtube it's so good it's only
four episodes ya and then (err) the way they shot it also like the beach i mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs [lah] and it's also by an artist that i really like (uh) actually last year the dia ada datang singer last year maybe last year atau dua tahun lepas dia datang singapore tapi i tak tak pergi !alamak!
what about like live music (err) pernah ada pergi tak dengan experience ke tak live music
to this place
for me i really love concerts [leh] like it's too bad [lah] this year cannot go concerts but i think that's okay because i get to save money right
(uh) then like (mm)
for me [kan] my (uh)
concert yang macam paling memorable tu dengan my sister juga [ah] ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok coldplay [oh] actually an interesting thing about this was (uh)
when i went to buy the tickets for this show so i remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right jadi dia orang nak jual at
a higher price
ya [lah] so like for me (uh)
as a frequent concert goer [kan] you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that [oh] my goodness i am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable [lah] tapi dia punya bila part beli tiket itu pun memorable but in a sedih punya memory ya
[oh] ya i (mm) what about macam (mm) ni punya fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
think for me my fashion style i always like to (uh) dress up i like to experiment since i was a kid so i always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe i would like to try streetwear
and then (uh) if you look at my closet i like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and (err) i i like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then pasal
setiap orang [kan] ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia i mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya i got random question for you (uh) ya do you believe in love at first sight
i don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why i ask you i wanted to know your opinion ya because for me [kan] (uh)
apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik [eh]
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after i know the person after i know their character after
i see them do stuff after i hear them say stuff then it's like yes i like this ciri-ciri jadi i suka orang ni [lah]
so like (err) personally i've never fallen in love at first sight and i think it's
pelik ya
ya what is it
i think this [one] [eh] your hardest question [eh] how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish (mm) how can i don't know about dish [lah] but i think right for i [kan] you know my mesti i pilih okay antara syrup limau atau teh o ais limau
ya i think (uh) like teh o ice also i mean you can minum panas it stays great and then you can minum sejuk it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu [lah] mungkin ada tapi i tak tahu ya and [oh] so (um)
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like (um) say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me (uh) just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
[oh] i was thinking
(mm) korea i think okay but like
i want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
i had a
not a very nice experience when i was at the airport because
(err) apa ni kat airport tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan my makan tengah hari pun
sikit [jer] i think maybe just (err) what do they eat #japchae# [ah] #japchae# i guess i'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but i ate #japchae# #japchae# is noodle ya ya
so then i didn't eat for like dinner and then i was at the airport and there was no halal food i mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
very big [ah] so i if i were to reach there i calculate [lah] like cannot reach there before my gate open what if i reach there then the the kedai tutup then mesti lapar [kan] so i remember i i i only bought kacang
kacang makan
habis tu i only ate in taiwan
!chey! cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane [lah] so i the so these are the things that i think about when i want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as (uh) language culture culture i feel like you can adapt to it ya i don't know i don't think there's a country for me that i wanna stay forever i think i like to jump around
in singapore for tourist place right i like to go nature ya cause i like to relax jadi bila i nampak pokok i nampak
(uh) air air tenteram i tak fikir banyak i boleh dengar
i boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau [jer] but like there's so many different colours of green
like [eh] quite cool [leh] like [oh] and then like (uh) ya i like
to actually i like to listen to the leaves and the meet in the wind
what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
[oh] that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also i i don't think i have a favourite flower [lah] but i i love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right !wah! they were so cool
ya like macam bunga-bunga pun
cantik very delicate
ya
very cool and like (um)
so like what kind of flower like do you wish you can plant
ya
so it's very cool to see (um) (err) what is this the flower moving
in the wind and then (err)
so ya [lah] i really like flowers i also like plant i like nature we all like to relax right it's so cool
and then everybody macam just bersenam dalam dia punya taman

(um) you'll you'll be even more tired so macam power nap actually the minimum
the maximum kalau the best [ah]
twenty minutes here
then you'll gain so much strength
[kan] like i'm like i won't expect it to be twenty minutes also
(um) then i went for a
run
i've been i've been quite active [lah] nowadays like
i really want to focus on losing weight
you know just building myself
(um) and [eh] nak join tak #muay-thai# gym together

(um) they are gonna be there macam ada certain slots certain coaches [ah]
so depends and it's an all girls' gym so i think like i join cause i'm comfortable also
and
my end goal
is to
join evolve [ah]
yes
yes
tak tu tu [lah] soalan cepumas dia saya tak tahu boleh ke tak tapi kita cuba kita tak tahu
you know you may not know until you take
risk
but ya [lah] i mean like
evolve after that then probably like be a p_e teacher
yes dreams of course i'm old we're old man we have to need to
what do you expect
i i ran around (err)
(um) the secondary school area here
ya just like
few rounds [lah]
and then i exercise a bit at the fitness corner i mean it's important to keep yourself healthy you know (um) okay badminton once in a while
you know
nowadays
food
a lot of
process food
and then like you won't get to like
burn the
chemical a lot [lah] then end up getting cancer and all that
this important [lah]
wh~ what was this though the badminton
[ah]
ya
!whoa! i didn't know that
!wow! what
how is that possible
!wow!
!wow!
okay [lah] i mean it's not that tiring
if you know how to might manage your time macam okay one day badminton then one day
gini but evolve is just
something i wanna do
two to three years down the road
then i can take like
until like
from there or something
ya
ya it's important it's important to have smart goals you know
what do you mean
i usually run (um) macam about
five to four days a week [ah]
so
kind of everyday but just like weekends kadang-kadang macam rest penat sangat [kan]
and i'm so taking my part time degree so
quite tiring
so whenever i've
when school starts then whenever i've
free time then i try my best to run [lah]
and
(uh) and
you know my job
like
they
under
they will
i mean this field is quite underpaid [lah] so i'm trying to find jobs that i can you know
like
secure myself financially
(um)
maybe
two k two k plus pun jadi [seh]
yours also i heard it's not two k right
(mmhmm)
the internet also they want experience as i mean like i don't know how am i supposed to find a starting job to get all these experiences in a good company
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem i mean foreigners you know dekat (um)
i mean it's it's common [lah]
but
everywhere now you go like you need experience and this you know
for people like us
kasi [lah] you know chance sikit [kan] tutup mata satu [kan] and just [orh] come
without any experiences in training will be provided [kan] boleh [pe] and
training apa internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much [ah] honestly
but i hope i hope you do find you know job that you can be you know
stable financially you know support your parents you know that
honestly
super hard you like
about hundred percent ten per cent [jer] companies who does that
like they
they don't appreciate you they
once you do something bad
it tarnishes your whole reputation
everything your hard work all gone
[kan] susah nak dapat company yang you know really
focuses on your
[ah] employees welfare
you know and job progression is super important
job progression
yes sure
!wow!
that's unfair
how old is she
she's two years younger and she's the head of your
team
!wah! that's a bit unfair
[orh] it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
i mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies i mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
i don't know [lah] this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
i mean that's why
(um)
m_o_m exist
ya so and anything complain [jer]
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
i am a student care teacher
(err) basically i just supervise the kids [lah]
(um) you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
like baca buku about homework
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
(um)
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
so like you're contradicting yourself macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline macam tak kisah dorang buat apa but then
a moment later you're there changing the
there was [oh] kena buat assessments [lah] apa [lah]
that kind of thing so i'm a bit confused yang budak-budak ni kesian [kan] dah balik sekolah penat
satu hari dah belajar abeh balik
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
talk at all you masuk bilik
start belajar
homework
and tak boleh baca buku
sampai habis assessment book
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
for their well-being macam okay i get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them macam shelter but
okay [lah] kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu
masuk belajar
nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh [tau]
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
kalau rest pun ten minute
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
i know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high [ah] maybe because of that you know kids complain macam [eh] penat you know i don't want to go student care anymore
torturing so
a lot of people
quitting [lah] actually like one month macam about seven
a lot
that's the thing
ya and i can't even laugh with them
i can't even
talk to them
i need to scold every time they can't even will sit macam you know sit like
like
l~
they fold their legs fold pun tak boleh
yes they have to sit macam you know upright sit properly
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
i mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you i mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
you know our own choices macam budak-budak ni like kesian [kan] semua benda kena
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do i do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay [lah] i mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
i wanna know
it's okay just tell me
[oh] ya i did [oh] my god i miss her so much (um)
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and [ah] i met man the house so so empty
and
so dapat dapat jumpa dia sekejap dapat dapat ubat rindu you know you know
and ya [lah]
she dah dah dah dah dah ada suami so lupa [lah]
tak telephone tak apa
and all that ya
but
i don't know i'm happy for her
ya that's like
i mean like
nowadays (um)
you know when you find a soulmate you know you just
you just
dapat and okay kahwin and like
dan you know but but some people out there you know still finding for
jodoh semua ni susah [lah] i mean like but
it's important to go with the flow you know
like
not f~ forced upon it
not
find it you know once you stop finding for it then things
come
ya that kind of thing
but i heard you and your
your boyfriend has been together for
for years right
how long [eh] how long [eh]
[oh] my
god
[oh] my god that's really sweet
[oh] that's true
no
i don't
[eh]
every once a week
[oh] my god that's sweet
[ah]
but then my ex
(err) previously
he don't even remember
dia masih
ya
so
i think he's called ex for a reason
(mm)
is it but are you the clingy type of person or like
i see
okay okay but like
i mean
#mashallah# i mean like
you know last long you know till
till married so wait okay
k
now i need to ask you important question
when
where is
the day i get to eat some nasi biryani
nasi minyak please come on bila ni
when can i be a godma
allah
okay [lah] i mean like we are still young and he is also still young he is in n_s right so you get your freedom now
i mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay [lah] take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
[oh] i love that
i need to write that's
a perfect quote
(um) me and my family okay
i don't know [eh] i mean like i'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have [eh] have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
i i think i have to be the bigger person right now but i'm still coping cause i don't know how
i don't know i'm really i'm lost
but
okay [lah] slowly slowly maybe i get to learn stuff
but i'm still at a stage whereby
i focus on myself a lot
and i'm scared that
you know i might
i might
lose
the responsibility
macam like i don't know i i will learn from it [lah]
i mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
[oh] man
i saw this post and they said that (um)
the first child
macam they will get like a set of rules
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
(um) ya pass off so
macam it's kind of unfair
but at the same time you you are nurtured
(um)
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third [lah]
so that's why like i'm lost right now but then you are eld~ the eldest we're like okay okay i get this right i get that right
so ya [lah] are the pros and cons
but
i i hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because i look up to you also
cringe
(mm)
that's true
that's true
and no wonder i'm friends with you
(um) okay talking about sweet right
i scared [leh] i scared of diabetes
macam takut [tau] okay you know like they say macam when you
(um)
when you buy buang air kecil [kan] then like there's ends
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
how to say macam
ada kencing manis gitu
in my family punya history
ada okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
my grandpa macam semua ada this history of
diabetic
don't you takut [seh] say like you know i'm young and you know i love peach tea i love you know
his deserts you
takut [lah] i mean like i have to take care of my diet [lah]
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
[oh] my
i'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high [lah]
but
okay the thing i am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low g_i food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
so i am like [oh] okay jap white bread is high
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then i i went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower g_i so that you
okay macam
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
insulin tak pakai banyak even insulin is working perfectly
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
(mm)
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
that's the thing kuah lemak apa [ah] cholesterol [oh] my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
i mean i don't mind eating salad
but
the options
dekat kedai ada ke jual salad like hawker centre
i mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce kita beli like ten dollar but then
pakai tu
you save so much
that's true beli like banyak then after that simpan in the fridge
abeh busuk
one to two days
!wah! this is
this is the thing [ah] macam
is quite hard
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition nak physically active [lah] abeh busy [lah] dengan kerja
ya that's true
i mean i've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know peop~ like nu~
nutritionist exist to macam lead them
itu semua pakai duit [seh] do it see i mean like everything revolves around money nowadays
like why can't you just love is free yes
okay love is free
(err) love pun susah dapat like
i think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard
is it a twenty two
no no no
twenty two curse
that's true and parents nowadays also working abeh balik dah tidur you know that kind of thing
and ya [lah] it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have fam~ quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend gi mana
we lepak dengan kawan but i mean it's not wrong but okay [lah] macam
ada balance [lah] okay one day with your parents one day [oh] i've heard of this story before satu okay there's this one (um) student right
dia punya
(um) makcik tinggalkan
her
grandfather
[ah] abandoned him dekat bus stop dekat malaysia
and then drove back home
and left him there
balik rumah dia
malaysia [lah]
singapore
[ah] dia tinggalkan [ah] dia letak bag suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa [ah]
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then (um) they receive a phone call from the dad (um) the dad call another [lah] his son [lah] another son
cakap (um) bapa nak balik you know that kind of thing and the son also tak cari bapa dia for one month
then went there
and nampak bapa dia dekat old folks home
and he said the father said okay me home [lah] then then they say like [oh] it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay i can live in your store room also
the father pass away
ya that's true macam you know
maybe the financially dorang tak boleh handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays banyak macam drama drama you know
typical but i didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life i always watch it in t_v macam [oh] ni ya allah tak baik [seh]
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
trau~ the kids now the kids ada sekarang trauma issues
you know
that's true that's true
i mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why i'm scared i really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
ya [lah] they've taken care of me well apa kecil-kecil kasi makan this a way for us to repay back
that's true macam it it
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good [leh]
because
(um) doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia punya chances
of (um)
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so [ah]
how old is she now
but the around
(oo)
i think more the the the the over sixty five [lah]
definition of
(um) lepak or re~ relaxing at her old age
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe i i mean like if i'm her also i will
bosan [seh] duduk dekat rumah you know like the whole thing like
no fresh air i'll be like
lonely at least we go out where you'll get to people watch you know
just watch people walk
and
i i enjoy people watching honestly so i can relate to your grandma
(oo) that i like the question (mm)
(um) i
think [kan] i would
probably would love
love
to
just
(um)
around
okay [ah]
paris area
london because
i don't know macam singapore
is it so rushing
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only ni semua nak merebut [lah] but then
i have heard a lot of people saying that
you know if you really want to chill chill mango pergi dekat paris
just duduk minum kopi and you
the rest of them are chilling as well
i want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know (um)
ya [lah] but that's my goal [lah]
just
ya you how about you
cantiknya
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax i don't know
i feel like singapore just need to chill a bit [lah]
it's just too fast pace but
ada pros and cons juga fast
pace i mean we're we're successful to certain extent macam economy !wah! jangan cakap [ah]
but
ya [lah]
lepak sikit [lah]
and like
you know the population pun sekarang macam a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
people like us
so i feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control [kan]
i mean it's not weird i mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me i wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
pun
i mean rezeki tu okay [lah] there's rezeki tu datang dari very you know
god but like
i don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
makan pun berapa dah berapa dollar okay nak beli pampers nak beli ini and
five times five
if i have a high paying job i don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle i can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
(mm)
we're like that okay
but
i feel like ya i mean like if you have
something to work towards to
i mean you get motivated [what]
in certain way
but
to me macam house work is not an issue
i mean i would love to have a maid [lah] i've never been living with a maid before macam sedap [kan] ada orang kemaskan you and all that
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future i mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
s_m_u
i mean that's good [lah]
planning is
everything
honestly i mean like
you don't just
go macam okay (err) go with the flow macam go with the flow sangat you know
like
[eh] okay
but like
ya [lah]
i mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
[oh] i took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation i took a one year gap
ya we did we both did i remember
it's like
okay to me macam one year gap is quite productive [leh] like you just take one year to just
think about what you want
actually that's true i mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so (um) and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
momentum dah hilang [tau] hilang graduate
abeh dah tak belajar [eh]
macam #shiok# dah naik #shiok#
so macam if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap i think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
meant to be
that's why i believe [lah] so that
i mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
[oh] man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know i took a one year
gap come on
no i
after i graduated
i work okay
may i i graduated kirakan macam april [lah] [eh] dah habiskan
then i
kept up
till november terus start kerja
do they work part time also
i didn't know that
i didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing i know you were good at savings i know you had like
!wah! a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
[oh] my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason i mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
i feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know i mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
i mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and i heard that s_m_u is a good school
so better [lah] aim for it and there's a lot of my friends yang
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so i feel like you have higher chances of
getting
the s_m_u punya
intake
but #inshallah#
i mean like you can i can [lah] i have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
i mean uni hard is going to be hard i mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya [lah] you can manage your time well
so
i feel like you can [lah]
and s_m_u is good because you are taking full time right
answer me
what what what which course are you planning to get
i mean you just mainly just look at your major [what] minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
so minor i mean you can minor in apa organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
ya
i think minor minor bus~ in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what i mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
[oh] betul betul betul
and
healthcare also
i mean like you can market
but under healthcare [what]
why not
[oh] ya i forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but i have heard about it
[eh] i'm but i'm planning to
i'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause i'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe i will get back to it later
you know you know i'll just explore and
this is the thing i heard you know i don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya i mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
i mean depends [ah] on the situation kalau nak job hop just because [oh] you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not macam you're still young you need to know what you really want in life kalau tak experience macam mana [seh]
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
i'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
progress betul-betul macam you know be successful
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
[oh] my god that is ridiculous okay merepek gila
but
okay [lah] i mean there are so many expectations of us
macam we are barely okay
i'm not
try to
i mean there is
people our age
like with so many macam experience and really capable
but
takkan nak sama okay over generous everyone as the same
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
i mean don't ex~
don't over expect too much and also don't macam
you know like letak kita kat bawah sangat you know macam
dorang macam [eh] korang ni tak ada apa-apa [ah] just nothing you know
middle [lah] macam
borderline you know that kind of thing
so i really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about [lah]
that's true macam like
i always watch like movies you know macam
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
and macam susah [lah] dapat
in singapore
because all those movies are al~
always based on other other countries you know
macam america ni semua
i don't know like
okay like
sometimes i do have thoughts macam if we want to be like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like [oh]
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what i mean
[ah] okay okay this now is a fun topic okay i don't know where but i like [ah] rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and i like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because i'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you
so what type like net~
like usually you netflix
!wow!
!wow! i barely have time for that
do you watch modern family
[oh] my god you should watch you should watch it's funny
[oh] is it good
it's funny
it's it's cute
okay okay
is it okay i didn't know that i mean like i always
[oh] i mean i i've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
apa ni is stranger things
but like okay [lah] i i might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like (uh)
okay [lah] funny but [eh] quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and i'm single as hell
[oh] that's so sweet
ada
i mean i wanna watch but i don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like i don't
i really want to try but i don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
i see okay
that make sense
but i can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
a decent self control punya tolerance but me
i can't like i don't have self control
like once i'm indulge into that [kan] habis
it's over for me so i tend i tend to macam you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why i'm joining like #muay-thai# gym
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya i don't mind spending
ov~
over
time on it
alright [oh] my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since i start playing you know
games
and ya [lah] i mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely [oh] my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the sec~ the older one or
[eh] the younger one
[eh] wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
[oh] are you serious
you don't play with the second one
i see boring
but
ya [lah] i
i mean i love p_s four
for i usually waste money on play nation ni semua
tapi waste of money [lah] so i stop playing games
but overcook is fun
switch is simple kau macam you can bring it around pastu boleh main
that's true that's true
i mean but
ya [lah] i mean
i'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary i mean like
there's a lot of things i wanna do i wanna shop you know i wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
baju ni semua but i'm trying my best not to
because
i feel like overspending i won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
i see [eh] wait wh~ where does he wh~ where macam mana dia invest
on so every month
i see but how much does he save per month
tak sikit [kan] that's the thing
i only invest on every month i just kasi macam hundred seventy gitu
and for fifteen years [ah] then macam ada you will get back like a lump sum
(um) and in case if you were to macam touch wood [lah] macam pass away or anything like
you will get
more
than what you save
macam
hundred k
how to get [ah] macam
i mean it's quite
reassuring [lah] to know that
you know these thing which are the backup plan gitu
ya so i feel like you should you should invest on
i mean i can i can like brief you through it [lah]
like
all these investment and all that kind of stuff
it's really productive okay
we should
okay how was your day
you have to go to work tomorrow right
in the morning [kan]
ya
in the afternoon not in the morning [lah]
(mm)
production meeting [eh]
prepare for the production meeting at the the details [eh]
ya
ya bit busy month
but traditionally it's the busiest month for you right
traditionally for the past
twelve thirteen years right the demand december november december but not this year right because of covid right [ah]
i see
what time will you be back do you think
okay cause i need to prepare lunch
and i want to i think the kids will definitely want
to eat the fish with you [lah] the
ikan kerapu
i don't know what kerapu
i think i tengok first because usually for me
i don't i think for you is best to eat
something fancy for tengah hari [lah] makanan tengah hari [lah]
(uh) nasi you know
sayur
fancy tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam more like salad [lah] because of your condition right because of your kencing manis right your diabetes
so it's best to
to cook the heavy meals for lunch
for the for me the kids kalau ada nasi ada ikan they will eat [lah]
(uh) but i don't want to buy tadi bila i beli ikan tu i tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam ice box bau so i rather just buy satu ekor ikan [lah]
dari beli dua ekor itu hari i beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis
you know susah nak habis abeh end up buang you know so i rather not
sebab tu tadi bila kat #sheng-siong# tadi
i beli satu ekor ikan aje
tak nak membazir
why
ya
(uh) tapi ada kala pula i feel serba salah when i do that kena beli satu pula nanti the kids i want some more fish you know macam
kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada plan tapi mak bawa makan ke
you know atau my mother give food untuk (uh) she packed food from from her house right then she give also that would also
stretch the food even further the food we have [lah]
so i also don't want to waste food [ah] okay so tomorrow then you have to continue your work but you be working from home right you'll be studying from home right
the details [ah]
why take so long you still have to do research is it for each slide
that sounded like writing right it's almost like writing [what]
but you didn't put that much effort when you were write
i have to edit the what your write your your your what your article is is it your your assignment
i have to !wah! i edit punya rak
tapi semalam punya not not that bad [lah] but it's just a simple two three pages
jadi macam [eh]
two three pages but you know it's like
not it's not so bad it's not so badly done i mean i'm not trying to say you did it quite badly but
you know macam if you sit you if you did it this way for your write article you will have less problem [lah] i would have edited even faster but semalam i
i edit tak i didn't really require a lot of time [lah] think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours dah habis [ah] edit
(uh) tadi i berbual dengan my
my russian teacher tu the skype over skype [eh]
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was (err) he was a having a conversation with his friends our (uh) what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me yang
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
i and the song was from #tokyo# square then she's like #tokyo# square so he thought that dia dari jepun ke group ni then i at the moment he said that my eyes lit up i said yes he and i think he knows that singaporean [lah] it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was (uh)
(err) who i don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then i it's like [eh] that's not the famous song from #tokyo# square
but the song actually nice tapi dia pakai lagu #sukiyaki# punya lagu [tau] do you know #sukiyaki# right there's this
it's all because of you you know that song
i'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the #tokyo# square turned it into a song i think using the lyrics they sing it [ah]
(uh) it's not an original so i told him that when i was young i follow kak tina to this concert by #tokyo# square
so #tokyo# square actually that
it's not a tok~ a got a #tokyo# square concert but they perform a few songs [ah]
(uh) because there are many other things that (err) at that show so #tokyo# square was one of them so i i i remember #tokyo# square but the song that that was famous i was telling victor the word #tokyo# slot square is famous for this song called within you i remain is it within you remain or something like that
(uh) that is the originally is from #tokyo# square but there's some (uh) famous mat salleh singers sing that song [lah] western singers that (err) sing (err) #tokyo# square punya lagu but that is i say macam singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
to america right they don't have
a lot of talent [lah] they don't macam you know
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and i said the melody is actually from a japanese song very fa~ very i think is #sukiyaki# [ah] from what i know
(uh) but dia punya melody has been reused and reused by other bands [lah] but that is not the most famous #tokyo# square
(uh) because like i mean nama #tokyo# square tapi dari singapore you know macam
that's the that's the unique thing [lah] that he was like
have you heard the song within you i remain ai ni</mandarin> i love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin> i need you
because my i think kak tina did some events [ah] for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
put us somewhere then she brought me with her [lah] so i think one of that that's why she know #tokyo# square
(uh)
and that they were performing dekat mana [tau] kat depan if i am not wrong [eh] at this padang area near parkway parade
they had this show they had this
no macam this area dekat depan parkway ke sebelah kat parkway ke one of those area [lah] because parkway was you it was like a famous [lah] you can see shopping cen~ shopping mall shopping center dekat eighties nineties mana ada banyak
[ah] so you remember [lah]
(mm)
(uh) the open space then they put up (err) the stage right [eh] (um) but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like [what]
(uh)
sam willows
i think kalau mungkin mungkin yang singapore yang rock band [lah] yang dulu-dulu [ah]
[ah] the malay rock band #ramli-sarip# all that there is known tapi for the english
medium [eh] english medium tak banyak that's why #tokyo# squares is one of tapi yang you kata sam willows sekarang famous there were a few [ah]
(uh)
is there a song baby jane [eh]
(uh)
four
[ah]
(uh)
(uh)
ya because they're singaporean like like
the the drama series actors compared to the chinese (err) medium right like the malay medium
(err) have this problem even english medium you know where they're not professionals now the amateurs right they have a real professional job at the side
at at a real professional job and they do singing or they do acting
(uh) on the side line [lah] it's like the a full time job for them
(uh)
i mean actually added actually actually them the i'm actually say it's the
is the the talent right
he was able to
like they say kembangkan dia punya talent [ah]
we're going to malaysia because he did so many
he did so many wonderful songs i mean i cannot imagine
like a lot of the a lot of the songs like that if he did was famous [what]
ya
[ah] ya the malay medium [lah] but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like #kit-chan#
you know macam yang ada english the (err) english medium ada but they are not
they are not world famous [lah] macam the their world famous because they perform
like macam siapa #jacintha# [ah] #jacintha-abisheganaden# i think #abisheganaden# is it #halim#
at that she because she performed for cats even cats ya
ya
ya
not really a band not ya like but there is a talent [lah] like like the singapore talent [ah]
but macam you have (err) macam art #fazil# you have (err) #jai# [eh] is it #jai# is it the
#nuradi# #nuradi# #nuradi# is a [ah] ya singapore talent
ya ya ya
i think macam we we we know okay like macam acting a lot of them because of the
the #khairul-anuar# join siapa apa
the malay channel [lah] siapa tu
astro [eh]
i don't otherwise director of astro guy so a lot of the malay talent they
he brought he brought over singapore malay talent bring over to malaysia
so they have this (err)
[ah] not really talent train [lah] it's just that they give oppor~ opportunities for them because there's a market macam kira malaysia ada market you know
macam nak cakap pasal comedian ni semua macam kita hantar kita hantar comedian pun comedian macam (err) #suhaimi# [eh] #suhaimi# part time you know at least dia dia part time mostly full time d_j you know so he doesn't really get to hone his comedic skills that i know
jadi macam
not fantastic [lah] not like [ah] #zizan-razak# though
no i think
no i think macam pasal singapore banyak pakai script
singapore the the [ah] they're not very good with improvisation tak bagus
[ah] i i i understand macam boboi boboi punya jokes [eh] #boboi# the group the mahara~ mahara~ maharaja lawak [eh] [kan] they have #boboi# they have the different
[ah] what is that either let like either when they talk about loghat [eh] there's always a tema tema like like loghat like is always going to be malaysia menang because singapore tak pandai buat loghat you know
it's only people like [ah] #zizan# #zizan# [eh]
they can really do loghat know and they really are very good at imitating macam singapore punya macam they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid
you know macam malaysia really bercakap loghat loghat is accent right kira loghat orang #kedah# orang #kelantan# and then
they are more exposure ya
kita punya loghat is loghat bahasa baku
no no but they are very professional i remember i pergi (err) the not kedung kodek what's that
the theater [lah] that the malaysia that we went to to watch the #nadrah# right
the maria hertogh riots thing right so the i remember i was watching pi mai pi mai tang tu at that time was #imuda# #imuda# that there were some people sayang they can perform on stage four to five hours i mean it was a three hour show three hour plus show with interval almost four hours they can really they have really showmanship they are really professionals you know
because they can really perform !ee! apa tu they can really perform macam
buat masa yang berpanjangan [tau] macam ada stamina is really that atau buat orang macam orang pergi #kelantan# #kelantan# they they the people doing dikir barat
they can really do dikir barat the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
(uh) macam for us it's not like that at all that's why i say it's amateurs [lah]
i remember when m #nasir# was talking to a
(err) #hady# [eh] #hady-mirza#
for the
(err) what's the talent show [eh]
the yang yang lama-lama [lah]
dia kata orang glamour ada what is that [ah]
that's the mu~ mu~ not singapore idol the one ya they go to malaysia dia perform astro punya [lah]
i think astro punya organise so ya guest judge was
(err) m #nasir# so (err) #hady-mirza# because i also don't have astro but i watch on youtube [lah] i i i i watched through
[ah] tapi dia ada all the the veteran singer so #hady# was face off with this other
they need to create that rivalry i think on purpose [lah]
[ah] so they have this person in the end dia menang dua-dua two of them memang [kan]
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite i think (err) (err) m #nasir# asked him (err) #hady# where have you been
why now you know macam like in a way kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat malaysia you know
because he was (err) wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from
for work (err)
ya pasal dia dah then he wanted to stop then he went off drugs right then he he he decided that okay this is really menyanyi is really his talent you know
is he forgotten ya
ya
ya that is the problem [eh]
no but macam i remember when i was watching those chinese drama series [eh]
like zoe #tay# and that time zoe #tay# was the were the in she was really the talent like #pan-ling-ling#
junior [eh] #yuan-ching# you tahu you kenal dia was she some
ya zoe #tay# was from your ni
#yuan-ching# #yuan-ching# yang dekat #jurong# [eh]
[oh]
her association
no but but you had that #yuan-ching# punya alumni #yuan-ching# punya alumni is it #yuan-ching#
#yuan-ching# macam hancing the the #yuan-ching# punya alumni dinner right you [eh]
no i said if you want to go you can go with
siapa tu
(err) your friends apa ashik [eh] siapa
#amin# [kan] dia orang tak pergi [eh]
i told you the three of you form a table [what] with your other friends and sama kelas
no at that time [lah]
now memang susah
[ah]
pass away already [eh]
pass away [eh]
retired [lah]
cikgu ahmad said macam pernah dengar [jer]
how does it look like
is it badan besar rambut putih [eh]
[oh]
pointed out [ah]
as in he's still
actually i feel kind of sad that my teachers are retiring i don't know for some reason why
i just
ya macam macam macam seroja was telling me she was retiring from n_u_s right i feel so sad you know
or or even when peter bush was saying i felt so sad cause i was like what i felt that they could go on and on no forever and then retiring make me feel sad i don't know for some reason it just makes me sad
you know
ya
they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but i thought that they will be like okay like for example i thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
you know to be ya i mean be (err) get get new more books you know but macam the way he said like they said well you know like the wood that's it for me man and it's just macam seroja
she's just tired you know
and (um)
i think that's the main reason why they retire
[eh] even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine [oh] for you you are millennial i'm not [sia]
you you are i'm not i'm older than you sayang
i'm a nineteen seventy nine
(uh) i am a generation x [leh]
[ah] tu [ah] si si siapa was telling me these millennials [ah] because it's
it's really the you [lah] but you are not the the the the people that #seroja# and #borshak# was saying [lah]
the they were saying that this millennials [ah] lazy you know lazy [ah]
ya
ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right mana tengok seroja i tengok kesian [ah]
[ah]
because i think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
dia beli rumah tu about satu point satu satu point dua juta [tau]
no she said people the
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to (uh) buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house pun (err)
(uh) it's slow down macam orang pun tak nak beli
so
rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu i think
i think ten years [eh] twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even (err) make any profit
(err) around the same price as #seroja#
(uh) (uh)
(uh) dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual
dia tak nak jual
(uh)
macam tinggi [lah] tak nak jual harga tinggi [lah] she just want to sell (uh)
slightly more [lah] or around the same price [lah]
because she already bought a f~ she already got (err) her flat
(err) her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
dia punya rumah yang ini tingkat dua yang rumah ke sana tu tingkat lapan
she want to because she love (err) cycling
[ah] and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle dekat
her condo tu [kan] not near the beach right so macam
to her is an effort [lah] to go back and forth naik basikal di situ and i think a bit #ulu# [lah] because situ [kan] jauh [kan]
she like cycling but macam
i think she wants to cycle near the beach [lah] she doesn't have to
(uh)
ya [lah] but she has wonderful legs [ah]
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but macam
for me when i see her i tengok i don't think money is a problem of course she like to
macam is typical of (err) they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but i think for her to be able to
macam still tinggal that rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual and still have (err) her she's start to pay ready for her house
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
i think around (uh) ten years or so [ah]
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road [eh]
the amber road i'm not sure maybe [ah]
i think i i don't think is a new condo [ah]
(uh) (uh)
no no hers was second hers was a new lepas tu dia kata t_o_p ada t_o_p
(uh) it's new it's new
[ah] tapi besar because rumah dia belum habis renovate [eh] because they had to for stall the
(uh)
(uh) the no the the macam kira development dah habis semua tapi orang semua i think they nak renovate [ah] sikit-sikit [kan]
tapi pasal renovation kena put on hold because of the covid
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
so i was thinking to myself [oh] not bad [eh] dia tak payah jual rumah in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to jual rumah so maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta i mean she's already nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
and not having to borrow money from the bank
maybe she has the money ada duit juga [ah]
that one betul-betul ada (err) pool or view of the pool ya
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
tiga tiga bedroom
she say three bedroom but i only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice sayang it was like
[oh] my god sex heaven
(uh) i think i think for dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal condo she shared with a flatmates dulu dia tinggal dekat h_d_b sekarang dia tinggal kat condo i think she found a new flatmate [eh] and then macam kat kat russia [kan] they don't have this quality of
condo [kan]
(uh) so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware [lah] about the development about about buying condo (uh) that #dasha# is aware so macam macam it's very sexy [lah]
it's very very nice
no i think she stay i think she stay at condo because dekat itu dekat dengan russian nya embassy
and and then dekat #bukit-timah# dia nak dekat dengan nature agaknya orang putih gitu [kan]
[ah] shared dengan ramai ramai ramai
i tak tahu i never ask
(uh)
because i thought i i thought she stayed at #serangoon# garden then then suddenly she went over so that one i don't know that story i don't know
(uh) (uh)
(uh) but i think she like the location agaknya
dekat dengan rumah dekat dengan dekat kerja agaknya
(uh) because this mat salleh they like their nature they like
(uh) dia naik bus dia dia orang naik bus
i don't know i think she definitely made a choice
because maybe the flatmate yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya
!huh!
i don't think it's sponsored
but i can ask [lah]
but it's like i think for europeans is not really
they're not really macam kita a bit rude about money we talk about money like macam i can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if i ask the question to audrey i think #dasha# will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about macam
especially french so i think it's something that they
macam it's not really the thing [lah] macam us cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual
(uh)
i mean i can't ask that question
but
but she's very (err) thrifty [lah] [sia]
you tahu this this year i don't see her spending anything dia tak beli baju baru
rent [eh]
(uh)
i think it's two or three of them i think it's two of them in the room
ya
(mm)
mungkin dengan boyfriend dia ke apa kita tak tahu [kan] mungkin ada boyfriend [lah]
that's why she move (uh)
kalau like that okay [eh]
make sense right
(uh) but #sami# suka
i know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo [lah]
(uh)
macam dia dia kata dia ada swimming pool kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna [kan] (uh) that's fixed to me condo [lah]
(uh)
macam some of the aminah punya friends right they tinggal condo [ah]
(uh)
so they are a bit different [lah] their their the way they
(uh) macam (err) i guess that's macam we have friends in n_u_s i remember i have friends in n_u_s
i mean we are just h_d_b three room four room dweller but that this fence pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
their upbringing is different right
(uh) distinction [lah] (uh)
ya
they don't necessar~ from what i observed right they don't necessary have the best grades i remember when i was in school
i mean
yang pak ali [eh] you know pak ali always get the best grades macam dean's lists [lah] #borhan# also the one the d_j d_j radio warna right but they were from h_d_b it doesn't
macam ya people used to think that (err)
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so [lah]
(uh)
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best [lah] the best usually not them [lah]
(uh) i i mean i remember i had this german coursemate near terrace [eh]
she he ya
ya
he was educated sayang he was educated when he was young he was educated in #eton# [tau]
he went to #eton# know that was his socialization [tau]
did i ask him what did you do he's baba budak orang baba
[oh] i (uh) my father owns a travel agent company
(uh)
tak tahu betul ke tidak
(uh) and then
(uh)
(uh huh)
dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi tuition
dia pergi tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject
(uh)
this is doing n_u_s you know
[ah]
(uh) teaching macam he has he has his full time job
even after tu dia continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so macam you know you have this
but he's very nice [lah] i think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time kita because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you berbual and then dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang so most of the time we speak melayu and baba so
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
i cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so i i ask him [oh] can you get for me this this this this you know like the c_ds like from the then he will get for me [lah] of course [lah] he won't pay for it [lah] but because it's my mahal right so i pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there dia beli dia ingat i don't know how it is now terrence
i i found out that he was educated at #eton# so i was like #eton# then #dasha# was telling me i want to teach russia russian language to (err) the people in #eton# but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the #eton# boys (err) russian [lah]
#eton# is like the boarding school
in u_k in u_k there's a boarding school
no no no dia nak pergi u_k actually tak nak pergi singapore
tapi dia kata dia not good enough [lah] #dasha# kata sebab tu #eton# they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually #eton# then after that the #eton# got
a professor but dia orang u_k [lah] u_k
u_k or american [eh] but very fluent in russian and then because (err) project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but macam macam russian only a few know
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
[ah] ya
(uh)
(uh huh)
by russia [ah] no (uh) but (uh)
ya and and and the thing is is not just (uh) it's not just vietnam but also (uh) indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
(err) study in russia because russia (uh) (uh) study medicine in russia
i told you about this malay girl who studied russian i don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year [ah] to brush up on her russia before she
(uh) tapi be you know why they go to russia because dia punya tuition fee
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to u_k or america (uh) it's recognise [lah]
singapore i tak tahu but (uh)
there's this girl i thought singaporeans but when (err) #kacha# was telling me #kacha# the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to #sarawak# or #sabah#
so there were (err) she was speaking russian to her husband and dia she have two children two or three children they all go to #sabah# or #sarawak# then after that yang orang kat belakang dia there's this man [ah] (err) medical doctor
dia kata [oh] he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns (err) medicine in russia
(uh)
!huh!
money
no but i think is in a hospital in malaysia dia orang recognize
[ah]
malaysia hospital recognize
(uh)
i think wait singapore punya that they have a different different tu [ah]
because i remember my friend you know yang arwah nadim tu yang meninggal tu isteri dia
belajar medicine dekat #kelantan# [lah] if i'm not wrong #kelantan# also
but #kelantan# ni banyak
but #kelatan# punya he he actually don't want to go there he doesn't want her to stay there
but she cannot come and work here
n_u_s tak recognise #kelantan# punya medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes dia come back
(err) to be dia kerja kat #mendaki# [kan] arwah dia until he very sick already he went over there
(um) but yang your friend tu siapa
yang your friend tu yang follow kita tu pergi #kashmir# siapa tu
(uh)
(uh) #rundy# his sister she studied in ireland right
no ireland not scotland
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
you know that the hair stylists yang i pergi the hairdresser tu yang pergi kedai cina tu anak perempuan dia tak boleh masuk dekat medicine school dekat singapore so she actually took out a i think two hundred thousand dollar loan
to send her daughter to australia
mahal
so she want the daughter to but i said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka australia
[ah] because dia tak stress [lah] macam singapore
the pace of life is different [lah]
(uh) (uh) laid back
[kan] bilang
she told me that
!aiyo! #kartini# what you think is so serious and important here over there is like
so laid i mean this is #sofiani# who finish his
paper like one week or two weeks earlier before the deadline you know this guy and he said that we really went over to australia he just learn how to be so laid back that he doesn't really care but i know
#sofiani# will find it very difficult to not care [lah] you know
ya he will care a bit but maybe not as much as before
ya
ya
i know your auntie have to challenge with
challenges with the egypt and jordan right
right with the girls right but the guys are the ones studying local
kakak kakak kakak kakak dah tak ada adik perempuan
(err) so pula dapat keluar pergi luar negeri
you know #ahmad# #ahmad# stays here
#ahmad# was like when he switched to secular right
#adi# secular
[ah] same as #ahmad# right
[oh]
ya
strength
their strength is languages (uh)
ya
ya
she wanna do psychology from what i heard she wanna do psychology siapa si
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test [leh]
ya but we we found out from my
ustazah yang teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example yang daripada
(err) university of
apa [eh]
jordan and the university of
not cairo [lah] (err) #al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
(uh) it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
it's not considered a degree level macam for example you want to be a teacher right
they don't consider a degree for #al-azhar# a degree
yes that's what my ustaz told me
so macam it has to be like u_i_a u_i_a they recognize degree
(uh)
don't know #allahu-aalam#
jordan i tak tahu
(uh)
(uh)
could be [ah] because mak dia mak dia tak nak but but but (uh) the ustaz kata that's the reason macam for example kita dapat second upper the second upper (uh) or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya
ya that's why like people say why they go to madrasah for that's the big question everybody ask
siapa
(uh) #wani# [eh]
agaknya [ah] tu
i don't know now (err) covid i tak tahu [ah]
unless they do online [lah] unless they do online [lah] but i don't know #al-azhar# now not that good [lah]
so that's why a lot of people recommend pergi jordan
there's dia orang punya
the system of learning [ah]
(err) i think ever since the the egyptian spring [ah] uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time [lah] we know that the story [lah]
[oh] now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
[kan] itu hari si king of jordan datang
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
i don't i don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which i think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like tiga empat daripada eygpt and then she knows other dialect [lah] so dia kata ada kesian because she was telling me because dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz
ustaz hasan so dia bilang [ah] dia bilang dengan i [lah] some of them come from negeri yang you know they come from kampung so only know dialect [tau] dia orang tak tahu so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend [ah]
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
and this lady have a condition [ah] dia kata then i ask (err) your cousin [eh] how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into [eh] [a'ah] kak tini bukan senang you know like nak kena ni nak kena surgery nak kena ni can you imagine nak kena like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that i said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap [lah] nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people agaknya derma i think embassy derma agaknya and then spend money on them you know (err) spend the money on translations (err) these translators
[oh] ya because the the king would (err) #hussein# not #hussein# i i i kenal bini dia (uh) he was very impressed the singapore side very cepat very efficient
but when i was telling doctor ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia showing off
can just give to the poor people but i think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
(uh) that is the rumour [lah] that she tunjuk the jam
(uh) but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
(err) at the
(uh)
(err) visa at the jordianian embassy [ah]
ya but it's also something that has strength [lah] because her #fusha# is very good like the orang arab dengar #fusha# [lah] yang i try to berbual dengan ustazah hadijah
itu #fusha# but okay so macam the the difficult dialect is not egyptian [lah] according to them [lah] but i don't know i tengok egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt punya dialect very near #fusha# the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran [lah] you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the #fusha#
banyak orang arab banyak [kan] very diverse
that's the that's the thing [lah] so they get whatever they can
dia tinggal kat egypt itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama she even take she even take #talaqqi# courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take #talaqqi# she taught she taught me how to tajwid
she told me yang the and then when i ask #abi# #abi# say betul
ada yang ustaz yang famous sampai boleh kalau you buat salah your bacaan sampai boleh ambil you know your you know the what is that thing [ah]
when they collect the smoke the cigarette punya ashes [leh]
(uh) they can throw that at your face
like garang [ah]
you know but that is the the the nature [lah] but then you want to get the #sadat# [eh] they call it #sadat# you you want to get #sadat# so you do that [lah]
let her just stay here [lah] let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her
let her bukan poly tak boleh pakai tudung pakai [jer] tudung kat poly
(uh)
or you want her to go j_c okay [lah] go j_c pakai then there's the other thing [lah]
i think (err) tengok appetite dia macam math and science
language is a bit hard [lah]
but she might she might change her mind because i wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when i was you know
(uh)
i think from what i know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength [ah]
in singapore you cannot do well macam
macam i don't think so [lah]
(uh) i mean i have friends who who like for example #murni# and i have a mutual friend
(err) namanya
(err) okay [lah] one of our girlfriends [lah]
so i'm not that close to her [lah] because
tak tahu [ah] i just tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat [lah] but she's very close to #murni# so now she's the
i_s_d punya translation unit she she's the head you know
i mean i don't have to worry about it until
pasal i selalu berbual dengan dia
then i made her watch asian alida bahasa melayu i even i even (err)
(uh)
gunakan (err)
(err)

#bukit-bendera# the punya famous [ah]
cable car kalau you datang #penang# you mesti naik tu [ah] but
kita we apa tried tapi dia punya attraction tutup [kan] pasal land slide so we we cannot go

banjir dia dah dah surut ke belum macam we were hoping [ah]
teruk
[a'ah]
[ah]
(uh) (uh) ya [lah]

kalau macam let's say [ah] the the minister [ah] okay no restriction tak boleh pergi #penang# [ah] then yes
i i bought the travel insurance they can pay me back
ya but this [one] there is no ka~ kalau kau cancel means is
your own expense [tau] [ah]

[a'ah] kalau tidak dia kena pergi macam go arou~ longer way [lah] longer route
[ah] correct
conserving atau (err) (uh)
but the
and one of the attraction kita pergi [ah] yang apa the apa terbalik tu apa bang
upside down museum itu kalau orang pergi pun mesti ek~ because [eh] ak~
(err) #penang# tu like i said dia punya attraction dia tu tak banyak dia punya attractions tu #bukit-bendera# tu so kalau [ah] i think kalau dia punya other attractions macam all sorts of museum [lah] dorang buat ada yang macam cup apa

kita tengok kita dengar dari news [kan] [oh] there's no apa [ah] zero no new cases no local new cases kita macam harap-harap just make it zero [lah] make it zero make it zero [kan]
then kalau macam tempat locations [oh] dekat sini ada apa visited by covid nineteen
so we try to avoid [lah] that that place tapi kalau sometimes it's unavoidable
tu pun tak boleh juga [kan] macam [eh] hari tu ada kat ion hotel [ah] ion orchard hotel [ah] [ah] orchard shopping centre
kita pergi sana [kan] tapi kena ikhtiar [lah]
what what we can do is that like i say we are wearing mask is one of the protection so kita dengan ni kita good hygiene dah mesti dah mesti instill in you already

because the certain flu jabs are for certain types of flu string so sometimes you can you can take the flu jab already and then the next few months you have flu which but it is cause by different string [ah] dia tak effective jadi dia cakap if not effective what for i take don't need to take [ah]
#siao# because to me to me pada aku you should take it because you are facing all these people all the prisoners all the visitors coming in and out test ya took twice
every month i do not know but that time in that one week he had to take twice
whatever who what if you are if you are handling any anybody that is coming in from
from other countries ya (hmm)
(mmhmm)
actually nowadays dulu aku aku dulu macam aku gung-ho [ah] tak takut tapi lepas tu [ah]
tak
i can i can even watch you know like they poke poke poke me but now [ah] i cannot
sensitive makin takut
kalah bising [ah]
sekarang dia dah start jalan [kan] jadi rumah aku berselerak [ah]
ye [lah]
i don't mind berselerak sometimes but
because
diri kau sendiri [lah]
i know [lah] it's good but you see [ah] i'm de~ i'm dealing with different cases already macam kau aku rasa ian is very well behaved
ya [lah] it's a different phase but i'm reaching that
ya i'm i'm i'm ya i'm so is like
ya correct so he is a different mature phase already secondary school
i have all the phases that's the problem that's why i aku macam stressed because i have one boy i have one bo~ [eh] actually [ah] this conversation do we need to speak #singlish# or not
no need [eh] nevermind [ah]
asalkan ada dua-dua [lah] mixed
#hairi# dia susah nak dengar cakap aku kadang-kadang and he is very defensive and he is going into the teen phase okay i have #aira# who is in primary school but because she's a girl and she is going through
[ah]
what's that word [ah] period [ah] she puberty she might she might be getting her period soon
hopefully soon belum [seh] she ask she ask me you know ibu when am i going to get my period five already primary six
[dey] kau sec one [eh] sec two ke sec one i know you're the last one you know when but if you follow genes [lah] aku primary three
primary three i already got
dia dia dia aku punya marker dia kalau dah start dah start [kan] chocolate [lah] [ah] that day she start craving for chocolate stuff or sweet stuff want to go mcdonald's then he will ask me are you going to get your period already so ya i think so dia aku punya marker every month
nanti kadang-kadang dia mood swing aku tak mood swing aku okay [jer] lepas tu nanti dia macam nanti dia mengamuk mengamuk mengamuk lepas tu dia dah mengamuk nanti dia cakap dengan aku are you going to get your period [ah] tapi after that i'll get it [lah] he's my marker first then after that i will get it nanti dia okay kelakar [kan] ya but but after that will be [ah] ye sejiwa [lah] sangat ya i think we sync already
ya so i have #aira# then i have #hasif# who is coming into primary school level and he talks so much and because he has the influences from dia punya brother and sister jadi dia punya perbualan tak macam budak primary school punya perbualan macam #elly# masih boleh berbual cute cute
cute [lah] masih cute [lah] juga #hasif# tak [tau] dia berbual macam orang besar dia dah macam more naggy now maybe because i'm naggy or his brother is naggy lepas tu dia and then he he like
abang why you never wait for me abang can you quickly do this kalau kalau aku ada macam abang you never clear the litter bukan aku yang suruh [tau] dia yang suruh
[ah] and of course i have #hafif# [ah]
but it's tiring [ah]
it's really tiring you know
in a way [lah] tapi nanti abang dia complain nanti macam kadang-kadang laki aku cakap tanya aku whether i'm okay or not aku i have to tell him the truth [ah] i'm not okay
there's once i actually complain to him kalau aku punya kerja [eh] senang [tau] kau bangun pagi kau cium anak happy semua anak-anak tengah happy apa tanya okay okay i see you later [ah] then after that bila kau balik you attend your stuff already outside you go to the gym you come home it's dinner time the kids happy then it's already bedtime so you so so your time with them is like just it's only like one two hours [ah] it's bed time already finish then it's my time with you [ah] but in the middle
you you don't need to settle their breakfast you don't have to settle their lunch you don't have to settle their dinner [ah] then you don't see ya me instructing them [eh] pergi mandi [lah] sekarang dari pukul berapa kena solat kena ni kena gitu ni semua tolong ibu [oh] my god
!alah! camera tu camera tu for show [jer] bukannya pakai pun bila aku tinggalkan budak-budak sorang-sorang kat rumah
then aku penat [tau] aku cakap dengan dia kau balik kau nampak semua dah settle [tau]
except for sometimes berselerak which i will i will always like okay okay clean up clean up
after i try
pasal aku tak nak dia stressed [ah] kononnya macam dah dah tempat kerja is so difficult already then you come home and then you see more mess and you get fed up you know
so i try to clean up a bit
which is difficult [lah] because you know how many times i clean in a day
it's a lot of times you know
anything [ah] so like because i have cats right jadi i have no choice in the morning first thing in the morning i have to do is vacuum then after that i mop
by the time tak payah tak payah tunggu satu tak sampai tunggu tiga jam [lah] satu dua jam [jer] kau nampak bulu semua bergerak
so i have to do a vacuum again ya i i vacuum like
i cannot see it if i see it
i have to do it jadi aku vacuum again
but i can't because i have a i have a crok~ (err) a crawling toddler you know abeh aku tak suka jadi aku kena if i shave them [ah]
which i'm going to shave them tomorrow [ah]
if i shave them is lesser
tak [lah] cepat [lah] nanti grow balik [ah] [ah]
kena shave again aku shave sendiri [lah] mana ada kena bayar apa benda
shave sembarang
[ah] initially kita shave sembarang [a'ah] petak-petak [lah] gasak [ah] then after that macam initially macam kita nak [eh] let's let's try to to maintain dorang punya fur so we use the the the head defe~ defe~ whatever [lah] then in the end [ah] tak kuasa [lah] go down to zero shave aje semua terus nampak macam [ah] nampak macam biasa balik
aku punya ni banyak message [ah] macam banyak sangat itu [ah] messages coming to my phone
!hais!
help apa
condition rumah aku
takde there's no way [lah] i the only way is for me to lazy parenting [lah] the robot i have i have it no it works the thing is aku
we were observing the robot [tau] kita cakap kesian robot ni pasal dia banyak benda yang dia kena manoeuvre macam kalau aku jadi robot [kan] aku macam like !alamak! meja !alamak! ada child punya benda !alamak! mainan no and and that's how dia macam macam confused [ah] so the best wai~ the best thing [ah] when i was using it the best was when it is in the kitchen cause it is easy i do not know where to park it ya it's a huge one
kita beli second hand aku punya benda takde [lah] first hand semua second hand
kita beli daripada orang
!hais! when will i have humans who can help me at home
ya that's what i do [lah] i do lazy parenting
i called it lazy parenting [lah] i just order them about macam #ayra# sekarang dia dah pandai
belakang [a'ah] [lah]
dah lama apa baru sekarang kau perasan dah lama
kelabu asap ya granite
actually rumah aku dah dah takde is not in sync already all the stuff
it's all dah no [ah] the island i push there already because i don't i don't bake any more [mah] ya ya pasal aku dah tak bake jadi aku letak [jer] [lah] tolak ke tepi dulu so i have space to move around in the kitchen
then how yang tu kau tak pergi yang block two one eight tu why jauh daripada apa
there is a bus that goes to #kranji# [what]
i think so ya because sometimes (err) aku punya neighbour ni dia sekolah dekat #kranji# juga kadang-kadang dia balik lambat dia tak naik three zero seven dia ambil lagi satu bus and then it drop behind aku tak tahu
ya you have to come back here [ah]
rumah #jannah#
[orh] the that's a new m_r_t ya i do not know what is the
i do not know what is it
aku nampak rumah orang [jer] view apa
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
or
tu rumah baru apa
cause macam those rumah-rumah yang baru [kan] the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing aku macam like ya exactly pasal tu pasal we say resale the best that's why resale punya prices is still
three hundred
(mm)
(hmm)
no [ah]
pasal that time aku tanya [ah] #naz# rumah aku punya two years two years ya
ya means kalau dah naik market if i want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
jauh [ah] aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus [tau] cause of a southview kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak block sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang block sana block mak mertua aku block sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya block macam block aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada e_m dengan e_a yes correct then yang kat hujung-hujung is e_a ada tapi mahal
ya this location quite difficult that time ada yang block opposite opposite my house block two zero four dia jual dia punya e_m
then dia jual murah because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then i was thinking maybe i should just go for it [lah] since i'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later gila nasib baik ya i was thinking of that [ah]
ya i was thinking you know like [eh] this is the best time you know yang let's just do it [lah] nanti kita boleh fikir cause right now also i'm still paying for for the house using my c_p_f [what]
not not not tapping into his so okay apa
tapi
dia bayar dia punya part is lapan ratus aku punya part lima ratus
(hmm) but kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena increase but then again you'll be difficult [lah] cause if i prolong like this no job no c_p_f contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser bila aku nak itu
so it's gonna be difficult [lah] so lucky thing also [lah] we never go cause now i'm re~ rethinking twice do i really want an e_m do we really need an e_m is like a lot of space
and a lot of space to clean up
so
ya i will need the space [ah] but at this moment i try to
!chey! sudah [lah]
kejap [jer] then lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak
tak aku aku nak need bigger space but then aku pun fikir bigger space means we probably buy more things
you know so
just be happy [jer] [lah] dengan apa dengan space yang aku ada because most of the time pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik
kitchen
(mmhmm) correct
three is just enough in in in apa in the end pun kita plan at this moment [ah] because i don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
#aira# yang tu yang tak she volunteered she say nevermind #hafis# sleep with me
(hmm) because dia sorang [jer] apa yang she gets everything [what] her own her own like double girls [lah] [ah] but because i was thinking also because their age gap is very very far (hmm) that's why she don't mind that #hafis# sleep with her
which
they are all sleeping together still tilam tilam kau tu very useful bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal
no #aira# has her own platform
so she sleep on her own tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam
ya in a way [lah] so gasak korang [lor]
tu dah start nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne
[a'ah] [lah] how do you feel about it
i thought he had a not say a girlfriend [lah] but there was this girl
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
kerana
how to react how to
(mmhmm)
but
but it's not due to ian or it's due to to him the family
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
jap [eh] aku punya sini tak tak tak tak tak mute ke
ya allah ya rabi daripada tadi
kita berbual habis tu aku tak mute aku punya itu
no [lah] but i i do not know
[ah] takde pun
#la-ilaha-illallah# tak tahu [lah]
apa-apa [ah]
satu setengah [ah] (mm) (mm)
ya exactly cuma masalahnya is the noise from the background aje hopefully it doesn't affect so much [lah] exactly habis-tu pula telefon aku aku tak tahu
[oh] ya we don't know [ah] we never
but that's the thing you see our aku tengah pasal bila first time aku nampak this thing [kan] aku macam like
tadi kita tadi kita dah macam cakap [kan] pasal ni aku cakap aku nak berbual dengan laki aku tapi laki aku cakap ya i don't speak malay which is true [lah] he no [oh] my god tak aku [jer] mixed mixed aku sorang [jer] yang boleh berbual dengan korang melayu fasih no problem takde masalah langsung kalau nak kasi aku apa kalau kau nak aku berbual apa tu !chey! berbual melayu yang yang no [lah] i mean like using proper malay words also i think i can try
[a'ah] tu [lah] aku pun rasa macam gitu [eh] cakap pasal banyak english banyak melayu kelmarin aku kena interview that was on wednesday no on tuesday
so mendaki nak interview aku so mendaki cakap dengan aku [eh] #hasif# ni [kan] in every of his class pasal #hasif# [kan] ambil yang mendaki nya classes which is free right [ah] in every of his class dia actually very outspoken pandai berbual [ah] you hantar dia untuk itu [eh] untuk preschool tak cakap ya dia pernah start daripada preschool [lah] start daripada play group dia cakap [eh] how about your other children aku cakap [oh] ya my eldest tu memang [ah] daripada nursery [ah] all the way sampai kindergarten [oh] kita tengah cari families [lah] yang hantar anak-anak gi [ah] preschool kita nak interview you boleh tak
okay [jer] aku aku sembarang gasak [lah] tak [lah] dia nak kasi aku voucher tak kesah [lah] aku tak kesah if it if it helps the community apa salahnya then dia cakap ya so kebetulan kau ingat tak yang there's one day yang aku hantar korang satu article a lot of malay families tak hantar so it's on conjunction with that kiranya dorang nak interview aku tu [kan]
to create awareness that how macam mana [ah] sekolah [ah] for preschool [kan] for preschoolers it's good to send kids (err) to preschool to
as a stepping stone
you know permulaan from all the different cases [lah]
ya ramai a lot so bila aku berbual dengan so yang datang tu is a mendaki person and then there's this person i do not know i think she is (err) from
yang (err)
maybe from the preschool punya aku tak tahu [lah] okay lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang interview aku tu it's from berita harian so aku tanya actually kenapa you nak interview i pasal the preschoolers [ah] cause is it because of this article that i read (err) budak-budak [ah] apa bangsa melayu tak itu
aku cakap [ah] [ah] tak dorang tak hantar then i say kenapa (err) what's the reason you tahu tak apa dia punya reason dia cakap dorang cakap is not necessary
jadi dorang hantar k one k two [jer] !huh!
aku cakap [lah] [eh] itu zaman mak bapa kita [seh] zaman mak bapa kita ye [lah] kita hantar k one k two [jer] [ah] tapi sekarang i think
the system dah berubah
no
if you send to the government punya the p_a_p punya dorang memang tak ada childcare service apa it's only a few hours everyday lain [lah] kalau dorang ambil ambil yang macam [ah] macam aku punya is private so they have a childcare service from seven to seven
so pada aku macam like apa [seh] pada aku like why would you say it is not necessary pada that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan you bila you [ah] decided to hantar [lah] anak you pergi preschool
that's where then then i ask [lah] this interview going to be in malay or english [eh] abeh dia cakap in malay [lah] aku cakap my malay is also tak strong sangat (mm) kita mixed mixed boleh cakap [ah] boleh [ah] so kita berbual
the dia punya question was very legit [ah] like macam okay first kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi preschool secondly [ah] bagaimana [ah] bagaimana [ah]
(mm) [ah] apabila menghantar mereka tu [kan] [ah] did it help
did it help in what dorang punya perkembangan [ah] dalam pelajaran
[ah] development self development tu aku cakap [lah] pasal dorang punya motor skills dorang punya cognitive behaviour dorang punya social skill and then benda-benda yang yang preschool boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar like saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang math ke
more sight words ke phonics ke it's very difficult for me to read i don't have the takde macam dia punya layout on how to teach them
tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah [kan] semua dah ada
(err) a program for them [ah] senang sikit
so dorang tanya like (um)
more of it is actually #hasif# because #hasif# is very outspoken
then dia cakap like macam how do you feel [lah] bila hantar like is there any improvement aku cakap ya ada banyak [lah] improvement terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang very (err) friendly
you know he's very active dia pandai pandai berbual public speaking pun dia tak takut
which is true tak takut [seh] [ah] dia macam like [ah] gasak [ah] sembarang [ah] you know
so but aku macam like feel very abeh dia tanya aku [lah] like (err) is it do you think that it's because of finances
then aku cakap terus terang ni memang berat because saya ni sekarang tak bekerja jadi [ah] finances okay [lah] berat juga untuk anak-anak tapi this is for anak-anak education there has to be a way mesti ada jalan lain kalau nak cakap pasal private tak boleh
we go to a government based [ah] government aided sekolah and then kalau kita low income mesti the sekolah has a system for the lower income family jadi dapat further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about kalau tak nak berbual pasal finances there could another reason the other reason kenapa [ah] mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi preschool kerana tak ada tempat [ah] tak ada tempat (mm) in the neighbourhood tak cukup preschool ya so so i cakap okay terus terang [ah] untuk #hafif# i masuk [kan] nak masuk [kan] dia infant care
i registered him for infant care bila i masih dalam perut this is where orang semua cakap [eh] #kiasu# nya dulu pun i pun macam gitu aku cakap gitu dulu pun aku macam gitu apasal [eh] orang apa pregnant masih dalam perut dah dah registered now after that i dah kena i tahu kenapa kerana tak ada tempat so people have to be like
think ahead cause a lot of families right now i told her [lah] a lot of families right now dorang prefer hantar anak from what i know i notice prefer hantar anak pergi preschool pergi childcare daripada ada maid kat rumah because kalau kat childcare budak-budak belajar can develop you know at home [ah]
(mm)
susah [kan]
take care only tapi [ah]
nak tolong ajar ke nak tolong exactly
don't try so hard [lah] cukup [lah]
terus aku macam like lepas tu aku fikir-fikir balik aku macam like [eh] kesiannya kalau kita punya malay community really do not want to
[eh] then you pass by so fast [eh]
don't you think so like with covid like !wow! where did all the time go
ya
miss travelling [eh] do you miss travelling
ya but if (mm) you could pick a destination where do you think you will travel to (uh)
(um) like before covid [lah]
new zea~
i've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and i was gila [seh]
ya that was so fun right u_k and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya bila [lah] boleh travel lagi macam camper van was so nice right i mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
bila time nak makan we can makan or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya i think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya i think i enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to u_k
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
i don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus lima puluh
sabar sabar sabar he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but i heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
i was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and i didn't keep up
pergi pub [eh] pergi pub hot chocolate !wow!
[eh] so was the first time that you felt snow or macam how was it [ah] macam sejuk gila ke or like how was it
[ah] k
[oh] okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
k [lah] at least you were sort of prepared for it [lah] to happen
[oh] okay [eh] tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk [ah] i think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right macam hot chocolate or like
i don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate dekat
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it [ah]
like it was like an (um)
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
yup yup correct [ah] rindu [seh] tu
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like i have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then i think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
yang the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then bila wombat tu macam bau kita punya makanan !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come tak ambil gambar [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
tu [ah] kecoh saje
for a moment i was thinking like should i throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like kesian when when i saw them at the door they look like so hungry and i don't know like like i just felt like i needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya i guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those i don't lame places [lah] like i don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] lepas covid pergi mana [eh]
[eh] but k_l okay you can go k_l by driving but if you could fly i mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what i've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know k_l #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like i think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like i don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
dia penat gila [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in k_l [lah] like i need my dose of k_l man
ya i really hope this goes away soon [seh] k tak sabar
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] macam
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
faham faham faham
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so macam like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd i think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
i think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
tapi rasa macam you macam boring gitu
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did i say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] selamat tak seasick [eh]
ya i guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what i miss another thing i miss about traveling
weirdly i miss the supermarkets kelakar [kan] kelakar tak
i don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so lain right
ya the range i remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! i don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas i think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that kita nak save duit [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
i don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
i don't know i rasa apa dah pakai
(err) wait (err) k let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one yang kat farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was dekat bandar like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there lupa [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and macam all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] macam modern
so macam (um) i don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# yang mana satu [seh]
yes yes i remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream macam bunga like that macam the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was u_k but macam tak memorable sangat [ah]
ya but if i had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) macam mana [eh] (err)
#amorino# k #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya i think
tak i'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
pening [seh] i tengok
ya
faham faham
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that i don't think i've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] macam
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends i guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that i really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like i think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
macam there's raclette cheese in u_k remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so macam you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're lapar like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
borong market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
macam it wasn't it wasn't like popular or macam ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) i think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya i remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like i remember there was one macam
apa [eh] flavour ni macam some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
i i remember i remember there was something like (um)
pisang goreng is it pisang goreng
macam they said that it was pisang muda goreng or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
i'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried i can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] mana nak dapat [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like i remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie sebelum tu apa
ya
what's dragon's den tak pernah dengar [seh]
ini macam shark tank ke apa
[oh] k okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] macam like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but i miss (um) ya i miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas macam masak sendiri and all [kan]
ya
i do i do like macam
like you know when we were craving for
apa [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or teh tarik shop and pay an exorbitant amount untuk beli just to macam
satisfy
ya i mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] i do miss i do miss local food when i'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle i think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya tu [ah]
(mm)
entah [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than kat sini
what what what what do you miss
kau singapore pun ada k_f_c [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or apa apa yang sedap sangat [ah]
okay okay
livable boy sama makan sama hidup [eh]
ya
that was i think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
sedap [kan] like apa [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like i no i remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there i think malam [eh]
a pie pie face
tu [ah] tak ingat [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! rindu gila [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes kat u_k
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning i'm i can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya i think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya i just like
i guess [ah] i guess
sedap [kan] like
like like i didn't even know something macam so basic and simple can taste so sedap you know what i mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait apa what was the filling dalam jacket potato dia lupa [ah]
ya macam i don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember kita order lepas tu kita order lagi lepas tu ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
sedap sedap sangat sedap
ya like it's so ya i don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and macam ya things are just
probably like
i don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas apa [lah] yang kita boleh buat kat singapore sekarang
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby duit [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
macam ya you really save more i mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya i mean people really like to go into stores pasal dia orang suka touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
yang unbeatable [lah] and ya you i think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand tapi macam berlambak [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
bukan bicester
we were so noob man
okay can you jog my memory again york mana satu
[oh] and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain [kan] yes yes yes
[eh] it's a once in a lifetime chance [seh] we never know if we are going to pass by that place again [lor]
okay [lah] just want to check it out while we are there betul aqilah
so right what [eh] did we go to any theme parks [ah] kat sana like i can't remember like during our trip
trying to recall [lah]
(err)
i think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
ya only only that one (err) that one place ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia
enchanted garden or something
yang ada the one with the that float what do you call it [ah]
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope apa [eh] what is it called [ah]
no no no it's not luge
ya but basically there was that fun huge float kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu we just slide down the slope ya get it is it
ya that was nice and then that was this (um) [eh] mahal [eh]
berapa [ah] berapa [seh]
fifty [eh]
fifty sing [ah]
[ah] okay [eh] what what else was it that we did over there
i think kita ada masuk macam some maze thingy right
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then (um)
ya i just remember that that thingy [ah] what is it called [ah]
not not rafting [ah] lupa [ah]
[oh] then kita ada masuk tu haunted house haunted house
[kan] ada macam tempat i don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip dekat sana then ada this little like haunted house yang kita masuk
kat atas [ah] like this house of mirrors or something like that
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that i think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to [lah] [eh] but the beaches there were nice [eh]
beaches i remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
(err) no [ah] bondi [ah] bondi kat australia
ya at u_k did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did i remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
(mm) we really miss the nature [ah]
ya i mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya [eh] but malaysia nature not bad [leh] actually
ya
(mm)
cari waterfall [ah]
no [lah] you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
cari waterfall we went on a major like waterfall tracking thing in tasmania [what]
like i think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya it can layer on lagi [eh] kat dalam forests kena layer on [seh]
ya but okay [lah] i mean like okay #langkawi# has nice beaches
okay [lah] it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can [ah] while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually i want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya i have (uh) know two thousand maybe
bila [seh] how come i don't know
ni time uni [eh]
wait what did you go to spain for
[oh]
[eh] but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
but (err) tu [ah] like last time i never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like i am sure you had to save up to do certain thing i mean macam you've got to plan around your budget and everything [kan]
jauh gila [eh]
[eh] sabar belgium is germany right
[oh] okay okay and then apa jadi
and then
so wait the cab fare was mahal gila or what
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare [ah]
#ish# rabak or what
!huh!
so basically you were ca~ trying to catch your train (err) trying to catch your flight you mean
[eh] wait back then you guys had like phones and technology with you right or macam
ke kau orang macam were i don't know just winging it
serious
[oh] my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
(mm)
okay okay and like the timing wise
ada buffer [lah]
this was towards the end of your trip or macam mana
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys [dah] takde duit apa [seh]
okay no cash on hand [lah] you mean
okay
(mm) (mm)
[oh] faham faham k k and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your alasan
(uh huh)
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
[ah] so like he kena switched on dia punya meter [ah]
[oh] i see like how much it's supposed to cost [ah]
okay okay no [lah] because i'm just wondering macam you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
[oh] !wah! were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him [lah]
(mm)
confirm tengah panic [eh] pasal macam dah [lah] lambat then you have to find your gate and everything like [oh] my goodness
start of an adventure [eh]
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
macam macam what what would (err) the like significant moments of the trip
ada raih tak kat sana
[oh] selamat [ah] spain menang
[eh] wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
i see
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like habis
people will probably be like maki-maki semua
ya ya like (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] i see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm [ah] kena jalan balik [kan]
jalan balik lepas tu
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
serious [eh] roti and tuna everyday okay i don't think i can do that
(mm)
no
ya ya ya cause i i think i remember like a hostel dot com or something
(mm)
prata [eh]
prata is everywhere
okay
wait wait wait sabar sabar kau orang dah check harga benda tu ke belum
okay okay habis
alright alright alright so you guys were like itik dengan ayam [ah] berbual
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like #prata# bom [ah] so kirakan dia ada macam
but as in they served it on the side or memang it's it's really like with the sugar and all
[oh] my so he gave you guys one first or macam mana
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the manis one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
i see i see
yup
so what siesta time basically macam nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] i've never i've never en~ encountered this before so
kalau dia orang ada siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is i think fair for the emplo~ employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
masih [ah] madrid
he pernah kerja at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] k k [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true i mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large macam like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your ni the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]
tapi [kan] panas
then wild wild wet last year ada pergi [kan]
lepas tu dia punya right time tak silap tutup
lepas tu
i think
i think late last year lepas tu the right semua sudah buka balik

ya tapi kalau makan chicken kita boleh gain weight cepat i think i says that macam i think masa itu
adik everyday lunch [ah] curry chicken
then the chicken
no but it can make you fatter fat like catalyst for you to grow fatter
i think so because after i chicken i feel fat
kalau chicken face i think (um) rasa cengkung
sebab chicken [kan] tak ada
tapi double chin ada
ya
macam mana tu dah
(mm) (mm) tapi hari itu adik makan #nene# chicken
sedap i don't think
ten dollar something tak itu
itu [kan] itu k gambar dia letak wing and stick [kan] so literally the drumstick and the chicken wing attach together [tau] lepas tu bila i buka kotak it's literally just two wing
and two drumsticks essentially just two chicken [lah] basically is not even
[ah] tapi dalam gambar tu ada empat
drumstick dengan chicken wing attach together
yang z z macam z shape tu
[ah] four of that so macam worth it [lah] so we bought that two meal
habis (um)
ya dan
(mm)
berapa
[oh]

tapi i think the sekarang the chicken yang
macam kalau you crave for chicken i will go for ginger chicken
cause the cause dia orang ada that promotion [tau] apa twelve piece at nine ninety
[oh] dia orang punya six piece is seven dollar something
lepas tu dia orang punya
tw~ twe~ apa twelve piece

lepas tu macam selalu ada that promotion ada nine twelve piece for nine dollar so i was always i will always get that
promotion chicken

(uh) abang abang still insi~
[ah] [ah] acik say she got he will stay for another month and then wait for another
for review of that one month and see how if he gonna stay in or he can keluar
then ayah macam mati-mati nak buat bilik dia dekat living room

ya tapi nak ke bawah dia satu rumah
ya like ayah
(mm) (mm)
tapi nak kasih dia tidur mana
[oh] tapi
but ambin tu tak buang-buang
ya
ya
i perasan dua-dua our parents macam asal boleh [jer] like they want [lah] but then
asal boleh [jer]
ya to maintain it or like to do something about it ya then
but they didn't talk about it
[kan] [ah] dari last two years [eh] last three years [ah] nak pecahkan ambin habis sekarang tak pecahkan !wah! [oh] my god lepas tu bila hari itu asri buat like they denting the house right
(um)
i macam then i feel macam at least buat something [ah] dengan rumah tu really have to go [ah] cause
ambin tak ada ambin macam (err) special feature for our house if like visitors guest datang but then it's also a burden to us
ya macam dulu okay
ya and then ayah pun tak ada kena carpet [pe] might as well just remove everything [lah]
ya i don't know [ah] i think is it they he still thinks about the
effort have to put in like the kayu have to go through the window
nasib baik tinggal tingkat dua [seh]
at least do sophisticated sikit
zen ya tapi tak kisah sangat ambin kalau baring sebab nanti macam you can feel the
#kayuness#
ya
i know (mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya cause it's very efficient [lah] like it can fit all
cause dia orang punya like square feet all memang macam about the around the same [ah] macam kecil-kecil
minimalist
(mm) ya
[ah] that one
why can't they make the sliding door
why must have a big wood door
ini pun buka habis terus jamban like
if you kalau kalau the the window the door will be macam to a bit wider one [kan] dah langgar dah jamban tu
takkan jamban kecil kecil
rectangular jamban
ya
it'll be nice [eh] to have like the shower all the way there and then the the sink there
ya i think they want to go for the modern design kind b_t_o
to be (uh huh) habis tu dia orang punya bracket bracket semua ni kat luar like wiring wiring terjojol macam dulu ke semua kat dalam [kan]
sekarang terkeluar habis macam nanti kalau kita letak cabinet [kan] kita kena custom made
cause ya
ya
actually rumah actually i i macam rumah #juan# rumah mai semua dia orang punya size [kan] size rumah kita orang [tau]
#jurong#
ya and then can't
habis their parents tinggal kat dia du~ dia duduk kat master bedroom [pe] so dia dia orang customise the wardrobe sebab [kan] kat tepi pintu [kan] tepi toilet [kan] ada benda terjojol [kan] [ah]
dia orang customise to accordingly ya the the wood semua
(mm)
ya
i say macam kasih cakap [ah] like (um)
since like kaibah dah move out [kan] why not you buy [ah] almari then i say i want but then i can't just throw the besi-besi
ya
decent [lah]
at least okay at least tak ada langsir over a
open concept wardrobe orang-orang lain macam [eh] if we want to follow orang putih [kan] [kan] macam dia orang suka wardrobe behind the curtain ke apa [kan] ours is like
n~ not working you just go under the curtain only
ya and then so many kotak
ya you know dekat ikea pun sekarang dia pun ada open concept
[ah] [eh] that time i pergi dengan apa pergi ikea dengan as~ asri then he bought
those ke~ macam those metal racks [lah]
habis dengan dia punya drawer semua tu okay [seh] at least
ya then
[oh] ya selalu selalu orang beli lepas tu dapatkan kad kenalan habis jual kat carousell
really
ya
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
i think because time too much orang baru move in right and then kau orang
one nak benda barang but then you guys think think macam (uh) lepas tu bila dah beli macam you usually [dah] furnish most of the things then macam ada sikit-sikit [kan]
and then you chance upon the exact same thing at a cheaper price
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah] ya macam dia orang ada add-ons [kan]
add ons
free stuff like add-ons to the cabinet tak [eh]
[oh] give away
macam benda tu tak perlu [ah] habis dia orang pun tak perlukan duit or or they think
tahu tak apa
don't you think so like with covid like
it was january february march covid
november december
[eh] tak [kan] mesti [lah] miss travelling travelling is one of the best thing that i think
kita nak buat buat [seh]
(um) you mean before covid where i wanted to travelling atau lepas covid nak pergi mana
kalau before covid
(um) i think i wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand [ah] most
(um) mo~ i won't say most value for money tapi dekat
(um) dengan dia lawa
ya tu [ah] i think [ah] that time i pergi in twenty
sixteen tu i pergi (um)
okay [ah] i tak i didn't get to enjoy
fully because it was in a tour
tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah go camper van dekat u_k dengan go
(uh) australia i rasa kalau kita dapat camper van kat new zealand
confirm lawa gila [ah]
tu [ah] tapi ya [lah] macam macam [ah] jadi kalau macam u_k
kita punya camper van berlubang
and then i think what was i i i felt what was most memorable probably was
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay [lah] tasmania best [lah] sebab dapat naik the ocean liner [kan] travel from melbourne to tasmania tapi
(um) sydney dengan sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family yang follow jadi
rasa macam best [ah] sebab you enjoy more with them
there are shared memories together [ah]
[oh] berry van [eh]
ya lepas tu yang kita you makan kat perfect catch
tu pun best [ah] fish and chips by the river power [sia]
i think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to u_k punya fish and chips u_k fish and chips
punya [lah] tak sedap
ya i think i enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to u_k ya
ya i went to new zealand dengan my aunties [lah] and my cousins
(err) well (uh) bila you pergi dengan (um) makcik-makcik [ah] dia orang punya level of (err) worry is more because they feel that they are responsible [lah] for you
so i wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
i tahu [ah] tapi bila you dah dengan makcik-makcik i
(err) dia orang dah [eh] tak mahu [lah] tak mahu [lah]
and ya [lah] so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my f~ back then [lah] my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group i think he was one of the old~ eldest or one of the oldest
dia dah pergi counter dah pergi bayar
alih-alih he was walking on the platform
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya (um) and the group had
i think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
[ah] despite my aunts' protestations
and ya [lah] so he jump [ah] he was the only one who jump smiling
i mean the usual health
declarations apply [lah] [kan] you got there
it must be ticked are you fit ada sakit apa-apa tak you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera benda-benda macam gini semua biasa [lah] kena fill
and once you are done ya [lah] i mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
so they give you a cert [lah] to say that yes i am brave enough to have attempted this and #nah# ambil kau punya cert
ya
actually for new zealand (um)
the year that i went
so kita dalam kat new zealand maybe about one or two
can't remember whether one or two nights but i remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
i was watching the netherlands match [ah] so
my cousin and kita pergi pub
tak tak minum [ah] [eh] [ah] kita pergi pub ordered hot chocolate
kita pergi pub pergi pub (err) hot chocolate tengok bola kat luar
tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan it was raining
(um) and then bila esok pagi
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
sekali tiba-tiba (um) snow fell
lepas tu bila when there was snow (err) we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
(um) the advisory was tak boleh drive on the road dulu
and then (um) apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow yang christchurch (um) felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so macam lama gila [ah] lama tak boleh snow macam gitu
(err)
[eh] did i say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
[ah] was that the first time i felt snow
ya betul i think that was the first time i rasa snow
(err) unique experience [ah] sebab
tak pernah nampak snow [kan] so
ya ya ya we memang kita tahu it was winter so we brought the i mean for me at least i brought jacket and gloves [lah]
(err)
(err) not for snow but i mean just winter kita tak tahu pun there was snow that was gonna happen
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun [lah]
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana
the tour company decided okay nevermind we (err) board the bus and lepas tu drove to another hotel
and (um) ya we basically tidur kat hotel baru
tapi yang tak #bestnya# pasal new zealand
is that
the malls closed at five p_m so you imagine [eh]
(um) winter obvious sejuk lepas tu
winter sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis
semua benda semua kedai dah tutup then so it was quite boring [lah] for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that !wow! at five p_m i'm back at the hotel doing nothing but tengok t_v so it was kind of boring [ah] but fortunately i think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night ke two extra night
ya
k [lah] how chocolate is the best [lah]
or coffee but i think back then i wasn't much of a coffee drinker
so hot chocolate [ah] sedap
tu bukan [lah] tu some pumpkin spice [kan]
[ah] apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
dekat queen victoria market [kan]
[ah] [eh] tu biasa pasal kita terus makan donut dia kat luar
!woo! #shiok# [ah]
!wah! camper van experience lain [eh] i think
kat mana
wilsons promontory
betul
dapat
(mm) ya [lah] i think by then kita orang macam dah penat i mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then (uh) by the time nightfall kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal [lah] having wildlife a wombat benda yang
tak pernah nampak kat singapore tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk camper van
melampau [jer]
i'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food [ah] [kan]
ya tu pasal [lah]
ya the the experience i think i think if you will for example to take a tour
kita tak akan dapat experience benda-benda macam ini sebab tours chances are
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
(err)
ya
ya and i think (um) partly why i really enjoyed the camper van life sebab
sebab your time is yours
(um) you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
(um) you can even decide on the spot that !hey! i want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
lepas tu
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
i think yang even on that trip [lah] yang we kita turun tengok the river delta [kan] ya
tu [ah] tak tak sabar tunggu ni covid habis
lepas covid first destination when they say borders are now open first destination k_l [lah] i'm don't even wanna go j_b
i just gonna shoot straight for k_l
ya tapi kalau you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
jadi kita kasih [lah] orang yang nak fly fly dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi
kita pergi apa yang kita mampu [jer] iaitu k_l k
apa
wanna drive all the way (um)
ya tapi okay so there are two ways to go about doing it biasa orang drive
what they do is they drive
to #penang#
lepas tu tidur rest one night and then esok pagi just sambung pergi border of thailand
ya that one more relax [ah] takde kelam kabut takde macam rushing for time
kalau nak lagi rilek
drive ke k_l tidur semalam
lepas tu [ah] pergi #penang#
nanti [lah] belum buka k_l tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar
#selangor# tengah highest for covid numbers
ya so boleh [ah] lepas tu lepas dah tidur k_l satu malam pergi #penang# satu malam baru pergi thailand tapi tu dah kira dua hari [ah]
kalau nak cepat then tidur #penang# satu hari esok kita pergi thailand ataupun lagi nak cepat terus to thailand [ah] tapi penat [ah] badan sebab it will probably be macam
empat belas jam on the road [ah] so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired [ah]
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border [oh] you see
so to me
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand kalau the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
then the other alternative is fly to
#krabi# or fly to #phuket#
sewa kereta kat sana
lepas tu travel around southern thailand
kat mana
(err) i don't know [ah] tak pernah try tapi jangan bawa kereta [ah] jangan bawa kereta in
you sewa kereta dekat thailand
ya
kalau bawa kereta sendiri then you might as just i mean i don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring [lah] so what i want is kita save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore [ah]
naik kapal terbang nak sangat [kan] kapal terbang [ah] naik [ah] kapal terbang
ya
true but then i felt that okay [lah] i think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
i think that was just the experience [lah] of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship [lah] [kan]
okay [lah] memang best [lah] tak cakap tak best tapi le~
tak [lah] bruny boring [lah] kirakan macam boat dia kecil apa
[oh] tu juga
bukan bunker [lah] cabin [lah]
cabin cabin
ya
okay [lah] tapi malam we kita tak travel malam so you were travelling at
it wasn't that bad
no [lah] i guess when it got
i mean bila kita baru-baru masuk when the boat started to sail
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
by the time kita dah tertidur boat dia probably
took a slightly more i mean the seas were ruffled [lah] [kan] when i think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat [lah]
then bila pagi dah bangun
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm [lah]
[ah]
[oh] ya
tak
ya i think supermarkets overseas [ah]
lain okay [lah] i mean dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi i think because of the space that they have
(um) there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
and harga tak so mahal [lah]
because they are the producers [ah] that's why
[ah] meat so fresh
ya because they are fresh produced [ah] benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap
lagipun bila kita kat sana
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
memang [lah]
tapi tu [ah] since
[oh] dapat dia orang yang burger ni macam best [ah]
true
even the ice cream is different
okay sabar which one do you prefer you lagi suka van diemen's punya ice cream ke you lagi suka gelato #messina#
van diemen's was ya betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah farm
macam-macam [ah] gelato #messina# ada macam-macam flavour
tapi yang #amorino# punya
#amorino# punya i think kita makan
kejap i tak ingat whether that one were u_k trip ke
[ah] tak salah tu u_k [ah]
okay
ya i like #messina# better sebab i rasa
ya tu yang best dia [ah]
because you have a variety to choose from [ah]
because kalau you you compare van diemen's van diemen's punya flavours are
much more predictable in that sense
it's not anything out of the ordinary [lah] macam k you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
[kan] atau
k [lah] apple cranberry pun boleh katakan
quite common
ada apa yang dekat tu dekat tom's palette
dia tak ada ke
okay tom's palette ke gelato #messina#
ya ke
but then tom's palette sedap [seh]
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
(mm) ya
and the best donuts in the world
[eh] do you notice
it could be ya
tapi it could also be the fact that
benda tu kita tak pernah try [ah] contoh [eh] contoh
when we went to borong market alright k break your head right
we ordered the the bombolinis [lah] the donuts right
i think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
(um)
i i wouldn't say that sebab dulu dunkin donut pernah ada with their bavarian cream
tapi the the ones that dunkin donut jual tak sesedap [ah]
and
ya okay so kalau you imagine [ah] break your head you punya donut the dough is soft
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique (um) overflowing
inti dia penuh [kan]
so they were oozing out and okay [lah] i guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world [lah]
which i am inclined to agree sebab about i haven't tasted
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya [oh] and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
tak pada i macam lebih pada okay like
i felt that it was a cross between lemak cili padi dengan (uh) apa thai green curry
ada [lah] iras-iras dia
plantains [eh]
did they grill that one grill [kan]
i think it was grilled and then they put (um) brown sugar or something on top right
ya if i'm not mistaken it was that [ah]
ya that one
[eh] there was something that i thought about (um) [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] (um) london (um)
the devil brownies [ah]
ya that was a random find [ah] no we went to that
that weekend market
(um) i wouldn't say it's a random find [lah] because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
[ah] correct
beutl betul betul
dah dah lepas tu i found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den [ah] dragon's den dragon's den is this (uh) british show
where aspiring business owners visit this there (err) these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons [ah] so these dragons are
investors yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak shark tank [ah] macam shark tank [ah]
so dragon's den dengan shark tank lebih kurang [ah] sama [ah]
(um) so ya she pitch her brownies to them [ah]
i i not i can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not [ah] but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted kirakan you bagus [ah]
i think i saw that as part of her marketing collateral
(err) she used that as part of her advertisement [lah]
[ah] but i really good are really really good
ya okay think about it [eh] kalau you kata you miss the food overseas
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
no [lah] just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you cakap [oh] i miss the food overseas
then i realize that okay [lah] when travel kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example macam
macam makan kat noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
[ah] noodle oodle (um) that's just
soup [ah]
right like like mi dengan
ya so if you were to think about it again macam is it really that fantastic
[ah] tu [ah] faham tak
so
probably
okay but i know definitely for certain
i miss
the
i miss the p_f_c paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
ya it's the spices sebab dia orang okay imagine nandos
k imagine nandos [ah] so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
[ah] the price the price is way cheaper than nandos [ah]
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
so nandos [kan] macam [oh] nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam up sikit
[kan] ada sudu garfu
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab [ah]
and that's nice i miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
[ah] yes
[eh] the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name [ah] a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice [ah]
ya what else [ah]
what else was nice that we have
[oh] buffet that that buffet was power
[eh] that was a nice chance upon [ah]
that was not in our initial plan [lah] because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
(um) ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay [lah] it's a saving grace [lah]
it's a saving grace because i think
(um) those ya that jacket potato was nice
that thick milkshake sedap gila
ya it was milkshake and skittles [ah]
filling in the jacket potato
ya i think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat i mean i didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian [lah] at least [oh] that was some nice jacket potato
tak boleh replicate [ah] [eh] so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop kita masuk
k [ah] penat saje nak duduk
and baam sedap gila apa tempat ni
ya
that's true
betul juga okay [lah] maybe i think [oh] what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the ni [lah] factory outlets
[kan]
ya cheaper [lah] ya but i don't understand how people could
spend thousands (err) on prada
understand [ah] it's still thousands [eh]
tapi tu bicester village elite [ah] up [ah]
bicester ke #bister#
bukan bicester [eh]
b i c e s t e r bicester
ya but i think the york punya outlets (err) better [ah]
york yang kita punya kita punya camper van (um) battery mati
yes
tak yang job dia
[ah] kita dah
somewhere near the south
so kita travel all the way up untuk pergi york
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
that's true [lah] tapi macam travel untuk two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that macam (mm)
kau orang biar betul
okay [lah]
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major [lah] the u_k and the two australia
[ah] tak ada theme park [ah]
[ah]
float apa
[oh]
(err)
bukan luga [kan]
slide down the slope ya
best [ah]
tapi tu mahal [ah] i rasa
mahal [lah] i think
tak salah adults
fifty
fifty !alah! fifty australian fifty sing ni lebih kurang sama [ah]
maze kat sana [ah]
(mm)
haunted house apa
[oh]
[eh] itu mengarut [seh]
[eh] tu mengarut gila buang buang masa saya pergi tu
ya [lah] tak menyeramkan langsung
ya
the beaches (err) jog my memory again where did we go
sabar ni u_k trip ke (err)
[oh] sydney ya bondi
i think we did
portsmouth
ya i agree
malaysia nature
okay [lah] i mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
is partly because of the weather [kan] they humid tapi dia panas [ah]
so walaupun masuk hutan (err) i mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
tapi bila kat dalam panas juga [ah] sebab takde angin [ah]
compared to bila kita travel dekat u_k you ingat tak yang kita pergi tasmania
(um)
cari waterfall
yang kita cari waterfall tu u_k [kan]
[oh] [oh] ya ya ya
[oh] ya k [ah] at least bila kat dalam sana
dia sejuk sikit [oh]
cuaca dia orang memang sejuk so kita tak rasa sangat [ah]
[ah]
kalau nak pergi taman negara berpuluh lawa [ah] saya confirm
but it's hot [ah]
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
i've been to spain
ya i have (err)
two thousand let me recall [ah] when did i go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven i think or two thousand eight
i met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
(um) we went to travel around the areas [lah] so we went to spain (um)
specifically we went to madrid [lah]
(err) at that time two thousand eight tak salah tengah euro euro two thousand eight ya tu [ah] euro two thousand eight [lah]
so (err) i clearly remember there was one night
i think it was spain versus italy
(mm) ya
ya kalau kalau travel as a student
(um) i think you really have to plan
how much you are going to spend so macam for us while kita pergi sana we either just took the
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
atau kita ambil (um) kita ambil apa the the budget flight [ah]
so i remember there was one (um)
so we were from netherlands kita travel to belgium via bus
so when we reach belgium
(um) we thought that the bus station (uh) at that belgium to the airport was quite near [lah]
only for us to realise that actually
kita dah terlepas the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
jauh i think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium [lah] mana belgium is germany
so kita terlepas so konon-konon nak naik taxi [ah] the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks [ah] ya
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely [ah]
i think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
(um)
tak juga [ah] we were winging it [lah]
ya
[ah] ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab lepas tu
kita cakap dengan pakcik ni [ah] driver we need to get to this airport so dia kata that sixty kilometres away
ya so timing we still had i mean like
we still had about at an hour [lah] but sixty kilometres away ya [kan] so it's still quite a distance
at least macam
forty five minutes to get there [ah]
so you macam dah !alamak! macam mana [eh] but the worst part is that we will we had no money [ah] there was i think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
this was the start [lah] almost the start i think ya
no bukan takde duit [lah] but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the mo~ if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang [lah] [kan]
habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita hundred and this one [ah] more than hundred twenty euro habis kita dah duit dah sikit then kita macam !alamak! macam mana [eh]
so we negotiated [lah] we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay i tell you what
nevermind [ah] he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind (err) i charge you
i forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros [lah] basically
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but i will switch on my meter and nanti i will show you all
dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya trip ni lagi mahal [lah]
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation [kan]
ya [lah] i i think sama [ah] macam benda ini juga so dia on
dia on dia punya meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter dah naik two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
and then by the time we reach there he
(uh) maybe three quarters [ah]
lepas tu he said
ya and then dia kata okay you look [ah] at the meter
sekarang dah hundred three hundred and twenty euro aku off k aku off
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got [lah] and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed [lah] maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey [ah]
lepak hidup
ya starting tu dah adventure [ah]
run into i
i think the high~ i won't say highlight [lah] but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
no but i think kalau spain kalah confirm raih [ah]
[ah] but because spain won (err) i think o~ i think through penalties [eh] spain menang italy and then [ah] because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the (um) there was a big screen dia orang (err) live telecast
so kita ramai-ramai [ah] kat sana sama tengok live telecast [lah]
ya and (uh) i mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you [lah]
sebab
ya and then i think when when
where we watch i think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
i think it was something similar to that at madrid [lah] [ah] but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
(err) i think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think [ah]
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
the trains tutup [sia]
[ah] so [dah] happy happy
jalan [ah]
[ah] jalan [ah] so tak ni [lah] ni dah madrid [ah] ni dah madrid so madrid dah macam
lepas portugal so kita pergi
so it was netherlands lepas tu ambil bus pergi belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal pergi (um) flight to madrid
ya that was that was an
all the way makan ni [ah] roti dengan tuna [ah]
ya
tak [lah] everyday but basically living frugally [ah]
[oh] i remember there was one there was one instance i think it was
i think this was in madrid
kita
(um) my friend and i [lah] kita dah dah dah lapar [ah]
so kita turun kat kedai muslim ni kita kebetulan found a muslim shop which was nearby
no
you go through your hostel dot com ke apa [ah]
ya
so (um) jumpa [ah] kedai kedai muslim ni [ah] semua muslim brother dah masuk kedai dia apparently kita ternampak ada #prata# [ah]
#prata# [ah] so macam #prata# [ah]
so i don't know whether it was [ah] an instant #prata# or #prata# that they made [ah] tapi nampak macam #prata# [ah]
so my friend and i [eh] baik [ah] this harapan #prata# puas hati [lah] [kan]
tu kita dah tengah lapar so kita minta dia enam [ah] enam [eh] kau tiga aku tiga [lah] enam
itu tak perasan [lah] sebab kita dah tengah lapar [ah] and harga dia harga tak mahal sangat [lah]
true dah tengah lapar [ah] so kita dah okay [ah] enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar and he couldn't speak english
so
[ah] macam gitu [ah] so dia [ah] sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu
then macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar
no
apparently dia orang makan order #prata# dengan macam sirap ke gula [ah]
sekali manis nak mampus
tak i think they tuang the sugar on top [ah]
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each [ah]
so kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik
so we were thinking of as i think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it [ah]
tu pasal [lah] dia ni dia ni kira macam muslim brother boleh pakai punya [ah]
ya
power [ah]
ya that's why
ya
ya
and then (uh) you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita keluar (um) maybe like after one or after the two
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ya like they i think the shops mostly will close like one to four ke two to five [ah]
[ah] like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
so it's okay [lah] as in dia orang tutup sekejap for them to rest lepas tu dia orang buka sampai maybe sepuluh sebelas
ya
[ah] yup
true
[oh] (err) in madrid juga i where where when we were walking [ah] masih masih masih
sekali tiba-tiba there was this bangladeshi guy
who came up to us
say #assamualaikum# and started to (err) to talk to us in malay
kita dah kat madrid [eh] dia orang bual bual melayu [eh] muka bangladesh berbual melayu lepak
so we talk to him when quite further in he said [oh] actually yes he's bangladeshi
ada pernah kerja kat malaysia
for
working [ah] so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then i guess he
came back to bangladesh and then (um) you know went back went to spain to work [lah]
i mean if the opportunity presents itself nak [lah] [kan]
kalau ada kerja yang bagus okay [ah]
ya working overseas is something
okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
it is something that i want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest i had for staying was
i had six months [ah] of exchange in canada
that was a clo~ i wouldn't say there's even that even came close [ah] but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which i was in made me feel welcome [ah] to the point that i felt that !hey!
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both [ah]
okay so (um) when when i was at the university at mcgill in montreal
(um) the m_s_a or the muslim students association they were quite
(um) vibrant and there are very active [lah]
so (um) i decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them [lah]
because when i were went there also (um)
it coincided with the fasting month
[ah] lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana i mean
kalau kita kat singapore kalau bulan puasa [kan] macam
tarawih lepas tu
ya fasting oversea i think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short [ah]
so ya
i nak minum hot chocolate dulu
!wow!
nak cakap apa
[oh] interesting
okay so kita memang dah tak
makan
meat products as much as we did before i mean dua ribu dua belas [eh] dua ribu dua puluh dah kind of okay
so how how far lang nak go in to into veganism
i rasa
(um)
going into veganism would be fine by me but
i will not go as far as being a vegan because i don't think i can
be a
full time vegan
i think that will be quite hard
tapi in a way i think we're almost
there [lah] almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
i rasa
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
tapi
tapi i rasa i macam ada
selfishness sebab i don't
feel the same thing bila macam guna ikan bilis just because they are smaller than a chicken or lembu
[ah] i rasa selfish sebab they should be equal
okay
ya ya ya faham muk~ #mukbang#
(mm)
[a'ah] in a way [lah] sebab
i mean orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing is our companion pet banyak orang guna sebagai [ah] ada anjing as pet
but when it comes to chicken or duck
kita pun pernah bela itik
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
manja [lah] binatang tu can be so is that the same comparison
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
tapi kita start dengan (err) hunting and gathering food from [ah] natural resource macam
(mm)
kalau orang dulu-dulu dia tak berkebun pun
berkebun tu selepas
dia pergi memburu semua [kan] then baru come this era bila orang start berkebun and jumpa teknik berkebun
(mmhmm)
(mm)
!wah! i tak ingat
jadi kalau you nak go into veganism you akan
be a vegan [lah] bukan vegetarian
telur i cannot leave that i mean i
i boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu but i feel like i need my protein daripada telur
(um)
[ah] mac d that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
tapi the challenge
is
macam kita dekat sini
[ah] you i tak sure tapi i
if i were to be a vegan
the challenge will come bila balik rumah mama
and mama
masak apa yang dia masak [lah] i don't think i have the strength to tolak
because it's not something yang i boleh dapat every day
i i can do that kalau pergi kedai kawan
tapi kalau balik rumah family dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan
but i myself don't have the strength to tolak apa yang dah ada tu [ah]
[ah] and sebab i tahu
dia masak sedap gila
so susah [ah]
you macam mana
(mm)
(mm)
apa yang spark your idea untuk
jadi
vegan
is is there a certain
(err) timeline ke
yang membuat you sampai ke part yang mana you nak jadi vegan ni ada cerita dia ke
(mm)
macam cringe cringey
(mm)
i rasa
i
don't have anything
yang betul-betul macam the moment yang spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
because of all the free time
(um)
and because of a lot of things [eh] yang you bagi [tau] i [lah] and dia macam i was brainwashed by your brainwashing
but actually (um)
in southeast asia
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan [kan] sebab we have abundant soy sauce we have that (err) we have abundant soy derived products macam tempeh tauhu
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) sedap [jer]
[oh] my god
ya [lah] sebab kita crave
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
born born to be slaughtered [lah] basically
(mm)
spread penyakit ke macam nyamuk you you never know which one yang gigit you yang bawa aedes
extreme [lah] i mean i i think dua hari lepas #kot# i kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi
(mm)
selain delving into veganism apa you punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu
kalau ada [lah]
i think ada #kot#
and then
[oh] okay
i rasa i rasa i punya azam tahun ni i nak
start drawing again
sebab i dah lama sangat tinggalkan drawing and sekarang i rasa janggal nak buat the kind of drawing yang i pernah buat dulu
janggal gila sampai sampai macam halfway tu dah menyampah [tau]
tapi tapi i i [tau] [lah] kalau kalau practise every day
dia makin lama makin okay so that's one of my
(err) two thousand twenty one resolution
lepas tu i nak
(err) come back to
belajar italian
and probably greek as well sebab tu pun dah tinggal quite lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu
(um) apa lagi [eh]
i
i wish i can say yang i nak seriously
belajar music but
but
but quit susah [lah] sebab i i don't have the same passion untuk tahu what's behind the system
[ah] dia not not as fulfilling but
by by time
(mm)
atau maybe about
(um)
nak cakap lack of audience pun tak juga [ah]
even dekat rumah pun
dia macam not as motivated [lah] untuk untuk pegang musical instruments
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
just in case tapi kalau dah beli then tak main
bodoh juga
apa [ah] my other resolution
i wish that i can
fully depend on working from home [lah]
sebab [ah] before this kita depend on performance and
[ah] fully on music then
if we have side jobs yang
work from home
then tu macam bonus but by by the end of last year dia dah turn to the other way round
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
memang [ah] memang more than performances so i hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way [lah] because i tak selesa pun untuk keluar and perform and jumpa orang in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still nak ada event takut juga [ah]
(mm)
kalau
kalau you punya new year resolution apa yang dah boleh tiru dah i punya
(um)
greek
i i
berasa macam i nak belajar japanese sebab i tengok food wars tu tapi
better untuk focus dekat
one or two language first [lah] before ventured out
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god ya
(mm)
tu [lah]
tapi so far italian is not that hard i rasa i boleh catch up balik
(mm)
[ah] and i suka sebab macam once you belajar italian you can kind of faham french as well dia ada kaitan [ah] dia dia ada kaitan
quite beneficial untuk learn that one language
sebab dia boleh branch out to bahasa-bahasa lain selain language to apa lagi you punya ni you punya azam
so
okay ap~ what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
(mm) (mm)
dia macam
(uh) i remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore cakap the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself dia dah ada everything yang dia nak
but speaking of two thousand twenty i
i rasa it's not
a total shit show [lah]
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
and then ending pun
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya [lah] cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
(mm)
[oh] but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but i still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait [lah]
(um)
what else [ah]
you you you you decide the topic pula
if you go
the the
apa yang akan jadi in two thousand twenty one [ah]
[ah] two thousand twenty one
i rasa akan ada
a burst of
creative contents
for sure sebab in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
[ah] dia punya
macam musicians tak dapat buat shows
[ah] ya artist tak boleh buat exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one i think a lot of creatives will start macam
this this cannot
(um) go on for too long i have i have to do something to
to make everything better for myself [lah] sebenarnya especially if that's their only creative outlet
dia redundant it's very redundant
(mm)
but what about live shows i think (um) live shows pun dah start ada search juga because (um) g_l_c sebanyak yang start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations memang
jaga
social distancing q_r code scanning and everything so itu pun i rasa in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
k when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
(mm)
ya i don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
i i don't fear the five g conspiracy
(mm) (mm)
natural selections
(mm) (mm)
i baca dekat twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
dia orang cakap your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
macam flu or fever side effect yang teruk-teruk
so i think i pun tak walaupun i takut jarum but i don't think i akan stray from i mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
(mm)
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
(mm)
ya [lah] faham
i mean even sekarang masa pandemic pun i dah tak ingat what happened in june in may
duolingo
(mm)
i think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic ni akan berlangsung lama and they cannot depend on skill yang dia orang dah ada so they have to broaden their horizon
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
okay can you explain pasal stoicism sebab i try baca tapi i macam
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
excited
i think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because i am emotionally invested in everything
so
(mm)
i mean i appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy i don't think i can because i'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
apa you punya philosophy philosophical standpoint
[ah]
(mm)
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
(mm)
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature [lah]
(mm)
semua ni sebab
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you memang dah
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
i mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because i think
benda ni macam
very personal because
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding tak sama so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so you decide
the next
the next thing
i ran out of idea already
(mm) (mm)
i don't have any other interest
and the new age #plato#
(mm)
okay
once the border buka
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called [ah] the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
(mm)
the difference
i want to go to greece again
(mm)
[oh] in addition to that scandinavian countries
scandinavian countries dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama european
bukan yang yang yang tak payah stamp passport tu [ah] dia tak termasuk dalam schengen countries [eh] [oh] termasuk [oh] then why
[oh] ya ya
sweden
[oh] yes denmark
k [lah] hopefully next time
tapi i memang curious on how they can manage to provide
pre-university cause i long for that i yearn for that
what about southeast asia or asia [lah] in general ada tak yang you nak pergi
ke kita memang western centric
euro centric okay my apologies
(mm)
(mm)
i think sebab i think the the the reason is because
(um) dia orang preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit macam dekat sini most of them are
in ruins
(mm)
[ah] you you cannot see with your own eyes
tapi asia i
nak pergi tak i nak pergi indonesia but but but the parts yang kita tak pergi before [ah]
i think tu pun interesting and for some reason
i nak pergi thailand sangat sangat sebab i rasa macam i nak dia punya street food
(mm)
tu [jer] #kot# as for now
[ah] india but maybe bila umur dah lima puluh nanti [lah] #boulogne# and [lah]
(mm) selain tu
[eh] tapi yang tesla buat
the space flight yang you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
running [eh]
[kan] they dia buat dia buat this (err) flight flight system baru yang mana you can travel across the world in less than three hours ke two hours [a'ah]
so i don't know if that is still running sebab dia nak
buat
benda tu affordable for everyone
i think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years ke
i mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours !wow!
balik hari [jer] pun boleh
!wah! long silence very long silence
(uh huh) death to two thousand twenty
i suka that documentary
u_s centric tapi understandable [lah] sebab creator dia pun from u_s
but i think it's a good mockumentary [lah] to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one [eh] two thousand twenty
(mm)
!wah! i punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam what do you want
and
you dah cakap you stoic so i dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu
(mm)
okay [lah] if if you could
be your younger self
apa yang you nak change
(mm)
you know what do you have against schools [ah]
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm) i faham
(mm)
tapi tu [lah] i think i learn more
kat rumah
[ah] dekat dekat internet for you i don't have internet at home
actually kat okay i mean form five pun i don't have
and i tak pakai
hujung form five i pakai iphone but before that i pakai
ada laptop but i don't have internet so what's the use [ah] but i
i lebih i i understand bila ayah yang ajar
but for you most of that internet [lah] [kan]
kena ambil to toefl [lah] lagi sekali
i think that will help a lot
tapi tu [lah] dia punya price point expensive
and i don't know what to do with the toefl certificate afterwards so dia expire after like two years and then i don't know what to do within that two years
until dia expire macam the last time i ambil rugi [jer]
[ah]
then sia-sia even if you dapat offer travel while once you nak masuk dia akan minta balik your toefl punya sijil then you have to take again
(mmhmm)
two thousand twenty one ni
kira start of the decade [kan]
bukan yang two thousand twenty [kan] last year was the ending
this [one] is the beginning okay
[a'ah] kita tunggu the fireworks
kita tunggu the fireworks but nothing happen
(mm) very anti climactic
okay [lah] i like new beginnings (um)
i pun takde expectation
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
tinggal lapan minit
that that [one] quite fast tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah
[oh]
boleh
(mm)
i harap
entah [lah] i don't have any
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
poll sekarang
like dia macam
tak dia from semua benda sebab
in a way
i tak rasa
macam you tadi cakap [lah] [ah]
afterlife punya benda kita tak tahu and it's not within our control [kan] dan ni pun sama it's not within my control so whatever happens happens [lah]
because i don't have the power to to do anything about it
(um)
and
apa pun yang dia orang buat i think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
you have yourself and people around you
tu [jer]
entah [lah]
tapi i i'm quite positive about
this year
macam
tak hopeless sangat
it's been awhile since i rasa hopeless dengan
the whole tahun
so you
institution
religion
agama kaum
[oh] kaum is a very sensitive issue
(mmhmm)
and i tak suka tengok facebook comment
dia almost macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu you don't have any feelings at all
[ah] bangsa malas membaca
lepas tu tajuk everything click bait
[ah] i wish that kena change
yang tu kena change
[ah]
(mm)
but journalism yang spark head
orang yang malas membaca tu ya malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun they have to click in order to know the
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
(mm)
ni nurse yang nurse yang yang ni infected tu dekat u_s yang vaksin (mm) (mm)
(mm)
and then kismis dan
that's my vaccine !wah!
(mm) tapi yang news pasal nurse tu very misleading sebab even if you take your first vaccine untuk dia sampai ke fifty percent immunity tu dia ambil dua minggu
dia kena covid within i think hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu it's not even two full weeks yet and even kalau dah two full weeks pun not a full total immunity
second shot baru ni tapi
orang malas membaca
dia buat orang takut untuk buat benda yang betul
and lagi pun journalisms sekarang mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then jadi satu bentuk berita [ah] yang penting ada content ya monetisation and yang penting duit jalan k
tapi content memang tak best langsung especially because the audience dalam twitter and dalam facebook is two totally different kind of audience
(mm)
[oh] dah ni
lagi satu minit there's only one minute left
[ah] nanti [kan] bila you dah settle you click right [ah] tick [ah]
(mm)
okay [lah] macam tak rasa sangat can speak one hour macam tak
[ah] [ah] i wish i wish we can talk about something new [lah] (mm)
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
k [lah] thank you
okay
yes happy new year
ya [lah] dua ribu dua puluh we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
[kan] tu [lah] masalahnya
semua resolution pun dah tak tercapai semuanya
ya true
(err) of course first of all i have to make sure that i redo back everything yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye [lah] cakap pasal redo back everything sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada i would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight [lah] memang nak nak tu~ turunkan berat badan [lah] harap harapnya macam tu tahun target [eh]
this year target nya lebih kurang dalam maybe fifteen k_g ya
(uh huh)
serious [ah] sihat ke kalau macam tu
(uh huh)
yes
[oh] i cannot do the skipping sebab dengan spine issue [lah] so macam kalau skipping nanti patah pula tulang belakang so i don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
tu [lah]
ya achievable so i would say that kalau fifteen maksudnya dalam sebulan kena target at least two k_g [lah]
tapi tapi sebenarnya one k_g half pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu [lah] lebih kurang
ya so that's another thing [lah] pasal vegetarian [kan] macam ya before this sebab baru adapt to vegetarian so banyak makan processed food [lah]
actually adapt tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi i would say i ate a lot of
like man man-made meat macam tu [kan] sebenarnya tak boleh so i was thinking of this year kalau boleh nak jadi vegetarian and grow my own food like tanam sayur ataupun tanam
tanam sayur [lah] basically kita orang dah tanam benda lain [kan] macam tu [lah] any~ anyway
ya how about you how about you what is what is your resolution untuk tahun ni
(uh huh) (uh huh)
ya the real world comes
okay
(uh huh)
okay alright
okay
for business apa [lah] apa apa the idea business yang dah ada buat masa ni
(uh huh) okay
apa dia lagi sekali
i see surprise delivery menarik
i see so the surprise part [lah] yang betul-betul make meaningful
(mm)
i see i see
okay
(uh huh)
i see so macam mana sebelum delivery ni dia akan ada macam set set dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh customise ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu
[oh]
okay faham
[a'ah]
so basically ni macam (err) profession~ macam bukan professional dia macam lebih kurang special customisation [lah]
okay tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam (uh) food based ke ataupun
[oh] interesting very interesting i see i see so berap~ berapa lama dah start
[oh] okay [lah] okay maksudnya dah ada customer [ah]
[oh] !wow! ya ya ya ya sebab ya [lah] sekarang ni orang pun suka [eh] macam boleh pergi surprise delivery lepas tu boleh hantar [eh] boleh share dekat insta [kan] macam tu [lah]
betul
i see
(mmhmm)
i see so it's not just it's not just [oh] i forgot the date and i want to send it over i just send something it's not like that [lah]
i see so
i see interesting it's interesting so apa [lah] nama the surprise delivery service ni apa nama dia
[oh] !wow! okay kotak riang so kotak riang basically like macam gift (uh) box of happiness [lah] box of happiness
okay okay okay betul betul new year resolution [lah]
healthy food what what is the what is the meaning of the healthy food what kind of food
so mak~ dia sendiri [oh] okay alright alright like like less carbs [lah] less carbs
konjac #mee# [oh] the one without calorie is it okay okay
(err) i've read about it once ya i know
maybe i should be your customer then
how okay you know talking about healthy food usually healthy food used to be very plain and dry and [oh] my god taste like medicine
so what do you have for now ada tak benda-benda yang ya it's still give you some happiness in the world tapi healthy [lah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow!
i see tapi sugar free how is that achievable even
ya ya ya but but but that's interesting because
why so many people didn't manage to do the resolution like losing weight or anything like like in my own case because all the healthy food [oh] my god
it's terrible
menarik menarik so (err) healthy diet healthy food
basically ya [lah] macam kita pun tengok [kan] dengan covid punya issue i think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the covid issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat [kan] [ah] so ya penting [lah] very very important [lah] untuk
in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and i will be your first customer
tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah when you get rich i will be the first person yang you have to belanja [lah] [kan] aduhai
[oh] resolution lain apart from losing weight i would say that okay [lah] dia macam satu we have to look at the whole system [lah] [kan] i started with trying to eat
healthily [kan] i want to (err) i want to lose weight so i have to live live (err) i have to eat healthily so i want to grow my own food the idea is not just kita nak kurangkan berat badan is also because i want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet [kan] most of the thing yang you beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak [tau]
especially sayur [lah] macam tu [kan] jadi macam i was thinking of and kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam supermarket
[kan] so we didn't know pun macam kita opt untuk healthily tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat so i was thinking of like okay with after i grow my own food i will save more money and i want to make sure that i can pay off all the debt because somehow ya [lah] (mm) kita tahu economically macam mana
macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar with the with the vaccine of covid nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so i was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal i was thinking of i want to save more money (err) ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt [lah]
[a'ah]
how is that
like for youtube channel on planting food i see
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
[oh] interesting
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya sekarang ni ramai juga [kan] orang monetise daripada youtube [kan] and then ya betul betul and because we provide the content youtube is open platform anyway
betul betul okay ya interesting i should think about it should think about it ya macam
orang kata tanam [jer] [lah] tapi sebenarnya ca~ nak tanam pun ada cara [kan] ya ya ya
ya interesting (hmm) okay boleh boleh masuk dalam resolutions seterusnya okay
ya [kan] so i'll be like
(err) healthy and rich
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so cakap pasal healthy and rich [kan] kalau [lah] you nak sum up [lah] the the i the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word [lah] apa you punya apa one word yang will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
!wow! [oh] okay alright alright maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni the the timeline the the stories not good yang you need the plot twist
okay
okay
untuk diri sendiri [eh]
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person macam it ya maybe with better networking kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh bring it forward [kan] ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one i would say that i would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one i want is kind
because i i want to be kinder to myself [lah] i would say that two thousand twenty dengan covid dan sebagainya it has been very harsh and i blame myself i critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
tak jadi apa-apa pun so i was thinking okay i want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the wo~ kind to the world [lah] like environmentally more friendly [lah]
so that's the idea
(mmhmm)
okay apa lagi takkan tu [jer] apa lagi share [lah] resolution
okay alright
that's right
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm) ya ya
you you become a boring person [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) what what kind of me time like pergi bowling macam tu
i get cho~ give me some example on that
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill yang you dah ada and then you want to enhance ataupun like new skill
because you don't have the money at that time is it
okay what is that i'm i'm so interested to know what is that
[oh] okay musical you have the artistic side [lah] deep inside okay
alright alright
ya i still remember like your one of your ambition is like jadi ya jadi pemain guitar [oh] my god
so funny i didn't know you keep it until this this year
i see but not guitar anymore [lah]
i see i see that's interesting that's interesting so (err) you you didn't have any basic yet for piano is it
[oh] alright
(uh huh)
i see but you were in primary is it
[ah] okay ya masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama i didn't really update
i see interesting interesting
ya piano is very elegant anyway
then
but but somehow piano i~ like ini dua benda yang berbeza [tau] mostly guitar punya song it's like metal you know very hard [one] piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it juga makin besar makin matang you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
(mmhmm)
okay
i see so with before this kak long pernah juga ada idea macam nak enroll class [tau] and of course i want to also look into yang macam elegant elegant ni [lah] [kan] cuma kenapa bukan piano sebab piano requires some set up [lah] then tak dapat berlatih kat rumah [kan] macam tu so i was thinking of beli ukulele ke violin something like that [lah] so macam at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you [kan] kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak wind punya apa ni punya instruments you need a whole band baru dia akan menjadi or you main trumpet sorang-sorang macam ni [lah] dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan spo~ spongebob i don't remember the name squidward tu clarinet that's clarinet so it will
[ah] squidward [kan] so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it [lah] macam tu
interesting okay [lah] basically [kan] macam kita boleh tengok [kan] sometime our education system
focus on more maths science tapi [kan] art art is very important human very connected to sap~ any beautiful things be it the beautiful things tu dalam bentuk visual ataupun audio [lah] macam music [kan] because somehow that makes us
(err) be more empathy [kan] dan buat kita more human [lah] and in your own case [kan] macam memang buat hard science buat maths [kan] (err)
at the end you will turn to robot [lah] if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you macam tu [kan] okay so piano so that's the skill yang basically dream [lah] belum belum start [ah] do you have any skill yang just you want to enhance [lah] yang you dah ada sat~ dah ada base base[lah]
how about that
ataupun something [lah] selain daripada skill (err) musical skill ada skill lain tak
[oh] mandarin why why mandarin
but mandarin is kinda hard though because tak silap mandarin [kan] dia ada macam empat
empat macam apa [eh] apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi something you know
(mmhmm)
ya that's the thing sebab basically ya bila kita boleh connect to to a person dengan dia punya mother tongue it will be lebih ni [lah] [kan]
ya ya lagipun kita pun multi racial i think it's best untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga [kan] betul betul interesting interesting
(mmhmm)
offered
(uh huh)
so what what is your what's your choice [oh] japanese
so okay buat masa sekarang how many language you know like even it's amateur pun tak faham how many i will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea daripada mana because you watch [oh] my god alright alright
really i only know like i see so
[oh] interesting so basically now you already have like five language already
five language already
anyway (err)
ya i think that that is enough that that is great enough [lah] i would say ya ya ya
so many language cakap pasal korea i watch a very very good good drama i'm not sure you have watched it or not tapi dia berkaitan dengan business [lah] since you pun nak buat business [kan]
you know the start up [oh] okay alright alright alright
so (err) who's your favourite character in that movie anyway
your favourite [lah] [oh] my god i think everyone is on his side anyway so
ya cerita tu menarik [tau] because dia menunjukkan macam mana yes
so orang selalu tengok [kan] orang business ni at at the end of the success [tau] like the only the tip of the iceberg [lah] when ya and then macam kita pun jealous [lah] bila dia lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
i would say that i i have been in business for quite some time and it has been hell but somehow i didn't regret any of it [lah] because everyday i woke up i know that that's something i want to do
even though macam belum kaya lagi but there ev~ every single day i woke up
i look forward to it and
ya that is something i really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years [lah]
even though i would say that sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi it's interesting and i would say that the in the in the drama itself benda yang paling belajar is you need a good mentor
macam bila you bila you dah kaya ramai [jer] orang yang akan datang [kan] berpusu-pusu tapi basically kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul care ataupun just nak ride on us macam tu [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
ya that's the thing so cakap pasal tak kaya tapi means a lot sebab
my business is operating on different model which is i choose a social enterprise basically the business itself adalah untuk selesaikan social issues like
i~ ikut [lah] issue nya about environmental ke apa [kan] so because i do believe that in the in the in the keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan
kita perlukan orang buat business untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work [lah] kita pun tahu politician have so many other things [kan] tapi i would say that business kita boleh provide like kita boleh provide ya macam cakap [lah] kerja untuk orang [kan] kita boleh provide service diorang macam in your case you nak buat surprise delivery [kan] you boleh make people happy and so i would say that
business gives you more autonomy in some way
so at least you can do what you want
inse~ instead of ya [lah] i used to work juga dulu [kan] dengan boss boss bukannya senang [kan] kita salah pun
kita bet~ salah memang confirm salah kita betul pun kita salah [kan] jadi macam ya but but it's okay i think that's the beauty of young age [lah] untuk
try error jatuh explore ya explore
[oh] my god [oh] my god that that is interesting
i would say that
jangan ber~ jangan berhenti terlalu cepat sometimes you didn't know macam awak tengok [kan] business business yang dah berjaya
that take years then even just take even one to two years [lah] yang one to two years ni bukannya entrepreneur dia #grant-preneur# sebab dia dapat duit daripada grant [kan] macam tu [lah]
tapi basically [kan] (err) orang perlukan at least six seven years untuk dia betul-betul ada strong base [kan] so if you stop too early
macam let's say kita nak makan durian [kan] even though we already see the buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita bua~ ambik pokok durian [kan] kita sibuk nak makan durian nak makan durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit [kan] it's not going to taste good even though you nampak hari-hari tapi you kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri
tapi the the biggest thing ialah perseverance untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh
so i would say that
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening [kan] tapi
ya that's the beauty of it [lah] trying to hustle hustle and hustle until one day
you can enjoy the ripe durian
i also waiting for my durian to fall anyway ya
ya not too long two thousand twenty one that free hopefully hopefully
what kenapa apa ya~ what what what was
[oh] so itu adalah interesting part i would say that
i really i really like him
as a lead as a lead charac~ actor because
he is a good actor [tau] so wha~ basically (err) sebenarnya [kan] bagus [jer] cerita start up ni walaupun dia letak satu lead actor yang teruk gila tapi basically dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang
lead actor pun dah terlalu superficial [tau] macam terlalu hebat so sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda
so walaupun awak tak tengok character #nam-do-san# tu sangat-sangat loser [kan] tapi basically that's how people at thir~ twenties macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu
compare to someone yang dah macam #han-ji-pyeong# yang dah thirties [tau]
so tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang production ni pun tak sangka dia akan backfire macam ni
sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada synopsis [kan] ada seorang mentor yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat #han-ji-pyeong# tapi because he is a good actor himself yang membuatkan
kita move dengan perasaan dia sampai kita ras~ sedangkan character tu tanpa tanpa interpretation daripada dia [kan] mungkin akan jadi character yang sangat annoying
harsh lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi because (err) the actor himself [kan] put so many emotions on the face
!aiya! many conflicts (err) conflicting emotions yang kita tahu yang he is not bad he is just
ter~ tersakiti macam tu you know
(err) mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati [lah] tapi when i think back and if i am mad at #nam-do-san# i would say that i'm mad at younger me juga
but still as a as a
nonton suka hati kita [lah] kita nak suka siapa [kan] that is our own right tapi i would say it's a good reflection [lah] it's a good reflection
three years pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus that's the thing
sebab yang lain ada character development [tau] the other two friends tapi yang tu macam stay like just like that
ya just just better sikit [lah] ada coat sendiri tak payah pinjam that's the only improvement made [kan] [kan] tu [lah] !aduh!
okay ada lagi ke resolution untuk tahun ni anything [eh] untuk tahun ni
[eh] small thing [seh] yang buat benda jadi great and big ya
[oh] my god that's so hard
ya ya
procrastination
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya [lah] macam zaman study i would say that i i'm a last minute person because last minute kadang-kadang boleh push you
like push you [lah] macam in the very last minute [kan] you boleh focus and sometimes your creative juice like macam tu [kan] tapi masalahnya in real life [kan] when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as (err) ke~ persekitaran [lah] environment macam tiba-tiba covid dan sebagainya [kan] so macam
procrastination akan backfire you compare to someone belajar yang it's just you and your assignment [lah] macam tu [kan]
(mmhmm) ya ya
maybe because you are a person yang work under pressure
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you kena you kena combine kerja you dengan team mate lain like just imagine if the team mate buat macam tu to you [kan] at the last day baru dia nak submit dia punya
so it's going to be difficult
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
yeah
drag yourself ya betul betul betul procrastination
and somehow sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa [lah] procrastination ni pun
sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya social media juga [kan] macam in my own case [lah] i will say sometimes i was like okay i just want to watch one video [kan] tiba-tiba another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so itu yang menarik then tu [lah] tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu [kan] ada tengok satu documentary [tau] dekat
documentary dekat netflix [ah] cerita pasal social network [tau] macam mana sebenarnya since kit~ since kita guna all this services for free [kan] macam facebook and all those thing [kan] basically we are
pelik [ah] sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah customer [kan] tapi kita tak bayar so tu maksudnya kita bukan customer maksudnya kita adalah
data (err) their their modal macam tu [kan] so
so dia dah baca [tau] kita punya behaviour dia dah baca kita punya interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so macam dia tahu macam mana nak keep us hook kita tengok one lepas satu-satu [kan] lagi satu !aduh! lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar
ya ya ya
macam fikir fikir contoh kata [oh] rasa nak beli katil [ah] tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar
[a'ah]
so i don't know i mean they were listening to us [lah] [kan] our microphone is always on kita tak pernah pun default untuk tutup [kan] somehow
ya
ya tapi maksudnya ya maksudnya kalau [lah] basically okay kalau diorang dengar diorang just feed us dengan ads okay [lah] tetap okay juga [lah] sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli [kan] but how about if bad people
peeking through your life from there
[kan] so ya
so tu [lah] macam bila kita bila kita gunakan service ni for free [kan] for free
so kita basically menjual diri kita to them [lah] like okay i am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me sebab tu pencen~ penting kita baca like agreements and all term and condition
but i would
ya ya ya ya
macam tu [lah] like term and condition if you agree tick siapa pun nak baca tick [kan] kat situ that that's the thing
so
tapi takpe [lah] basically the basically the idea is walaupun kita tahu ap~ ap~ yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku at least kita tahu dia ambil so at least kita boleh jaga-jaga [lah] more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things [kan] macam tu
(mm)
ya
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now macam dulu [kan] like ten years back kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa that is something like ridiculously happened [tau] macam
[kan] kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita (uh) cik boleh tak saya tengok
(err) saya nak tengok apa periuk (err) dapur macam mana ada hood ke tak ada hood (uh) ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of peop~ of other person [kan] because that person boleh buat live dekat dia punya
bilik [kan] macam tu
ya
ya
ya ya even [oh] my god i still remember like one house tour that i watched dia siap tunjuk the secret room
ya that's the ya
and basically [kan] senangnya sekarang ni with the technology ada the a_r semua [kan] dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik your plan house plan [tau]
hanya dengan gambar se~ sekarang pun technology yang ada with with pictures you take pictures you can even like kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat
okay so basically what if du~ during the house tour people screenshots screensh~ screenshot and redo back your house plan
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then macam nak masuk pun senang
yes and somehow this wealthy people pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan post so orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya rule dalam kita post social media ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh post pasal vacation after the vacation
yes sebab basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then curi [lah] apa saja
yes yes yes
itu [lah] dunia sekarang different [lah] people
it's it's very interesting because people are less communicative
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing [tau] macam orang dulu [kan] dia communication nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu [jer] [lah] masa untuk interact [tau] so you really have to all out [kan] tapi people nowadays [kan] dia neglect
organik punya communication tapi dia boleh share every single thing about dia punya life [kan] tapi bila orang judge dia marah pula
orang tak like tak tak tak bagi reactions pun dia marah [kan] so
so okay cakap pasal tu that's there's one more [lah] one more thing i want to add on the twenty twenty resolution [lah] twenty twenty one [oh] my god twenty twenty one because i want to segment my day [tau] macam
i realise that throughout the day there are so many times i check my phone and check my phone [tau] so i was like macam i want to segment [lah] macam okay pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically kadang-kadang check tu actually in notification and an hour and i watch hundred videos already
ya and then macam then all the video sometimes is (err) ridiculous (err) like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness [kan] so macam
so i want to segment [lah] macam okay dalam masa tiga jam ni i will i will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest i would stay out of it macam tu [lah] that's the idea
okay
macam quota [ah]
(mmhmm)
!wow!
[oh]
just imagine in the middle of cute cat video and then it stop [kan]
[oh] you can ignore [lah] dia tak macam parental parental control yang terus off [oh] okay okay
just just to remind you [lah] bukan [lah] macam guru discipline something like that [kan]
tapi ada apps [tau] untuk buat benda tu which is very interesting i just download it [lah] macam nama dia forest [tau] so macam bila you start the apps [kan] you kena set [lah] you nak you nak buat kerja berapa lama
okay so dia ada beza [tau] tiga puluh minit dia punya shrub [jer] kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok [tau] kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah [tau]
so basically [kan] dia untuk bantu you untuk (err) focus so you buka app you set tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja [kan] so you tak boleh buka apps lain you kena tutup dengan apps tu sahaja
kalau [lah] tiga puluh minit you access your phone pokok tu akan mati [tau] tapi kalau kalau you buk~ kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan notify you okay pokok tu dah hidup and basically everyday you have a patch of forest untuk dibangunkan
yes very interesting so macam [ah] so macam basically [kan] dia bagi kita award macam dia bagi reward [lah] reward macam
okay so kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian
tak so depress
[a'ah] maksudnya
ya
ya
betul sebab manusia ni sukakan acknowledgement tapi takkan kita nak suruh ya yes
takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam [kan] it's just like boss datang okay congratulations four hours [kan] tak logic [ah] [kan]
that's very intriguing [seh] tu satu benda forest ada satu lagi [tau] interesting juga nama dia sleepy town so apa yang kita buat adalah (err) kita set [lah] satu hari kita nak tidur dalam enam jam [kan] so bila nak tidur kita buka apps tu dan tutup phone dengan apps tu on on running [lah] okay
so kalau you bangun dalam masa you dapat tidur tujuh jam ataupun you bang~ pasal you tak access phone dah lepas you dah set the alarm [kan] you akan bina the town
sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping [lah] so you will enjoy it when you so dia lebih daripada quality life [lah] so macam
interesting i ya [lah] saja [jer] nak tengok apps i've seen because i want to live better i want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes i already sleep [tau] tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok phone sebab nak tengok sekejap [jer] end up [kan]
mula-mula [jer] yes end up netflix tiba-tiba [kan] tiba-tiba so basically dia memang dia memang ada design untuk bagi orang hook
and tapi kita kena take back the power [lah] we have to unhook all that
okay (uh huh)
ya yang peliknya dia bukan macam puppy [tau] yang macam memang sentiasa entertain anyone dia diva and then macam
make macam sangat-sangat annoying [ah] macam if if i need you rub me rub me now and when i don't like it i will just leave you macam tu [kan]
tu [lah] orang cakap [kan] macam bila kita bela kucing kita yang jadi servant to the cat
[ah]
aduhai
i think because they are cute tapi elegant
they they keep their [eh] i know tak [lah] macam cara dia tidur you know then [oh] tapi tak juga
tapi tapi ya cats can be very then sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam
ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang instead of bela anak [kan] maybe sebab bela binatang lebih bagus [lah] #kot# dari bela anak [kan] sebab bela anak ni
yeah maybe sometimes diorang inve~ investment so
ya ya ya
macam tu [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh] my god zombie apocalypse tapi agaknya sam~ okay [lah] ya zombie apocalypse tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa
i don't know i i have seen the video people cakap the science or some drugs can make you like that i don't know [lah] tapi i would say apocalypse akan berlaku so be it zombie or not but still [ah] kata [lah] kalau that's why that's the thing i've been reading about bunkers [tau] macam menarik [ah] orang yang boleh buat bunkers kat bawah rumah [kan] macam tu because you want to save peop~ save your family [lah] at least and sebab
tak payah tak payah zombie [lah] an~ apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada food ration
and then at least ada survival skill [kan] let's say [lah] kalau berlaku
disasters [kan] actually zom~ zombie apocalypse akan leads kepada disaster [ah] dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah [ah] [kan] dan sebagainya [kan] so (um) kita kena ada survival skill
let's say kalau macam mana kita nak (um) menyorok kat mana [kan] ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab ya [lah] so far nak cakap pasal zombie ni kita tak tahu zombie tu macam mana
there's so many kind of zombies some zombies are dumb and slow some zombie are very fast so i don't know [lah] which zombie will come first so that's the that's that's
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see [kan] can only (err) listen [ah] macam tu [kan] so tak tahu cuma i would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared [lah] [kan]
let's say kalau zombie semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang [kan] so kita kena
[ah] duduk dalam air [kan] betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air at least kita kena basic macam rafting ke apa macam tu [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya it's not zombie [ah] we call it b_o_b bunk out bag dia macam
(err) bag tu ada cukup [lah] untuk something happened ada macam first aid macam ada dry food and then macam (err) your details pasal you punya your blood semua [kan] so macam kalau orang jumpa you terbaring ke apa you ni tapi kita panggil bunk out bag [lah] macam tu ya but kalau kalau kita cakap zombie kit tu orang akan rasa [oh] it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie [kan] but actually (err) disclaimer sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja [jer] [lah] it don't have to be zombie let's say [lah] kalau ada orang masuk rumah you yes war we don't we never know [kan] macam even though kita rasa everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year yang buatkan apa pun kita punya resolution tak tercapai tu [kan] so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so (mmhmm)
okay
ya
ya
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it [lah] so macam tak tahu [lah] kalau macam overseas [kan] orang akan macam ada n_d_a [kan] non disclosure [kan] macam tu tapi macam
i would say that berapa pos~ berapa probability dan possibility dia [ah] then macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya contractor tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana [kan] so macam boleh berlaku tapi i would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous [lah] sebab maybe [ah] [kan] macam for now i would say that if we pun orang akan rasa [oh] this for safety
but for people yang macam influential [kan] let's say say it's (um)
(uh) artist celebrity politicians [kan]
but
ya kalau dalam movie kalau macam mafi~ mafia ni kalau orang tu buat bunker untuk dia dia tembak [jer] lepas tu [kan] [ah] of course [lah] we cannot do that [kan]
cakap pasal rumah it's very interesting [kan] how ya people try to customise house [kan] macam buat secret room macam buat bunker and now people sekarang macam buat apa #catio# untuk kucing [lah] [eh] macam buat hub ya
cat is like social media [ah] hook you [kan] macam tu
(mmhmm)
why because cause you don't want them to go in the house anymore is it then
okay ya [lah]
ya ya ya
and make them you know that's the thing (err) we call it like cat nourishment [ah] macam cats used to live in the wild tapi kita yang bring in the home [kan] so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is kejar rama-rama
things like that [kan] so that is tapi kalau ada rumah the first thing i want to have is swimming pool [lah]
okay
seriously you want to hi and things waktu swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least bukan semua baka [lah] maybe some some breed can [lah] macam i would say bengal ke apa yang yang very wild one [kan] tapi basically kalau perasan semua kucing berenang most of them adalah yang short hair
ya instead of long hair [ah] macam tu sebab so kalau long hair i would say it would be very very very wet and then tak dapat macam wiggle wiggle badan dia how dogs do it [kan]
ya it's very interesting and then i want to have like place untuk macam
buat yoga with all the sun you know because somehow [kan] kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then kita most of the time stay at home working at home as~ and everything because of the covid
we have less exposure of vitamin d [tau] but because vitamin d we can only get it from sunlight [kan] so i was thinking kalau ada rumah [kan] in the middle of the house i want to make sure the dia punya dinding tu
(um) made from glass no no made from glass so dia dek~ dia dia
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight macam tu
ya ya glasshouse glass house
like buat like igloo style so macam #dok# macam macam ni [lah] kubah macam tu
ya the remaining is always nice and i think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive [lah] [kan] macam during this trying time [kan] macam ya every new year pun kita buat resolution [kan] pastu kita buat plans and everything because we want to look forward in life [lah]
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
macam and most of dreamers pun orang rasa macam crazy people in the beginning [kan] macam
kalau tengok
macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik wright [kan] the the the wright brothers [kan]
macam when they want to fly things siapa [jer] yang setuju
tapi now that is diorang punya determination tu yang membuat we can cross country [kan] kita boleh experience things on the other side of the world
(mmhmm)
betul i would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected [lah] dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat heavily affected
sebab ya [lah] diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak operate [kan]
[oh] tak boleh langsung ya then most people yang kerja dalam industry tu diorang adalah macam skillful people tapi in one area [tau] so diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain
(mmhmm)
i see and i would say they are very good in emergency response [kan] i see
ya that's interesting like paramedics pun boleh [kan] macam tu like basic basic [ah] menarik menarik so ya [lah] macam
because senang [kan] kit~ bila orang kena lay off ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena lay off sekarang sangat
dan somehow apart from dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan industry re~ re~ revolution industry [kan] bila everything's automated semua benda pakai robot pasal dia akan take away our jobs [kan] tiba-tiba kita berlaku economic punya macam ni yang yang merudum [kan] so
ya it's going to be very very difficult to most people [lah]
and ya
sebab itu [lah] kita buat business #kot# [kan] boleh [lah] bantu orang maybe provide more jobs to people [kan] sebab the economy have to run [lah]
ya
ya because somehow dengan ramai orang kena laid off employer pun ada banyak sangat pilihan so the competition is very very high
yes yes most most business are barely surviving
macam tu [kan]
and cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada business [kan] [lah]
i would say that kesan besar kepada education system juga [lah] [kan] macam kids nowadays i would say sometimes se~ bagus juga sebab orang dah mula adopt online learning sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan interactions
dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam universities [kan] some universities are (err) fully (err) ke~ fully on online platform [kan]
tapi bila kita dekat university kita bukannya hanya belajar theory dan kita punya subject tapi life lesson macam
kita belajar communicate kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi [kan] so all that adalah very important life skills so i am so into online learning i i really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some ho~ some~ sometime boleh juga bagi tapi i don't know how much the impact will be towards the buil~ character building
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
even though they are tech savvy (mmhmm)
ya betul betul ya
betul
(mmhmm)
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose [kan] tapi friends adalah orang yang you boleh choose ya [kan] so macam
you boleh choose and su~ and boleh align minat dan sebagainya [kan] compare to ni then ya [lah] macam same [eh] macam peer [kan] macam sa~ same age peer sangat sangat penting untuk kita associate untuk kita faham
dan sebagainya so
ya akan jadi ada impact yang besar [lah] kepada characters building macam tu
(mm) (mm)
dalam keadaan yang mencabar
ya just imagine before this pun graduates susah nak dapat kerja because
it's a very competitive market [kan] and now kita ada so many
(err) talented people kena laid off and compete together with them
ya macam dah [lah] nak compete each other pun dah hard enough and then kena compete lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun experience it's not going to be easy
tapi new economy pun akan terbuka [lah] macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi influencer [kan] sebab ya like influencer pun boleh give money
(uh huh)
!wow!
dah lama [kan]
life goal [lah]
cuma bahaya dengan being influencer ni sometimes they are not being human [tau] macam
and they ya and diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu social status yang sometimes unachievable kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar [kan] untuk bagi nampak abs nampak kurus sometimes it's just about angle
then people yang see that they didn't know pun itu adalah angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that sedangkan all that is just an illusion is a diff~ it is just an different angle [kan] camera trick that's the thing sometimes
dah [lah] tu [lah] jadi lebih mencabar [lah] kat kita punya youth kalau keadaan macam ni ya [lah] lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
(mmhmm)
ya even big brands pun sekarang dah start to work with influencers instead of artists yang memang buat art [tau] berkarya
okay [lah] somehow artist people diorang charge memang terlalu mahal [kan] and influencers dia ada ca~ dia ada bigger fan base
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya faham
(mmhmm)
dan arti~ artist dan actress ni dia terpaksa produce something dulu [kan] baru orang boleh look up to them [kan] compared to influencer ni
pergi makan pun orang suka [kan] pergi jogging pun orang suka [kan] so macam cuma tu [lah] kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh set rea~ unrealistic thing [ah]
so !fuh! banyak juga kita borak ni [kan] daripada start dengan resolution cerita pasal zombie apocalypse dan sebagainya so ya hopefully takpe [lah] yang penting kita start sekarang buat sekarang macam
ya boleh
it's going to be a tough year but it's going to be interesting and fun [lah]
yes hopefully okay
(mmhmm)
untuk family [ah] untuk family (err) i would say that more collaborations macam
ya [lah] before this i would say that i live on my own [lah] pun duduk macam jauh [kan] so macam
i live on my own i just want to achieve my own goal [kan] tapi i want this family to be more collaborative like masak sama-sama
buat kerja sama-sama and even though macam ya [lah] adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu you know like sometimes i feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one [kan] even though of course [lah] macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah [kan] tapi basically [ah] but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
(err)
kadang-kadang macam ya [lah] kita pun kena bergerak sebagai family
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
betul how about you apa yang you (uh) foresee for as a family punya movement
(mmhmm)
(mm) even the silly silly stuff [lah]
ya true true
aduhai okay [lah]
ya
ya ya ya hopefully [lah] macam and it don't have to be far pun but at least places that we can
just leave the work behind and just connect as a humans [lah] as siblings as
daughters and son and all ya [lah]
okay jom rasanya
rasanya
boleh [lah] [kan] kita start put in the planner ataupun buat vision board [kan] letak dekat dalam let~ sham~ semua lawa-lawa [kan] and satu benda lagi it's good [tau] actually bila kita tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us [lah]
(mmhmm)
ya because when we say it [kan] tak ada [lah] nanti at the end takkan [lah] nanti at the end of the year nanti macam [eh] apa jadi dengan macam tu [kan] so macam
i was looking through our the booking right
then aku realise
mahal [sia] it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the apa last week of the year [what]
[kan] then aku tak tahu macam mana like we need to have more options i guess
ya okay
but unless we go for the apa [ah] smaller rooms [ah]
because the one that i found was
that one untuk yang the suite room so aku rasa macam besar sangat i mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but i think can go for the smaller rooms
the same place because
okay (err)
aku rasa boleh [ah] but i think it's about dalam empat ratus gitu
aku rasa [ah]
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus [ah] below two hundred should be okay right
ya i think aku rasa for now empat orang but
ya i think only four [lah] right
unless dylan joining i'm not sure
ya so (err)
but i'm checking my friend like cause my friend got the (uh) call (um) membership
so he got discount [lah]
ya
that one is sofitel is at #tanjong-pagar#
very near [what] the hotel i mean i mean you can go i mean it's around cit~ there's a lot of cafes there also [what]
ya
ya i think it's all nearby there [lah]
ya technically i don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon [lor]
yup
the price confirm makin mahal
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year i guess
ya [lor]
ya [oh] ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so i might have to take leave ya
but then i think i'll take the whole week [lah] i see how [lor] technically i got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya [oh] ya last year we had the what
botanic gardens theme [ah] the boy bunga theme
ya no but whenever #tanjong-pagar# theme
don't know
i don't know o_l [lah] maybe o_l theme
[oh] ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
[oh] ya dia belum decide right
ya
[oh] really [ah]
from which (err) supermarket
prime is hard to find you know there's only like berapa [jer] dalam singapore ni [tau] nak cari
ya
#sheng-siong# #sheng-siong# also hard [sia]
i mean you see my area around down here there's no #sheng siong# the nearest is #bukit-panjang# mall
giant [lah] since we just with brandon
[eh] last year we did giant
!aiya!
[eh] n_t_u_c ya ya n_t_u_c
so what
ya i remember the cause i think n_t_u_c got more things to buy
kipas [oh] it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know sebelah-sebelah [leh] like one black one white i don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
bodoh
ya bodoh so big [sia]
ya so what is just the four of us [ah] #xing-jing# [oh] no with the others right because we doing dinner dengan yang lain-lain [kan] malam so
(mm)
who's the free one [ah]
can you plan
please
kau plan [lah] then kau bilang kita then we will just decide i mean we will just a vote
you have to be codes
ya they bodoh
this is not chinese new year
this is christmas so tak payah #lohei#
dinner
i think dinenr can go all out [lah] i guess not all out as in macam terus
apa sakan [ah] but more like a
but now buffet very irritating [ah]
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve [lah] i mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the makanan will dia ada server will send to you yes i know right ya so i think it's not a good time for buffet
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
(mm)
he kena bullied
what what do you mean location kena change you mean the buffet town run away or what
is it i there's only one buffet town i think it's at raffles city
i know
[oh] ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have i don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
[oh] ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
for the dinner dia orang boleh [eh]
okay
(um) terrence i haven't check with him yet tapi aku rasa maybe dia tak boleh because that week he's going back to school already
[oh] ya true also
i mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon i think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least macam tujuh puluh percent untuk
dia orang go to phase three [lah] so
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that [lah] they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members [lah] yang tinggal dalam serumah right
ya
different timing
ya
can
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas punya dinner [kan]
so what they did was because they i think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely [lah] i mean you cannot meet [lah] but
so aku tak tahu [ah] macam mana like
ya
ya so i don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
[oh] ya just five of us [lah]
without partners [lor]
(mm)
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us [what]
korean ya that [ah]
#farin# birthday
[oh]
[oh] yes
ya i mean just let them let them tell their partners [lor] that
#bo# #pian# [lah] [kan] macam tak boleh apa
ya
ya so i think the dinner one is settled
i mean technically it's not even a macam public holiday on that day right
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight i mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya okay
i think he never go there before so you should be safe dia tak ada benchmark untuk tempat tu
ya
(um)
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work [lah]
then the next morning he will aku rasa go to the work straight
ya
(mm)
ya [lor]
so the tuesday morning aku rasa he has to go back to work [lor]
monday right
is it really
ya
[oh]
okay i thought it's monday and tuesday
you
!hais!
okay [lor] we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
cause i remember i ask my friend for monday tuesday punya time slot i mean (err) rates ya
then he say it's like seven hundred [oh] my god like the one the i bought was only four hundred [sia]
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
masih [ah] kau taiwan
you are in a cold room
!whoa! but luckily i went taiwan [sia] just before lockdown
ya
(err) not as good as that one we we went that time
ya it was that one i go on march it was macam sejuk [ah] tapi macam just like aircon kind yes
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
!hais!
!hais! ya
ya
[eh] but i heard the vaccine are coming in right so i think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
t_p_e
(um) ya
but you know the that time the who say [ah] which minister
the he say macam apa like
he's not going they are not going to macam vaccinate everybody kat singapore
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
tak tahu save duit agaknya
ya
so i think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably [lah] elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations [lah] wait those are compulsory right
ya may~ maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
i don't know
but until then i don't think we can travel [lah]
want to give up
ya because i think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
was there [lah] [oh] my god
(mm)
apa purpose [kan] i mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat they can just spread to each other [lah]
(err) they have another issue to tackle there [oh] my god
(mm)
are you talking about succulent
[oh] cactus cactus yang kecil-kecil gitu [eh] then
[oh]
dua cactus
the normal one cactus
no the normal cactus yang besar dia ada thorns then macam bulat-bulat gitu and dia punya shape
straight then bulat-bulat [eh] right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert i think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
kau siak [ah] !hey! mahal pokok tu
(mm)
[oh] i don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay i see
what [sia] cardboard
[oh] what
kau tanam pokok durian [jer] [lah]
i mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
!hais! anyway i have an assignment on an essay [lah] so i need just (err) your your point of view [lah] i guess
(mm) it's about (um)
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so i don't know what do you think
kind
i mean
the experts say [lah] the lockdown causes more macam apa problems than benefits ya
why
(mm)
ya
true [leh] ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least i guess
(mm)
ya
(mm)
good [what] lockdown good [what] i was enjoying the c_b period
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems [lah] rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
[oh]
ya
(mm)
okay but i think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are entertile~ but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like i feel [lah] like always been pushing
s_m_e all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but i think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation [lah] so i think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway (err)
macam dulu dia tak pakai grab but sekali now [oh] i need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it [lah] rather than kau tahu macam kalau tak ada covid like everybody is still
macam oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during c_b also got famous because of this so
okay [lah] aku rasa
ya [lah] #alhamdulillah# i need the money so what's the problem
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money untuk
to avoid this (err) to convert their platform store into online platform [lah] so
aku rasa okay [lah]
(mm)
true i mean you will lose your human touches also [lah] right i guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of h_b_b now like because of a lockdown so i think
bagus [lah] [kan] macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef kat rumah [kan] semua buat #dalgona# coffee macam kau
okay ya i think so then like societal i think also got benefits like
(err)
i think it brings families together
kind
macam
you will just stuck at home with your family [lah] you got no choice but just to interact dengan dia orang like
that's all [lah] like
so
ya
i know
but although yes i agree that it can be quite a challenge because like kalau kau baca that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
not every family can get along [lah] hundred percent get along so
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya i can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one !wah! then
ya
right ya
(mm)
ya obviously
ya
(mm)
true
(mm)
but i think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during c_b it's like a jungle out there
i mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what i mean
ya definitely bro
they are better [lah] because you know carbon footprints were reduced [lah] i mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit [lah] of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight [lah] like just
ya
ya
ya
okay [lah] at least they are well taken care of i hope coming from what we see on the news i think they are quite well taken of just that i think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress [lah] i would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit [leh]
ya i mean what can you do also right
ya
(mm)
ya
then aku rasa like i think they dia orang tak concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
maybe they did [lah] like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions i mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority i guess i don't know
i mean during the c_b even like dia punya apa
not counsellors [lah] what what is it calling
orang yang
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
so they don't really care about that part aku tak tahu but
ya
(mm)
i know right i want a bit longer
ya i mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this i mean hopefully yes [lah] but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
i mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya [eh] can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown i need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society [lah] i guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
i think there's nothing to argue about it i think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case [lah] on the rise during c_b
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water [one]
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito [one]
it's true okay [lah] but that's not really a problem i guess
it just go without the track [what] [sia] bodoh
ya but i think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the la~ the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down [lah]
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead i feel [lah] at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
iya [lah] confirm ada [lah]
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down i think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot [leh]
is it
aren't we not at the top
[oh] we're not the predator
i don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest [lah]
but we have brains though they got no brain i mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya i mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then i think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then macam suddenly kau dalam hutan tu kau introduce monyet kau introduce pangolin kau introduce lemur pelanduk i don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
pergi mana balik rumah kau
ya ni bukan library [tau] kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil [tau]
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
i don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale i don't know
everything must go right i mean i don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild i guess i mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to [lah] but it's not possible [lah] per se
[oh] my god
[oh] that one that they kill all the animal [ah] but cause the one all is affected in~ infected with the coronavirus [what] ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
so they have to kill or macam that one [lah] like what chicken flu like that [eh] bird flu chicken flu
they have to kill all the the chickens [mah]
i think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
sekali coronavirus from plants [leh]
yes
apa apa merepek kau
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya inside the middle [ah]
(uh huh)
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese (err) [ah] swiss cheese plant
stop it [lah]
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the me~ at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times [leh]
what is a prayer plant
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but monstera is an indoor plant [what] right
it's just need a little like
sun
i thought you need the evening sun or something
(mm)
ya
ya
technically they are bushes [lah] weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
not really [leh]
ya
no but first life i think very short always wilt [leh]
kau masih [tau]
but you know i was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer [lah] but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
(err) the air the in the room all these i actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk [leh] like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also [what] light can [ah]
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya i know
dah mati ke
can [ah]
ya probably can [lah] i don't know
i don't know it just grows short [lah] from small to big [lah] i guess shoots ya
!hais!
i only need to buy one plant untuk taruh dalam office aku
no [oh] my god that one
mati kesian benda tu
but actually mati a very terrible death to do
ya [sia] kau teruk [sia]
then we got scraping benda tu
no [meh]
i thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
[ah]
(mm)
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
i think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office (uh) condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
!aiya! the typical kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu
dia macam coconut tree but it's not
what is it called [eh] yang
it's not coconut tree yang pokok-pokok yang
fern gitu is it look like a fern
!aiya! very the
tak [lah] serious
i think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
ya usually events that kind of pokok [lah] you know like those
standard pokok i don't know
it's the typical pokok at events you know
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
(mm) [oh] my god
(mm)
yes that's one thing pokok pisang
!hais!
(mm)
spray is it then
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
(mm)
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water i guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also [what] if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
(mm)
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
i guess i mean you can go out plant
(mm) ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die [sia]
(hmm)
[oh] my god it's so expensive though
it's like i don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough [lah] too much plants [ah] mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant [eh]
[oh] no
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
it's like a fern anyway
!hais!

(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how i would end up not dis~ not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
i suppose (um) ya
ya
okay

kirakan okay [lah] tak macam kawan dia okay [lah] tak dengan members dia semua okay [lah] tapi
but
still at the back of my mind (um)
i would i will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it i i know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
(uh)
[ha] okay
apakah okay wait wait wait
ceritakan suatu pengalaman yang sebenarnya lucu tetapi mungkin tidak lucu pada masa itu
you faham tak
cari toilet just to cebok
and buang seluar dalam
kat mana ni
ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
!huh! okay
(uh) cerita kelakar
okay actually you know what
you know what i'm gonna do right now i don't wanna talk about i don't want to use this conversation
i wanna talk about something i want to talk about the house
ya okay it's easier for us let~ let's just
what do you think of the house [ah]
!huh!
ya ya what do think of the house [ah]
(mmhmm)
keep talking [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
i mean for me ya [lah] i mean it's i do feel
i mean once in a while like i do feel macam a bit sedih that
yang apa ni
i
i'm a bit far away from from where i'm used to [kan] like i mean like i've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but i guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that i really i mean do i do i really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially i had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what i propose for because it was what i like
you know anything i'm just very lucky that like what i like was what was what you like as well
right
i mean certain things you like a bit sedih right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like i wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just mahal [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah]
ya
your your your your new phone masih banyak battery [kan]
you just get jap [eh] jap [eh]
(uh) okay you know what i'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right i want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health nanti [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
(um)
ya [lah] tu [jer] [ah]
you know what i think i want to talk about our house
i sometimes i just just sometime sometimes i tengok the gambar semua [eh] macam like
you know cannot believe that macam tak percaya that
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
one thing [ah] i actually [eh] when i design the place right one thing i actually didn't realise apa [tau] yang toilet kita actually kecil
no no no i mean it's not besar i mean it's not it's not (um)
not no what i'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small i mean it is
it is kecil tapi tetap besar you get what i mean nak i i
i would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no i just wanted to
no i wanted to put a bi~ i i i nak i nak letak apa cermin besar sikit
abeh tu yang bawah cermin tu yang tangki tu
i nak buat macam a cabinet (uh) you know macam ada macam gerobok kecil gitu
macam ya [lah] luas sikit [lah] tapi
the only [lah] but the buttons ge ge which is good [lah]
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
i was kinda glad that the
terrazzo tiles dah habis
is just cantik ya
actually (uh) actual~ actually toilet kita cantik
i'd like to say [ah] toilet kita really cantik
me
i choose it
i yang nak ni apa yang
i wanted the the
the apa ni
the terracotta punya apa tadi [eh] yang tali ni [kan] yang yang yang the line here

no actually macam
kalau tak putih pun okay apa
jap [eh] jap jap jap jap jap
[ah] okay you tanya [lah] you you okay you you tanya i any (uh)
sembarang
soalan
(hmm)
pelancongan yang paling menarik sekali yang yang say~ yang saya telah pernah alami
ialah
waktu kita melancong ke
iran
paling menarik
bukan
pal~ yang paling digemari
kerana
yang pertama
iran bukan (uh) suatu tempat yang
[ah] ya~ apa yang you know yang akan saya pilihi
dengan secara #otomatis#
tetapi
you know ia
ia diberi
you know it was an option that you know that i didn't even pick you picked it
you know and i thought it was just interesting you know because i've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
i i had zero expectation of iran in fact i'm not like when you were planning the whole thing i will just like (mm) ya okay and i just
i just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
okay [lah] the first night the the the first night was a bit seram
ya it was was seram sikit
you know because macam like macam
like dia punya airport macam macam bukan airport dia punya airport macam like
macam tak best [ah]
and then then lepas tu kita [kan] [kan] [kan] the first night kita kita tinggal hostel tu [kan]
ya and the hostel pun the hostel tu pun macam seram sikit
tapi the next apa [ah] besok pagi when lepas kita bangun
(uh) kita
ya ya ya ya ya that [one] was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
(um) we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
(mm) where they were that was really really very nice and then (um)
you know it was just interesting it's just that i think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went #tehran#
we didn't have a guide like what we had (uh) in #isfahan# and #yazd#
[eh] no no no we didn't have #yazd# it's #shiraz# sorry ya
but
ya [lah] we didn't have a guide [lah]
would have been nice [lah] if we had a guide [ah] but we didn't have a guide
ya
ya actually we should have stayed there longer the fact that it was was [ah] lift tak cukup
no the that point of time i was i wasn't i was freelancing so i had a lot of time
ye ke
[oh] ya that time diorang yang kena balik ya ya ya
roy yang kena balik siang sebab ada apa ni ada apa
!huh!
just cakap [jer] [lah] nama bukan orang tu kenal ya
[oh] ya roy kena balik siang sebab dia [pe] ada [pe] [pe] apa
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to #bordeaux# so many times
[oh] ya
(mm)
cranny
(mmhmm)
i think south of france ya ya ya no no no that time yang kita yang kita pergi #nice# tu semua [kan]
ya yang kita gi #nice# tu the [ah] tu best [ah]
tu best gila really real~ really betul-betul best gila
okay to be honest with you right to be completely honest with you the summer trips the best one yang kat france
ya yang kita pergi #nice# #saint-tropez#
(uh) #biarritz#
no yes we did we went to biarri~ #biarritz# we went to #cannes#
yes we did go to #biarritz# we went to we went to #biarritz# dengan your aunty [eh]
yes
[kan] [kan] kita [kan]
[kan] kita pergi f~ [kan] kita pergi #nice# [eh] no kita gi #bordeaux#
then from #bordeaux# kit~ we went ya we went to (uh) #dune-du-pilat#
and then we went to #biarritz#
ya and then we went to #arcachon# ya
and then after that we went to #nice# then from #nice# we went to #saint-tropez# whi~ kita gi
kita gi #cannes# and (um)
#saint-tropez# #cannes# and tak tahu mana lagi [lah] situ [jer] [lah]
entah [eh] tak tahu nak berbual apa lagi [eh] jap jap jap [eh] i tangok yang tu
jap [eh] (oo) they got a lot of question
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
i think
for me it's the built
first
right i'm okay with looks
ya
i mean i mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
i like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because i think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like i'm i'm attracted to i guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can i
deal with like you know you and i we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
i mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like i find myself like when i'm very conscious of what i'm speaking that i'm speaking i tend to break out more i mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like tukar and then cakap bahasa melayu
you know boleh [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way nak cakap melayu all the way because
even when i'm speaking malay
normally i suppose right i
i often pepper the words with
pep~ pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase luahkan perasaan
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like luahkan perasaan means like i'm about to cry you know like i'm about to
i'm about to really go dri~ deep
with my feelings but when i say i'm expressing like i just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when i say i nak luahkan perasaan kat you [ah]
maknanya i macam ada banyak [lah] nak cakap sangat [kan] ada banyak [lah] nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena (uh)
nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena
nak kena cakap [lah]
then rasa dia macam macam berat sangat
macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal !wah! see
janggal
you do~ you tak tahu makna janggal you teka makna janggal apa
just teka [lah]
yes ya
janggal maknanya awkward
yes
[eh] no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
i suppose so
jap jap jap jap let me check yang ni
jap jap jap jap i reply kak su jap [eh]
ya you check whatsapp yang
yang q tu
jap jap jap jap jap let me just show this for a while [eh] i just switch
ya ya ya it's recording nampak ben~ benda merah tu
sekejap
takpe
jap jap jap
okay jap [eh]
okay mari kita tengok soalan-soalan yang lain
sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu
don't know okay okay i tanya lagi [eh]
sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu
pe~ koalan~ soalan pertama fahamkan anda
you faham tak
no kemahi~
kemahi~ (mm) okay mahir tu apa
no kemahiran is skills
sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta what's serta-merta serta-merta tu apa
serta-merta serta-merta is immediately ya or instantly [lah]
right sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu
i'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
(mmhmm) okay
why
(uh huh)
[ah] okay
(uh huh)
mana [lah] i tahu you tanya [lah] diri sendiri
okay i'm go~ i'm actually going to attempt to speak malay in this [ah] okay kemahiran yang pertama yang ak~ yang ingin saya

you know
and i i think those three skills would be
most
(uh) would be most useful
i believe
okay
okay
okay jap [eh] jap [eh]
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
suatu hari
anda bangun dari tidur dan mendapati bahawa anda telah menjadi seorang pelakon
siapakah pelakon itu dan mengapa anda memilihnya
okay
pelakon
yang saya
(um) memilih
[ah] ialah
(uh)
(uh)
siapa yang jadi spiderman yang barunya yang the latest one tom holland ya
saya ingin menjadi tom holland kerana
(uh) dia
(uh) sungguh (um)
(uh) talented
i have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)
that dia muda
saya ingin menjadi muda kembali
(uh)
muda dan (uh) berjaya
ya tom holland
bagaimana pula dengan anda
pilihan
kenapa
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay kejap jap jap
okay (um)
[eh] jap jap you know what i want to tengok the video yang your brother hantar
then kejap [eh]
ya satu jam kena berbual satu jam
just berbual [jer] [lah] satu jam the no okay the thing is i think what the
i think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) wheth~ how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so i think they just want to find out like
i think i think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now i'm speaking in english and then suddenly i tukar i cakap dengan you bahasa melayu
i think saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila
yang paling mustahak ialah apabila
dan kenapa
dan dari situ
(um)
memberi (uh)
kesinambungan
bagaimana
dan apabila
(uh) diorang diorang ingin (um)
diorang ingin mengetahui
cara-cara
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes woul~ okay what i find such studies very interesting because they alw~ like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to feed~ you have to you have to understand because
nec~
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced i get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's i think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour i suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as m~ as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this conversa~ is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk ni semua we don't really
i mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
i think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how i hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so i feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
i feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where i can just easily go in go out nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap english cakap english
and
then cakap [lah] but the fact that kalau
kalau certain words macam like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like macam !alah!
ya
ya macam dia macam tak natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes lagi dua puluh minit sahaja okay tapi sekarang i nak tengok yang the video yang your your brother hantar tu
jap [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] i'm glad that they that the yang [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually i'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
nasib baik tu yang benda tu ya [lah] dah habis
jadi
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
ya rumah kita besar [sia]
yes
[a'ah] macam lama [sia]
no [lah] i rasa i rasa first first christmas
to fully pindah but i mean we can slowly live there
my things i'm gonna letak sikit-sikit [tau] i'm not gonna like one time go there i'm just gonna put things bit by bit because i takde kotak
i probably gonna take a few kotak and all that for of course office
muat ke
[oh] cakap [jer] [lah] ya
i really suka the yang kitanya flooring flooring kita cantik

i think the kitchen cantik [ah] like after we letak after the apa ni the
dia

i think the whole idea yang [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
i kinda like it though
ye ke
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] ini diorang boleh spray [eh]
okay
so yang ni nanti nanti next few days baru pasang [ah]
kena tunggu benda tu kering [eh]
actually [kan]
i was imagining the the counter top to be
besar sikit [tau] tebal sikit actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me i'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but i was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya lebih tebal sikit
tapi macam tak [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]

(uh huh)
ya
right
(mm) (mm)
ya
as the caterer you are supposed to do th~ supposed to be the one [sia]
the event organiser like which is them [lah] since they're catering for the food

like ya sell your package to someone else
[oh]
why you still continue to pay [sia] babe
[oh] masih tu [ah]

[oh] my god babe that's a lot of money [sia]
i think you should like list down all the deposits as you meet them macam everything [tau] you list down from a to z how much exactly you have spent and you have paid for and then you include like what their what's the stand of the vendors like are they willing to (uh) and then you also include like you you (um) macam if you get pregnant then how you gonna get married you can get married like can have a wedding and then but then they will o~ open it till twenty twenty one then like how [sia] you nak macam it's a lose-lose situation for you in all in all aspects [lah] like you still going to lose money [sia]
and at this time [leh] macam
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put (uh) a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that [oh] because company also need t~ need to earn money how can you put that over a an in~ individual's loss
macam like you lost thousands of money [eh] just because like [orh] the company need to earn money the company didn't give you anything back
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
nothin~ ya tha~ you didn't get any of the products
!wah! i will angry [sia]
ya
it's not even your fault [sia] it's not even your yo~ you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been (uh) how it was planned i feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the majlis are over like you get duit salam you know
i told #aqil# i had no expectations like kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin [ah] but other than that i'm just thinking at my own time [ah] cause like i'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course tapi i tak nak macam okay i need to find a man yang i boleh kahwin no it's like i want to find a man that i love and then slowly everything will (uh) fall into place [lah] like if y~ if we kahwin then kahwin like but ultimately i feel like (uh) it's important that #aqil# and i learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting [ah] of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so pelan-pelan [ah]
[oh] you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
(err) like a couple of weeks ago cause i tell him like by default i feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
because we are exclusive kita tak cakap we we kita tak berbual dengan orang lain like we love each other like we see a future in each other tapi (um)
i still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so he say [ah] like let's celebrate or officiate (um) hujung tahun
so i was like i guess can take it as a test like i don't know like just wait it out and observe
tapi [kan] babe but there are certain things that i'm still not used to i tak biasa like him looking at my phone
he must see me siapa text he must see me siapa call
i'm not used to that and then he's like i nak tengok your gallery i was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all (ugh) in my mind like low key i'm still like single because like mentally like i'm trying to like you know
get myself there and tell myself like i'm in a relationship
never i never tell him this yet
ya
[oh] right so anyway like in december he kata like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then i macam [oh] then he cakap [ah] actually dia dah start saving like he's very (uh) thrifty like
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that i like admire about him [lah] he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then i was like [oh]
just like
i think it's quite cute [lah] like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right (um) the last girlfriend [ah] he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you ca~ do you want to be my girlfriend i was like [oh] so like i~ to him it means a lot [lah] that he ask me then i was like [orh] okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
(um) also like i feel like honestly deep down i still have unresolved issues you with #hassan#
me i still have un~ unresolved issues with #hassan#
like a lot of things happen because of him like macam me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
ya we're still not talking [tau] babe
then i was really sad cause during my birthday dorang tak wish i (um)
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine p_m then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually i went sleepover !wah! i felt like the shittiest daughter ever [sia] babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like [ah] loose threads or like (uh) consequences on some like those aftermath of me and #hassan# that i'm still trying to figure out because i don't want to go into a new relationship with #aqil# and have like all these things unresolved like if i want to be with #aqil# i want to be with #aqil# only and not have like [oh] this is because of #hassan# that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key i still care about #hassan# like sometimes i wonder like is he doing okay and all that
i
i know like i know he's an adult like i know dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar like he'll be fine but on the low-key i still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
take care of himself
i think so [ah] because like he was a great boyfriend [sia] babe only things m~ things messed up after the relationship
so like i was so sure of #hassan# [ah] i wanted to fight it out fight it out for him [oh] my god okay i nak bilang you something [ah] yesterday yesterday semalam i told #aqil# this i say i cakap dengan #aqil# (um)
i went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year [ah]
and to be honest right i'm so glad it happened because i got to meet you
like i really felt that way [sia] babe like
like the thing with #hassan# all that shit that went through like i went through with the other guys like
i will go through it a million times knowing the fact that i'm going to meet #aqil# and this is going to happen
ya
it's so crazy like how like at peace i am with how things ha~ like how things (um) tertulis [ah] [lah] like is everything tertulis [what] like
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time [ah] babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and #aqil#
belum i belum delete i still i still masih ada kat phone
dekat my phone
kenapa i tak tahu i tak tahu asal i tak delete
i i tak nak tengok [ah] the gambar-gambar like it makes
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but i have some things that i want to keep like myself and friends
kau nak but
ya i don't know [ah] like
i mean i really really hope #hassan#
everything will work out well for him because i really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness [ah] babe he's a good guy
i mean during the relationship [lah] after that i don't know what happened
right
(uh) after after #hassan#
cause you were still with #audi# and then like we went out remember you me #hassan# you me #hassan# #audi# ya
ya
honestly right i have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
the~ like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
i feel so [eh] babe
(uh) like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like (um) cold like he's very (err) like
a~ [ah] very action [ah]
like he's a very action person i feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like h~ he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like (uh) when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then (err) he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that i kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so i'm just like then i wonder [ah] like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
that's like trying to be macam they are trying to
be someone that they're not
lepas tu (um) dah kahwin after a few y~ after a few years dah penat like pretend to be someone that you're not
then their true form comes out !wah! scary [ah]
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
[ah]
okay
cakap melayu [lah] okay so itu saja tentang #hassan#
[ah] tentang #hassan# dan #aqil#

so you should like
[eh] they have they have like private villas with pools and like nice vi~ nice ass views and the food's pretty good i think you should check it out
it's just like for maybe like three nights [lah] you just have time for each other
just #lepak# with each other
(uh) kalau kita empat pergi #bali# #aqil# dengan i kita pergi (uh) !ee! kita get high
kita get high on shrooms kita get high on mushrooms
[oh] my god they're gonna transcribe this t~
ya like typing it out like okay so #miza# (um) said she and #aqil# colon
[oh] right we can like
ya
i think it'll be fun
[orh] yesterday (um) we saw #aqil# [ah] class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like h~ he was with his girlfriend [oh] my god the girlfriend cantik gila [sia] i was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like (uh) ya melayu but she doesn't look malay i think she's mixed then
i like macam like i say hi [ah] but i like frozen a bit so tell i a bit shy cause like i'm flustered and then s~ #aqil# was like are you like shy then i was like no i just a~ i couldn't tell him that i'm like like i'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
then [ah]
[ah] ya the the they were in the lot and then like #aqil# saw them then #aqil# was like [eh] and then he park near th~ th~ near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like (err) decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
because right babe when we duduk in the car #aqil# need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
!huh!
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
i am not complaining [ah] cause i also don't mind the aircon his car anyway i tak complain [lah] pasal i pun nak aircon the kereta dia anyway so a~ up to you [lah] you nak on aircon i okay [jer] you nak waste nak waste gas
nanti
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
but i think one thing that i need to like (um) get used to is dia punya cemburu
cemburu
like his jealousy
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person dia cakap dia tak jealous tapi
bila i cakap pasal like my guy friends or like #shah# #shah# [sia] #shah# is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then macam [oh] maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me i tak jealous pasal like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
#firdaus# is an idiot
like to me it's like (uh) old friends that's fine if you h~ if you found a new girlfriend that [one] i'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like kalau you nak dengan dorang you dah lama dah dengan dorang
ya
so like the fact that you and dorang tak together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything [lah] between you
you know
we got seven more minutes
i punya timer five three two eight
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like i i'm also like
i'm also quite scared to introduce #aqil# to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
[orh] pasal #aqil# tak practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
tak tahu
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
i feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the ba~ he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
i don't want to push him i don't want i want you to d~ like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
he was saying like i love your daughter i~ i'm working hard [ah] to earn a a stable income and i'm also working to better myself as a muslim then i was like !oof! damn cause he dulu tak pernah puasa then he say for the last two years he's been puasa full [lah]
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
so macam
okay i mean i don't want to be that girl who's like [oh] my husband has to be no i've never been like that i always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes i feel like #aqil# like morals also questionable
like he [ah] he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who d~ who do that also
especially practising muslim so macam like [ah] but macam i have friends who like drink but then they go solat jumaat
then it's like ya then it's not morals but i think it's more of like his view on people like dia dia punya
pendirian [ah] like dia rasa like it's okay for him to do it because dia tak practise he's not a practising muslim tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia practise practise religion then itu salah so like i don't wanna ya so like macam [oh] okay like that's your view too
that's your opinion but
to me i've always been a to each their own kind of person like
gasak kau [lah] nak buat apa you you dah besar you tahu apa salah apa betul apa so i tak kesah [ah] dia nak buat apa
not my responsible to~ to tegur you because you dah tahu all this you dah tahu and like siapa i nak tegur you know
ya
so i think part yang dia like in terms of i~ i'm just scared macam my parents ada high expectations on #aqil# like they
they nak ni nak tu then they will they will i scared they feel like #aqil# is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair [lah] pasal they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like i yang nak kahwin [pe]
ya
right
i think my my parents punya fear is also because like if i get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life [lah] like once kita dah
meninggal like you know that kind of thing
(mm)
macam tak sincere [jer]
your mum
ya
[eh] how's your mum is she okay
(err) i think december
like i would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
(uh)
most likely early next year
or mid next year
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our macam we will start planning [lah] like properly macam
apply for house then like (um) because #aqil# just started working so his c_p_f is tak banyak
but i told him [ah] like my c_p_f is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like [oh] no [lah] but like he wants to
then i say it's fine (um) like we can like plan [lah] like
i feel like i feel like #aqil# is very very reasonable dan dia punya like
dia tak macam kata dia kata dia [tau] dia like dia dia will dengar cakap orang then after that he will like process and then he would
try to understand and see other people's view [ah] like i feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with
macam be with
like as a partner dia
dia faham like the what is understanding in malay babe
pecah
alright
ya so the correct so the third year aku move out (err) then i was (uh) staying dekat my aunty's punya place [lah] so what happens is (uh) i was there (uh) for actually aku duduk kat rumah dia [kan] for very long it's about
(uh) overstay my welcome is because i think it's too too long [lah] it should be
(uh) i they gave me hints [lah] ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so i i stayed dekat dia orang punya place for one and a half years ya one and a half years (err) my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way (err) they had a sofa bed down there so i was sleeping there
and then (uh) that was the the time where aku just (uh) you know just tried to just tried to to survive [lah] you know but the good thing was that i was not out in the streets i was i was actually you know i had a i had a roof [lah] and then i was you know so that was a good thing [lah]
correct so that was that was (err) (err) you know (err) at the end of the three years then (err) aku early this this this year [ah] first of january actually
(err) sometimes okay terms sometimes tak okay [lah] so that means macam (um) kadang-kadang she will invite me back [tau] macam (um) you know to to her to the family home [lah] but (uh) sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
yes and then after that i i you know many many a time i told her that okay i'm never coming back but in the end i still come back you know that kind of thing [lah] you yes (err) so the the the the very interesting thing that i realise that when i came back
(um) she totally changed bukan change macam apa [ah] so she totally macam (uh) you know she she's more (err) she she literally like (uh) tries to bother about what i'm doing you know (uh) getting to know what i'm doing and that kind of stuff i don't know what happened in the time that i was not there tapi (uh) aku rasa she i don't know whether she realise [lah] that i think family is more important than you know having i mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing [lah] so i think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so i i would say that she she tolerates me [lah] now (err) but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months [eh] we have not had a single argument i think she has learnt to accept
earlier okay okay

yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
i i i i also feel the same way as you you know because last time [ah] whenever it i'm the same as you [ah] mesti kalau macam cakap [kan] mesti nak menang [tau] macam in an argument [eh] kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang so i'm always macam energetically fight back [tau] [ah] passionate macam fight back [tau] but nowadays [kan] macam i i don't know [ah] kenapa it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through (uh) certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so (uh) kita macam tak tak (uh) apa tu there's no more energy to to [ah] to to expand to to argue [tau] macam at the most pun kalau even if we don't agree [kan] nanti the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what i prefer [lah] you know it's just you know you just you just stop [lah] just you just don't don't don't speak [lah] but but it's something that i have always (um) like macam i i'm really thankful that (um) she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because (err) i i knew back then [eh] i knew for a fact that i could not live with her i definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now i realise okay [lah] you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that i'm not sure whether is it because (err) dia pergi haji (uh) last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before covid struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that (uh) she came back and (err) i think i don't know [lah] maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
and then after when she came back ya when she came back (err) she was more (err) you know (err) she was more more able to control herself [lah] her emotions [lah] and on my part also i try to i try to control my own emotions [lah]
ya
yes it's not a one size fits all kind of thing yes correct
yes correct exactly
yes yes
ya ya ya
actually you are right you know i'm like you know kinder bueno tak yang the coklat kinder bueno okay okay i te~ i tell you what's the relation [eh] kinder bueno dia punya chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft
is it
is it is it is that is that [oh] for me for me i can if if if it's some if it's an issue that's very close to my heart [kan] i will i will [ah] i will be very very (uh) macam adamant to to keep to my belief style [ah] so when when i and when i'm that kind [eh] you that no matter what you do right i will not change and i will not follow whatever you say i will just keep to my own ini but if you were to do the reverse if you were to do the reverse psychology type of thing (uh) i will tota~ i will melt i will melt and i will just give in [tau]
so i'm the type of person and and she knows this actually she knows this dia pernah bilang dia pernah cakap i think so yes yes it's a lot with ego it's a lot to do with ego i i think so but now it's a it's a better experience [lah] ya and then apa

[ah]

yup yup yup
yes i remember that conversation very very well i remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for s_q punya apa tu (uh) yang yang yang ni apa we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was (uh) the the s_q part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time [kan] so you ask me to apply for s_q punya apa tu (uh) opening [kan] yang yang ala air steward
ya (err) i told you about my eyesight and i also told you about (uh) i didn't know it at whether i'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like [eh] come [lah] just just follow me [lah] you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that i that i remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at in~ dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat northpoint kat #yishun#
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area dekat northpoint dekat mcdonald's and then kat luar and then we were talking about things like illuminati [lah] we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and i still remember that i still remember that convo i still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but i i i i will always remember so
you you you i i know for a fact that you you when i talk to you right (um) the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective [tau] which which means okay macam let's say for example [eh] i you you i like just now i was telling you about you know how i was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me i wouldn't be able to understand [tau] kenapa dia macam gitu
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective (uh) a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so i think (uh) it's quite it's it's something that (uh) there i i would i would (um) and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn [lah]
i am i am i still am actually yes you did yes you did
well i i knew that being a pilot was what i want but i didn't know that i could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what i mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the i mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so (err) and and and it was honestly right my mind [ah] is always a one track thing so let's say for example [kan] aku cakap okay i told myself [ah] i i want to become a pilot but (err) i will only think about okay how do i become a pilot how do i do this how do i do that i i wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe i can become a air steward first then i can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing [lah] so i i don't have that kind of (err) presence of mind [ah] to think that i should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing i'd go the straight out
for me
[oh] right
so so my my life in in this industry [lah] in this aviation industry started out with (um) with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room (uh) on the computer so my dad was the one that i credit for for giving me this passion [lah] because he wanted to become a pilot himself tapi dia punya eyesight (err) macam tak (err) how to say [eh] (uh) not hundred percent [lah] not not not not a six six [lah] vision [lah] so (uh) and at that time [kan] dia orang very strict [kan] kalau kau punya eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance dia lain [ah] [ah] [tau] yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many act~ act~ actually actually you are right sebab tu [eh] they realise [eh] in (err) in (err) eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine i remember this very vividly because i still remember i was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was r_s_a_f which is the air force so dia orang (uh) they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot [tau] who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there i remember man on that day i bought like three copies of the newspaper i cut out all the picture and i pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because i started wearing glasses when i was primary four already ya ya so i was very i have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because dah tak boleh apa because you dah pakai you dah pakai glasses then that's that's it [lah] you you no more already [lah] no more chance right so [ah] so that was what spurt on my motivation (uh) and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when i was in (uh) so after i finished secondary school right i set my sights on the youth flying club so what i did was i join the youth flying club and i managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and i managed to (err) (err) start the flying course [ah] so that time (uh) they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents (uh) fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight macam familiarisation flight [ah] so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out [lah] dekat (err) kita pergi sana then after that apa tu they they brief us and then (err) they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that [lah] this was a very long time ago sekarang dah takde lagi [tau]
sekarang [ah] sekarang is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what i did was i went through the course and when i went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition (uh) even further because i felt you know [ah] bro the very first time i flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight dekat youth flying club [tau] and this was when i was sixteen [lah] when i was up there it was such a different feeling
that i couldn't i i didn't want to land man i didn't want to go back down to earth i wanted to keep flying
[oh] definitely man i will want to fly man i want to have wings man no need i don't need speed man i want to fly as high as possible
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when i landed when my when our plane landed and when i stepped off the plane i couldn't feel my feet [lah] bro i was just floating i was literally just still floating i was on cloud nine i was just i was just you know but that was the thing [lah] that was that was this that told me like okay you know i have to i have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that [lah] ya so i pursued it you know i i kept on pursuing it and i studied all that i could tapi aku i made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that i thought that i needed physics macam science [ah] science punya subject [kan] (err) i i thought that i needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
actually i realise i did not need to have science per se i just needed to understand the concept of flying
(uh) it was a mistake because i took the wrong course when i was in junior college last time [ah] i i'm i'm an arts person i was more of a arts person i should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but i chose science because i thought i needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my (uh) my my my strong point i mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so (uh) puzzled because did cakap apa [tau]
(uh) [eh] i realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics [ah] but your other topics [ah] you rabak man you cannot make it why [ah] then i realise that but it was it was (uh) (uh) only way way way later [lah] then i realise that (uh) okay i i i actually
[ah] no no it was a academic (uh) more of a academic kind of (uh) mistake [lah] (uh) i mean it was a academic (um) how to say [ah] misstep which which i could have my my my (um) my potential was was was higher if i had been in arts but i chose to be in science [ah] which means then after that (err) the after that okay so after that i had another setback
and when i was (uh) just before i enlisted in two thousand five i think two thousand five two thousand six [ah] i had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit [ah] when i was in j_c i had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis [ah] so i had to remove my appendix because (err) it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if i had (err) not (err) what (err) gone to the hospital [lah] (uh) if i've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
ya ya ya it was that bad i was literally aku tak boleh bergerak i was just i i and i still remember that day was my (uh) examination my english paper punya examination e_j_c and (err) i couldn't i couldn't move i had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like i'm bringing you to the hospital right now [ah] okay so what happens is this this this condition after i remove the appendix right
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication (uh) in which this this (uh) operation actually made my stomach lining weak
(uh) because they have to cut they have to cut through [mah] so apparently i think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my (err) my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another [lah] basically so it was first it was an appendix then (uh) it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical [eh] in a medical sector your intestines (uh) usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
(uh) apparently that can be fixed okay (err) and and basically what happens is (uh) if you fix it (uh) generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what i fixed mine two years later
it recurred again ya it recurred again so (uh) that was another dent in my in my in my dreams [lah] basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know aku pergi [ah] s_i_a punya air steward punya interview tu yang aku pass
(err) actually i pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition i failed my medical that's why aku tak aku tak dapat (uh) jadi (err) air steward as well ya so in the end in the end i so you you see how how it all ties up [lah] how it all times ties back together
this this this this (uh) this condition but (um) the good thing was i went for another op so i i fixed i fixed the condition
and (uh) hopefully hopefully [lah] [ah] cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again [lah]
!huh! this year i'm thirty five bro
so i i have already i started flying when i was (uh) in the u_s you remember there was a period of time i don't whether you know or not i was okay so i was in the u_s because i joined the university that is (err) (err) specifically flying related
so (uh) they teach you how to fly and they teach you i mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day (uh) but i was in the u_s and it was this time when i was in the u_s that i actually learn and train and i and i actually got to to fly you know real real flying [lah]
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
i i don't man i had to i had to use for the operation aku pakai ni aku pakai my medisave (uh) my my apa tu orang panggil

ada ada sikit (uh) my mortgage [kan] every month is (uh) one point one k (uh) aku punya (err) they cut off aku punya c_p_f (uh) eight hundred
so aku kena top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future [lah] aku aku aku i was thinking [lah] anyway that [one] is is is always an option i i'm keeping it as an option for me [lah] which is why i wanted a bigger place (uh) the other reason was because aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang [ah] all my baggage my
[eh] i don't mind man i really don't mind kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat it's just beside admiralty m_r_t [jer] also admiralty m_r_t is at woodlands i mean the woodlands area [kan] and (uh) the it's only about macam five minutes
tak tak tak tak it's not it's (uh) it's it's just opposite the m_r_t ya it's opposite the m_r_t it's a residential punya punya place [ah]
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when i was in the u_s correct yes correct i i managed to fly with them (uh) [ah] no no no i was in a i was in a a corporate (uh) site i was actually doing (uh) business business aircraft when i was in the u_s
yes i was there (uh) okay [lah] it was it was (uh) it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is (um) when you are overseas [eh] (err) your how do i put it [eh] you you're considered as an expat [tau] so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration [lah] so that's the reason why (um) most of us [kan] kita belajar kat sana we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to (uh) apply with the local punya okay so right now right now (err) so okay so so right now what happens is this [eh]
i managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
so (uh) average [lah] it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level [lah] i'm not i'm not a macam senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me i'm more like the first officer or second officer type of (uh) about four k about there [lah] about about (uh) thereabouts okay so when covid happened
yes so when covid happened (err) this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad (err) i mean it was just a very bad timing [ah] it was the worst hit industry ever (uh) unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and (uh) they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old [lah] so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again [ah]
to the parts [ah] they get (uh) they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
(uh) some of them they do but most of them for the most part (err) they don't need right they just they juts leave them there [lah] they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but i think i mean who i mean when when they they put it there [ah] nobody wants to (uh) you know [ah] then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this [lah] you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be [lah]
[oh] man they have a lot man i i'll show you pictures of (uh) of the airplane graveyard over in the u_s ya they have they have one in the u_s they have one in australia you know they have a lot [lah] this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and i realise that it was (uh) it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay [lah] so i thought it was (uh) it was a good thing so i thought i i tried it out at that point in time and and i did [lah] and i'm glad i did you know and i'm and i'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right i think yes i already signed kita dah sign contract kita dah sign #dok# we even we even (err) graduated kita semua dah celebrate [seh] we went out drinking i mean
[ah] tak tak tak tak tak i didn't go through the i was supposed to go through yes correct i was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes i know i know i know that was thing so i mean there's there's setbacks [lah] along the way there's you know there's ujian there's setbacks there's (uh)
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
ya i know right macam nasib kentang [kan] macam there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya i know know i've heard of it before [lah] this phrase i know i know
tapi i mean i i've always thought that there is a silver lining [lah] you know in in every ya so aku i i'm i'm i'm still in it you know i'm still in it and i'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct i'm still waiting so i'm hoping that when this covid thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to (uh) goes back on track and all that right (uh) i i'm pretty sure [lah] one day [lah] one day i (uh) you know i i i i have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day i will i'll you know i'll be i'll be able to to do it [lah]
but but for now (uh) i got the next best thing which is (uh) flying drones [lah]
[eh] it's a different skill set [lah] [sia] it's a yes yes correct i know i know i just imagine myself (uh) being on the drone so when i see it i was like [oh] okay ya [lah] but but by by i mean it's it's the best that i can do (uh) (uh) that's relatable and that's (uh) you know but i think (uh) they they have already announced macam plans [lah] you know
(uh) they want to push us to become (uh) flying instructors so ya so so i think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is (uh) back to normal again right (uh) i think you know hopefully [lah] hopefully i won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and i'm like shit now i'm to old aku tak boleh [ah] #dok# flight tak boleh
i will i will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers [eh]

[oh] maybe on top of your table tak ada kot but just now yang table kita ada
it's nice [leh]
later i'll ask them
kau tahu [oh] wait
so (um) kau tahu h_b_l aku [kan]
sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes h_b_l it's like it's either kau buka computer then like
zoom semua kau akan berbual with your cikgu [kan]
tapi aku punya h_b_l [kan] it's like we talk
no we don't talk like we do assignments so we just have like a few questions like less than five
it's like damn fun because it's like
(um) that one whole week right they don't give like
one assignment
on one day it's like
one assignment like five question like monday until wednesday then that's your deadline wednesday night
so one of our question [eh] sometimes cause
okay our h_b_l [kan] like h_b_l intern h_b_l intern [kan]
so like rarely they know
like about us
so one of their question that they ask
was what [ah]
if you can be any kind of colours what will you be
so what is your answer
ya
why
(mm)
can it's up to you but why
white stands for purity okay then
for your inner soul
apa inner soul kau
(mm) ya maybe [ah] a bit of both
okay you kau guess apa aku choose
why blue do i look like a blue
no [oh] my god okay correct answer but aku chose orange
okay cause orange [kan] is like more of sunset it's like most of the basic [eh] the main colour of sunset is orange
ya so i just chose orange [lah] at first i don't know but then
aku cakap like since i like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange [kan] so aku cakap [ah] like (um)
aku chose orange sebab it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me [ah] macam dia can make my soul like very calming
ya so aku macam okay [ah] then end up aku dapat five points
ya
serious
i think whoever work like
on air right stewardess
they enjoy like they can see all those sunset and sunrise [sia]
ya
yup true
i want to be stewardess but then end end up aku pakai hijab so like cannot
actually can
fly emirates
kawan aku [eh] no #huda's# sister yashira dia
ya tapi dia sudah quit sudah
she [oh] cause aku cakap dengan dia like aku nak jadi air stewardess
then she said like go [ah] like try but then aku cakap like
cause i'm using hijab [what] so it's hard
then dia cakap she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after bila touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know macam
you know yo~ like you get what i mean
macam it's so pelik like ya but i really want [sia]
ya that's why tapi macam
the thing is [kan] kalau kau s~ s_i_a [eh]
kalau kau on the way kerja that means kau tak pakai tudung
so i think kalau kau sudah fly #bangkok# or something then
bila kau sudah sampai hotel kau nak keluar balik then kau pakai tudung
so kau imagine kalau like kau punya kawan macam
they say like [eh] just now like i thought you never like you know like people assume [what] [eh] you use tudung you know
it's damn crazy
ya
i don't think i can
like i would rather
have like okay not flexible work but
i don't like that kind of
like macam back to back
schedule
my body like need rest
ya
but kau pergi #bangkok# bila
(mm) aku
i'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now i saw this job search
for temperature screener dia dekat #bukit-batok# hospital
so dia orang cakap it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital tapi tak ada aircon
[kan] pelik dia cakap like note [kan] dia cakap below like for the note they said (um)
tak ada aircon so like whoever dap~ like shortlisted
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area
so pada aku macam hospital apa tak akan tak ada aircon
no [ah] but
i never apply aku just nampak sahaja then aku macam
a~ [lah] aircon tak ada biar like i don't want like i want i need
to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan [lah] at least
that time [kan] aku dapat okay someone i got th~
okay not dapat like they replied to me
so aku tanya like hi is this work still available
then [kan] end up orang itu cakap ya okay still have available
tapi the thing [eh] it's so annoying like dia orang cakap ada available
then dia orang suruh aku send resume but then they don't reply to it
so aku pergi double text like okay i was being annoying tapi aku need a job
and dia orang sudah cakap aku it's available so aku cakap
(um) hi excuse me like so is the job still available aku double text [tau]
then after that
(err) dia cakap hi yes (err) dia cakap hi yes sorry like still have
then dia tanya aku kalau aku boleh kerja
(um) dekat heat tak sebab dia macam open space
s~ so the the open space macam kot you know the security guard guard post
okay so
aku sudah aku cakap okay ya sure like whatever [lah] i just need the money
then end up orang itu cakap
(um) okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
so sudah aku sudah cakap yes i'm okay tapi dia mati-mati macam tanya like
are you sure you're okay so aku macam okay whatever
so aku cakap (mm)
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post [what]
so obviously there's fan
so aku rasa dia annoyed macam bila aku macam tanya like kalau ada aircon ke ada fan then dia tak reply aku [sia]
like how how rude is that like i just want to know if there's aircon [eh]
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan [what]
tak akan whoever kerja sana macam just mati [kan] dengan heat dia
betul
apa
i doubt it will open
ya i miss i miss going there then like talking to the kids even though they are annoying
but i don't miss the managers
sorry [ah] like
[eh] kau tahu aku tak dapat [seh] yang that kids club punya
apa itu
ya that voucher
merepek [seh]
what if what if all of aku punya

i mean it depends sebab [kan]
b_m_t (um) most of the time is quite lepak

(err) sarah said it's obvious [lah] and then i was like what do you mean it's obvious
then she said (um) most most of the time if you go out with your friends you will say the name
but then today you just said yo~ you going out then i was like !huh!
sometimes aku tak bilang apa like aku aku tak bagi nama
so aku macam okay whatever [lah] aku malas nak fikir
so aku sudah mak aku asyik call like around twelve like macam pukul berapa nak balik pukul berapa nak balik
so after that aku sudah sampai rumah like around twelve fifteen then mak aku asyik call then aku bingit
then aku saat masuk rumah aku cakap [ah] relax [lah] like it's only

then after that mak aku macam ya [lah] nak call dia sekarang
then [ah] then aku macam okay [ah] whatever then aku bilang sarah like
what's mama's problem [lah] what like why she keeps on calling us like
she said curfew at one so why are you like bothering us around twelve
ya aku #sot# but then i think it was like my tone
bila aku balik rumah then because it was so annoying so after that saat (um)
after like five minutes or ten minutes later aisha balik
then aisha pergi masuk bilik dulu [ah] so aku kat luar so obviously aisha macam nak gossip gossip
(um) dia pergi bilang sarah
cakap (um) pasal mariam [ah] (um) mama cakap mariam biadap
itu pasal aku kena balik siang then sarah cakap
(err) apa yang kau merepek [eh] like curfew memang pukul satu apa yang kau nak salahkan mariam
which is true [ah] like apasal kau macam
cakap [oh] it's #mariam# fault now i have to go home
padahal just because i was rude like macam kau tahu curfew pukul satu like
kau fikir kau special sangat like you know macam boleh balik like any time
like mak aku tak cakap apa-apa pun mak aku just text dia cakap pukul berapa nak balik then mak aku cakap (err) adik beradik kau sudah ikut kau
(err) sudah biadap balik lambat semua then itu pasal aisha nak kena balik
so but then #aisha# was like blaming me then aku macam like
dude like our curfew is at one
but then you act as it you are the sp~ sp~ (err) special child you know like
(mm)
cakap apa
[oh] ya then mak aku cakap tak [lah] like (err) #aisha# [kan]
macam okay so #aisha's# friend right is like macam
like mix of both so like there's bad and good [lah]
so aisha cakap like (um) [eh] mak aku cakap aisha punya kawan
(um) macam family tak ada family support that kind
so kita macam [oh] okay [lah] then mak aku cakap dengan aku (err) so yam kalau awak nak cari
kawan make sure yang baik-baik semua then after that mak aku cakap
so awak (err) #zeko# dia sudah bayar yang duit government
so aku dengan sarah macam tengok each other kita macam
like how you know then kita tanya mak aku [ah] how mama know
then she said ada [lah] mama ada spy
so aku sudah #sot# like i was damn pissed off [lah] i was like
like it's #zeko's# story but then how come #zeko#
told #aisha# then end up like mama know you know
ya then after that at first aku sudah bilang sarah aku cakap [oh] #zeko# kena bayar balik that five hundred
then after that sarah macam [oh] okay then after that out of nowhere mak aku tahu
then (um) dia cakap [ah] confirm aisha bilang
then mak aku cakap tak [lah] (um) mama tahu [jer] gitu like mama dengar so aku macam
!huh! okay then i was so pissed
so i went to expose one of #aisha's# secret [lah]
then after i exposed then after that (err) my mum was like
(uh huh) padan muka dia like [kan] mama punya mulut sudah (err) masam [eh] masin
masin ke masam
(mm) [ah] [kan] mama punya mulut masin like i already told her to not balik lambat or like
illegal gathering [lah] then i was like okay whatever
then bila aku sudah keluar semua (err) #aisha# texted me she said
(err) #mariam# did you tell mama that
(err) i kena fined blah blah blah then i was like
(um) !huh! no [lah] mama [kan] ada spy you ask her [lah]
then she was like (err) #mizi# told me
that you told mama about it then aku cakap (um)
tak ba~ then aku macam aku cakap tak bagus fitnah like anyhow only aku cakap gitu then dia cakap whatever [lah]
so apparently she go text #aisha# [eh] she go text sarah she said
(um) apasal like mariam nak kena expose aku like
why must she tarnish my name by saving her boyfriend's name
habis sarah pergi reply dia cakap
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
then after that aisha cakap [ah] like (um) like i don't know she was just like saving her own ass
then after that betul [pe] like story itu is #zeko's# story tapi apasal kau pergi bilang mama
habis sarah cakap kau fikir mariam nak sit back
(err) habis like just see like you talking about the boyfriend's name to mama like you know
then #aisha# say [oh] gitu then aku macam
like you get what mean macam i'm not saving anyone's ass but it's just that
it's just #zeko's# ranting to you then end up you have to tell mama about it
and and one thing i don't like about #aisha# [kan] dia macam
how to say [ah] like she always talks about her friend's problem but then she don't talk about her problem
like one time she macam she balik the she said (um)
apa tu [oh] she went out to eat with #haziq# like one of her friends [ah] yang pernah suka dia
then after dia cakap [oh] haziq sekarang bawa motor ini ini ini then dia cakap tapi dia nak tukar like kau tahu macam
like mama don't care like who asked like no one asked about like you just tak ada topic and talked about it you know
like pada aku macam !huh! tak ada orang tak ada orang start topic pun like pasal ini like who asked
then (err) satu kali [oh] tadi aku gaduh dengan aisha
she
tadi i mean through text [lah]
she go use my c~ c_d_g
then the tempat
apa [eh]
the tempat the kau tahu yang shoelace habis tempat (um) atas ni kalau
converse [kan] nanti kalau flip that thingy nanti ada yang the converse punya name [kan]
ya so she put like that so aku nampak
then okay first dia tak tanya aku permission [tau]
like
dia tak tanya aku permission untuk pakai kasut itu like out of nowhere aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak
then after that aku text dia aku cakap one more time if i see my shoes like this
i will throw your nike inside the water
sebab dia punya nike [kan] she's very protective of it
so aku macam okay like i understand like i won't use it because it's mahal
then after that (err) dia cakap
(err) dia cakap i was airing it [lah] habis dia cakap
dia pergi bilang kat sarah dia cakap why #mariam# so rude then pada aku macam it's basic [what] it's kasut birthday aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau [ah]
habis after dia cakap dengan aku (err) okay [lah] so from now
(err) you just use your own stuff i use mine like stop bothering me so pada aku macam
the least you can say is sorry [what] like at least aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap sarah like
(um) aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta permission like bag dia kenapa macam aku sudah make it aku sudah minta kau permission it's just that kau macam tak acknowledge it you know
then aku macam [ah] whatever [lah] then (err) dia cakap dengan sarah i want to buy c_d_g shoes so like
(err) #mariam# don't have to like nag then aku macam i won't nag if you don't
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right i washed it
then out of no where suddenly the next day dia pakai then ada kotor lagi like do you know how pissed i was like
aku baru cuci like sudah bersih habis like kau pergi pakai
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use [lah] but then end up kau nak pakai aku punya c_d_g yang
dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang a~ [lah] aku boleh beli habis pergi [lah] beli like you know macam it's so annoying like
(err)
annoying satu kali itu yang like these few days like we've been like macam
(um) how to say [ah] like macam
!huh!
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
ya like macam these past few days [ah] like me and #aisha# we have like this tension then sa~ sarah satu kali
(oo) i sense tension then aku macam [ha] [lah] kau just stop
cause
i i won't say it's okay [ah] but
i don't know [lah] i mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay [lor] but
i doubt she will stick to that
confirm nanti balik [kan] dia akan cakap aku (err) pergi buka beg sekolah aku cause that time i use her timbuk~ bag
confirm [one] then
but then aku still haven't use her nike shoes so now i'm just trying to find like
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right i will ask permission but then for her right she won't
she won't ask permission for her macam [oh] kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur so like aku sudah tanya sudah
macam what what common sense is that like i don't get it
no
aku penat [sia] rant pasal dia
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and #aisha# our shoe size is not that
far [lah] it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just terjauh
tapi that time aku pakai kasut
(um) merry [eh] kasut apa tu doctor mart
aku just tak boleh fit aku boleh fit but it's so ketat like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok [tau] dia pakai macam just
like comfortable
ya tapi sarah punya is not my size so bila aku pakai it's like extra ketat and like pain
but then kalau aku lose the macam the strap dekat belakang [kan] then when i walk it's more uncomfortable cause my kaki will ternaik
you get what i mean
that's why so like i was thinking if i should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
aku macam
malas nak go through [ah] the blister blister
aku punya kasut yang doctor mart yang high cut dulu itu [kan] tapi dia #swee# #swee# [jer] [seh]
[a'ah] macam since
dulu bila aku pakai like okay dia macam
#swee# #swee# tapi like there's a little bit of space tapi sekarang sudah #swee# #swee# so like
aku cannot use thick socks i have to use like
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so i really don't know like sarah can use [lah] but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
i mean i have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then
aku just tak nak like kaki aku blister
like no thanks later will ruin all the fun because i will complain about my blister and all
berapa banyak doc mart [ah] kau ada
ya
one okay i saw two of it what's the another one
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay okay
[ah] but you rarely use that now
no you can just use it anywhere like go lot
b_p hillion
don't lie sometimes your simple is like aku pakai lepak then end up macam dressed up don't lie don't lie i know you
macam rare occasion
aku pun
okay now
i just need to find high waisted white
[oh] if i take one of your high waisted i can use to match my flower baju
the ones that you always use the high waisted yang flair
yang macam boyfriend's jeans but then that one is the high waisted one
white white
you have right
ya i think that one can match my baju because
okay i have to bring that baju to you sebab dia kat bawah sh~ (um) tali [tau]
so kalau aku pakai [kan] kalau aku pakai like normal jeans kalau aku naikkan tangan aku dia akan ternaik
that's why i need something that is like secured to
(err) [ah] ye~ ya i think so i think so
ya dia bukan skinny dia (um) flare yang macam boyfriend's jeans kind
you know right
ya because that baju since that time [seh] my mum buy but then i haven't use yet cause i cannot find like the correct
(um)
bottom
i can use this bottom the one that i'm using now but then
what
(err) ya
yes
(mm) (mm)
then
okay
(mm) (mm)
!huh!
see what
!huh!
what what hole
nonsense [lah] that guy
so what are you going to stop wearing it no right
no wait i'm thinking what hole can see
lol but you you are using inner [what]
nonsense [lah] this guy
ya but then now luckily he isn't like luckily
!wow!
but then kau tahu aku perasan [kan] like macam
being with someone like so long macam until like they say like
[eh] baju you boleh nampak dalam [kan] baju you boleh nampak dalam [kan]
sekarang bila aku check baju [kan] aku really see macam
[a'ah] [lah] like really can nampak like okay dulu kalau aku nampak macam singlet [kan]
okay even though aku pakai singlet tapi boleh nampak the singlet punya shape [kan]
okay dulu aku macam okay whatever like just use it but then sekarang aku macam
no don't want macam aku feel macam no [lah] orang like kau tahu sun [ah] kalau sunlight [kan] nampak obvious [kan] then aku macam tak apa [ah] like
boleh nampak [sia] like (um) inner aku like singlet like lagi macam memalukan
ni sekarang like he don't even have to say anything about it aku macam automatic [sia]
cause i think that i'm thin~ ya i'm so used to it
tapi sekarang macam kalau aku pakai button then kalau button itu punya macam you know sometimes the button like too s~
(err) macam how to say [ah] like very far from each other so like
can see the dalam [kan]
sometimes sekarang aku macam even though aku malas nak pakai
like singlet aku akan just pakai (err) what [ah] what's that
the sports bra tapi yang sports bra loose so bila aku pakai at least dia tutup yang kat atas
cause one one time [kan] aku punya button [kan] dia
dia very far and aku tak perasan then boleh nampak [sia] kat aku punya dalam
just hal then aku have to change like my hijab
style so like can cover the in front

[kan] it's like (err) it's okay
who what
ya honesty [ah] ya i know
(mm) (mm)
but then
it's not hard if he doesn't have strict parents
it's true because if you don't have strict parents right like your parents don't care like if you've matair
ya but then kau
i mean if he don't mind like okay like if he have motor or car right and he can just travel like anytime anywhere
i don't think it's a problem but the thing is now is like
the problem is about kau orang kau orang punya time and like macam parents dia pun quite strict
about matair
if tak strict aku rasa most of the time dia sudah ajak kau sudah datang like

kau pakai a full body suit habis kau punya head mask thingy macam kepala besar gila babak
ya
no no no it's not face shield it's like kau tahu cartoon characters kalau dia orang nak jumpa budak-budak
then dia orang akan pakai like this costume
[ah] [eh] benda ni boleh letak kepala kau [seh]
aku nak cuba tapi tak nak [ah] kotor kot
okay kita tinggal like twenty minutes left i i don't know ten
[eh] five
really [oh] [ah]
(mm) okay wait now we have to think about our food
okay
(hmm)
no
no i mean like
if that okay pros about there's no cars right the traffic won't be like
congested
then like the air pollutant won't be like so bad
ya !duh!
but the thing is [kan]
kalau kau tak ada car how are you supposed to travel like there's going to be a lot of people in the m_r_t you know
and no i can't do that like
okay how about there's no cars but there's only motors
[eh] cool [sia] kau kau ada think kau
okay wait or right okay kalau tak ada motor atau car
kita travel by air
[eh] cool gila [sia] !huh!
kau pada dulu [sia] kau nak bungee jump
aku nak [eh] apa yang benda yang kau is it water dip
yang kau masuk dalam air tapi kau bogel
[ah] skinny dip
[kan] no [kan] you pernah buat [kan]
itu gila babi [sia] no you know i was like thinking okay cause i am dulu kat wattpad
you know the wattpad
they always talk about when they go beach then sometimes they try this skinny dip then aku macam apa [sia] skinny dipping
then aku pergi check then aku check google aku macam what is skinny dipping
then dia orang tunjuk the results then aku macam ya allah mata go where
ya ya
ya but i thought #sentosa# don't have all these kind
(hmm)
ya but some people do that without like
you know being feared of it
same but i don't really like the beach it's so hot
i mean
that's the purpose of it [lah] to go beach getting tan
okay bila bila kau nak esok
okay boleh
apa-apa [jer] imagine kita kaya gila [eh] !wow!
okay boleh bila kau nak
kau imagine [eh] !wow! i i can't imagine like myself being rich
i mean i can be rich like by working hard
but then like kau imagine macam you grow up being rich
like you grow up with like a mansion like you don't have to worry about anything
it's so it's so fun
okay aku tanya kau [eh] what's one topic right
kau don't want to talk about
like macam sarah right and her kawan like macam one topic her kawan macam don't like to talk about is like macam sex
ya but then aku tengah terfikir like kawan aku okay kawan aku aqilah [kan]
she don't like to talk about money
ya macam okay example like macam okay kawan aku tanya aku [oh] bank engkau berapa like aku cakap [oh] nine dollar
macam you know macam it's so flow and easy tapi for aqilah macam kira dia macam berapa [sia] bank engkau like we want check like
cause kita semua tak nak keluarkan duit then for #aqilah# [kan] kita semua diri dekat tepi dia then dia pergi cover [tau] dia punya account
dia punya that screen then kita macam berapa [seh] kau ada berapa [seh] kau ada then aqilah cakap tak ada [lah] like nothing like not much
cause but i think confirm a lot cause she work as bond
like after her poly then she will work like this company [ah] then they will pay her eight hundred
eight hundred every month like ever since she started her bond so macam i think two years already her bond like
sudah ongoing
so macam confirm a lot then lagi her parents bagi dia like duit allowance
then ya that's one thing [ah] that i realized for #aqilah# she don't like talk about money
but then for my oth~ like #syara# and #shak#
itu aku tak sure
[oh] aku rasa shak tak suka berbual pasal
like
sex [ah]
[ah] aku rasa shak tak suka
ya i think
