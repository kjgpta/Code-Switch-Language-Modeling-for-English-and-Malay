alright
alright #mahirah#
yo hi alright it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
[ha] <malay>nampak</malay>
beauty in everyone okay this is a
topic <malay>ni berat</malay> [eh] topic <malay>ni</malay> is very this topic is <malay>orang kata</malay> very wide <malay>dia punya</malay> spectrum is very wide that means we can talk about a lot of stuff doesn't need to be just beauty in terms of appearance <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in terms of everything not just
(uh) look wise <malay>tapi</malay> beauty in (uh) nature beauty in personality beauty in
there's a lot this topic is <malay>memang kita boleh</malay> counter bad or good we can counter about this so it's a really good topic I would say for the first
(uh) time <malay>kita berbual</malay>
so okay <malay>kita</malay> start <malay>gini</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>kita</malay> start with the first one is
what is the definition of beauty to you okay <malay>kau</malay> start <malay>dulu apa kau punya</malay> definition of beauty <malay>pada kau</malay>
yes
okay
[oh] that would <malay>tu bagus tu</malay> yes that is <malay>bagus</malay> (err) <malay>bagus</malay>
for me
for me okay <malay>ak~ aku</malay>
I don't see myself as <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> victoria's secret <malay>punya</malay> type <malay>punya ke lawa memang tak</malay> [lah] <malay>memang</malay> not even near that [lah] but because I have my insec~ inse~ insecurities (um) based on appearance <malay>juga</malay> which <malay>itu pun</malay> is another topic [eh] <malay>kau pun tahu kita kau pun tahu</malay> about me about
but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
which people in our society is blinded by that <malay>sebab</malay>
standard <malay>kalau kau lawa orang pandang kau</malay> people will look at you and then they say but that doesn't mean that your personality is good that doesn't mean that your attitude is good so that is what
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
<malay>tapi</malay> for me beauty <malay>kalau kau lawa pun mana pun</malay> but if your attitude is <malay>macam gitu</malay> then
then <malay>memang</malay> you know what I mean
<malay>memang kit~ tak boleh dianggapkan</malay> as beauty overall and it this is our perspective <malay>ramai orang ada</malay> different <malay>punya</malay> perspective but we're gon~ we're not gonna touch on that but d~ we can just (uh) it's between the both of us what is our definition
<malay>boleh</malay>
beauty in a long term !woo!
(mmhmm)
true
ya
in the youth ya true
so se~
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
[oh] okay for me my <malay>kawan</malay> the friends that I go like the friends that I <malay>cari atau dapat</malay> it's okay we can talk about poly ya <malay>kita punya</malay> poly days is <malay>kita tak</malay> I don't see like [oh] <malay>kau lawa</malay> I'm gonna be friends with you no no I woul~ never <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kau lawa</malay> I was going to say you no no I never <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean I don't know for me <malay>memang</malay> I don't see
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather not
go towards that <malay>sebab</malay> it's not gonna be a genuine <malay>punya</malay> relationship you know
<malay>sebab</malay> it's just gonna be
for clout <malay>macam</malay> you know some people (uh) there is some (uh) cliques <malay>ke apa</malay> whatever in school <malay>yang macam</malay> okay <malay>sebab kau lawa kau</malay> popular I'm gonna to go to you because
I'm gonna get that popularity I'm gonna get that fame <malay>dia ada</malay> attention so I think is there a generation that can is there a genuine relationship that can last you know
which is <malay>memang</malay> may~ maybe not because during after <malay>kalau</malay> your school is done then that's it will you ever meet the person <malay>yang macam</malay> will you know the how deep the relationship goes how deep the friendship goes
<malay>macam</malay> for me and you [eh] <malay>macam</malay> this is <malay>kita pun semalam baru jumpa</malay> [eh] we just met yesterday with our friends and that is like <malay>kita punya</malay> relationship first <malay>kita</malay> start from sec one
and until now it last <malay>ramai</malay> of my other friends <malay>macam kita dah macam</malay> you know after that <malay>macam dah</malay> start to <malay>putik putus</malay> but with you and (err) (err) our friends yest~ yesterday it is a long lasting <malay>macam kita tak</malay> awkward [tau] and that is something that I see down the road we are still gonna be friends forever #inshaallah#
because there's the because we don't see beauty we don't see
you know we are all beautifully in our own ways but what I see in friendship is that the how we treat each other you know <malay>kita punya</malay> chemistry <malay>kita punya</malay> behaviour
<malay>kita punya</malay> personality because okay imagine <malay>kalau</malay> the reason why we are both still friends is because our personality towards each other is that we care we are genuine <malay>kita takde macam makan orang</malay> you know what I mean like betray or
or jealousy no that it is really a general rela~ relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
<malay>tak payah cari</malay> beauty for clout or fame because it won't bring you any <malay>betul tak tu</malay>
<malay>apa kau rasa</malay>
<malay>cerita sikit</malay>
(mm)
go towards the beauty or
[oh] damn
(mm)
(mmhmm)
like fashion wise you know is it [oh] damn okay I think I get what you mean some~ my course <malay>pun ada juga yang</malay> those type of cliques that
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are (um)
(uh) handsome (uh) <malay>lelaki kat dalam</malay> my course <malay>yang baik yang</malay> humble <malay>yang tahu yang dia orang tak</malay> stuck up but there are also cannot deny that there are also (um)
(uh) girls that they <malay>dia orang punya dia orang macam</malay> you know they have that beauty standard [lah] <malay>dia orang ada</malay> that
fashion wise in terms of beauty wise and they are not they are <malay>sombong</malay> they are arrogant you know
so <malay>macam</malay> it's a
I don't know (err) <malay>macam</malay> for me that's not the right I mean okay but it's hard you know cause you know they say <malay>kalau kau lawa</malay> you should then (uh) take advantage of it like you know you should your personality <malay>pun kena bagus</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> but people who are <malay>lawa</malay> usually you know <malay>dia orang</malay> I'm not going to say all but
most of them gonna <malay>ada</malay> that ego you know that ego that it depends [lah] how you are brought up you know
which is (um) it's not really a good thing
but it's up to them [lah]
ya very subjective
(mm)
true but overall selecting friends with (uh) with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not (uh) it's not the right way to do [lah] I would say
so ya it's not
not just that [lah] beauty in terms of you know right k~ (uh) now we are all going to that stage of working [kan] it's always <malay>kalau</malay> it's always <malay>macam</malay> you see this (um)
if there's a competition you know what I mean
not just competition but <malay>macam</malay> okay if you are pretty then you might get that job have you heard about this I had experienced that <malay>macam sebab</malay> this person is sexy <malay>ke apa ada</malay> landed job
what do you think about that is that a good thing or
I mean that is for us <malay>yang mungkin macam</malay> of a lower standard
it's not it's unfair [what] because you should pick someone of (uh) of ta~ of talent of skills instead of beauty
(mm)
[oh] yes
pay plays an important role e~
(mm)
design
F&B
social service ya
true
<malay>betul asalkan orang tu baik kita dah kita bersyukur</malay> [eh] I mean like as long as the person is good then by all means go ahead you know
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) beauty in appearance or beauty in mindset like personality wise would is that (uh)
this we can say about our <malay>macam</malay> okay in the future <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak cari</malay> (um)
a partner in life your (uh)
wh~ is beauty important <malay>macam</malay> appearance wise or the best is <malay>macam</malay> mindset or the opportunity of behaviour what do you think about this
(uh huh)
that is true of course first app~ ya you will see the appearance [one] or not
ya <malay>tu memang</malay>
<malay>ad~ ada yang suka</malay> cute <malay>ada yang suka macam</malay> E-boy
true true
(uh) no (err) not the first (uh) judgement because first judgement <malay>memang</malay> is just gonna be appearance and a bit of hi and hello but (uh) overall <malay>macam</malay> to find that the quality wise for a future partner
me too
I think
okay <malay>kau</malay> okay <malay>kau</malay> share <malay>kau</malay> share <malay>dulu</malay> cause <malay>ni pun</malay> (uh) is an interesting fact
for me right I got a
okay I will share you later you share first
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
what's the point [kan]
true I mean for me I think that is considered beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay some people say intelligence is beauty
intelligence is beautiful so actually appearance is no~ is nothing <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] first judgement yes appearance <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] peop~ people say kindness is beautiful to me int~ intelligence is beautiful to me or <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> the act of (uh) sharing <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) car~ caring the your you <malay>punya</malay> personality that is beautiful so
<malay>macam</malay> I think beauty [eh] is
is again subjective <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>ada orang</malay> [eh] they say <malay>macam asalkan kau kemas</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kau</malay> (err) you are clean you clean yourself <malay>macam</malay> it <malay>macam bukanlah</malay> you yo~ I'm asking you <malay>macam pergi</malay> plastic surgery to be beautiful no I think ya as long as you your the cleanliness of your the state
(uh) I'm not gonna talk about myself (err)
but overall <malay>macam</malay> the of how you take care of yourself <malay>macam</malay> for the <malay>macam kita</malay> how we like its like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we <malay>kita basuh muka</malay> something like that you know
things like that this little things that will build up (um)
the sense of beauty <malay>sebab</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> beauty [eh] is again <malay>macam</malay> very it can be very (um)
stressful for some people
<malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> trying to fit in inside the society that you are in you know what I mean
you know (uh) I got this <malay>macam</malay> experience <malay>kalau</malay> we talk with our friends <malay>ke apa</malay> we always like <malay>ada juga</malay> topic <malay>yang macam ini maknanya macam</malay> anxiety of being in a crowd of (uh) people
(uh) again it's about slo~ un~ (um) <malay>macam</malay> low self esteem you know <malay>kau ada</malay> face <malay>gitu tak aku ada</malay> I have low self esteem you know cause I do have insecurities that <malay>macam</malay> to me I find that
it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
<malay>macam kau</malay> do you have any like (um)
insecurities <malay>ataupun macam</malay> low self esteem towards this kind of (uh) topic
I <malay>pun sama</malay>
handsome
<malay>sama sama</malay> for me <malay>sama</malay> (err) like I think
<malay>susah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
unless <malay>kita kes yang macam</malay> our confidence level is very high ya but of course
<malay>terdetik</malay> [lah] <malay>kat dalam hati tu mesti ada yang setitik yang</malay> very <malay>kita rasa macam</malay> [eh] !alamak! you know what I mean
ya
I came across this one (uh) (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) it's a meme [lah] the it's a kid the kid says <malay>macam</malay> the kid was saying (uh) <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> to god [tau] god (uh)
if (uh) can you make me (uh) beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
okay but I think <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
for me <malay>pun ad~</malay> times <malay>yang</malay> I would say to myself like
if I'm not smart then at least make me beautiful [lah] you know which is a wrong mindset <malay>sebab</malay> that means [eh]
I'm okay this to me towards me I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
[oh] that means when if I'm pre~ beauty
if I'm (uh) pretty I will get somewhere I would get (uh) at least a modelling job <malay>ke apa</malay> you know at least I have something <malay>tapi</malay>
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
<malay>tapi sap~</malay> okay <malay>siapa tak nak lawa</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa tak nak</malay> handsome <malay>buat apa dalam dunia ni</malay>
who doesn't
but as long as the person is
(um) <malay>tadi nak tanya seribu</malay> question <malay>boleh</malay>
yes
yes
[oh] !wow!
girls or boys
I think [kan] for me okay <malay>kita perempuan</malay> [kan] but I think (um) generally speaking [kan] I think it's the girls is it but not me [lah]
subjective but I think [kan] it's more towards the girls <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we have like boys and girls is different [what] <malay>kita punya</malay> how we hangout how we
ag~ again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
<malay>pergi</malay> towards that
that <malay>apa tu tujuan</malay> like okay I'm gonna find this kind of clique
but
to you <malay>apa</malay> to you which one for you
ya
physic~ really physic~
practical
(mm)
ya <malay>macam</malay> in terms of gossiping also [lah] you can say that <malay>dia orang macam</malay> more towards okay maybe gaming or like
some other stuff which <malay>macam</malay> for girls maybe some of them will talk about [eh] look at that I mean [eh] <malay>macam</malay> [eh] yo~ have you heard this about I heard about <malay>macam</malay> some of my friends (uh) classmate <malay>dia macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok tu</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok dia ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tengok</malay> you know they we they are always <malay>macam</malay>
you can say (err) comparing [eh] comparing
(uh) judgy but
that's kind of the topic <malay>yang</malay>
for you know me and you <malay>kita tak kita</malay> we don't go to that because we have other better topics to talk about
but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then (uh) (uh) most likely is the
<malay>kaum wanita</malay> [lah] it's always <malay>kaum wanita</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> ya but (uh) (uh) (um) to mention <malay>macam orang yang tak lawa</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> but it's <malay>kini</malay> it's how society <malay>pandang</malay> you know what I mean
maybe okay maybe we can talk about society you know <malay>sebab</malay> this is how society looks <malay>sebab</malay> to be honest who started this thing called <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) okay (uh) <malay>kau tak lawa kau tak boleh kawan dengan kita atau</malay> if you're not handsome or if you are like this (uh) or if you're
this of this race or something then you cannot be cannot join inside this society who started this thing <malay>mesti ada dulu</malay> maybe in history <malay>ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang macam</malay>
okay <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>macam ni</malay> I you see it all started it's not it's nothing to do with (um) you can say <malay>ni lumrah manusia</malay> [tau] you know <malay>kau tahu benda ni macam</malay> this human standard the world doesn't do this [tau] it's us the humans that
that did this kind of thing that it makes it into a problem actually <malay>kalau</malay> we all treat people the equally (uh) got nothing to do with beauty there maybe
there will be a lesser percentage of people having (uh) insec~ insecurities there will be lesser percentage of people being low of low self esteem <malay>sebab</malay> it's how which society you are if you are in singapore okay but then
<malay>macam</malay> okay I'm not gonna I'm not <malay>sebab</malay> you get it's subjective it depends some <malay>ada</malay> some parts of the world <malay>takde macam gini</malay> but some parts some of the world
especially in two thousand twenty
that is very <malay>macam sebab</malay> it's all about the fashion it's all about the vibe that is very concerning [what] that's why <malay>ramai orang macam ada yang</malay> every article is that people suicide you know
youth suicide because due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
<malay>tak payah cakap pasal</malay> you <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] it can be because maybe <malay>sebab</malay> (uh) you are having this disabilities which I very pity this for people because how could you judge them how could you bully this kind of people I mean they got they never do anything to you [what] <malay>betul</malay> [what] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dia orang tak kacau kau apa</malay> or like they judge you base on your (uh) clothing <malay>ke</malay> based on your I'm not gonna say about appearance but maybe we can (uh) about also <malay>macam</malay> status
hierarchy system <malay>macam kaya</malay> and poor
this kind of thing is what
it's all <malay>lum~ lumrah manusia</malay> it's all (uh) human standards
which I think is
is <malay>tak berapa bagus</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
not just beauty [tau] <malay>macam pasal</malay> poor and rich <malay>pun boleh jadi</malay> problem you know because of that people get bullied people got outcast people I've seen (uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kat sekolah kita nampak</malay> [kan] <malay>macam budak ada yang kena</malay> outcast [kan] you know what I mean
this one is this kind of thing [lah] that is bad for
it but it goes with the era you know what I mean
[oh] dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
functional [eh]
[oh] ya
that <malay>macam</malay> (uh) the economy won't go if there isn't any hierarchy you know what I mean
ya comp~ competition (err) competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
that is true that is true dysfunctional something okay you got to search for that (uh) after this dysfunction but I tell you a bit <malay>macam betul</malay> [lah] like
there will be a president there will be (uh) our manager there will be our the boss
<malay>takkan semua sama</malay> right <malay>pekerja</malay> then if like that some people also don't want to do work [what] because
there won't be any leaders that to lead
true so <malay>memang ini</malay>
<malay>lum~ lumrah</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>memang</malay> it's the world [lah] it's just it evolve like this [lah] to be honest <malay>mesti</malay> there is gonna be (uh) plus minus there plus minus <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam kau tahu</malay> okay (uh) <malay>dunia hiburan</malay>
about okay (uh) western world <malay>atau</malay> K pop [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for example that kind of thing
usually <malay>yang lawa</malay> [jer] <malay>pun yang disanjung</malay> <malay>disanjung</malay>
usually it's gonna be the pret~ the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's gonna be (uh)
[eh] actually no I think it just involve in the korean <malay>punya</malay>
the K pop world you know what I mean <malay>sebab</malay> in western world we don't look at beauty [what] we judge based on (uh) music wise <malay>kalau kita suka macam</malay> for example like
(uh) there are (uh) idols <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> okay (uh) like
<malay>tak</malay> I think <malay>macam</malay> it's different <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> compare we cannot compare like western <malay>punya</malay> industry like the hollywood and also K pop <malay>sebab</malay> K pop I it's always gonna be the most handsome idol <malay>atau</malay> the most prettiest idol that's gonna get that fame
<malay>yang lain semua</malay> you know especially when you're in a group of (uh) like ch~ of <malay>kau pernah</malay> (uh) come across this article <malay>tak dia macam</malay> there's this one idol <malay>dia punya</malay> member <malay>tak berapa lawa</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
to me it's fine [lah] but it's <malay>ada sikit macam</malay> different <malay>daripada ada lain lagi lawa</malay> then all the <malay>macam</malay> the paparazzi right would is taking the photo of that person at the side where the other member that is <malay>tak</malay> not of a pretty <malay>tapi</malay> is in the middle
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
so I think that is also <malay>rabak</malay> [lah] to be honest
[oh] my god like
[ah] <malay>memilih kasih padahal sama</malay> group [tau] <malay>padahal</malay> they are in the same group
to me I think music or acting is just okay acting is a different thing but music wise if the music is good then go ahead [lah] like why <malay>sanjung</malay> (uh) idols that are very pretty or handsome when you don't even know them no you don't know what
their personality whether they are they good people <malay>sebab ada</malay> [jer] <malay>yang</malay> news turns out that [oh] this idol did this it's a bad thing but then the fans <malay>tak boleh percaya tu</malay> the fans doesn't (uh)
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
yes you said it <malay>betul apa</malay>
(uh) same like macam
<malay>macam</malay> you have to move on because you know this idol doesn't know you
you wish <malay>tapi</malay> okay but see this is how beauty
see this is the bad side the not bad side (err) but the the negative side about
beauty [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
the look at the people will just support this (uh) this the group of
based on their
(uh) sexiness <malay>ke</malay> based on their face <malay>ke</malay> or whatever then it's gonna go towards (uh) bad <malay>punya</malay>
okay not I'm not just talking about the K pop there I'm just talking I'm talking about okay perspective as (uh) the <malay>macam</malay> those fans <malay>yang sanjung sangat</malay> [kan] it's not (uh) it's not a good habit for them [what] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> right when things doesn't go their way then they are not inside the reality world you know they maybe can start to like <malay>macam</malay> harm or they can start to like threaten which is not a good thing correct or not
so that is the negative side [lah] about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can everybody can achieve success
<malay>macam kau tak payah ada</malay> beauty then you that doesn't mean that you cannot achieve success you know I mean
<malay>tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> (um) o~ oprah winfrey you know she's not like the <malay>lawa</malay> the most beautiful whatever right but she got that kindness in her she got that skills she got that (uh) hosting <malay>punya</malay> and she can be successful you know what I mean
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way [lah] but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
<malay>yang benda apa tu yang benda</malay>
<malay>yang benda</malay> (uh) success
(mmhmm)
true
it also goes with <malay>macam</malay> top (uh) fashion wise you know what I mean
<malay>macam kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu</malay> (uh) okay <malay>zaman sekarang</malay> right you know if you were to just wear like (uh) sloppy
<malay>macam</malay> T-shirt and cause that's what I do sometimes you know but and then <malay>kita pergi kedai mamak</malay> something like that right
<malay>kedai</malay> (uh) #kopitiam# or something like that people might like
nowadays people might think <malay>macam</malay> they will look at us like [eh] <malay>dia ni biar betul</malay> you know what I mean like
like are you seriously going to wear that you know and that's it that's where <malay>kita</malay> I'm gonna feel <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) it's okay (err) but like [eh] like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
<malay>tapi</malay> get it's it's how era goes you know <malay>sebab zaman dulu</malay> imagine if okay right now this is the beauty standard is like this right <malay>dulu</malay> time maybe like early two thousand
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example [eh] and then you call you wear (uh)
a dress with heels to a #kopitiam# people will look at you <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you <malay>biar betul</malay>
<malay>lain macam</malay> but right now if you were to do that maybe people will like
(uh) think <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau lawa macam</malay> it's fine
so see how this (uh) the era <malay>macam</malay> how (uh) move [eh] you know what I mean
<malay>lain</malay> [eh] which is weird [eh] <malay>macam kadang-kadang macam bila kita fikir</malay> !wah!
as time goes by
as technology becomes more <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) better and more (uh)
<malay>orang kata apa lagi gempak</malay> then
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay (um)
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(mm)
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
!wow! okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it (mm)
true
[oh] yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean (um) ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> no no no I'm not talking about you as in <malay>macam</malay> those people who are who dress like hipsters they are not hipsters <malay>dia orang nak</malay> step [jer] <malay>macam</malay> they just follow the trend you know what I mean
just to ya just to fit in ya that's the word
I think saturated
I think there is like <malay>macam</malay> photos trend I guess <malay>kita</malay> use simpler simp~ (uh) simpler terms [eh]
I would say today this
(uh) of (uh) twenty of the twenty first century
as you know <malay>macam</malay> around starting to see because here I feel it
it's not (um) it's because (uh) as technology evolves we evolve
you know what I mean <malay>sekarang</malay> (uh) is we are living in the world where
social media is a thing is (uh) <malay>macam</malay> instagram you see what people post you might want to follow you know what I mean
(uh) facebook twitter youtube
(uh) this kind of thing (uh) <malay>macam</malay> pinterest (uh)
<malay>dulu</malay> tumblr okay tiktok <malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok [kan]
<malay>sekarang</malay> tiktok where
the you I mean you we see everyone's <malay>punya</malay> life you know what I mean
all the youtuber all the your favourite idols <malay>ke</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> favourite <malay>punya</malay> artist (uh) kim K <malay>ke</malay> whatever you can see through just from your phone or your
T_V you know what I mean so <malay>maknanya</malay>
due to that's why (uh) people are like following <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> E-boy E-girl you might not be an E-boy E-girl <malay>tapi</malay> you just want to fit in or you just wanna ya you wanna look cool
<malay>tapi</malay> to me I think
you can follow whatever you want <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you have that mindset of because I wanna look cool I think that is not the right thing (err) you know what I mean why say you if you want to dress up because you
you kind of like <malay>suka dia punya</malay> style <malay>macam</malay> some people you can we see [oh] I like I kind of like this style I want to try
ya go by all means <malay>tapi</malay> you shouldn't change your attitude your personality because you are now in this group ya <malay>macam</malay> that is not the right way <malay>sebab macam kau kena</malay> genuine with yourself [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
imagine you are not like that right <malay>tapi sebab kau nampak</malay> (uh) your maybe your cliques are all <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) going towards the this kind of people and then you change your personality not just so if you coul~ if you (uh) if you just change your clothing then it's fine <malay>tapi</malay> you change your personality your whatever
because of your friend then it's not a good thing <malay>kalau</malay> if you change for the better then by all means go ahead because that means that is a good (uh) circle of friends that is a good company <malay>tapi</malay> if you start to <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>maaf cakap</malay> [eh] this can be very sensitive <malay>sebab</malay> imagine if your circle of friends (uh) <malay>macam</malay> smoking
then you follow but actually you know that is not you know that okay maybe you know that is not right <malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>buat</malay>
because you want to fit in then I think you shouldn't (uh) people like this they shouldn't do it because you should just stand for your own right <malay>macam</malay> you don't need to fit in why you want to fit in <malay>macam</malay>
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
with people <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] I say you don't need to get okay <malay>macam mana kau nak</malay> get this thing
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a comp~ (uh) company of friends that you know of a good kind that will help you bring to that
(uh) stage you know what I mean
so <malay>macam</malay> you know like (um) you know they say there's a saying <malay>macam</malay> (uh) everybody goes comes with you but can't go with you it's like <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] like
(err) <malay>macam</malay> the journey like imagine you want to go to the next level
ya or you find someone that have that same mindset <malay>tapi</malay> you don't
(uh)
have the same people that will hold you back
but because everyone's <malay>macam kau</malay>
needs a level up you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> level of for the good
not because not to level up to become someone that is
<malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like see this is how (uh) trend setting <malay>macam</malay>
fashion wise (uh) people are now using (uh) fewer are following the more of the K pop
it's not gonna be is a beneficial to a certain extent if you know if you knew it <malay>tapi</malay> if you don't know but you follow the bad company of friends ya maybe you can touch this topic later <malay>tapi</malay> if you follow that kind of group <malay>yang buat benda tak elok</malay> then (uh) then you should
you should have your own pride [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean <malay>kau punya</malay> pride <malay>kau tak payah</malay> follow <malay>orang lain punya</malay> instruction <malay>ada betul</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> shoot [jer] shoot
go [jer]
(mmhmm)
value is it popular popularity (mm)
(mmhmm)
self love
<malay>pandang rendah</malay> is it <malay>pandang rendah</malay> you look down on them [oh]
okay for me
as long as you know
where you stand <malay>macam mana</malay> you know what I mean like if you are going towards that big group <malay>macam tadi kau cakap</malay>
as long as it's of a good value then by all means go ahead <malay>macam</malay> if the crowd is gonna be supporting you in terms of your <malay>macam</malay> it will lead you to a success <malay>atau macam</malay> lead you to good stuff good vibes then by all means go ahead <malay>sebab</malay> if you know the circle of friends is good
by all means go ahead <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you think there is not of good but you just want to fit in based on
the people's <malay>sebab</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends you know what I mean like quotation <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>nak ada</malay> friends <malay>punya pasal</malay> then you go in but you know that you don't fit in but you just want that popularity then it's that's not a good (uh) there is not a good <malay>tujuan sebab kalau kau</malay> really <malay>nak</malay>
I mean you know some people <malay>macam</malay> for me no [eh] <malay>macam</malay> for me I got this thing where
<malay>kalau aku takde kawan</malay> then I'm not gonna I'm not desperate for friends like I just I mean you know there are some people
<malay>kita nampak</malay> I've seen this
where
they okay they got problem with the friends and then they <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the group [kan] <malay>dia keluar</malay> from the clique and then <malay>dia cari orang lain</malay> immediately just because you don't want to seem alone
but then like that much <malay>macam</malay> you like <malay>tak bagus</malay> [lah] I rather be alone you know what I mean I rather people see me as alone
and I have my own (uh) <malay>pendirian daripada</malay>
I think (uh) I need to find a friend because (uh) because people might think <malay>nanti macam</malay> I got problem
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that (uh) circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a good one take your time to find (uh) someone that really is genuine in your friendship
same goes like your question <malay>tadi</malay> whether that loner is degrading themselves no I don't think so <malay>sebab</malay> if the loner if that loner sometimes loner <malay>tu</malay> feels that
there's nothing wrong (uh) he or she is of a good (uh) direction even if the person is alone go ahead I woul~ <malay>kita</malay> support <malay>aku</malay> support <malay>tapi kalau</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> you know people who are alone they might have problems or stuff that we don't know of and we cannot judge based on [oh] <malay>kau seorang maknanya apa kau takde kawan</malay> you know like you don't have friends
come on that is childish [lah] I think we should all be mature enough to feel that maybe the person like to be alone because you know if he's an introvert because some people some extrovert also likes to be alone you know <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to go with the crowd cause it's
<malay>sebab</malay> if you want to go for me [eh] <malay>aku</malay> I like to keep my circle of friends close <malay>macam</malay> just a small circle of friends that I really call true friends you know <malay>sebab</malay> to have a big friends bigger friends in the crowd do you have to have the commitment you know what I mean and is it gonna be beneficial <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
ka~ you know <malay>kawan kosong</malay> and <malay>kawan</malay> that is really true
ya so back to your question where <malay>kalau</malay> the loner is degrading or not or
let what people think go ahead society if society doesn't like you or doesn't like what you wear or doesn't like your face or whatever right they get did they will always throw find some ways to throw head to degrade you whatever but <malay>kalau</malay> you it's hard to say <malay>macam</malay> for me you know I just say but if I were to
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or what~ whatever right
<malay>tapi</malay> what I can advice <malay>macam</malay>
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
<malay>tak payah kisah pasal orang-orang yang gini sebab</malay> they don't deserve your friendship they don't
<malay>dia orang tak layak pun sebab kalau</malay> they judge you they whatever they insult you then are they of a good friend then no
so go ahead like (um) move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that you deserved that the person deserves
<malay>kau kalau kau macam mana</malay>
yes I still remember our first
<malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>kita aku</malay> case <malay>macam</malay> the clown [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the class clown and then when I okay for the <malay>kita ni macam</malay> podcast [eh] <malay>tapi macam</malay> okay for those who <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> I'm okay I won't say that I'm ambivert <malay>macam</malay> I'm
an extrovert and also I prefer like alone time or whatever right but when I first met #mahirah# [kan] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>dia macam pendiam</malay> [tau] but actually she's not you have to get to know her
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>mahirah aku</malay>
ya it take a long time not years [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> but no maybe years for somebody but for me it's a connection
but no <malay>aku</malay> respect <malay>kau sebab</malay> okay you call yourself introvert right
but you are successful <malay>kau</malay>
for those who <malay>tak tahu</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> chairperson [seh] <malay>kau</malay> your leadership skill is really <malay>aku sanjung aku macam aku tabik</malay> (err) <malay>sebab</malay> your leadership is the best
so and
and those who don't know <malay>tapi</malay> once you find good people right you stick to them <malay>macam</malay> for me thank you for being
my friends !chey! <malay>macam sedih pulak jiwang kenapa pulak sebab</malay> it's true

she's beautiful to me and her character <malay>macam yang</malay> moth~ <malay>macam</malay> motherly kind of (uh) you know what I mean of how she brings me out <malay>aku</malay>
if some if someone that
of a role model like !wow! like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam kita</malay> we wanna be someone like that you know what I mean

and how <malay>dia macam ajar</malay> like even when she come back work she still like teach my younger siblings
although that she's tired but she still
<malay>macam ajar</malay> then !wah!
(um) <malay>tak payah cakap pasal</malay> beauty [lah] it's <malay>macam dia punya</malay> attitude wise you know what I mean
ya so role model
the is that <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay> if you want to say like western <malay>punya</malay> or like <malay>macam barat</malay>
(uh) <malay>pelakon ke apa</malay> [kan] then I would say #neelofa#
#neelofa#neelofa#
is the ya malaysian <malay>punya</malay> actress host (uh) business woman <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>kalau kau tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia buat</malay> this brand <malay>apa yang neelofa punya tudung</malay> and then she's successful <malay>sampai pergi</malay> (uh)
milan (uh) to the business <malay>berkembang</malay>
like real be and she's very #muslimah# also so I thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
she is a great (uh) host she's a great actress also and she's a great business woman and that and at the age of thirty I think she's thirty right now thirty one or something <malay>dia masih belum berpunya</malay> she's still single but her driven of (uh) being that success both <malay>dunia</malay> and <malay>akhirat aku boleh cakap</malay>
it's like !wah! <malay>macam</malay>
it's something that <malay>macam</malay> you god bless you know
ya I take that as a
(uh) role model because some more is a woman ya women and malaysian and (uh) of a islam (uh) muslim also so ya that's a great thing <malay>apa tadi kau nak cakap</malay>
#wallah#
<malay>betul</malay> the I mean the life the hereafter [lah]
ya
okay ya it's subjective
(mm) (mm)
ya <malay>tu</malay> [oh] my god singapore living ya
(mmhmm)
why ya true it's hard to find someone that of both that is !wow! I think <malay>memang</malay> it's very rare no not just both <malay>tapi</malay> your character <malay>pun baik</malay> your personality <malay>pun baik</malay>
those who have that
I have the most the utmost respect the utmost <malay>macam</malay>
role model [lah] I think that is what we call role model being both are woman or man <malay>yang macam</malay> you know that you have okay for the guys handsome (uh) <malay>bekerjaya</malay> and (um) (uh) <malay>apa</malay> we can <malay>cakap apa</malay> faithful is it faithful and then (um) of a good personality then
<malay>memang susah nak cari</malay> but these are the people <malay>yang macam</malay> you <malay>risau tapi</malay> again to those <malay>yang kita</malay> okay <malay>kita boleh ran~ ran~</malay> (uh) <malay>rumuskan</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab</malay> we got like a few more minutes <malay>tapi</malay> (um) what I can say is that we shouldn't just (um) we shouldn't just
(uh) okay what's that word [eh] I want to say that this <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kita jangan</malay> just <malay>tengok yang lawa kita</malay> just <malay>tengok yang</malay> handsome you know what I mean we don't we don't (err) okay don't pay attention okay as in like don't pay attention to all these or to the beauty of appearance <malay>sebab</malay>
it will just make you <malay>rasa diri</malay> you <malay>yang kalau</malay> you know that you are not of that beauty standard it will just make you more depressed or like social anxiety or like self esteem it will decrease your self esteem also
so I feel like we <malay>atau</malay> whoever shouldn't pay attention to that because you just bring us down [what] like we won't move on we won't we will live in fear of being judged or being outcasts then
as long as you in order to overcome all this right just work hard and be your this <malay>macam</malay> successful of yourself just to be a better version of yourself <malay>kalau</malay> just you know what I mean like
(um) like
there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
<malay>betul</malay> you know what I mean ya right there's the there are other aspect just be of (uh) just be humble be kind I think <malay>kalau</malay> at the end of the day right
you can people will love you even more than just those beautiful without character <malay>betul tak</malay>
so just ya just be on that don't worry <malay>kalau</malay>
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same [lah] just human being
ya
yes be comfortable in your own skin it's hard to directly <malay>macam</malay> choose to that but slowly I think as long as you <malay>macam</malay> you work hard to become what you want to be and then you your character is nice you don't you when if you are up there you don't judge the people below you because you never know <malay>bila</malay>
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
so then you just be humble [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that your pride is to be the best version of yourself [lah]
(mm)
yes ten years down the road what you want to say to yourself okay no (uh) okay how about before that we say
(err) the one thing we regret
you know what I mean <malay>macam</malay> we get five years back what we regret
it can be anything doesn't need to be of like what beauty but it can be anything then <malay>baru kita</malay> move on to ten years down the road what should we
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure
!wow! that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
<malay>macam</malay> it has come to a point where
<malay>macam</malay> because of beauty [lah] because of like insecurities and like low self esteem I tend to like
I think myself <malay>ni macam takde</malay> value
and it has come to a point where <malay>macam</malay> whatever people take one for me <malay>aku macam mengalah aku</malay> like okay give in cause I felt like
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to
to have like prioritise in me <malay>sebab</malay> I tend to like
to like <malay>macam jaga hati orang ni jaga hati tapi siapa nak jaga hati kita orang</malay> [seh]
you know what I mean so it has I should be more <malay>macam</malay> have that confidence which I <malay>aku tu</malay> last time [eh] <malay>tu</malay> last but right now I have I work on that and it's I find that
(uh) re~ the respect that you're given by society that is more
so to the next ya (uh) future advice for your for the next five years or ten years down the road <malay>apa kau punya</malay> advice
is it an advice or like what we want to be or
[oh] message to [oh] okay
[oh] okay that's good
(mm)
true
true that is important and <malay>macam</malay> to just have that little selfishness in you so that
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued [lah] in this world into serious [eh] for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
<malay>ni</malay> is important <malay>betul</malay> okay
ellen <malay>punya</malay> ellen put aside [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> this is my <malay>pendirian</malay> I know where
and I have experience of job interviews of people of a higher standard
higher status <malay>kau</malay> manager your <malay>kau</malay> they treat me they treat us <malay>macam kita ni</malay> beginner but we because of our age then they degrade us you know what I mean so I <malay>aku macam</malay> to me I would never treat anyone like that be it even if one day <malay>aku</malay>
have my own (uh) business or I'm (uh) I'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever [lah] bigger title whatever
treating people nice is you is a must <malay>sebab</malay> how can you judge <malay>sebab</malay> I got people around me <malay>macam</malay> they judge okay for example
<malay>kalau kau punya</malay> job (uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) cleaning wise <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
I mean you shouldn't judge
<malay>kau</malay> why would you (uh) I've seen this is another topic (err) like for me okay I just share a bit of my intern [eh] I was treated badly by the supervisor
it's because (uh) <malay>kita</malay> they can bully us you know cause they think us we are like (uh) <malay>kuli</malay> we are like beginner
<malay>kita macam baru masuk</malay> industry then they bully us they not just (uh) okay if we are bad right if we are rude then by all means I deserve that treatment <malay>tapi</malay> if we are respectful if we are willing to learn but you treat us like <malay>macam kita sampah</malay> or like you insult us you
you treat us badly you you call you are racists I got you know a job interview and the guy was racist to me but then I felt like [oh] my god you you forget where you start you <malay>kau dah lupa diri</malay> [kan] this is what happen when <malay>kita lupa diri</malay> so I just want to advice myself that [oh] my god please

I don't know
it was like long time ago like there were people who like older in my class like by one or two years

ya okay so basically it's like an Andalus [lah] then they band you according to how smart you are whatever then got the morning session and then the
then the morning session and the afternoon session [lah] yah so like
I think
I think like
the first few years was
(um)
like afternoon session or whatever [lah] that's how I know like that's how I know a lot of people in the #Tampines# area who are like malays cause like I go to like this <malay>masjid punya madrasah</malay> and then like
cause you mix class every time [what] so you just make friends with everyone in that class
yeah
then
then after that like me and so
so halfway through
(err) the primary school like when I was in primary school right they created this #macam# new syllabus <malay>abeh</malay> like is everything #macam# in english [ah] english [ah] then like #macam# <malay>tak ada</malay> exams everything is for like
(uh) you know those people who convert
to islam
then like they don't understand Malay or anything
ya is yeah so cause <malay>dia nak</malay> #macam# like
(um) integrated society or whatever so they like abolished they abolished the <malay>madrasah</malay> the <malay>madrasah punya</malay> system so there's no more like exam or anything cause we actually had a Chinese girl in our class
and then like she <malay>kesian</malay> [sia] all the textbooks all in Malay <malay>abeh dia tak faham</malay> like she was just like so confused and the only thing she could can understand ya the only thing she can understand is the Arab cause like
the teacher teach in Arab right then whatever she don't understand she can actually ask in English and the textbook is in Arabic what so like she'll just translate on her own but everything else is in Malay and then like she just couldn't understand

like imagine a literal small inside
inside and then like he's just struggling cause like he only understand chinese ya then after that halfway through she left
he doesn't
ya he doesn't he only knows Chinese
<malay>apa kau</malay> okay maybe cause like he learn cause like N_S what then N_S

ya so I work from home for <malay>macam</malay>
about one month
then I feel so like <malay>terkurung dalam bilik</malay> and the wifi is not strong

so between you and me the experience is different [lah]
ya
how long

ya only two weeks <malay>dua minggu</malay>
<malay>duduk kat rumah</malay> and you know what I don't even do in my room you know I do at the living room
so my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in the office
that's why I <malay>tadi</malay> I ask you to take a picture of your work~ working setting
so at least you have a table and two monitors right
that is me in the office <malay>kalau kat rumah</malay> I will just like <malay>duduk depan</malay> T_V then my laptop
then my drink then how con~ how is that
effective ya
(mm) it's not at all also
<malay>ya ke</malay>
[oh] my god and the
and he is used to that
[oh] make the home <malay>macam</malay> office like that [ah]
[oh] then what your wifi around your houses [eh] around your houses around the house <malay>macam</malay> good [ah]
(mm)
and your room
[oh] okay
ya [lah] then how you do your work [seh] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
like because your work from home <malay>pakai</malay> Zoo~ <malay>pakai apa</malay> Microsoft or
or
ya the Google hangouts you they you never break out [meh] <malay>macam</malay> never lag or what
[orh]
(mm) okay so the experience is quite
okay [lah] for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
ya so now <malay>buat apa</malay>
back to school already right
[oh]
[oh] one more month !wow!
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
!wow! you got
two months of holiday [ah] not bad [ah] you
(mm)
[oh] you've been working part time <malay>kerja apa</malay> [eh] cause I saw on your Instagram you work night shift all
(uh huh)
like what
why
but you are still working [what] okay [lah] <malay>tu</malay> means you [dah] survive <malay>sikit</malay>
spent too much on what
[oh] how much you earn [ah] that job
(mm)
hundred per
[oh]
ninety nine
per night
!wow!
okay
<malay>kerja apa</malay> why you never explain
[oh] pack <malay>apa</malay>
makeup stuff
then you work alone or what not alone right <malay>ada orang lain juga</malay> [kan]
[orh]
<malay>kerja kat mana kat</malay> warehouse [eh]
#Tampines#
!huh! then how you travel [seh]
<malay>ibu cik nya rumah</malay>
i~ #Yishun# correct [orh] so you got straight bus there [lah]
technically [lah] a bit [lah]
<malay>lama</malay>
compared to staying at hou~ [ah] compared to where you are now until
(uh) at <malay>ibu cik</malay> house [lah] the difference right
(mm) okay so now you still working there
then now what
why experience [what] you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
one week and then you cannot <malay>tahan</malay>
(uh)
it's just too fast paced [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
ya one day <malay>berapa</malay>
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K [lah]
(mm)
!wow! not bad [ah] you Q_C
do you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
(uh) the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the f~ in the emtire human line
if you are at the first person [ah] then <malay>paling senang</malay>
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up [what]
[ah] [kan] so if you are the first person it's the easiest job [ah] but quality check a bit hard [ah]
quality check and need to <malay>buat cepat</malay> then that's crazy [ah]
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
<malay>macam</malay> from
(err) we start at about nine [kan] then we need to
pack for [eh] no we start at about [oh] <malay>macam lapan setengah</malay> then <malay>lapan setengah</malay> all the way until <malay>pukul dua belas</malay>
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the [ah] the rice is either you
(uh) scoop the <malay>kuah</malay> then after that you #kiap# the container then you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target [lah] but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
[ah] pack <malay>kat</malay> kitchen [ah] so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because <malay>panas</malay> [lah] then when you #kiap# the container then you also will #kiap# your finger [lah]
bla [lah] then lepas <malay>balik</malay>
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person [ah] so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
<malay>kat mana kat</malay>
the industrial area at #Woodlands# there [lah]
(mm) so they needed manpower (uh) so they asked manpower from my company so ya [lor]
(mm)
yup my current wor~ company [lah] so this the the workplace that I work for
I mean the packing place <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>kerja</malay> is (um)
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they pay us then we help them [lah] (mm)
(mm)
ya [lor] so that's why I whe~ when I ask you how was your experience for the packing I understand [lah] what it means when you say fast paced
express <malay>gila</malay> [lah] especially when you do quality check how to quality check <malay>cepat</malay> [seh]
so that's how tired you are then now <malay>kerja apa</malay> [seh] <malay>kerja malam</malay>
[oh]
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you can [lah]
no [ah] you will learn [one] usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
like few months ago <malay>sekarang baru dia dapat</malay>
and the pay is quite good [lah]
three K [lah] three K for I don't know how many weeks of working [lah] so ya
ya so <malay>kerja apa</malay>

[oh]
so you what you
[oh] okay can
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
then <malay>kenapa</malay> you leave
[oh]
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest pa~ packing job is it
compared to your makeup [one]

(mm) then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
[oh]

(mm) !ee! I ask you first how's you and Andy
you've been closer right every time <malay>sekarang</malay> I always saw you and
you and Andy on InstaStory
that's why <malay>selalu macam</malay> spend time <malay>sama</malay>
<malay>dia pun</malay> holiday <malay>ke</malay>
[oh] okay okay
[oh]
that's why you guys spend time together
(mm)
ya that's why <malay>macam selalu</malay> when I see your InstaStory <malay>macam</malay> [eh]
Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
<malay>kenapa</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> [seh]
[oh] I mean
[oh] <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mata merah</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
like jealous <malay>ke</malay> like [oh] I have a boyfriend but you don't like (err)
[oh]
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
ya it's how but good thing Andy <malay>faham</malay> [lah] that's the thing
understand each other
meet <malay>tapi masih berbual</malay> [kan]
like on Whatsapp or at least <malay>berbual</malay> on the phone
good [lah] good [lah]
(mm)
not talk
(mm)
well good [lah] good [lah] at least
in this relationship the two of you
<malay>kau orang dua faham</malay> each other the needs and the wants
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
<malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
ya how long already [ah]
what
three years
not bad [ah] three years [ah] this is this the longest
(mm)
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay [lah] actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you li~ like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya [lah] because his side he don't make it he don't
show it <malay>dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan</malay> so
(uh) his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya (mm)
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like !hais! [eh] cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue now is <malay>macam</malay>
(err) me and him are dealing shitty stuff now [lah] so ya
together and individually so <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] let's say [ah] so [ah] cause <malay>sekarang dia</malay> [dah] O_R_D right
do you know what he's working now
(mm) you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram [ah]
[oh]
[oh] that recent stories <malay>dia tak</malay> appear [lah] that kind of thing okay
cause [ah] <malay>dia sekarang</malay> work as financial adviser
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya insuran~ so he's an insurance agent
so under A_I_A but (uh) under A_I_A there's a sister company called
M_F_A_G
so (err) basically how to plan your financi~ how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
(mm) so okay [lah]
(uh) you ask me <malay>kenapa dia kerja ni pasal</malay> one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and <malay>dia dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer]
[ah] so he invest I mean he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified F_A
so <malay>sekarang dia boleh</malay> go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start s~ selling insurance or any plans
(mm) so that is his career so his career now [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people [kan]
ya so you will meet new people of many age~ of different ages (uh) different character
(uh) gender and everything else so <malay>macam</malay>
okay [lah] I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so (um)
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
<malay>kita</malay> is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
fourth year in the relationship
ya so [ah] so <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his N_S <malay>pun pernah</malay> happen I don't know [eh]
so <malay>macam</malay> this thing happen for the third time already
okay so okay [ah] now I explain to you what happen
so (uh) basically <malay>dia bilang</malay> me ha~ Hans <malay>punya</malay> type <malay>punya orang</malay> is <malay>dia</malay> he's very honest
so <malay>dia jujur dia akan bilang apa</malay> his <malay>perasaan</malay> everything to me
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me [ah] [oh] (um)
he wants to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
so at first <malay>bila dia cakap macam gitu</malay> I thought
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like (uh) means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
<malay>tapi</malay> it's not explore means <malay>dia nak</malay> explore <malay>dia nak jumpa orang baru</malay> without feeling (err) bad
get it so means [ah] means [ah] like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about #Lina# that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his N_S
his N_S <malay>dia ada</malay> group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for S_A_F
[ah] so that is the first time it happened
so when he met new group of girls then <malay>tiba dia macam</malay>
!wow! <malay>macam</malay> okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay [lah] <malay>sakit hati tu sakit hati</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> at least
[ah] it d~
saki~ it did hurt me but it was the first time so <malay>macam</malay> okay first time let it go that kind of thing
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like want to know her even more
ya but that someone that V_C lady <malay>dia macam</malay>
not interested [lah] because that V_C girl also have a boyfriend
vol~
no V_C is (err) volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for S_A_F
[ah]
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional (uh) breakdown [ah] I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his N_S
<malay>dia macam sampai berbual</malay> on <malay>dia macam</malay> my me~ no [ah] like
<malay>memang dia</malay> o~ they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp [lah] like
like made a move [lah] <malay>macam</malay> message [lah] message the <malay>perempuan nak</malay> know better
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating [lah] but but
I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct [a'ah]
so during N_S is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
<malay>kelakar</malay> [kan]
[kan] (uh)
ya
this is what I'm trying to say [lah] don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
it's just <malay>dia punya tiba</malay> the way <malay>dia layan</malay> me the way he behave around me change
<malay>macam</malay> in terms of not good [lah] <malay>macam</malay> he he tell me things like (err) I want to explore he don't want to feel
like limited talking to new people
get it because in this in <malay>dia punya</malay> line of job <malay>dia akan jumpa</malay>
<malay>jumpa orang baru</malay>
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] ya [lah] professional that part it is [lah] but at the same time <malay>dia nak</malay>
know more about people get it and he thought he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he will meet somebody that is (um)
(err) way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the yo~ he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say [ah] this is me [ah] this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
at any point of time in his life <malay>dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang</malay> better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing <malay>tu juga</malay> I said <malay>macam</malay> I ca~ I say to him [ah] I also can say the same thing to you [what] but I choose to focus what is in front of me
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
<malay>faham tak</malay>
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit [lah]
so ya !hais!
no I don't know because
from the start of the relationship I got even I <malay>pernah bilang</malay> you [what] <malay>bila kita nak</malay>
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to end up (uh) like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then if you ask me [ah] if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya [lah]
like that's why when you things like (uh) on Twitter will say this and that right you w~ you wait sometimes you need to leave you mu~ you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
[ah] I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know [lah]
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] I mean you <malay>nak</malay> comment <malay>pun</malay> comment [lah] because honestly
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
ya and there's no end to it <malay>macam</malay> there's no conclusion there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion <malay>macam</malay> do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do you still want to go on with li~ like endless
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
that's why I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
<malay>macam</malay> okay
<malay>macam</malay> dependent [lah]
not exactly [lah]
<malay>bukan macam</malay> okay so
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
ya [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
it's stupid [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
yes sure up to you s~ you can go ahead and share
(mm)
(mm)
but you do try to recover after that right
(mmhmm)
(mm) ma~ [ah] that's the word make up
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay> [lah]
ya [lah]
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
[kan]
<malay>dia belum</malay> N_S [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay> [lah] but at least now <malay>kau orang</malay> at least <malay>ada</malay> so called same goal in the relationship right
(mm) (mm)
with him
(mm) at least a goal with him [kan]
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
get it <malay>macam</malay>
we like I say to you we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early next two years to get married now is like (err) am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
for me now with Han is really <malay>macam</malay>
a total switch a total change of goals which is now <malay>tak</malay> match
ya so now I'm just like
(uh) like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I don't know [lah] I really don't know I don't know whether <malay>kita</malay> are compatible or what already [lah] because <malay>dia memang</malay> [dah] ada</malay> other mindset <malay>juga</malay>
I
everyt~
met his parents
spend time yes <malay>tapi macam</malay> other stuff to talk about the future no [lah] because <malay>dia punya</malay> parents obviously is supportive of Hans
han~ his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
like a person like a <malay>gundu</malay> like that <malay>tunggu macam</malay>
<malay>macam badut gitu</malay> th~ but the (uh)
!haiya! ya [lah] the thing is
the thing is if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
it has been weeks already [ah] so if I cry now also <malay>macam</malay>
it's just tears [eh] <malay>macam</malay> really legit [sia] so <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah]
so well I'm just updati~ updating you my relationship status so <malay>kalau</malay> we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand [lah]
<malay>tak apa</malay> (uh) it's okay not to make assumption [ah] but
but the thing is it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
<malay>kalau kita</malay> so called if we reach to a level where we break up right
my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
(mm) [eh]
like
[kan] [kan] s~ so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him o~ with him right
(mm)
ya so but this thing is special case as~ I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then <malay>dia macam</malay> disagree [ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay>
di~ (uh) (hmm) no he I don't know <malay>dia cakap</malay> (um) why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just (um) be friends
okay the thing is it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so <malay>macam</malay>
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out <malay>macam gitu</malay> (mm)
so far during this period right
where (uh) like
I (mm) only just now I met him [lah] after like a week <malay>tak jumpa</malay>
but few days ago when my friend <malay>ajak</malay> me hang out then I asked <malay>ada siapa</malay> ad~ <malay>kalau ada</malay> Hans I say to them I <malay>tak nak</malay> join
(mm)
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story [lah] okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware [sia] ch~
(err) like I don't know a week ago maybe
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> ya <malay>ini susah</malay> [ah] <malay>susah</malay>
he's
I know I understand
!hais!
!hais!
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I hint only [lah] I hint to my mother only [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
she sense it [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to (uh)
the group of friends <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>bilang pun macam</malay>
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya [loh]
so this issue <malay>macam</malay> I really <malay>tak nak bilang orang</malay> but
on my Instagram I think people can like [oh] okay Hans and #Lina# is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
(mm)
ya <malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think <malay>pasal</malay> I'm just too <malay>macam</malay>
too f~
I have fallen for him too hard that (uh) now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two <malay>masih boleh jumpa orang lain</malay> and stuff <malay>tapi</malay>
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person [lah] but
ya [ah] so ya [dah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah]
that's my that's what I'm experiencing now so if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
[ah] it's just me expressing my emotions
(mm) and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
!huh!
ya it affect
<malay>kadang</malay> [seh] <malay>dalam kerja</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out [ah]
then suddenly <malay>benda tu</malay> come in
then when <malay>benda tu</malay> come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when <malay>tadi</malay> you <malay>bilang</malay> me [kan] [ah] what time you sleep and stuff right
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
twelve A_M <malay>tahu</malay>
sometimes I <malay>habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I'll just hang out talk I just like (err) but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so <malay>macam</malay>
okay I do Zoom meetings at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I <malay>baru balik</malay> that kind of thing then once I go home
I'll just knockout [ah] so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing [lah]
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
<malay>tidur pukul tiga bangun pukul lapan</malay>
then
then it affected my work in terms of productivity [lah] I <malay>lupa benda</malay> I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so (um)
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already [lah] so that is good enough
(hmm) ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand [lah]
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
[ah] your <malay>rumah macam tukar hari</malay> [seh]
ya ya
then ra~ ray~ before <malay>raya</malay> I think I went to your house once also different theme then <malay>raya</malay> also different theme
then <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
cree~ busy [seh]
it's only your room <malay>tak</malay> involved [lah]
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space [seh] that is good that's what I need [eh]
but the thing is I don't like to work in my <malay>bilik pasal</malay> wifi <malay>tak</malay> strong legit <malay>tak</malay> strong
ya (mm) me an~ me and my <malay>adik</malay> already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
we just need a different type of (um) router ya
because this wifi sucks you okay for example [ah] <malay>kalau sekarang</malay> you co~ go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
ya
[kan] that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
I always do outside <malay>kalau tak</malay> I'll just do at other places
(mm)
ya means we need an addi~ additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the T_V
so <malay>macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi</malay> to my room
how many wifi you have at home
[oh] you have two
one is at
(mm) so you are connected to your
parents' [one]
(mm) <malay>patutlah boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> ya then I need to <malay>pasang</malay> one more [loh]
(mm)
ya
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] but
it will be eventually right this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
(mm)
just now <malay>punya</malay> meeting is just a normal work meeting
crazy [kan] no it's <malay>macam gini</malay> so you <malay>kerja macam biasa</malay>
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work
then we got Zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we are all
like on the same track check in <malay>apa</malay> task you <malay>buat</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>penat</malay> [seh] so it's like technically you're working twenty four hours
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now [ah]
(err)
mo~ I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one (err) some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at M_S_F to do social work
so they are deployed at different places but the same time
they also have still to do they still need to do their <malay>kerja biasa</malay>
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
(mm)
that is why at night we need to do meeting <malay>pasal</malay> everyone will be in the meeting because at the office we will never meet each other
[ah]
(uh)
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya correct ya
no jus~ just now [one] is because I had to do a trai~ a mini training for this up~ [ah] tomorrow's training
ya
(err) at <malay>pukul sepuluh</malay> no worry [lah] can
ya so ya [lor]
then anyways so I am starting a~ another job again cause I was just

<malay>merepek gila</malay> [ah] because I mean we have to do this cause to maintain our
pay to maintain the mon~ the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just COVID things [ah] it's it sucks bro hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal

I don't know you tell me is he like really <malay>kasar dengan kau</malay>
(hmm) I know actually now right is actually so hard to find a partner that is truly down to earth for you and really down
to like date you and then to <malay>kahwin</malay> with you
act~ actually (uh) after the truth or dare game right I thought <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tak suka aku</malay> because like I feel like maybe
he feels <malay>malu</malay> because he had to do it so from then on <malay>macam</malay> it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that <malay>dia</malay> just start to <malay>tak suka</malay> me
that's what I felt ya because that time when you know after that they ordered mac right
and [ah] I wanted a straw or something so I said [oh] !alah! can you pass me a straw I don't know why he like he just ignored me
then I am like wasn't the <malay>tak</malay> [oh] is he not at me
ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
she loves me
!huh! I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll still talking to his ex you know <malay>kau tahu</malay>
<malay>dia masih berbual-bual dengan</malay> ex <malay>dia</malay> [seh] ya
ya and then [ah] he was actually low key hoping to get back with his ex but then his ex was just like [eh] I don't know
ya
yes there was the story then [ah] you know then after that I <malay>teman</malay> him to go for one office <malay>takraw</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> sessions just to watch [lah] and then we were walking to the sports hall <malay>abeh</malay> I think <malay>kawan dia</malay> saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then [ah] <malay>kawan dia</malay> upload to
snapchat and then [eh] his ex <malay>nampak</malay> [lah] then
(err) his ex message him and ask I thought there was still something between us
yes <malay>dia</malay> playing hard to get but then she's also like <malay>macam</malay>
not sure about him but also playing hard to get <malay>macam mana</malay>
so <malay>dia orang dah</malay> break up [lah]
exactly
like
exactly there is my point that is what I mean
but
ya
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak suka</malay> when like (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend <malay>punya kawan</malay> I mean just make it clear [lah] that
you guys just <malay>kawan</malay> and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what <malay>kau</malay> mean by that <malay>ular kepala dua</malay> is it
what
it's not just
how will wait so the guy is gay
[orh] okay [dah]
for years
but why would the girl <malay>buat</malay> such a thing to the <malay>mata air</malay> [sia]
I mean I don't know that guy
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's okay if you want to <malay>buka aib dia</malay> to me because I don't even know who he is so
(mm)
wait so does that mean at some point <malay>kau pernah suka lelaki tu</malay> on
[oh]
(um)
ya
like <malay>kau orang</malay> are just platonic friends [lah]
the <malay>mata air dia</malay> just have issues [lah] I think because remember when <malay>aku</malay> used to have issues dengan #yasmin#
ya
I don't even know why and then now <malay>kita</malay> we're friends so like look [ah] the turntables
no is it is it the office reference <malay>entah</malay> [lah]
speaking of the office you know my sister [ah] I told my <malay>kakak</malay> about (uh) all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
maybe (err) your boss should hire a cameraman and then like cameramen will like every time when there is a fight in the office
the cameraman <malay>kena</malay> zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then (uh) <malay>dia akan</malay> (uh) bend into like the people around <malay>dia punya</malay> reaction that will be so funny and then the title should (err) the office two point O
ya
well anyways I didn't tell you about one of the main drama in my intern office
so basically [kan] [ah] logistics and accounts just cannot get along for some freaking reason and then
<malay>aku</malay> is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to <malay>buat kerja</malay> for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they <malay>macam</malay> how is the company going to <malay>maju</malay> right and then
and then so I have to be the middleman so for finance I have to scan (err) purchase order and invoices
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance <malay>habis tu</malay>
[ah] after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person [lah] and then <malay>mesti perempuan</malay> finance <malay>ni pun cakap</malay>
<malay>asyik</malay> pass <malay>kat aku</malay> [seh] this one you pass back to (err) <malay>si</malay> logistics <malay>dulu</malay> then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is <malay>dah kerja kau</malay> [pe]
(mm) it's like <malay>macam</malay> as if they make it look like <malay>macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal</malay>
they are the ones that making <malay>kerja aku susah</malay> you know so frustrating
(mmhmm)
(um) I get what you mean though because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] at N_U_S
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID <malay>kita kena</malay> work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually <malay>kat kerja</malay> I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so <malay>kecil dari</malay> desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and plus I'm still new to the system
and then [oh] and then <malay>aku punya</malay> boss every damn day <malay>dia akan suruh kita</malay> on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
(mm) I mean [ah] almost <malay>hari-hari</malay> [kan] my boss will <malay>tanya</malay> everyone [oh] what is on your plate today like
<malay>macam</malay> every damn day <malay>hari-hari</malay> nine thirty A_M sharp zoom meeting without fail <malay>dia akan tanya</malay>
[ah] my office hours is nine thirty to six thirty
[ah] you end earlier [what]
about one hour
<malay>lima belas minit</malay>
ya
from
(um) #kim#yam# road <malay>nak pergi</malay> #sengkang# okay [lah] and then plus you know <malay>bila nak pergi</malay> and <malay>balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit</malay> [oh] my goodness
so tiring
ya so depressing <malay>tu</malay> turbine intern so !huh!
what topic though
J
[oh]
#jannah#
!wah! so <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
is it #jannah# <malay>dari mata air</malay>
<malay>kau tak</malay> [eh]
who do you have in mind to be #jannah# <malay>mata air</malay>
but
honestly I cannot wait until #jannah# <malay>kahwin</malay> though because like
I will feel so happy for her <malay>macam</malay> yes
I know right
any guy <malay>yang dapat</malay> #jannah# is a very lucky guy
is it
no because you <malay>kau tahu</malay> [pe] I don't really have a lot of friends especially guy friends
!hey! what do you mean by that
no my cousins
<malay>sepupu aku</malay> they are either <malay>lagi tua</malay> or they're younger than me
so like I don't think #jannah# will be interested in <malay>dia orang</malay>
allan no no allan's cousins already have [ah] girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew #jannah# <malay>tak suka lelaki yang</malay> younger than her
so like scrap that
it has this is a very hard thing to do
[kan] <malay>saya ni</malay> like #shaza# really <malay>shaza pula jap</malay> I mean you deserve the best also but #jannah# also like deserves the best
why (ugh)
we
we all deserve the best
feminism and empowerment [oh] my god speaking of empowerment do you hear about the U_S elections
it's so <malay>merepek</malay>
did you know that kanye west is really running for president
it's like americans don't even take <malay>dia orang punya</malay> elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
ya
you know actually [ah] U_S should take notes from singapore and make voting
a compulsory thing and not give them a choice because that I see
<malay>orang dekat</malay> U_S <malay>dia orang</malay> like [oh] have you registered to vote
I mean you have a choice to register or not
ya but
to get whether you get involved or not in politics
it's your <malay>masa hadapan</malay> that you are thinking of it's the <malay>masa depan masa hadapan</malay> of your children
so like
you get what I mean right
yes
[oh]
did you hear about the woke culture thing
especially <malay>kat</malay> singapore
tweeted I know you deleted you have twitter but like
woke culture has been like taking over singapore <malay>punya</malay> twitter and it's really annoying especially those influencers
[oh] woke W O K E
it like it's <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] (um)
are you guys have to be woke in order to like <malay>macam</malay> so you guys don't [ah] offend <malay>siapa-siapa</malay> I'm like (ugh) stop it
ya
but
<malay>macam</malay> no offence na na na but ne na
demographic
ya
ya
you know actually [ah]
(uh) actually women <malay>dia orang minta</malay> for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
ya call for equity
ya cause it's like
no no not financial management it's (uh)
<malay>macam</malay>
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time [ah] seek catering to their needs better it's like <malay>macam</malay> for example you're looking over fence [ah] this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
these (uh) but this other person cannot see so if you give both of them
ya actually I know
<malay>aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut</malay> okay nevermind
cancel that's wrong theory
ya
nah

[eh] <malay>rasa</malay>
can [ah] try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent [ah] and like
they really build up their name [eh] you know like
those DOTA players E_A players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands I would say
pricing <malay>mahal</malay> Secret Lab <malay>paling murah</malay> four nine [sia]
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality P_U leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding [eh] I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine for the Secret Lab chair
than [eh] APOL is three nine eight
ya
similar <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> Secret Lab <malay>ada</malay> five years warranty APOL <malay>dua</malay> year [jer]
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya
no [ah] it's like covered a few stuff like you know (um) for Secret Lab they have this tear protection thing so where like if the material <malay>kalau terkoyak-koyak</malay> [kan] <malay>kopek-kopek</malay> then after that
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
I
<malay>tapi air tumpah tak</malay> damage <malay>apa</malay> you can just straightaway <malay>lap</malay> the thing then the water is gone already
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is
ya
<malay>tu</malay>
ya <malay>aku nampak</malay> I saw that [one] <malay>basuh</malay> the <malay>lantai</malay> then all the stains all just come out right
that's true [ah] Coke like damn sweet [eh] I'm not a fan of Coke [ah] it's too sweet for me
[ah]
ya standard correct
[ah]
[oh] carton
what that's for <malay>hari raya</malay> [lah]
[ah]

that's non-fizzy
(mm) Seasons the blue colour [one] right
<malay>hijau</malay> [eh]
that's the green tea ice lemon tea [eh] is it
ya that [one] not bad because <malay>dia punya</malay> ice lemon tea flavour in that <malay>tak</malay> as strong [ah]
sugar
ya
ya I agree
[eh] wait seasons
[oh] I think I got I think I never try Seasons (uh) peach tea before [eh]
[oh] no I don't think so [eh] the I can't recall
maybe [ah]
[eh] so <malay>bila nak beli ni</malay> table tennis <malay>punya</malay> racket paddle
(mm)
(uh)
!alamak! <malay>pergi</malay> club room [ah] you <malay>cukai</malay> the paddles
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
[oh] like as in you just <malay>lepak tak belajar</malay> this kind of stuff
because you got the mindset [lah] like you know there's a
relax corner in school
<malay>potong kaki</malay> [ah]
ya
ya true
(uh)
I also finding [ah] I want find like (uh) you know like stable kind of part-time
<malay>tapi</malay> cafe
ya exactly cafe <malay>semua gaji</malay> like they don't pay you that well then at most <malay>kurang-kurang</malay>
and nine dollars [ah] if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of (um) eatery
but banquet <malay>malas</malay> [sia] bro banquet <malay>kerja lama kena diri</malay> then like it's not my thing [ah]
<malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay>
never banquet I never do before that time was (uh) kitchen job [ah]
ya Grand Hyatt [ah]
that [one] <malay>kerja</malay> kitchen it's a cook (uh)

ya #sheikh# ya okay I tell you about banquet the #sheikh# and this another friend [kan] <malay>dorang kerja</malay> banquet <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] because <malay>dorang dah kerja lama</malay> so they got a lot of seniority
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so this #sheikh# and the my this friend right step manager <malay>dorang tak buat kerja</malay> just like manage them tell them what to do then <malay>lepak</malay> so basically for like let's say maybe ten hours of work right they only do
<malay>dua jam tiga jam</malay>
<malay>tapi dapat gaji</malay> for the whole thing then they just <malay>lepak makan</malay>
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya they all like make friends already [ah] that's why
[orh]
Shangri-La
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>kahwin</malay> [ah]

s~ so it's a win
it's a win situation [lah]
ya
true
actually that time I <malay>pernah bilang kau</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kerja ni kat</malay> Marche or something
because
[eh] since when you care [sia] bro

(uh huh)
I'm not sure [ah] if that's Fika or something some other cafe near arab street last time
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> (um)
(err) but how much was the food
so Fika or the what's that called [ah]
Malayan Council [eh]

he's she say their service his service is top notch because he knows how to treat their customer right [ah]
freebies right <malay>keluar</malay> vouchers right

ya that's why is the owner is smart he
mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
but then he return vouchers so people like think like [eh] <malay>aku bayar macam gini tapi dapat</malay> voucher so like
then okay <malay>juga apa</malay>
ya exactly but then the thing is one thing good they don't have a minimum spending like what my sister do right sh~ she everytime <malay>pergi makan dengan</malay> boyfriend right
then they <malay>makan</malay> then talk because the boyfriend like
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he knows the owner
then right everytime go <malay>makan</malay> he'll give like twenty thirty dollar voucher like that so my sister and the boyfriend
(uh) the next time they just go then use the voucher to get like
you know cakes and (uh) tea or something like that
good the
the <malay>ondeh-ondeh</malay> [one] also then the durian [one] not bad quite nice
actually I don't know also I never see the store in person before

no beef [lah] then like just laze [ah]
!hey! beef is on bro
!wah! I need to watch the thing
<malay>sama-sama</malay> like quite <malay>gerek</malay> [ah] to be honest I surprised it's not on Netflix or anything the they not getting enough publicity [ah]
ya that's why at first I thought it was like a
just a group of friends they just wanna try something then until I see the pro skater came into their video
to their series then I'm like !huh!
can't be like just a random fellow can managed to get a skater
a proper renowned skater you know to come in
(uh huh)

that
hashtag
(mm) later he got hashtag dare to stab
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah] [eh] you want play or not
[eh]
<malay>pergi</malay> download <malay>ni</malay> [eh] [eh] apex <malay>boleh main sama-sama</malay>
<malay>kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya nanti kau pergi tengok dia punya</malay> game play it's like <malay>macam</malay>
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish (uh) cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
!huh!
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
I plan to but then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> need to work [ah] then like don't have much time to play games this [one] now DOTA also I don't really play that much
ya
P_S five I don't know [ah] I never see since the pre-order part
I think no [ah] like they still publish [ah] it's just that it's out of stock on the main (uh) website if I'm not mistaken
<malay>gila</malay> [kan] right
<malay>pasal kau dulu budak-budak</malay> town east [kan] P_S one P_S two
[ah] but you don't actually own you didn't own one right
[oh] okay
(mm)
[oh] I understand they control with the time guard [ah] <malay>ada</malay> time limit all these
ya
ya funny [ah]
!fuh!
[oh] you strike a deal before the exam [ah]
I see
but all the while you did well not
above average [ah]
nice
!fuh!
your sister also get P_S_P
[oh]
[oh]
ya it was dying down right nearby that time cause P_S_P came out
[orh]
<malay>yang gemuk punya</malay> [kan] <malay>bukan yang</malay> slim
[eh] don't <malay>terasa</malay> [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] wasted
okay [ah] P_S_P was short-lived also [ah]
it
it's good actually I quite surprised the thing (err) like just die down like I thought it will be a continuation but
I think P_S and
say again
ya no it's because the Sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that [ah] P_S_P Vita
[ah] Vita
P_S Vita that
part of I mean that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice D_S came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why D_S became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> necessary [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> touch screen and all
I think
(mm) I think the main appeal is just because D_S can support the
(uh) what's Pokemon games people literally buy D_S just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
<malay>macam</malay> minecraft [ah]
but it looks like minecraft is just I don't feel appealed in playing the minecraft kind of games
ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick
or is it just to garner the support of like I don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad
that's why every single move they made it's all got (uh) impact they want to achieve you know
!duh!
(uh) not !duh! [lah] but like possible
fortnite aha bro [eh] you never play fortnite [ah]
[ah] fortnight graphic is cartoon-ish there's that cartoon-ish as heck like damn cartoon-ish
like what

then <malay>gitu duit masuk</malay> so <malay>senang</malay> [ah] but then wasted [lah] I never think of it [lah]
#al-ameen#
I not sure [seh] I think around
I think until two A_M three A_M like that [ah]
if I not wrong [ah]
ya
<malay>dah lama</malay> [ah] <malay>tak makan sana</malay> because like
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy [ah]
<malay>diam sudah</malay> no [ah] I mean like
if I'm not exercising already all the more I shouldn't eat there [what] correct or not
ya diet [ah] if cannot exercise then diet [ah]
but I think I want to start back soon [ah] exercising
but <malay>hijrah barang lama</malay> [ah] now the people there all
extreme [ah]
he
#faiz#faiz# <malay>lagi</malay> extreme no I think #faiz# is like the epitome of extreme you know
(mmhmm)
but then I don't know [leh] like I feel like
going to the gym person <malay>pasal</malay> like my friend all say like if I go gym all [ah]
(uh) since I got the height already right
<malay>dorang semua cakap</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> confirm <malay>badan pau punya</malay> [ah]
ya but
the effort [ah] and like
I don't know [eh] I feel like going gym
but gym just very intimidating [ah] like <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>seram</malay> [ah] like go there people all <malay>tengok-tengok semua</malay>
okay
<malay>tak tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi kecil</malay> is okay you know <malay>kecil</malay> cause
like
I don't know [ah] like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
but like if you see <malay>orang gemuk</malay> [kan] <malay>orang gemuk</malay> confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy <malay>semua</malay> [pe]
so but that stigma also like
I don't know [ah] later people <malay>kat</malay> gym <malay>tengok</malay> like [eh] try hard [pe] this guy
a bit
a bit #paiseh# [ah]
but I feel like if I don't start like
forever [sia] <malay>macam gini</malay>
[eh] you know I looked through my gallery right
like
last time during N_S
I skinny [sia]
okay
not skinny [ah] I'm I was skinnier
like I was still big but like
at least I looked proportionate [ah] like don't look so <malay>bulat</malay>
I think hundred and four [ah] (uh) last time I checked was hundred and two
then these days I want to check already but my parents <malay>tak tukar</malay> the battery [ah] for the
weighing scale
so now
I just take as my weight still at hundred and two [ah]
I don't know [eh] my
cause since after N_S right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five [ah]
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
no not really after B_M_T [ah] after B_M_T still got a lot of outfields <malay>semua</malay> [pe] so we still <malay>keluar banyak-banyak</malay>
so
not say maintain [lah] but (uh) after B_M_T can order in already [what] so I always buy #nasi lemak#
<malay>makan banyak</malay> [ah] cause of
ya
then it's cause of N_S [ah] always order in <malay>asyik beli</malay> [jer] then <malay>sekali</malay>
like before I know [ah] like towards the end of N_S [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> getting rounder [ah]
cause army [kan] army the longer
the longer you are in army right the more <malay>lepak</malay> the
the superiors all will be [ah]
ya
so towards the end is like every week
I eat #nasi lemak# I eat Fatty Bom
[eh] fat~
Fatty Bom free [ah] I want to eat [ah]
[eh]
watch your language man
woodlands have at #marsiling#
no no no it's (uh) you know where #marsiling# M_R_T is
it's opposite #marsiling# M_R_T [ah] but not to the polyclinic side [tau]
you know #marsiling# got new shopping mall the where the police post is
<malay>rumah</malay> ella <malay>kat mana</malay> [eh] [oh] ya correct
(uh) (uh) <malay>rumah</malay> ella
<malay>kat belakang</malay> [ah]
towards the M_R_T tracks
like from <malay>rumah</malay> ella you walk to M_R_T tracks
then there's a coffee shop there [ah] Fatty Bom <malay>kat sana</malay>
[oh] ya
but what's the difference [seh]
[eh] it doesn't make sense [leh] I mean like okay like <malay>kau tahu</malay> (uh)
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that [one] is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
but then in this case like <malay>abang gemuk</malay> and Fatty Bom no difference [what] both halal already [what]
so like they <malay>tukar nama</malay> for what [sia]
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name [mah] it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know [ah]
but
that time also <malay>ada</malay> [ah]
so like when I go #lia's# house <malay>senang</malay> [ah]
like if got feels for Fatty Bom [ah] it's just like
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes <malay>sampai</malay> [ah]
no it's not at #afghan# there it's at
(uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> #dunman# sec <malay>kat mana</malay>
ya it's opposite #dunman# sec [ah]
then #lia# my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
[ah] <malay>dekat</malay> [ah]
<malay>malas</malay> [pe] <malay>dah cakap malas nak</malay> exercise
like really like it's like
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance <malay>yang jauh</malay> it's like
#yio chu kang# to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually not that far [ah]
may half the journey [ah] from #yio chu kang# to your house
ya but like <malay>macam</malay>
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
confirm <malay>malas</malay> [sia] <malay>nak keluar</malay> it's easier for you to just order
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars [ah]
the
(uh) #tampines# [one] not so bad [eh]
I know
usually me and #lia# buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
but that [one] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
if only <malay>kalau ada</malay> discount [ah]
usually I get the
cajun [eh] cajun chicken [ah]
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice [ah] the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
(uh) then got the then got the <malay>telur</malay> so it's like more like fried rice like that [lah]
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken [ah]
I never try <malay>abang gemuk</malay> before [ah] so cannot say [ah]
Fatty Bom or FatBoy's
ya
depends [ah] some
you know some of the hawker centre [ah]
the western shop got like secondary school feels [ah]
#Idah's# Kitchen
I don't remember [sia]
is it the one the thai shop take over [ah]
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
[oh] [oh] [oh]
I that [one] I thought that [one] is korean food [what]
[oh] I don't think I ate there before [ah]
now they got new [one] [ah] at Koufu
but a bit <malay>mahal</malay> [ah] that day I eat it's like six ninety
that kind of price [ah]
(uh) the
the whole range [ah] like you know chicken chop (uh)
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff [ah]
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it [ah]
<malay>pasal dorang</malay> ba~ <malay>dorang bagi banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak tapi</malay> even though the portion worth [kan] but I feel like it's like two people portion [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
usually they give like half bowl like that right
but over there they give the full bowl [ah] then the <malay>ayam pun dorang bagi dua</malay>
Koufu you know where the (uh)
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
I think new [ah] the shop <malay>dulu takde</malay> [ah]
but I not too sure [ah] maybe
I don't really remember [ah] because usually <malay>dulu kita orang makan sana</malay>
always <malay>makan</malay> the
japanese shop [kan]
[eh]
how [lah] I want to get better at DOTA [sia]
no [eh] but I play
I play public game like <malay>macam</malay>
always <malay>kena</malay> thrashed [ah]
it's like
if I get toxic opponent [eh] like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good [ah]
maybe [ah] maybe also
but I don't know [ah]
then <malay>aku tunggu kau</malay> download warzone <malay>sampai sekarang belum</malay> download
<malay>kental</malay> [lah]
I don't know [eh] like
I don't know how come your computer <malay>semua</malay> games <malay>tak boleh</malay> [sia]
like
the #genshin# impact also cannot right
but okay [ah] nevermind [ah] because #genshin# like you can't really play with friends [ah] like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode [ah]
like it's more to like <malay>main sendiri</malay>
then you just explore the world yourself [ah]
then
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore [ah]
like cause <malay>dorang ada macam</malay> like a energy system like that
like the call it resin
so
you know [ah] so like (uh) this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge [ah] like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by [lor] then it recharge slowly
then <malay>kau boleh buat</malay> the stuff you need to do [ah]
so it's mostly a waiting game [ah] like you finish
you finish what you need to do already then just <malay>tunggu</malay> [ah]
I don't know [sia] I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
l~ like really the game play is
fantastic [ah] phenomenal
but
I would say [ah] M M_M_O_R_P_G I've play [ah] so far
<malay>tapi</malay>
better than runescape [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
like <malay>kau kena tunggu</malay> [ah] resin <malay>kau</malay> fill up <malay>baru kau boleh main</malay>
ya so it's more of a waiting game [ah] so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term [ah]
ya true [ah]
[oh]
console <malay>pun ada</malay>
P_S_four <malay>ada</malay>
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales [ah] they spent <malay>banyak</malay> [ah]
dude <malay>gila</malay> mam~ like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
they spent like
like <malay>empat ribu lima ribu</malay>
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
so it's like really luck based [ah] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] your luck <malay>macam mana</malay>
I think maple [ah] cause this [one] is very easy to free-to-play
like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already [ah]
like I complete all the story mode already
<malay>pernah</malay> [ah] M_L [ah] last time I buy the skin
ya it's like DOTA like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like <malay>lima belas</malay> [eh]
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already [ah] like
wasteful [ah] spend <malay>duit kat</malay> game
ya some more it's like
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
like
it makes a difference but like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak leh nampak sangat</malay> [ah] like you need like
an advantage is advantage [ah] but like they make it minimal [lor]
so <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>kau macam tak</malay> you like don't know me like that [ah]
since when I even watch soccer
(hmm) <malay>sejak bila</malay>
<malay>sejak bila aku tengok bola</malay>
I don't know [ah] like
I never I've never seen the
what's the word [eh] the
the attractiveness of watching soccer [ah] like it's just
so slow
like <malay>kau</malay> compare <malay>dengan</malay> basketball like very fast paced so like
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
[a'ah] <malay>tapi bola macam</malay>
you wait pass I don't know [ah] maybe just not my thing [ah] I guess
<malay>diam sudah</malay>
[eh]
tomorrow I got no school [ah]
like I book my <malay>solat jumaat tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dah lama</malay> [sia]
wanted to book [ah]
<malay>tapi tak dapat</malay> [ah]
(mm)
since the booking start I never <malay>kena dapat</malay> I think cause I always book late [ah]
so <malay>dah semua</malay> all the slots <malay>dah</malay> fill up [kan] then <malay>dah tak boleh</malay>
<malay>dah tak boleh dapat</malay> slot [ah]
I really not sure [sia]
I think the same week [ah] on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks [ah]
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
[eh] I do tomorrow already
then (uh) <malay>aku tak leh buat</malay> for the next five weeks
[a'ah] so other people can get [ah] but some more <malay>aku selalu tak dapat</malay> [ah]
it
[eh] I think they blacklist me already
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tengok kerusi</malay> all
where you (uh) where you plan on getting
APOL
(uh huh) I only know se~ I only know Secret Lab [ah]
(uh) and s~ streamers (uh) <malay>aku tengok</malay> mostly streamers <malay>pakai</malay> the <malay>ini</malay> [ah] Secret Lab [one]
but then the pricing [eh] similar [ah]
<malay>paling murah</malay>
<malay>asal mahal sangat</malay> [sia] it's just a chair right
like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> even though
<malay>aku bayar banyak-banyak</malay>
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself [what] like it's not genuine leather right
it's P_U leather you know P_U leather actually <malay>murah</malay> [seh]
[ah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
(uh) five hundred dollars on a chair
<malay>kerusi</malay>
(uh huh)
I mean you said it yourself right like <malay>dorang apa</malay> similar [kan]
!huh!
worth it [ah] got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site [what]
<malay>sama</malay> [ah]
I mean okay warranty <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> one for one exchange or what
<malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> right like
<malay>ada koyak sikit</malay>
then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this [one] must ask [ah] I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it [ah]
every other week
<malay>kau ambil pisau kau potong</malay> [seh] already
[oh] really [ah]
okay how about <malay>macam kalau air tumpah</malay>
<malay>air tumpah</malay> on the thing
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but wh~
okay but what if it's like <malay>kau tumpah</malay> [kan] Coke
like you know Coke is very corrosive right
that time <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> (uh) I think
#achap# [ah] #achap# <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> the video
<malay>orang pakai</malay> Coke
<malay>untuk cuci</malay> toilet
ya exactly then people are putting that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks [ah] like even time <malay>hari raya</malay> [kan]
like
(uh) okay usually guest just [eh] (uh) <malay>tuan rumah dorang selalu</malay> just <malay>tuang</malay> [kan]
F&N [pe] F&N is like the standard [ah] the (mm)
my <malay>nenek punya</malay> side more of Coke [ah] so they got like
they got like a lot of Coke
like one what do you call that [eh] (uh) basket
not basket [ah] they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
then another container is all just (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> F&N
s~
ya <malay>hari raya</malay>
so if I go my <malay>nenek</malay> house
it's really just gassy drinks <malay>atau teh</malay>
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea <malay>gitu</malay>
ya different
syrup also not a big fan [ah]
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established [ah]
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons (uh) (uh) the ice lemon tea is the blue colour [one] but they got the
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] the other one <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] <malay>sedap</malay> [ah]
it's
ice lemon green tea
ya you can taste the tea [ah] but the blue colour [one] is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness [ah] ya the sugar
<malay>tak tapi</malay> the best [one] I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari</malay> like everywhere I go like most <malay>kedai tak jual</malay> [ah]
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
it confirm <malay>pernah</malay> it's the orange colour [one]
but <malay>sekarang susah nak cari</malay> I think they stopped production already [ah] I haven't seen it
for a while already [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] (uh)
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job [ah] dude
<malay>takde</malay> ga~ <malay>takde kerja takde gaji takde duit</malay>
<malay>takde duit takde</malay> table tennis
I think no more already confirm <malay>dorang dah buang punya</malay> like the thing so #lup sup# you know
haven't [ah] but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know [ah] I just scared
<malay>macam</malay> repeat
like history repeat itself [ah]
lik~ (uh) ya that's why
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> not that bad because like
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much [ah]
so maybe not that bad [ah]
but then [eh] you got #lobang# for <malay>kerja</malay> or not
ya but like
I don't know [ah] like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all <malay>semua yang tak</malay> halal
in the one that pays well [ah]
ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet [ah]
okay [ah] honestly [ah]
<malay>aku tak pernah kerja</malay> banquet
that time you work [what] no [meh]
<malay>yang sebelah</malay> Hard Rock Cafe
[ah]
(uh)
[oh]
#sheikh# also work kitchen [ah]
[oh]
the one a
[eh] but that [one] also see your manager also [ah]
because
ya cause (uh) my friend from N_S <malay>dulu kerja</malay>
it's not really banquet [ah] but they set up for the banquet people [ah]
<malay>kat</malay>
#shang# Shangri-La
ya so what they do is they just set up the place
(uh) like the table chair stage <malay>semua dorang</malay> set up
then usually it's for like reception <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just <malay>tunggu</malay> for the event to finish then they teardown
I think so like who
[oh] yeah but
but <malay>dorang punya</malay> is more for <malay>ini</malay> [kan] is like
like <malay>apa ni</malay> concerts <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
[ah] ya then this [one] is only for
like wedding reception only [ah]
<malay>kat</malay> Shangri-La that type
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager [ah] so
the manager is like #sheikh# and that [one] also
(uh) like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay [lah]
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much [ah]
he just delegate the work <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>duduk goyang kaki goyang</malay> [ah]
ya
ya
then I don't know [ah] I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends [eh]
ke~ <malay>kerja senang</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah buat banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
[oh] ya but Marche <malay>tak</malay> halal [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan gini</malay> [ah]
(uh)
maybe
[eh] have you went to Fika before
ya [eh] the food there
ya it's
you know where working title is [eh] actually working title closed already it's beside working title [ah]
!huh! they work there
I cannot imagine #rian# at Fika though cause the people there are like really
<malay>berbual</malay> really like proper english <malay>punya</malay> you know and like
how to say [ah] I don't know [ah] I can't imagine #rian# there
like #aidil#aidil# I still can see him [ah] working at Fika but #rian# a bit hard [ah] to imagine him working there
[eh] but the food there the food
the [eh] the ambiance all
top notch [ah]
like work there also I think #swee#
[eh] the food
a bit more to the <malay>mahal</malay> side [ah]
[oh] I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause (uh) my friend tell me their service there is like top notch [ah]
but then my friend say [ah] like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
then <malay>dia dapat banyak apa ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>banyak</malay> freebies <malay>semua</malay>
but then <malay>dia kira balik</malay> [kan] actually what he paid for
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get [ah]
worth it [lah] ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend [ah]
[oh]
but I heard the cakes there good [ah] the <malay>kuih lapis</malay> cake [ah]

(uh)
I want to get better don't know
<malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti</malay> I play for fun [ah]
apex game <malay>dia macam mana</malay>
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> graphics <malay>semua macam</malay> cartoon-ish [kan]
cartoon-ish is like what like team fortress [ah]
valorant is not [sia] actually it's quite realistic [what] is like same as almost C_S go but
only the suit like a bit
[oh] (uh) <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> halo kind of graphic [ah]
[eh] how
are you buying the P_S five or not
sch~ busy <malay>dengan sekolah</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang</malay> P_S five <malay>berapa</malay>
is now is <malay>mahal</malay> cause <malay>orang</malay> resell [eh]
[oh]
I don't know [ah] like <malay>semua orang</malay> like <malay>rebut nak beli</malay> P [eh] actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console [lah]
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] <malay>main</malay> [ah]
like when I go to my <malay>apa ni</malay> cousin's house
(uh)
ya like the first console I owned was P_S_P
(ugh) cause okay
<malay>aku dari dulu</malay> [kan] like
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
my parents <malay>macam</malay>
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing [ah]
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
but computer <malay>pun</malay> my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
ya so
<malay>dorang</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> okay (uh) #haris# (uh)
<malay>kau main</malay> twenty minutes
then after that [eh] you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my P_S_L_E
[eh] [eh] no primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
my father [ah] my father <malay>cakap</malay> like [eh] #haris# (uh) okay [ah]
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy
not really strike a deal [lah] like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three [ah] so like I never really believe them [ah]
(uh) wouldn't say well [lah] like
so [ah] A B
like A B
like I would say it's ave~ okay [ah] above average [ah] slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know [ah] one day I just come home [eh]
suddenly like everyone <malay>kat</malay> (uh) <malay>kat luar</malay> then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the P_S_P
then turns out one was for me [ah] one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted P_S_P I wanted game boy [what]
so my father <malay>cakap dengan</malay> the salesperson the salespersons <malay>cakap like</malay>
[eh] <malay>cik</malay> if you want to buy game boy
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no [ah] but wasted [ah] cause my parents bought P_S_P when it first came out
so it's P_S_P one thousand
[ah]
<malay>dah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah panggil gemuk</malay> [pe]
[ah] ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my P_S_P the slim [one] come out
the once the slim [one] come out <malay>semua beli</malay> [ah]
ya
but then that the closest to console I got [ah] P_S_P
ya but actually the games there quite good [sia]
ya
D_S [ah]
I think D_S take over [ah] the market
P_S_P Vita P_S Vita ya
downfall [lah] ya
then I
but I
I think
I think it's cause it's different [lah] like you don't really have any console yang <malay>kau boleh</malay> use touch screen <malay>kat bawah tapi</malay> still got the tactile buttons
ya it's like
just want to show off features [ah] <malay>ada</malay> dual screen kind of
[ah] that [one] is a Pokemon brand already [ah]
until now right ya Switch
no but Switch still got <malay>ada</malay> animal crossing <malay>ada</malay>
got other games [ah]
but quite popular [what] <malay>aku tengok banyak orang</malay> [sia] <malay>main</malay>
ya don't know [ah] mayb~
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked [ah] don't know [ah] this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he also play animal crossing [ah]
ya
the (uh) he got post on Twitter [ah] I got see a picture of his (uh) like office like that
I think
publicity [ah] like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all politicians like that [what]
got a rea~
probably that [one] also not he play [ah] maybe his P_R team play for him [ah]
ya
!hais!
<malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
[oh] okay <malay>faham</malay> ya
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice [leh]
like I okay this [one] is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular [ah]
until now I looking to play it again you know but <malay>tak [leh] jumpa</malay> [ah] it's called what is it called [eh] (uh)
adventurer concourse I forget [ah]
it is [ah] it's like you build a town like that then you hire hero
(uh) medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no it's one by itself [ah]
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war <malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
total war is what [ah]
is it
[oh] no
ya <malay>apa</malay> [eh] got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro <malay>yang</malay>
ya you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from [lah]
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget [ah] (uh)
I !wah! I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side [ah]
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
<malay>korang boleh</malay> like form a squad then do like
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
(err) (uh) quite cool [ah]
I forgot what's the name of the game [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia</malay>
plazma burst
(mm)
isn't that just (uh)
escape room
[oh] [oh] is it the one <malay>yang kau kena</malay> fix the generators <malay>semua</malay>
and then there's a ghost chasing you
[oh] is it
I'm not sure [ah]
#farid# all [ah]
skipper
#aiman#
#aiman#
[oh] I don't know [ah] I never see [ah] they post on twitter [ah]
I never see before [ah] #ipin# I only see him post M_L <malay>punya</malay> video [ah]
okay [lah] not bad [lah] he was top in singapore [ah] one point of time
for one hero no cause in M_L is as long as you play a hero <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> [kan]
then your
M_M_R for that hero will increase
[ah] so like (uh) he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again [ah]
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore [ah]
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no north singapore region means woodlands #yishun# ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's (uh) asian server [ah]
but they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> clamp the ranking <malay>kena main banyak</malay> [ah]
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
ya for other country is by state so like #johor# <malay>macam</malay> #johor# will be
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in #johor# top in #selangor# top in #sabah# that kind of thing
ya that's why
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to <malay>macam</malay> separate <malay>semua orang</malay>
singapore is one state [ah] singapore is a state [what] it's a state country right
(uh)

is it <malay>tiga hajat apakah hajat-hajat itu</malay>
okay I also wait you think for like one second
[oh] cannot [lah] that one is too <malay>gila</malay> okay maybe I start first
okay
if I got three <malay>hajat</malay> the first one would be I want to talk to my <malay>kucing</malay>
cause because I just like every time I always like talk to my <malay>kucing</malay> and then I become like a <malay>gila</malay> person and I like <malay>berbual merepek</malay> I legit like talk like my <malay>kucing</malay> is my <malay>kawan</malay>
so if I can actually talk in cat language maybe my <malay>kucing</malay> will talk back to me
(uh) (hmm)
but <malay>macam</malay> fun [lah]
!alamak! if <malay>macam tu</malay> then
I will be so scared
[oh] [oh] in the bathtub is it [oh] you
(hmm)
but I want to like <malay>faham</malay> what my cat is talking or like what my cat is thinking
ya
you say something
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) ya
if you get to like <malay>pilih</malay> if you can only travel to the future or to the past
what would it be
ya
ya actually
like <malay>kalau</malay> I'm given a chance to travel back right I want it to like
just be <malay>macam</malay> what's that like you just watch like you cannot do anything to change
ya
ya
ya I <malay>tak nak apa tu</malay> I don't want to travel to the future
cause I <malay>takut</malay> that if I see <malay>macam</malay> what my future is
and then I'll be scared to I don't know go to the future or
<malay>macam</malay> I <malay>risau</malay> [lah] that my what my actions will
will affect the future
[oh] ya that's true but okay example [lah] if in the future I see that I become doctor and then <malay>abeh</malay> I don't know I
okay no change okay in the future I see that I'm some~ something that I don't want to be <malay>macam</malay> engineer <malay>ke</malay>
or <malay>cikgu</malay> then I'll be like [oh] okay [ah] try to like then I'll try to do something that won't make me like a <malay>cikgu</malay>
but actually like in the end also like I don't know then it will affect my like what I'm doing right now [lah] and then <malay>macam tak ada</malay> thrill if I know that in the end I'll become doctor then
ya
then I'll be demotivated to study cause I know my future like okay [lah] later I become a doctor so <malay>tak payah belajar banyak sangat</malay>

ya
<malay>tapi</malay> fun [lah]
okay next wish (hmm)

I want to
not need to sleep
ya but as a wish [lah]
cause <malay>macam</malay> sleeping takes up so much of your time you know my <malay>cikgu</malay> always say that [oh] <malay>kalau</malay> example if you sleep like okay for imagine if you sleep <malay>macam</malay> eight hours a day
that means like your whole <malay>hidup</malay> right you only if you are sixty years old that means you sleep for like one third of your
you'll sleep for twenty years or something cause like eight hours of twenty four hours is like one third right
so he say like just sleep like <malay>empat jam cukup</malay> [lah] <malay>tak payah tidur banyak-banyak</malay>
then I <malay>fikir</malay> also like <malay>betul</malay> [lah]

it's like the most pettiest thing
okay I can I think of one
<malay>alasan</malay> that is <malay>paling</malay> like is okay
okay
I can think of one <malay>alasan</malay> that is very <malay>remeh</malay>
and it's okay
the <malay>alasan</malay> is like is that maybe <malay>dia orang punya suara</malay> is a bit weird like if it's <malay>macam</malay> you know like if you <malay>dengar</malay> like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
by the way <malay>macam</malay> <malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> explain

and usually the #anime# their plot <malay>macam</malay> very exciting and very fun [lah] cause it's not like real life so there's <malay>banyak</malay>
that you can do with the plot
you can <malay>tambah benda merepek</malay> that doesn't make sense or something that isn't <malay>macam</malay> logical in real life

ya so
you know how high volume my work is good <malay> kau tahu
okay [lah] okay [lah] okay [lah] sorry [lah] okay [lah] okay so <malay> apa aku nak cakap okay so basically <malay> macam
it was
(err) during my intake <malay> macam my B_M_T intake
so
I had to focus [ah] <malay> macam
every weekend I book out right <malay> aku terus macam malas [ah] just
like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like (mm)
don't know what to do [ah]
okay then once my
that (uh) batch <malay> habis okay that batch finish
then I was like okay [lah] I need to do something [ah] the deadline coming close
okay I start I do all the needed documents
I print (err) not print I search for all the
(err) (err) what all the
courses that I whatever paper whatever certifications that I got I
<malay> cari [ah]
I dig up for it okay then dig dig
then (err) they want us to submit that online
okay so (err) at that point of time I applied for two course
which is one is the course that you're in what is it [ah] what is it called
okay so I applied for the is honours [kan]
okay
ya so I applied for that one and then <malay> macam
like okay [ah] maybe one application or
one choice a bit too little [lah] so I choose one more
ya but I only applied for one
like I think
they gave me four options or six option I cannot remember but
I don't know I and [ah] [eh] is it I don't know okay
so I was like okay (err) maybe I put two [ah] so one was
infocomm security then the second [one] was
(err)
I think some design or
I_T course [ah] I don't know it's related to I_T but <malay> macam they asked for portfolio

and when [ah] they ask for my portfolio I was like what
okay I have no idea how to put this portfolio

so there this is where I realised
that (um) the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about (err) entertainment or something [ah]
they requested for a portfolio because <malay> macam they want to see what I have done
back (uh) any <malay> macam past experience or whatever
so that I can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should [ah] so
ya that was when I realised [ah] so
what I did was I
like (uh) screw it [ah] I don't want to apply for this course then I delete it from my option
the moment I delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then I was like [oh] okay
ya I only applied for one option [lah] I only put one choice

then <malay> macam
when we expect him to cover for us [eh] <malay> macam we do what he expect us to do
and then
there's a second layer so basically <malay> macam my <malay> encik is my first level
to [eh] no sorry my P_S
is my first level to le~ to complaint [lah] <malay> katakan
and then followed by my <malay> encik
and then basically then go up to O_C [ah] so there's this
thing in S_T_S [eh] there's one more layer in between my P_S and my <malay> encik which is that directing staff
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
(err)
(err) expect a lot from the from us [ah]
basically so <malay> macam
S_A_R standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he ex~ they expect us to be there before that
I don't know

and okay so you know how in
(err) B_M_T they say [oh] okay (err) the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the [one] doing all this (err)
all these checks right correct

so we also have the
<malay> macam what's
we also had the schedule [lah]
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
(err) the [one] that we don't like [lah]
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the thing about (err) the duty (err) is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
for example I have five sergeants one person will do the check for that day or for that morning [ah] <malay> katakan
then
so this directing staff came down he was like [oh] (err) what time already I was like !huh!
what do you mean he's like (err) why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like !huh!
what you expect [sia] you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check [ah]
you get what I mean
ya [lah]
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check [ah] rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like [ha]
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
check <malay> gitu something like that [lah]
so we're like (err) when I going O_R_D it was like [ah] don't care already [ah] because
maybe one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already [ah]
ya
I mean I just worry for my
under studies [ah]
(um)
okay
what you have done [lah] [ha]
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
[oh] don't have [eh]
okay then I guess (err)
(mmhmm)
okay [lah] but okay that
and he still cannot
(mmhmm)

let's say okay you're taking this batch for one month
like then (um)
within that four weeks there is a few weekend correct
are you di~ being disturbed on weekends or no
sometimes [ah]
then for me if I am every week every day
my phone will ring my phone will message got ping [one] confirm I tell you vibrate or whatever [lah]
everyday will do and everyday !hais! th~ that's why I'm getting tired of it
example like (err) interacting with
well
I have to deal with forty two recruits
[oh] then (err) the recruit asking me if I single also that one S_A_F [ah]
is it
serious I got
like (uh) no [lah] no I got one guy during my N_S right
he was in a relationship with one other guy pin in his
in his (uh) vocation training
okay so what happened was (uh) they broke up
they broke up and I was the direct (err) seccom
so ya so like I have to <malay> macam
coax him [ah] like [oh] [eh] don~ don't like (err)
