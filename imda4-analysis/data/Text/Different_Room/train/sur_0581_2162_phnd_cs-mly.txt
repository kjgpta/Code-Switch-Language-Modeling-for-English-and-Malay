so like (um) for me I I pick the shipyard job [ah] because I heard of like very good like (uh) what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing [ah] because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing (uh) <malay>bila kau</malay> sail [kan] (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>enam</malay> months like that

C_C_A
(uh) I haven't pick yet [ah] any C_C_A yet

<malay>apa</malay> choose [ah] the diff~ diff~ various types of sports or
club activities [kan] so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
<malay>kat sekolah</malay> we you can choose [ah] so I for the fir~ for me I pick the <malay>apa</malay> floorball [lah] like something new [lah] for me like I never try before [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
okay [ah] I find floorball quite interesting [ah] like
quite fun [ah] you know enjoyable your [ah] <malay>kawan kawan</malay> you know quite fun [ah]
but like honestly it's not something I like [ah] as a sport [ah] you know if
<malay>apa</malay> sport I prefer
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay S_P got offer quite a few sport [ah]
you know you got <malay>apa</malay> soccer and basketball got tchoukball <malay>gitu</malay>
but I I don't know [ah] for poly I maybe won't pick like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) sports C_C_A [ah] I will definitely choose something else [ah]
maybe like okay so for S_P they got clubs [ah]
(uh) clubs as in <malay>macam</malay>
okay so you know got different schools right
got like the engineering <malay>dia ada punya</malay> business
then you got my school [lah] called S_M_A the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs [ah]
so my one is (uh) S_M_A club
then <malay>macam</malay>
I was planning to join [ah] in the first year <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak dapat</malay> like you must go for <malay>apa</malay>
(uh) interview [eh] (um) when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply [kan] then I went for the interview
like I talk <malay>banyak tau</malay>
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I <malay>tak dapat</malay> you know
[ah] that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like !walao! [eh]
[ah]
ya that's why
but hopefully if I tried apply again <malay>dapat</malay> [ah]
[ah] that's why (mm)
ya ya true [ah] it's okay [lah]
sports
clubs [ah] I think clubs can [ah] but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you S_M_E you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can [ah] S_P so possible
kay
so like for you [kan]
your school what what course you take [ah] for you I know you are in year one but what course [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then what are the modules you will like learn
like for your course other than like programming <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) okay
[ah]
for me personally [kan] (uh) I enjoy the <malay>apa</malay> workshop [ah] not for like year one
because I <malay>apa</malay> secondary school I <malay>pilih</malay> [ah] what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology [ah]
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me [lah] cause I got experience in secondary school [kan]
so like for me is (uh) is fun [lah] cause it's actually something new [ah] some s- some of the what (uh) workshop practice or something you like welding (uh) you got the two types of welding <malay>macam</malay> gas welding <malay>ngan apa</malay>
arc welding [ah] something new [ah] then I <malay>macam lepak lepak</malay> you know
but (err) on workshop cause I workshop [ah] <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> four hours [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is (uh) about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A [ah] you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun [ah] for me
really enjoy [ah] cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun [lah]
ya
ya
then okay for my course right (uh) they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like (uh) different kind of <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia punya</malay> skills [ah]
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three [ah] is where like the interesting part [lah]
cause no no no before the internship [kan]
(err) <malay>apa</malay> they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like <malay>dia macam ada</malay>
what [ah] the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine (uh) fuel system you know so like for us (uh) students right before we go for internship right you must understand [ah] all these kind of (uh) machinery how it works
cause if we just go for (uh) what [ah]
if you just go for interview [eh] no sorry my bad but instead of interview <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) internship when you go for internship (err) what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills [ah] before our internship
[oh] what also [ah]
[oh] ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this (mm)
[eh] they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
(uh)
(uh) purifier room okay purifier room is <malay>macam</malay> like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right (err) you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test [ah] it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like (uh) as the water level rises so it's about five minutes [ah] it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
if I'm not wrong <malay>kita</malay> will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the wat~ okay eventually the wat~ water level will rise [lah] but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast [ah] ya
ya
ya that's why
that test [ah] honestly I haven't experienced yet [ah] cause I only year two now [ah] but something I look forward to [ah]
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me [ah] cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly <malay>macam</malay> like inspection you know like okay as
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or (err) what you call the inspector [lah] so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into [lah] like that [ah] ya
ya hopefully [ah] (mmhmm)
not bad [ah] not bad [ah]
<malay>ape benda</malay> like other things I do other than in school [lah]
kay for me right <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) in my free time I like to game you know
spend a lot of time playing game [ah]
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right (uh) I start off with mobile gaming [ah] then I started moving to <malay>apa dia punya</malay> competitive scene [ah]
(oo) #shiok# [ah] I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two [ah] then the prizes <malay>macam</malay> (uh) gift card vouchers so like as a student I wou~ I would not want to miss out right
<malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so something [ah]
something to kill time also [ah] in secondary school you know
then for you [eh] your free time what you normally do [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what S_P got any C_C_A I join right then for you [eh] cause like you know you are like
(uh) year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any C_C_A for your poly have or not
legit [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(oo)
(mm)
so okay [ah] based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first [ah] cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a C_C_A like promoting C_C_A for you to join right so you go see [lah] which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
ya so you obviously <malay>ada</malay> experience [kan]
so maybe you can make it to what (uh) #Temasek# poly (uh) floor ball team [ah] who knows [ah]
ya who knows who knows but I know the T_P floor ball team very competitive [ah]
know
(mm) can [lah] you just you just go for it [ah] <malay>dulu</malay>
see which one you like the most y'know
[oh]
today [ah] I just finished my
last paper you know today
[ah] okay [lah] because like <malay>semalam</malay> I got study like the whole night you know like <malay>macam</malay> two A_M
(uh) got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one P~ one two hour paper
[oh] my goodness legit
so much to study
okay [ah] hopefully hopefully [ah] hopefully hopefully can pass [ah]
but then [ah] after the paper like
at three P_M <malay>gitu</malay> I went for an appointment [ah]
for what [ah]
it's for like
how should I say <malay>macam</malay>
for my
infection [ah] or it's like how to say it's like a pimple [lah] you know in a sense and it bleeds [ah] so I have to go for appointment [ah]
check up first
and I read up ya it it's very painful and very itchy you know
but then I read up [ah] or on this right it's actually called the pilonidal cyst you know
and it's like ya is what very pai~ what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation [ah] s~ so like okay to~ I pick today's date because I thought like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) it's a weekday and there will be there won't be a lot people [ah]
but then when I went there [ah] my goodness
like legit a lot of people [ah] I tell you !alamak!
legit all the <malay>makcik makcik atuk atuk</malay> !oi! all queuing up [lah]
!wah! then I have to wait you know for like what one hour for my turn [ah]
I register then I have to wait one hour !alamak! no
then you're so crammed you know
[oh] my goodness
some reason I thought week day three plus
nobody will be there [what] right but then got a lot of people [ah] should have picked another day
the surgery [ah] okay so like kay just now I went for the appointment right then the doctor right keep
advising on the surgery
like okay [ah]
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery [ah] cause like I'm only eighteen [kan]
then like it will affect my future [ah]
cause whe~ this surgery is it's like
quite risk [ah] quite high risk [ah]
have to like what cut open that [one] put me on anaesthesia
<malay>gitu</malay> then
once they cut open they take out the <malay>apa</malay>
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
(uh) pull a skin
<malay>macam</malay> a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
so I cannot imagine [ah] [a'ah]
[ah] confirm painful [sia] legit
but
ya I think it's like two months from now [ah]
if I'm not wrong [ah]
ya man
ya hopefully [ah] don't know [ah]
I quite worried also [ah]
like you know might affect you know
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya hopefully [ah] why need to happen [ah]
ya
!wah! honestly right I just I just worried man
cause I go in only they got like a lot of doctors you know I think there was about
three doctors in the room [ah] then they wanted to inspect the you know you know
the wound
then I like quite scared [ah] then they start pinching pinching the wound then a lot of like the
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
the fluid [ah] come out then the blood all come out then I damn scared [ah]
it was damn painful [ah]
for some reason I don't know [ah] damn worried [ah] but overall okay [lah] I I
in two months' time I have to meet the doctor again at hospital you know maybe go for the surgery [ah]
[ah] don't know [lah]
whatever [ah] okay [lah] good good [ah]
ya I also cannot imagine [sia]
(mm)
[eh]
alright [eh]
[ah] I've been thinking right okay so like okay
e

(err) kay
I heard right that (uh) in your free time [kan]

(mm) alright alright
(mmhmm)
what do I normally do <malay>kat rumah</malay> [eh]
(err) honestly okay since I just got a P_C (uh) obviously game all day [lah]
but other than that
I will definitely start doing my own business [ah]
you know like
I will
buy like stuff online and reselling them [ah]
I I've been doing like what one type of business [ah]
the <malay>apa</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> airports cover business obviously not bad [ah] the business the profits [ah] ya

(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm) ya true true
first place I want to travel after COVID [ah] got a lot [ah]

what Gold Coast [ah] !aww! the beach
not bad [ah]
I know right we spend the whole day over there
ya you ya I got sick you know on that day
it was I think okay maybe because our fault [lah] <malay>pa~ pakai apa tuala</malay> you know where our that [one] you know
then we just walk back to the apartment so cold
then the next day we all fall sick fever then cannot go out the whole day wasted right
ya <malay>aduh</malay>
I don't know [lah]
when I free I'll go there again [lah] you know
Gold Coast
ya but I think it will be what a lot of people would want to go [lah] know everybody can now finally travel
but but then <malay>macam</malay> there would definitely be still restriction [lah] you know like beach maximum capacity
like a~ amount of people that can be there you know
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) have you been there before
(oo)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
okay okay something [ah]
okay so
you know when you're like kay now
you finally in T_P right
then there is like you must start studying right you know do you ever like procrastinate when you want to study
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
for me [ah] I also procrastinate [lah] like you know I prioritize my (err) playing games over doing work [ah] my assignments [ah]
but then again if like <malay>apa dia punya</malay> deadline is like
very close right then I'll start doing [ah]
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time [ah] you know because if
I don't do right then my G_P_A will be affected <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me [what] so I obviously have to start on doing [ah]
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over [ah] then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it [ah] you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle [ah] this issue of procrastination cause like
<malay>aku selalu macam</malay>
always [ah] since secondary school [ah]
always prioritise my games over the
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> our school work [ah] ya
(mm) !wah!
damn
ya it is hard [lah] but you know we must [lah] you know
it's very hard [lah] then okay like okay
through T_P I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for T_P is there like any course <malay>ada tak</malay>
ya group projects like that
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
okay
me [ah] okay I have [ah] okay recently
like for this semester one [kan] (uh) I have this (uh) project called S_I_P the module name is S_I_P which is <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
so~ social innovation project [ah] (uh) ya
so like (uh) we all <malay>macam</malay> is
I think combined with
(uh) different types of (uh) people from different courses [ah] so like
(uh)
(uh) two from D_M_R then <malay>macam</malay> two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for <malay>apa</malay> (uh)
to do a project together so basically this like
what S_P is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry [ah]
so S_P equips you with this kind of skill [lah] but let me tell you something [ah] I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you [ah]
cause like (err) it's damn #rabak# I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like !walao! [eh] why why got so much workload [ah] [ah] I don't want do [ah] like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
[ah]
like this
ya
[ah] then okay okay this [one] [ah] it happen like
<malay>macam</malay> a few weeks ago before our final group project so like (uh) it was during (uh) hari raya haji right
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal [ah] for our presentation slides
then these guys right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to (uh) help them with something and present then when I tell them <malay>macam</malay> I say I cannot [ah] I like damn busy today I got my
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate [ah]
then
[oh] then they say [eh] why like that we you the only malay just come [lah] then I say how can like that I holiday [what] hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
[oh] my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining [ah] keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school des~ designs right
they should know the different type of <malay>apa</malay>
(err) the type of programs <malay>dia punya</malay> different types of software [ah] to do like animation <malay>ke</malay>
or like do some drawing design [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] I tell you [ah] these guys [kan] is even the girls <malay>tau</malay>
they <malay>diorang semua</malay> they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of <malay>apa</malay> different type of drawing you know
[ah] !alamak! legit I tell you I don't want [ah] but it's okay [lah]
ya but overall I think it's a good experience [lah]
S_I_P cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together [ah]
and also ya it's good [lah] so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made (uh) okay you know for our project our aim right
is to help people with depression you know so like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
to help people with depression intregate~ integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if us~ usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely [kan]
[ah] they are like damn lonely right
!alamak! why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
more with <malay>macam</malay> (err) people [ah] online people online [ah] like strangers you know not in not strangers [lah]
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use [ah] then we decided to come up with something interesting for them [lah] cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
(uh) our the depression app [ah] counter
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing [ah] like <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>apa</malay> the
Pikachu [ah] Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
then our app also <malay>ada</malay> you have (err) what [ah] you have the therapy consultation tab
kay so what's so special about this tab right
(uh) when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app [kan] they can (uh) what [ah] (uh)
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual A_I controls right so when they talk then they type right say (uh) how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
(mm) it's it's quite cool [lah] honestly
and also (err)
you can also prompt for
(uh) real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one inte~ (uh) what (uh) questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool [lah] ya
ya (um) and also for our app right (uh) we also put what [ah]
(uh) since like most of us like like to game [ah] like we
most (um) people like to game like they download apps for what
(uh) games right
for most people right then
[ah] our app introduces like some mini short games [ah] so you got heard of (uh) what kind of games [ah] (err) like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
[ah] Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
so~ some mini games [ah] like also we put (uh) animal crossing [ah] concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
(um)
games for the user to play with [ah] which makes our app interesting [ah]
ya a lot of people [ah]
(mm)
ya so our app
since our app is based on (uh) like I said the <malay>apa</malay> [eh] the <malay>macam</malay> Pokemon [kan] like the virtual pet right
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins [ah] basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to <malay>macam</malay> what I decide to do [ah]
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
so like the shop right we also have a shop [ah] the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put (err) like the what [ah] poke food poke food includes like the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
what ramen or some like cookie [eh]
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon [ah] which is I think quite cool [ah] so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to [ah] ya
forward to ya
so that's about it [ah] for my S_I_P module interesting [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong (uh)
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two [ah]
ya semester two [ah]
it's called (err)
C_P_R [ah] communicative I can't remember [ah] what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
<malay>macam</malay>
