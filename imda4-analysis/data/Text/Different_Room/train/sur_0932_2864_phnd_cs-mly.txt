most of my job
either work from home or face to face [ah] I preferred <malay>tapi</malay>
also depending [lah] like cause I'm doing project right like I said then <malay>macam</malay>
prefer face to face [lah] so that we
can do things chop chop fast fast just
you know
<malay>habiskan</malay>
I_T projects so basically (uh) <malay>kalau ada apa apa</malay>
clients like we have clients
that come to us and then they say that [oh] I want you to make this app for shopee
so we will take in that project and then we will work on it [lah]
(mm)
you can say that (uh) I do
I do mostly the front end
U_I it's called U_I and U_X design [lah]
so ya not not if you see
[oh]
ya they don't give the option in the skillsfuture [kan]
ya
the comfort of the home
ya
but my project requires me to work with
a few other people [lah] so
ya ya you know the <malay>kalau</malay>
one part of the proj~ the programme is not working
then you have to like
do a video call [eh] hi how (um)
how the project going you know
how how to solve this issue and then takes like few hours to solve it
<malay>macam</malay> (ugh) <malay>malas</malay> [ah] it's better to do face to face [ah] you know like <malay>lincah</malay> can just
look at the computer and then there's
do (uh) [oh] ya
whatever [lah] right now <malay>pun</malay>
we cannot complain much [ah] because

(um) right now <malay>kat sini ada</malay> renovation my area <malay>sini</malay>
forever [sia]
ya
(err) but I feel like
[ah] I just want to
don't you feel like
it's a bit suffocating <malay>kalau</malay> you stay at home work from home
you lacking the human interaction
(uh)
<malay>macam tak dapat jumpa kawan</malay>

she's a
[oh] so right now she's also finding for job [lah]
<malay>kirakan</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] there's some source of income [lah]
but I think <malay>kalau nak kalau nak kahwin sekarang pun macam</malay>
ya considered a luxury [ah] because you have to have a stable job what you don't know what's gonna happen next right
ya
I get what you mean
ya
ya basically
I mean technically we are muslims [what] so we do have to you know
go the proper way <malay>kena ada majlis perkahwinan</malay>
you have to like
we have to have right I mean we have to have the engagement services
services and then (uh)
the wedding services
that one I that one I thought is just a
really [ah] that one I don't know [sia]
that one that one I don't know [sia] I don't know I don't actually know how it works <malay>kalau</malay> your partner is a non-muslim
[oh] really [ah]
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>ada benda macam gini</malay>

(uh) I don't think so
no I don't <malay>tak tak ingat pun</malay> you <malay>ada cakap</malay>
almost three years
(mm)
cause you are thirties right do you feel the pressure from your parents <malay>kalau</malay> your parents <malay>ada</malay> pressure you
your parents <malay>ada</malay> pressure you
it's really you man
ya because like right now I feel like I'm not doing much colourful I don't have a baby you know you know I think it'd be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
[oh] my god I'm the
polar opposite of you
because (err) my parents think that I'm a workaholic
and (err) ya cause I
[kan] <malay>kalau</malay> you are studying normally you just focused on studying right
ya but I prefer to study and work so
at that you know
the stress level is there [ah] I I don't I don't really get much sleep I don't really do much but I I
I like being busy in that sense
so I I tend to neglect <malay>kalau ada</malay>
(um) like I neglect my health a lot
my sleep
so I'm a I'm
quite a workaholic
ya I'm still twenty five also I don't feel the rush you know to
really get married I feel like even if I get married now it's because that
I don't want to you know have a big banquet
for my wedding big crowd I don't like crowd I don't
(uh huh)
(mm)
ya [lah] I feel like
no I feel like I want to get
H we want to we should get H_D_B first then
(um) you engage first then after the engage we set the date right then
before that we need to get H_D_B first then
get the wedding cause some people they get married first <malay>kahwin dulu</malay> [ah] then
<malay>tak ada rumah nak tinggal</malay>
either that or you have to move in with your in-laws right
like I feel like it's quite crowded [lah]
ya I just <malay>nak keluar rumah</malay> you know have your own
house where you don't have to do things under your parents' rule
especially if you are a girl right
especially if you are a girl [ah] then they expect a lot of you
female
get out [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
are you sh~ will you technically will you be shifting to your
to your boyf~ your technically your boyfriend's
place or will you (uh) get your boyfriend to come over to your place if you were to get married

I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know M_R_T or vehicles
but
it's quite scary [lah] <malay>kalau balik malam-malam</malay> then
you will be scared [lah] because

especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation (um)
those (um) touch and run away kind
ya then <malay>ada juga</malay> (uh) <malay>pencuri</malay> which is

I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house [kan]
I take I walk from pioneer M_R_T
then I <malay>jalan balik</malay>
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home

ya
ya my parents on <malay>gila</malay> [lah] you know they are all in all these
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know [lah]
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the C_C
the C_C members and then the C_C members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy

I would confront them but
I'm a very small person

I cannot [ah] I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so #jurong# staying at #jurong# west is quite fitting for me [lah] you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in #jurong# west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the M_R_T
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
fact that you feel like <malay>seram</malay> [ah] especially if you go home late at night
