(mm)
the thing is you don't know that's why
exactly
<malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>aku dah cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dia kalau</malay> comfortable <malay>dengan orang tu dia dia selalu buat gitu</malay>

maybe ten percent ya
I'm not supposed to tell you
I mean you cannot tell [lah] but
I mean some other way <malay>kau boleh macam</malay>
okay you get the feeling
[oh]
ya exactly
I mean if you moved on already what can you say
if the feelings <malay>hilang</malay> already what
okay if caring okay
his one right I think his type of like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) his kind of
convincing or talk or <malay>apa apa</malay> [ah] in general
his type is to like <malay>macam</malay> lead you on
lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
okay <malay>macam</malay> okay
#humairah# said that he still like <malay>macam cakap</malay> to you <malay>cakap</malay>
he talks to #humairah# about you right
K that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say [oh] I just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what I meant by he keeps leading on
[ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay>
so you get what I mean now
that's why
don't high hope [sia]
(mm)
never ya just dont ca~ care about him move on zack is in front of you even if zack doesn't like like you again
maybe in the future may~ maybe will
maybe now he's facing problems that's why he <malay>tak itu</malay>

why
[oh] okay now I get it because
okay [lah] now getting because I think he say because split I do number isn't [ah] linguine with me to select and mulberry is opposite [lor]
I think he said because <malay>kau dah bilang apa izuan alim gila semua dia solat semua</malay> [kan] zack is the opposite [what] that's why he feels like very competitive <malay>gitu dia tak suka</malay>
!alah! <malay>kesiannya</malay> you but did you tell him that
but did you tell him that
<malay>kau cakap apa dalam</malay> letter <malay>tu</malay>
!alah!
<malay>comelnya</malay> okay
[ah]
(mm)
so cute
but like if a guy if you know that he feels like that right
you should just tell him that <malay>kau orang</malay> together not because your expectation of a guy is
<malay>macam</malay> you should say that at least he tried it's easier
[oh] <malay>dia comel bodoh dia kata dia solat</malay>
now what time
okay I mean <malay>dia tak teruk seteruk aku</malay> [tau] but

I say that
<malay>aku ni pakai gini tapi aku tak buat benda gitu</malay>
even if like there's there's plenty of guys asking me for it
but but look like at the kids <malay>yang dah pernah madrasah</malay> even if I don't know they have done it
I wanna see his reaction then he will be like very annoyed confirm
K but very annoyed <malay>itu cerita lain ke</malay>
I literally gave up you know when he said that <malay>aku macam tak nak gaduh</malay> [lah] <malay>diam</malay> [jer] [lah]
he said what layer layer layer <malay>aku cakap</malay> am I not layering that one
[kan]

[oh] #huzni# texted you while we were talking that one
feel uncomfortable [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
I'm not the only one wearing like that what there's other girls also who wear like that
okay it's not it's not bad that he <malay>tegur</malay> but <malay>tegur tu</malay> like
<malay>cakap baik-baik</malay> not not say
it's not his tone it's the way he say it he <malay>macam cakap</malay> can you not wear like that <malay>macam gitu</malay>
I'm just saying ya
ya
<malay>nanti lelaki</malay> will think otherwise that one that that one I don't mind
if he says like that I don't mind but he says as if I'm the I'm the <malay>macam</malay> I'm the one wrong
<malay>tu pasal aku dah macam marah</malay> that's why I was pissed
ya you I look at you then after that I was like thinking
what the hell
ya the one he said when you were what what made him talk about it [ah]
[ah]
I mean it's your opinion on what you wear [what]
<malay>aku dah cakap apa terang-terang</malay> like <malay>kau nak pakai itu masa~ kau kau kalau cuci mata gitu</malay> then it's not my problem
<malay>aku pun</malay> pissed <malay>gila</malay> #wei# <malay>gitu dengar</malay>
you're telling me not to wear things
ya exactly
as a friend okay I understand
your point of view
but don't don't make it seem as if as if it's my fault for dressing like that and then I lure guys into doing it
[eh] you !wah! shit [sia] cannot [sia] like you can see my whole face it's not that obvious
ya even if I I asked #husni# you know
<malay>aku tanya husni gambar-gambar tu</malay>
like it's way before
<malay>aku tanya husni</malay>
I don't know we were talking about [oh] no <malay>kat dalam kereta lepas hantar kau orang balik</malay>
<malay>lepas tu aku tanya dia</malay> like #husni# was like talking because <malay>kita tiga</malay> [jer] [kan] <malay>dah biasa</malay>
then after that we just talk [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) we need to talk about like <malay>macam kesiankan adina semua kenapa dia</malay> emo <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>lepas tu aku bilang</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang macam apa jadi</malay>
like as in <malay>apa jadi</malay> as in like (uh) why is she still feeling sad [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
then <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>cakap</malay> in my opinion I think
<malay>dia masih belum</malay> move on <malay>gitu</malay> ya then after that ya
(mm) and then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>husni cakap</malay> maybe
(err) <malay>husni</malay> came to a conclusion he just said that (um)
because like (uh) that is why you shouldn't play dating app <malay>ni semua</malay>
ya then after that <malay>aku macam</malay> it's like <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> sometimes you just play the dating app just to get to know the person <malay>itu</malay> [jer]
for fun also [what] <malay>kau nak kenal-kenal orang</malay> [jer] [pe]
and then (err) suddenly you say
then he
te~ tell me that (uh) <malay>takpe kau kalau buat pun jaga-jaga</malay> [tau] <malay>lelaki ni semua tak bagus</malay>
okay that one was okay I understand he say that
that is nice if he said that
then after that sudden~ <malay>aku cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> like (uh) the guy I talking to that #irfan#
ya I told you ya it's yesterday
I told him that about that guy [ah] <malay>macam mana dia cakap dengan aku gitu</malay>
then after that I obviously I (um)
(err)
<malay>siapa tu</malay>
<malay>husni cakap</malay> ya just (um) next time just be careful [jer] [lah]
then after that because that #irfan# guy right he commented he com~
he talked to me about my picture
the one that I put
ya
then <malay>kata aku cakap</malay> (um)
<malay>dia cakap</malay>
<malay>aku bilang husni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku tanya dia</malay> in my in your opinion [lah] do you think it's even that obvious can you even see
<malay>pasal tu husni cakap</malay> no you cannot see anything [what]
because it's all black you cannot see the shape
it's just one line <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer]
[oh] so so like what's the problem it's just one line
if you
if guys also do that we can see [what] if I ask #husni# to do #husni# also have [what]
(mmhmm)
!wah! it'll it will trigger me right if he say that <malay>dulu kau pakai tutup aurat lepas tu kau pakai gini</malay>

[ah] the~ the~ after a while until it will wear off you if you ignore [what]
so just <malay>kalau kau tak pakai takpe</malay> [lah]
<malay>buat apa</malay>
this is the first time I post about <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> just <malay>ambil gambar biasa</malay> [jer] [kan]

ya serious
I have no idea but they they <malay>buka</malay> also [leh] like they suddenly just <malay>tak pakai</malay>
so I don't know [ah] it's just
ya

prohibition of wearing hijab right
ya but
(mm) ya
I'm just gonna
it's very stupid if they ban that [lah] <malay>macam bodoh sangat</malay> [lah]
