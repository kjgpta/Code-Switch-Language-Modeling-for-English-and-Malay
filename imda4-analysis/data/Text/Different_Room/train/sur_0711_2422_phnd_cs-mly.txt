why so little [ah] why the food [ah] they are controlling that kind of price [ah]
a small box

but the Malaysian are marking up the price you see
cause they don't want [ah] they want to be the same on par with the Malaysian <malay>punya apa orang kata</malay> commission

you get what I mean or not
so maybe they are earning about two <malay>ringgit</malay> or per box or maybe four <malay>ringgit</malay> per box so Singapore also they will put that kind of price [lah] <malay>tak lebih sangat</malay> commission <malay>daripada</malay> you know Malaysian <malay>punya</malay> counterpart [lah] you know <malay>kalau tak jadi macam perbualan</malay> [kan] competition like that

then (uh) in fact (um) this #Aminah Muslim# right (uh) the the other part~ the other party who was also scammed by her [ah] <malay>dia</malay> also use the same tactics like said the delivery man run away with the items
but when ya when she when she messaged the supplier the direct Thai supplier cause she is the one who gave #Aminah Muslim# this number the contact [lah] so
the the Thai suppliers told her that #Aminah Muslim# <malay>tak</malay> order <malay>langsung</malay>

(mmhmm)
(mm) baby will be sending on Thursday night is it
and then this one I want to ask her to give me the orders by by tomorrow [lah] actually she already give [ah] later [lah] this wholesale [lah] I don't know she want or not
then Thursday she have to transfer to me
[ah] ya but #Su Muhammad#
ya like like real like that [ah]
(mmhmm) like ours [ah] like the ruffle dress I thought that would be a hit but then the ruffle dress is the most difficult to sell actually
ya cause I think the ruffle dress is <malay>pendek</malay>
[kan]
(mmhmm) no the side the mermaid part
but it's very very hard to sell [lah] I don't know why
just put it at #Nina Sazali# it will be a hot kicks [lah] for us <malay>habis</malay> [lah]
[ah] like like ya
[ah] yes yes like Natalie Bella you see Natalie Bella she's selling the same stuff and then she put on influencer you know what I mean
so ya I think we need to invest [lah] but then again I don't see [lah] we don't need to take a lot of stocks [lah] anyway for me [lah] [eh] I don't really
[ah] like they said dream big to have a shop or whatever I don't have that dream to to make it into a shop <malay>macam aku nak pergi sewa kedai ke</malay> I don't have until that goals you see
ya and overhead <malay>kau nak kena ada</malay> manpower
<malay>macam gini ambil macam sambil lewa sambil lewa</malay> you know just on and as and when
(mmhmm)
yes
true
defects
they will ask for a refund
ya so that's why for me when I do this (um) online thingy it's actually for for <malay>aku</malay> to stay at home to do side income not for me to go out and go to another shop
and you know to to to run the shop
yes true cause my kids are still small I I'm I'm also working in the morning you see so I don't see maybe like flea market I'm okay with that cause it's a one once and on on and off <malay>punya</malay> event
but if to to be in a shop everyday I don't think I'm looking forward to that cause that's not where I see myself as unless maybe I don't know my my son and daughter grow up
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) I did a flea market before
no
perfume
(mmhmm)
ya looks like it [ah]
but I think if you buy the garment <malay>kau tahu</malay> you know the steamer the garment steamer that one left hand
(mm)
open and then clear ya it's just like our live [lah] sometimes I don't want to open this you know but then I have to open it
(mm)
ya
ya the man ya
ya but ya I think but once in a while maybe once a month can do this flea market stuff but not like every week you have to do this flea market I'm not into that looking forward to any like you know every week I have to go to a flea market cause for me is much more on you know home-based I don't know I mean some people have big dreams [lah] but I I don't see I don't know how about you
ya I mean I I love to go to a flea market but but then again like you said setup and cleaning up and then manpower I mean you have to have manpower for it [lah]
which is (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya about nine A_M
ya you know like the event in the make up you know like the what last time they always have this exhibition all [lah] what is it called
what is it [ah] expo expo all these [eh] bazaar is it a mini bazaar [oh] my god I I I I've been seeing I did a bazaar before [ah] last time I was working in the bazaar ramadan
making bubble tea [eh]
when I was a teenager I still remember that that bubble tea was a new craze you know that time I was in sec~ sec~
sec~ sec~ sec three or sec four [lah] that time
and it's very tiring [seh] it's very tiring [oh] my gosh
(mmhmm) boss
(mm) some more we will have to think of the money
ya true
so
(mm)
I think I think
ya rather than you have some live you see they have to go to the shop as well cause they have a shop so they do it in a shop so like I said I'm not looking I don't know maybe in ten years time maybe I don't know like what I'm doing right now is just for a supplementary to my income
<malay>berapa</malay> [dah] <malay>lima puluh ke kau</malay> [eh] fifty [eh] okay [oh] ya you're forty now [ah]
[eh] age doesn't matter okay it's just your dream to achieve it the dream even #Saadiah# [ah] she said [lah] next year <malay>kita buka kedai</malay> [lah] I was like seriously
<malay>dia nak</malay> boutique you know boutique she wants to open a boutique like her dream is very big [ah] you know like inside my heart [oh] no way I'm not gonna dream that big you know
[ah] she wants to quit her job yes
but then again I I think that she is like what you know <malay>semangat lima minit</malay> kind of person
alright then after that seeing that art seeing that people can actually sell the dress then she suddenly twisted her her mind again fickle-mindedly wanted to sell dress again
(mm)
she offered she offered but I don't want
knowing her you see how different [ah] from that live with my live
(mmhmm)
anyway if I do for her it's I never come out the money [what]
right so she is the boss
babe the friend staying condo [lah] the friend shipped [ah] buy the stocks [lah] cause when I heard the live [ah] she said self-collect at #Woodlands# not at #Tampines#
so it's from the house
[oh] somebody is crying is it
[oh] <malay>kucing</malay> [ah] [oh] okay cat fighting ya
what to do [eh] cat fighting nature nature
okay so like like I said [lah] so I mean I'm not jealous of the sales or whatever but I'm just a bit pissed off at how she can like <malay>berkinja-kinja</malay> you know at the live she used my words like <malay>wanita lindungan kaabah</malay> all these you know and then but with me !huh! <malay>pening</malay> [lah] <malay>pening</malay> [lah] <malay>pening</malay> [lah] over here <malay>pening</malay> over there <malay>pening</malay>

the other one is the lady's <malay>punya</malay> [ah] (um) <malay>dia punya apa ni</malay> [ah] <malay>anak</malay> (mmhmm)

no no but I'm I'm going to I'm going to give her back [lah] in her own time [ah] I don't want to sell for her anymore [lah] but I don't want to make it so obvious [lah] you know
[ah] ya [ah] but I don't want to make it actually in fact I don't after the incident
ya <malay>tak ada hati</malay> ya cause of the way she treated me as a what
ya and then what she's find find me so low class [meh] cause I don't have any I got a condo maybe you get what I mean like for me [lah] never mind [lah] I mean we can find our own supplies I mean surely but slowly ya slowly slowly we can you know <malay>memang</malay> we never come out with a lot of money [lah] but then again we just order a bit by bit whatever we can [lah] (mm)
