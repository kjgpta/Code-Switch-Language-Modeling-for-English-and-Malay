and yes <malay>aku</malay> currently poly year two right now and I find that it's so stressful coping with work and al
I feel like dying and I'm juggling a lot of assignments [seh] <malay>penat gila</malay
right time management is like the main key of of everything and !wah! how do you cope with everything though <malay>boleh ajar aku</malay> some tip <malay>tak</malay> so I can be better like you since you already cope with poly for like wha
three years and graduate already no
ya <malay>aku lupa kau</malay> biomedical school it's more to science based as far as it's different compared to me and y
mine is like no exam or whatever just project after project and my course currently taking is visual communication but look at you now working full tim
and I think that if you can <malay>tahan</malay> I also can <malay>tahan</malay> with everything I gues
so since you the graduate righ
I'm curious what full time job you currently doing no
!wah! circuit period circuit breaker period also you need to <malay>datang kerja balik</malay> [eh
that's so shag you know since this pandemic like what ever since march or something it's like affecting everything well we at home watching T_V and just feeling like me myself but what to do right adult life and that's how you gonna face through out an
I didn't know you still interested to <malay>sambung sekolah</malay> which uni <malay>kau</malay> plan <malay>nak pergi</malay> you're talking about university right my sister also (um) currently taking part time in S_U_S_S in early childhood or something part time for like three months just to get a certificat
I think you can follow up like that too I gues
right degree lik
no matter what you take for example for diploma or something people will just look at higher certificate nowaday
and [oh] it sounds interesting though and I wish this COVID thing is over so it'll be much more easier for u
an
I think you can cope [lah] knowing you for so lon
and time management is the main key like I said before and you know this pandemic I'm having online class and my eyes degree keep increasin
<malay>aku tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kena buat</malay> specs <malay>baru ke tak</malay> since my nephew already broke mine which I just made for one month only and it's already broke I'm so sa
s
ya <malay>rindu keluar dengan kawan-kawan semua</malay
and what's new right holiday we just sit at home no
can'
it's lesser things that we can do also now this COVID it's corrupting everythin
(mm) why not we go karaoke or something and talking about karaoke I kinda miss how we all use to g
like back in secondary school but if you want to go out also limit also five people so it's kind of hard [lah] cannot bring everyone with us well I'm currentl
in my semester break for like a mont
and coming back school on the october eighteen or something <malay>nak pergi</malay> staycation <malay>tak</malay> since COVID period have a lot of promotion vouchers et ceter
so <malay>murah sikit</malay> for us to staycation for like what two days one night typical and I really I feel like I really need a staycation since like overwork and shit and stuf
same goes to yourself I guess and sucks [lah] like I can't find anyone to go with me everyone is busy and all <malay>sedih</malay> [seh
ya I know you working full time so it's kind of hard for you to take off or something and ya <malay>aku dengar-dengar</malay> there's plenty of hote
for example (um) maybe we can do like it's a a three star hote
I'm hearing from my friend working at one of this hotel <malay>aku dengar</malay> the lyf #funan# hotel not that bad though a lot of my friends recommended me to go ther
you want to check the place out plus it looks like those kind o
korea hotel if I'm not wrong with double decker bed [lah] but don't have pool so I don't kno
maybe we can find something that affordable an
more fun chillax place lik
#shangri la# #sentosa# <malay>ke apa</malay
!wah! really that sounds nice since you've been to lyf hotel before so you roughly know how it's gonna be like but right you're right if we never get a hotel wh~ which come with a pool can just chill watc
netflix order <malay>makanan</malay> or somethin
like around town are
(hmm) but righ
I think we can just search mor
so that we know and plan out early where to go and suc
and yes I like water activit
and if I'm not wrong I think you got send me before the link like like there's kayaking swimming and all those fine things maybe why not we give it a go since like what seventy five dollar for vacation if not interested we can jus
<malay>apa ni</malay> (um
go staycation just chill at the hotel [jer] and since I'm single and you've got a boyfriend I just nee
a girlfriend to <malay>teman</malay> with me and <malay>layan</malay> my nonsense oka
(err) my friend say it's not bad though it'
it's like a #bali# vibe someho
where you can just chil
without anyone disturbing yo
and ya most of the food is not halal but if you don't care so just <malay>makan</malay> [lor
well you better like make time for me and plan this properly plus we deserve this staycation <malay>tak sabar nak jumpa kau semua</malay> [ah] it's been forever and you know just plan beforehand before everyone get busy agai
right it's been like rainy season also can't really do much even <malay>kalau nak tengok wayang sudah lagipun</malay> (um
there's plenty of movies to watch for example mulan or something an
ya besides staycation we can like what cafe hopping there's plenty of cafe in #haji# lane that we can try for example this <malay>apa ni</malay
(um) new restaurant near marina bay and this #taufik batisah
<malay>apa ni</malay> hipster where they sell chicken and waffl
and many more that time I went (um
(um) cafe hopping with one of our old friend with #hidayu# if you can remember her we wanted to try the #taufik batisah# cafe but end up it's like too many peopl
so we end up at this one random restaurant which call aline's cafe like a malay restaurant or somethin
no choice what some more I'm so lazy to walk around so we end up there the food <malay>macam tak sedap sangat</malay> they serve like what past
and the waiting time also like a bit slow so it gets cold by then I didn't really like <malay>tak sedap</malay> [seh] I had to go somewhere else <malay>makan</malay> you kno
but you know me I'm not a walking person s
I just end up at random place instead you remember about #ayu# righ
y
it's really shady honestly like it's only like the two of us in that caf
<malay>aku aku tengok tengok pun macam</malay
why so #ulu# like <malay>tak ada orang masuk</malay> I would say only the two of us no wonder cause the <malay>makanan</malay> not that nic
what to do you know me I'm like lazy walker every~ everywhere I go I just grab or something I hate taking public for some reason cause I hate crowd
and ya [oh] ya the mind cafe I heard about it mo~ most of my friends been there before like <malay>kau boleh main</malay> game board [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] but <malay>entah tak macam</malay
crowded <malay>ke tempat macam gitu</malay> but <malay>takkan kita dua</malay> [jer] [kan] <malay>pergi sana</malay
might as well bring the bring everyone is like so awkward only two of us are playing board board games
ya I'm close with her since I know her like what since childhood or something <malay>kau</malay> [kan] forever awkward in fron
people <malay>tak habis-habis</malay> awkward later you just froze there like nothing to say and just <malay>diam</malay> [jer
and ya maybe one day we can bring bring her along with us or just stay the two of us [jer
and y
anywa
I want to say that (um) since you in a relationship you just have to listen to your partne
right don't really have the freedom to do whatever you wan
but I don't kno
how is it like to b
attached by someone and knowing you right I didn't expect you to be the first one to get attache
cause I don't know back in secondary school <malay>kau</malay> those like nerd type of girl who don't really talk to to people that muc
then end up then end up [sia] [lah] <malay>perempuan ni ada matair</malay> [sia
I don't know how you do it like so low key I'm so curious like how you know what I mean I'm everything I need to post like social media so it's hard for me to deal with tha
ya I guess it's just not you I guess I don't know but it's true [lah] what you say like you don't really have to show everything online so like people <malay>macam apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni perempuan buat</malay> kind of thin

plus can you believe or not he never go out with someone for six freaking years it's that long I I was like no you could have been lying to me [seh] <malay>enam tahun kau betul tak betul</malay
then like ya he never go out with someone for six years and he got a lot a lot of ex [lah] like like sixteen ex girlfriend that was during I mean he is twenty six what do you expect righ
