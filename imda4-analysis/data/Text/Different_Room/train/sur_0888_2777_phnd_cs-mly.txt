[ah] okay
okay <malay>faham juga</malay> but let me tell you something K my type of guy is like you said soft spoken but can argue with me at the correct times
but I'm also specific about whether they are [eh] yes man or no man you know sometimes guys can be like
[ah] ya ya ya do whatever you want or like [eh] no way cannot do that just because you are my girlfriend you can't do that and stuff like that I don't want like that [ah] I want
<malay>bantah</malay> no no no no <malay>bantah</malay> is you shake right
okay to make it simple I just like someone who
won't restrict me from doing the right things in life or at least things that will do me good but at at the same time I want a person who can correct me
like if I do any mistakes they won't just let me go off just like that
just because I'm their girlfriend and don't want to correct me like for example
<malay>kalau saya buat salah macam saya berbual-bual dengan lelaki lain</malay> in a
in a <malay>macam manja-manja</malay> way of course [lah] <malay>mana boleh gitu kita dah ada</malay> boyfriend of course <malay>kita kena setia</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> I prefer <malay>kalau dia macam</malay>
<malay>berbual dengan saya</malay> [eh] you are my girlfriend [seh] [eh] <malay>janganlah buat gitu sebab saya tak akan buat gitu awak tak akan buat gitu kita</malay> happy <malay>sama-sama</malay>
ya I want that type of person it will be so sweet
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya that's true how about your boyfriend is he on the nice side or is he on the mean side
is he mean to me [ah]
that that sounds so wrong [eh]
that's sounds okay okay anyway ya it's very hard to find these sort of nice but not too nice guy I know a lot of man who would say
[oh] this girl is too picky for saying like that if I see these online and then I'm like what the hell do you want to fight me that's like the most basic thing a guy could do for a girl [leh]
don't you think so
ya
do you think you and your boyfriend got lucky I always feel like that not lucky [pe] [seh] but like that time in I_T_E
he went by chance someone said for you to look into his eyes and for him to look into your eyes are like !wahseh! so cute

what
I feel like every time we are at the workplace or something especially if we're at an intern level or like those lowest [ah] of all candidates
we would always get told to do one thing [eh] we get to do one thing and then suddenly when we do that thing suddenly someone else say [eh] don't do it don't do that [leh] like
isn't that the job of another person or something like that then they make us go round and round and around and then I don't know we we will get scolded for it in the end
ya that happened to me also at my workplace (err)
<malay>jadi</malay> my supervisor <malay>ni melayu</malay> you my mentor <malay>pula cina</malay> [lah] then [kan] <malay>ni sebelum</malay> COVID <malay>jadi kita kena buat kerja sama-sama</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi saya yang kena</malay> pass

the person I pass it to <malay>semua</malay> they tell me that it's wrong I'm not supposed to do that then I have to go back you get that feeling
(mmhmm)
yes work from home
ya
yes yes
ya
(uh huh)
[oh] okay but the thing is <malay>yang</malay> the company itself should also update their tablets or their P_C or their desktop or whatever because the thing is we are bound to use it whether at work or what
or home or whatever we will we will bound to use it and when we use it of course you have to use it at an optimum speed [pe]
(mmhmm) what is on your plate
(uh huh)

does she know know not that I know but I feel like I want to find someone for her someone special
I have no idea but you know [lah] like any of our friends who aren't judgmental
I would feel so happy for her too she's so patient with us and I feel like she would be even more patient with her husband or spouse or whatever they call that
ya but at the same time I want to find someone for her but I feel like most of my friends aren't good enough for her [leh] it's ya do you have anyone in mind for her
I know you don't have a lot of friends

(mm) (mm)
U_S elections I
[oh] I don't really care too much about it but I do stay up to date sometimes what about it
(hmm)
ya correct correct and the thing is I feel like (um) to them right voting is just
it's just
something to do and then if it's funny they feel like they should do it which is so weird because in singapore we have this election thing we have to choose and then we are actually serious about it like or we have this good points and bad points
ya (uh huh)
ya [oh] ya
but but the thing is like maybe their country is
of course [lah] their country is super big it's bigger than singapore of course it will be harder to maintain right then I guess [lah] it's
it's harder for them to keep track of the votes and I I also think that most of them are like or I don't want to get involved in politics so I don't want to vote for anyone you get what I mean
ya correct correct but
but most of them still think that we are <malay>macam</malay> or they have a choice to not choose because I feel like
nowadays [kan] everyone is sensitive about everything you you know that
I I saw I saw these two video [ah] it's like satire and then it's basically [ah]
showing that people nowadays almost every single thing you have to be offended about it if you don't feel the same way
no no no please explain
ya
wait wait work culture or walk [oh] woke culture no I never heard of that [leh]
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
suit so
like in [ah] if so basically we just have to be careful with whatever we say is it like right now I'm talking to you [oh] I feel like blah blah blah but blah blah but blah blah so I have to keep adding in defending points [lah]
but no offence to this culture blah blah blah ya you know ya okay I feel like I understand the meaning of woke culture now is it like a also something like let's say you were defending woman
then talk about rapists and stuff like that then suddenly got some guy in the comments
what about man man also will get [ah] okay I understand now what [lah] these people
(mmhmm)
yes

miss really I am not lesbian I have nothing against lesbian I like girls but as at a certain there's a limit to it I like boys I really liked boys thank you for your concern
I think I think mister alan was the one who told her because (um) our first lesson for that day we was with mister alan ya ya I guess okay I I guess I put myself up to it [ah] cause my sleeves was wore right and the blood was like dripping but I cannot do anything over it if
no the thing is if I wanted to fix my scarf right I would be late for school and you know instead of being late for
school I'd rather go [ah] go to school on time and let myself bleed to death that's a natural thing to do
[oh] my god you believe that story how [lah] correct correct okay
I
everyone knows that story was fake lady
[oh]
okay let me tell you [ah] the the real story was that I was fighting with my cats
I was fighting with my cats because they were fighting each other I naturally put my hand there right ya it's why cat
I'm not lying to you now I only lied to you two to three years ago but everyone knows that was a fake story okay everyone knows
okay ya so I was I was there [ah] and you you know you always talk to your cats right ya I always talk to my cats like the humans so I'm like
stop it [lah] what the hell stop stop stop stop stop then I put my hand in between them then one of them
[oh] got caught caught or
what is it what is it called they they hook my hand basically they wrap themselves around my hand then they kick then they bite also then my hand started bleeding [ah]
because they follow the owner I'm their owner so if I'm aggressive I'm an aggressive person ya aggressive also but they are sweet too so which means I'm sweet [ah]
then ya so basically I put my hand to between them and then they scratched me and I cannot do anything about it I'll just
decided or I'll just wash a bit then I go to school [lah] I go to school then mister alan thought I was suicidal weak weak
mister alan did have you seen this snapchat picture I I merge his face with mine
no no no no as in you know snapchat we could merge our face I put my face with his face right
it was the perfect match I look like mister alan in a young girl's body and I felt
weird later I will send you ya okay to sum sum it all up I guess I_T_E !woo! poly !aww!
I feel like ya I feel like going back right I had I don't know
I want to kit from there the kits that are so pretty and so cheap
