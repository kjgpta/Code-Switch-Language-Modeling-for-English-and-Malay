[orh]
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
like you like if you just put it on top of your table it just looks rose gold like I don't know whether is I <malay>mata potek</malay> or like <malay>orang</malay> Apple <malay>mata potek</malay> I do not know like I genuinely don't know
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought MacBook air
cause she's airy or what
(err)
I don't know I upgraded some shit and I don't know what
so like around one seven
so now officially girl girl is broke I [dah] <malay>tak ada duit</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> #makan# <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> you know I was like thinking of buying like
some
sushi for two dollars and I solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and I was like I think the uncle was just like
I thought he was like thinking I'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then I proceeded to take a two dollars sushi I was just standing there just like
should I buy should I no but I'm broke I'm broke I have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then I want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah I'm like (um)
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
I had always had money then after that when I realised that I wanted to buy the a new laptop
then I just set aside all my money and then I started
working to hit one point seven so at the start I think I had about one K already then I need seven hundred more so last month I was broke to get that seven hundred and then now I got the seven hundred then now I'm broke cause I have no money at all you know what I mean
I was
broke because the money is set aside for something what do you mean fake broke <malay>apa</malay> #lan jiao# <malay>kau apa merepek kau nak cari gaduh ke apa</malay>
but I had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so I am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day I was
(um)
going to
I don't know who I was meeting
then
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I
I remember like
this
I don't know why I like just suddenly I was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by Admiralty then I think I saw somebody who looks similar to him or not I just don't know so (um)
so
since I don't know whether I got tell you this story [ah] like since
(um) primary six
right since primary six I was primary six okay like I will like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] my mum <malay>pakai tudung</malay>
so like <malay>dia pakai tudung</malay> then <malay>kalau dia nak potong rambut</malay> [kan] <malay>nak kena pergi</malay> to somebody's house you know to <malay>tutup aurat</malay> and all that [lah]
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
like they are like fucking far extended family kind of shit [lah] but like <malay>raya</malay> have to go to their house cause it's like some <malay>nenek punya nenek punya kakak punya</malay> some shit [lah]
so it's like super complicated then my mum I don't know how she just
like knows the auntie so like she will go like when she was younger to cut her hair then once I started like to <malay>pakai tudung</malay> in primary school my mom brought me there [lah] instead of like the normal <malay>kedai</malay> barber and all that
then since primary six up until last year because COVID was this year what so up until last year I will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
since fucking primary six <malay>sampai</malay> last year this motherfucker has been like forcing me to <malay>jadi dia punya</malay>
daughter-in-law <malay>dalam bahasa melayu apa</malay>
yes okay I keep on forgetting that word obviously <malay>menantu</malay> material right there but like she has been wanting me to be her <malay>menantu</malay> for god knows why like I'm so messed up I'm so fucked up but she still wants me to be her <malay>menantu</malay> you know <malay>dulu</malay> right when I was like like twelve <malay>nanti benda dia</malay> #macam# <malay>kecil</malay> [jer] [ah] #macam# she will be like
[orh] like what do you think of my <malay>anak</malay> like that like <malay>nanti aku duduk</malay> like <malay>dia kasi aku</malay> #makan# <malay>nanti dia cakap</malay> you think by the way his name is okay let's let's give him like give me a nice Malay name like he's actually decent looking he's not ugly
even though I have a thing for Chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a Malay scale if there's something like that [ah] give me a Malay name
kay let's just use
!hais! neither do I but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name [ah]
so his name is
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is something
ya I think
like it's a long name [ah] but let's just use a generic one [ah] then after that
so
(um) she like ask me like what do you think of then I'll be like like <malay>apa kau merepek</malay> like that is your son what am I actually supposed to say you know
then after that like I will just avoid the question just act blur #sotong# and all that all [lah] I don't know what I will do [lah] I cannot really remember
then after that like I don't know about you [ah] but I don't know like what happened like it just started to escalate then like last year right I go and <malay>salam dia punya mak</malay> [lah] cause like I don't know why
then I have to <malay>salam</malay> the mum then
everytime she asks questions like do I have a boyfriend
or all that I will let my mum talk [lah]
then I will just never talk to the aunt even [eh] the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
I <malay>salam dia nya</malay> mum and then straightaway <malay>dia punya</malay> mum was like
(err) <malay>kenapa lambat sangat nak salam mak mentua</malay>
then I was just like
!huh!
!huh! <malay>sejak bila aku ada mak mentua sejak bila</malay> I'm like fucking nineteen and I was like
(err) I'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
<malay>kenapa kau datang lambat tak nak salam mak mentua kau</malay> and I was just confused you know I was just like
number one
lady hold up hold up I love it that you love me so much like thank you I <malay>sayang</malay> you also baby and you always feed me good food but like besides the point I have never even spoken
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that I have never even said hi to
like hi like I don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like is always the mum and the sisters looking at me up down <malay>ketawa ketawa gelek gelek sendiri</malay> and then like he's never there
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then I'm just like I obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like I've never even spoken to the dude before and I don't know why
I thought about that because I think I'm just dreading next year <malay>raya</malay> and then that is one of the things that I'm dreading [ah]
how I cut my hair
[ah] the last time I went to an actual barber
like I <malay>tudung</malay> and all that
ya so after I told !huh!
no after I told my mum that I was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since I went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like I don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six I'm kinda traumatized is how many years already
cause every year I go to her house and every year she will like ask me like do I have a boyfriend what do I think of her son <malay>kau nak jadi aku nya</malay>
(um)
men~
<malay>menantu ke tak</malay> that that happened last year [lah] but like you know it just escalates to suddenly I'm the <malay>menantu</malay> that's all
I don't know baby but what about you do you not ever had harassed
like I don't know it seems like
yeah I even
ya [lah] it's not considered harassed [lah] that's true
but like
[kan] I don't know it's just like a <malay>melayu nya</malay> thing
like <malay>makcik makcik</malay> be really all up in your face be like <malay>kau nak jadi aku punya</malay> men~ (err) <malay>menantu ke tak</malay>
like how do they actually
judge you
per say you know
like
for my
my situation like I actually
they don't even know anything about me other than which school I go to I don't think she even knows what's my favourite colour
and what is she judging me as like on judging me on
when she wants me to be her
<malay>menantu</malay> like girl girl doesn't like to cook I like to bake but I don't like to cook
is that a good men~ <malay>menantu</malay> quality like
you know it's just weird that's just what I was thinking about [lah]
that's all there's that
espec~
especially if <malay>makcik</malay> got a son that is like freaky
like you know older than you or the same age or older gone girl girl bolt outta there and run
get out

okay

okay what the what the heck he's so weird you want to meet your girlfriend but then you also want to <malay>berak</malay> then you don't want to <malay>berak</malay> first and then it's just like
confused
<malay>apa yang dia nak ni</malay>
!ee! [oh] my god dude
I don't know <malay>nak cakap</malay> childish <malay>ke nak cakap tak ada otak ke tak faham</malay> [sia]

[oh] my god okay okay I also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
(err) one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently I met her so it's going to be about two months but not really (um) I heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know I was like thinking
kay wait <malay>kau nya</malay> boyfriend <malay>jumpa mak kau sebab</malay> #macam# <malay>kena</malay> caught is it like like <malay>terserempak kat</malay> some~ somewhere then she's like no
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then I was like
<malay>lelaki tu yang nak lelaki lelaki tu yang</malay> suggest and then she was like ya and I was just like
!huh!
and then apparently like this coming okay I mean today is what day Friday so apparently they say either Saturday or Sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or Sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been toget~ they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
#lan jiao# I've been together with a guy for one year my mother <malay>tak tahu</malay> [sia]
and then this one
ya and cause he's Chinese but like
I cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
actually I also <malay>tak faham</malay> [lah]
so apparently they actually stated to each other both like both of them stated to each other like I'm not gonna play around but is both of their first relationship but then they actually clearly specify I <malay>tak nak main main</malay> okay and then suddenly I <malay>tak nak main main</malay> equals to you <malay>kena jumpa mak</malay> I
so like I <malay>tak faham</malay> girl girl <malay>tak</malay> believe it
even if I start dating like while lo and behold
I go and date some Malay guy I am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like I don't understand
how does this work
I just <malay>tak faham</malay> I was just like
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
was the one who told my friend like [eh] I want to meet your <malay>mak</malay>
but like one week into getting together though
I don't know
I just <malay>tak tahu</malay>
like just touch wood [lah] imagine if you don't
like he's not the one that you marry and then <malay>korang</malay> like !wah! full blown invested like I don't know [ah] I I was just confused I never would
have gotten together in the first place [ah] of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also so
#Aip#</P1> what's up
okay cool
!huh!
what
what
!huh!
wait what I cannot even comprehend that
so this girl like freaking younger than me had a boyfriend <malay>lepas tu buka</malay> bank account
<malay>sebab nak kahwin</malay> like they actually like
<malay>kumpul duit</malay>
<malay>nak kahwin</malay>
are they still together
to get out of jail
[ah]
because I met another person
like the effort
I don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
I don't know
I don't know man
[oh] ya [sia] like I don't know recently like
I I get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
<malay>dulu</malay> I would do it <malay>dulu</malay> I was that kind of girl okay I wouldn't go to the extent of like putting my money
in but I would like
want him to tell me like !hey! we're gonna be in this for the long run [lah]
so okay so
(um)
there's this one friend of mine
like
(um) her name is
then like
[ah]
[ah] yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day [eh] this year and like we are gonna plan for it [lah] like they actually have a plan like a future has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby I love you I love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
(um) she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
[oh] I hope it's going to be you in the end or like I hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing
and then she got so sad
and then
she got so sad that now she wants to try a fucking keto diet
<malay>sebab dia nak kurus</malay>
she wants to try let me reiterate and repeat these again okay she was so sad that he doesn't want to you know like
give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
and you know <malay>dapat</malay>
that body goals I don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya I just that's why I was thinking like I get her point of view like I get it cause I really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time
because you love them that much but then like if you compare it like five months and five years is two different things [ah]
no I just got blocked nose
I don't know why
suddenly like throughout this thing suddenly got blocked nose I don't even know why
but yeah there's that
I just like
[ah]
ya so the next time asked me to drink there you better bring your ass down
and then if texts me I'll let you know
there's that
there's so much
!huh!
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya that's why how to go drinking I ask pay [ah] my daddy
he my zaddy
[ah]
tell you so messy <malay>perangai</malay> everybody <malay>semua perangai</malay> #macam# [sial]
(uh) [ah]

one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
the <malay>sekolah</malay> is in the middle of like a <malay>hutan</malay>
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
(um)
one day I went back home and then I just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
I'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old I went back home I was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
like then next day they went and like find out who the guy who the guy is like <malay>siapa lelaki yang cium anak aku</malay> you know it's like maybe I don't know
but like they went right
my <malay>yayi</malay> and my mum <malay>pergi</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> to the <malay>masjid</malay> and then after that they actually like found out the per~ the guy that kiss me
was like a family friend
it was so messy and then like I was just like I don't even know how he looks like you know <malay>sekarang</malay> I cannot remember like I cannot remember anything
then like
I remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
they will just say you know <malay>lelaki yang cium</malay> <malay>kat madrasah</malay>
[ah] then I was just like
you know <malay>dia</malay> literally casually called the dude that name and apparently that he's still in my life
but I don't know who he is I've never seen him before but his name will pop out like my <malay>nyai</malay> will like talk about it to my mum
somehow
it's so weird so it's kind
I cannot remember but the only thing I can remember is what my mum is telling me which I did
to tell her which is just I just waddle waddle up and then be like mama mama [ah] <malay>ada orang cium</malay> <malay>kat pipi</malay> and then I like went like this to my cheeks and all that and then my mother was like what the fuck is going on
and then my mum went down the next day with my <malay>nyai</malay> to go and see the guy and then apparently the guy like people will fetch your child what cause it's like in a #ulu# place
then when like I was maybe I pointed to the guy or something and then the guy was with the mum and then the mum barely knows my <malay>nyai</malay>
and then I was just like
it's damn weird
ya so ya there's that so I don't know about you but girl girl got kissed at the cheek when she was five
I hate myself so much I was such a hoe
at such a young age
