it is much more (err) not it's much more harder like much more thinking to do because it's a lot more roles like among us is
(err) you just come
[eh] <malay>macam</malay> they are like only one impostor right one role [ah] it's the impostor and crewmate two two roles [ah] basically but this town of #salem# is <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada cakap</malay> jailer <malay>ada cakap</malay> (um)
mayor [lah] then like also same same thing like
the the impostor so called impostor but in town of #salem# the impostor is called the mafias and the mafias (err) the mafias can only attack at night so in the morning people will <malay>boleh macam berbual</malay>
there the town will like discuss on who is the

but if we're in town of #salem# this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say I'm good at the game [lah] but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore

I haven't finish watching demon slayer my girlfriend want me watch the movie so I watch the movie first then I finish the series

the movie is ya for one episode then the movie is <malay>tak salah</malay> twenty <malay>ke</malay> forty [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> the movie
one hour [eh] two hour <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay>
