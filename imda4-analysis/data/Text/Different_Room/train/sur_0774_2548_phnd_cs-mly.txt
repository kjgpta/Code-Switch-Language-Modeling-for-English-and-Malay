hi
my name is #Intan# and this is weird
okay I guess so it's gonna be the same thing maybe <malay>entah bah</malay>
wait wait wait so <malay>kirakan</malay> like you land in Singapore and then after that they give you the mask or like (err)
later on like the when the government give like the government (um) announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give (uh) you
ya we top we we top the rank [ah] isn't it we we top the list for the the number of corona virus cases <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasti</malay>
okay well
well as you know [lah] [kan] I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January (um) there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report (uh) Singapore reported their first case
but by that time (um) we actually had we we we travelled quite a bit before like <malay>kita pergi</malay> #Bangkok# for like <malay>satu minggu</malay> holiday
even though like you know there were threats of (um) like you know this unknown virus being spread around [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
like we didn't care so (err) after that when (err) Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
we went to Japan <malay>habis habis lepas tu</malay> was like that was when it was more heightened initially we were like thinking <malay>nak pergi ke tak nak pergi ke tak pasal</malay>
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but (err) my my boyfriend was like the most #kiasu# of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most #kiasu# and he was very irritating
<malay>dia pakai dia</malay> the kind <malay>macam dia pakai</malay> mask
and then is like he just insist [ah] right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
<malay>habis</malay> like in the aircraft when you know when we are all confined in in a met~ (uh) metal tube with like hundreds of (um) other people like he will refuse to wear <malay>dia punya</malay> mask and I'm like
<malay>aku tak faham</malay> so anyway
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know #Tokyo# is near
yok~ #Yokohama# no is it is it near I mean like (err) there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in #Tokyo# [lah] so
(err) we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like (err) luckily we came back right before when (err) Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other L_Os and (um) L_O_As and whatever
sorry so ya <malay>begitu</malay> [lah] but ya then after that it's like (err)
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
(uh) they took unpaid leave and then after that (err) I I I <malay>tanya dia orang</malay> [lah] like [eh] so what's the deal now are we are you getting fired or like are you staying on (err) what's the situation cause it's like
you know it's very uncertain then <malay>dorang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> lucky [sia] <malay>kau</malay> (um) (um) you left at a very good time and then I'm like
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
but ya <malay>macam begitu</malay> [ah] and (err) like you I'm also looking for a job but getting there but the good thing is I'm studying
so I can balance I can juggle my life with (err) studies I can keep my time occupied [eh] and like you know just do my stuff
you do you remember that (um) the viral video that fiasco the whole #Ateeqah Mazlan# <malay>punya benda</malay> that was super funny
she need to gain sale you know technically okay I mean like you know she put she put her nose where it didn't belong so it kind of like <malay>macam padanlah muka dia</malay>
cause it's like I know I know like she means well but it's like why do you need to go and call up <malay>siapa</malay> H_D_B is it or something is it H_D_B I can't remember
ya <malay>habis tu apa macam</malay> like she called them and then she tries to get like answers from them <malay>dia macam nak dia berniat nak</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> I think I think her <malay>niat</malay> is not to like viral like be like isn't like to to make to close down home based business but it's more to like
spread awareness of like the current regulations that are in place (um) <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) like the current regulations that are in place (mm) related to home based business <malay>begitu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> satisfy is like an understatement because <malay>dorang</malay> I mean like you know like <malay>melayu punya</malay> backlash is like next level <malay>dorang macam</malay> like [oh] (err)
(err) <malay>dia ni dia ni dia ni nak apa nak tutup</malay>
[kan] as in what do they say (uh) they said something about like (err) <malay>nak tutupkan</malay> (err) <malay>nak kacau periuk</malay> [ah]
<malay>periuk nasi orang</malay> something like that I don't know but it's so like ya it's well meaning but misplaced
<malay>dia macam kena dia tak kena pulau dia kena kecam dia kena kecam gila babi</malay> so funny
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her [lah] but as in like the fact is that like stupid [sia] you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible P_R
okay I did not think that it was our good friend #Hadi# <malay>pasal si</malay>
[oh] my god stereotype [sia]
that's another unwanted
of course [lah] I mean like it it I mean he is an unsung hero I mean like during the whole like during COVID [eh] sorry during C_B it's like people will stuck at home okay <malay>lepas tu diorang semua nak kena makan</malay> [kan]
and then half the time like for me my family everybody stuck at home so my mum <malay>macam</malay> frus
then after that she was like (err) even at times at times we we I suggest [lah] okay I say nevermind [lah] mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
<malay>dia orang masih kerja</malay> like you know I mean they are adjusted out there you know I mean like more than (uh) more than ever and like
it's still a <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja tu kerja</malay> [lah] but like you know
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
because it's like I had to leave for dinner after that but like they they they they featured like some <malay>macam</malay>
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked (err) they they featured some characters like you know (um) everyday Singaporeans and everything
(um) like so~ I think one of them was about like (uh) a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to (uh) the needy [lah] basically and (uh) you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not (err) feature
food deliverer (uh) like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like (um) healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
(err) like you know like for example they they do a featu~ they did a feature on like the N_T_U_C (uh) cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
the <malay>apa tu barang barang</malay> for the (err) how do you say the the items for the supermarket [kan]
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
how how long is that show two hours is like <malay>dua jam</malay> I don't think you can like squeeze everything together [lah]
[oh] really
[oh] it wasn't cheap
(mmhmm) but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
highly taxing job for example [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like in a family a a low income family of like for example <malay>dia punya anak dia</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia</malay> special needs kid
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay> the parents are like you know they got retrenched or something and then they're older <malay>habis dorang tak ada</malay> they don't have the means to go and rent a car and stuff like that there's still a lot of things to consider
(um) you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like (um) not considered
people who are en~ like who are eligible for like <malay>macam</malay> help because for whatever reasons they earn
more than like slightly more than the the particular (um) in~ like income ceiling for example and then after that like <malay>macam</malay> (err)
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like (err) very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
a lot of thought in it but I just cannot encapsulate it in words so is like <malay>macam</malay> you know like when you when you read something and then you have thoughts
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
[eh] what
but in order to in order to get
(mm)
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
so is like ya I don't know and we talk about like a couple of different topics also sometimes so <malay>macam</malay> I guess
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
well not really as in like I I at school during circuit breaker circuit breaker's thirteen April right so it was a interesting time for me like (err) because (err) <malay>apa</malay>
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that (um) like
(err) the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading (err) (um) like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
and then after that they started to implement like a lot of different measures and then it was very <malay>leceh pasal</malay> like you know because
there were at least <malay>macam</malay> twenty people in the class then after that like (err) we
(err) our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking [lah] like [eh] so how [ah] you think that next year [ah] no sorry next sem which is like in a month (um)
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
you know home based learning and then after that we were the only ones who are still not doing home based learning so <malay>macam kita</malay> very move very FOMO
so so (um)
(err) we we were like somehow like quite happy that (uh) we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then (err) then we we tested out the Zoom (err) interface then it of like sucked [lah] because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then (err) we had exams
and this was the very funny part so <malay>kita orang punya</malay> exams we <malay> kita ada dua exam like
for for one research module and another one [eh] <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
what is that module I took I forgot [oh] (uh) it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
we were revising and basically we were revising based on (err) what the exam usually entails [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
like like <malay>ada</malay> M_C_Q <malay>ada</malay> open ended and stuff like that and you based on like going to school and sit~ sitting for the exams then COVID happened
so basically we were stuck at home so (err) like the school has to think about something
(err) so that time <malay>nak</malay> like in the end we for the first time in my life actually I did an online exam can you imagine back in when I was working [ah]
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
(uh) there was one there was one module there was one module where they say it was closed book <malay>tapi kita orang macam</malay> like
[eh] get real [lah] <malay>kau ingat apa kita orang tak akan</malay> you know go on Whatsapp <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> text [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak</malay> what's this what's the answer for this but in
<malay>tak ada tak ada</malay>
so it's like (um) basically we were (err) there are there are like three different kinds of exam so <malay>macam</malay> like open task
so this open task (err) is like
a forty eight hour it opens like (uh) forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then (err) it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like (err) by one thirty A_M on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
so <malay>macam</malay> like we get on we we all got go online <malay>lepas tu</malay> we all sit down together
<malay>buka tu</malay> link <malay>duduk</malay> for two hours <malay>ku duduk situ</malay>
<malay>kau buat tu</malay> (err) exam just like a normal exam <malay>tapi</malay> (err) <malay>ni</malay> in the comfort of your own home <malay> begitu
well nothing because okay for that <malay>macam</malay> the time exam [kan] the time exam is like you cannot hire anyone to do it for you
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on [lah]
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me [ah] I personally I rather do myself [ah] because I know I can do it
so it's like it's the thing where I mean like <malay>ada</malay> forty eight hours exam that I had recently it was like
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a P_R assignment so basically I had to do (err)
P_R stuff !hais! like I prepared F_A_Q questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
[ha] you <malay>memang betik</malay>
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to [lah] as in like you know when I left
when I left (err) when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
[eh] thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful [ah] sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work [lah]
I enjoyed my life met so many peo~ many different people <malay>habis lepas tu</malay> like now (err) <malay>bila</malay> I'm like more settled a little in life sort of
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and [oh] my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
(mmhmm)
(ugh) I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive [lah] I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
but like for for uni it's a bit more difficult especially now <malay>pasal</malay> like (err) how to say this like (um) I'm much older than I was obviously
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up [lah] you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the (err) that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it [lah] okay like my my classmates [ah] my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
<malay>dia pandai tahu dia pandai</malay> she graduated from mass comm [eh] no she graduated from advertising
#Ngee Ann# similar course <malay>tapi dia punya dia punya</malay>
distracted <malay>tak tak boleh tahan</malay> so I had a project before just like <malay>macam</malay> like maybe two weeks ago ya so <malay>dia sibuk dengan dia punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>punya</malay> birthday
<malay>habis lepas tu dia punya kerja macam</malay> you know it's a group work
so <malay>nak kena betul betul nak kena duduk</malay> and then discuss <malay>lepas tu nak kena tulis apa apa</malay> in a powerpoint
presentation <malay>nak kena</malay> prepare <malay>pasal kita orang ada</malay> presentation and then after that we have to write a report also
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
two people writing the same report is a mess and a fact is is that <malay>kita kena buat</malay> like a very intensive research initially and then after that is like after that it's like more of like a solution finding kind of thing
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life [kan]
I said to her okay you know what <malay>aku buat aku buat yang</malay> lit review <malay>punya</malay> part <malay>lepas tu yang lain lain semua kau boleh buat senang</malay>
so basically we had like a google docs where we had a dumping ground of like <malay>macam kita orang punya</malay> (um) information and everything
and then the only thing she needs to do is to just write the bottom part of the the the essay the report <malay>itu pun dia tak boleh buat</malay>
and
the fact the fact is like I ain't going to do that but as in like okay so <malay>dia boleh</malay>
<malay>dia boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi mana mana</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia punya</malay> twenty third birthday <malay>dia pergi</malay> prepare all the <malay>apa tu</malay>
gifts for him <malay>bagai</malay> can you imagine twenty three birthday presents
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
because is like even though when I was working <malay>tak ada</malay> chance my boyfriend has ever going to get X number of presents however old he is from me
[eh]
<malay>itu</malay> part time just
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay [lah] I I don't think my my (err) my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
we are online (uh) we doing online lessons right now [kan] so like half the time <malay>kita</malay>
(um) <malay>kita</malay> log-on like at 9 o'clock
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture (uh) eleven (uh) sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
us to participate know like you know breakout groups you know that kind of thing and <malay>leceh gila</malay> then I was like (err)
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah] <malay>malas</malay> [ah] but like so basically like for how many weeks eight eight eight weeks (um)
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
still in my bed and then after that like when they are discussing then after that you know I'll try to make an effort to get off my bed and then after that <malay>duduk dekat atas meja</malay> [lah] and do my work
and then !huh!
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time (err) by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that [lah] so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on (err) in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
this semester so I <malay>macam</malay> like to be able to connect with them in a level (err) I mean like online everything is very cool
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
<malay>apa punya</malay>
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food

no because
no no no like period~ like periodically right periodically (um) (err) Grab host like have this like (err) promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer (um) a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then [oh] no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
(uh) the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so (err) ya
and then (err) so isn't like basically is this was this (uh) service available on (err) Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course [lah] because now everybody can go out already [what]
