hi kira
what are you doing
I a~ I ask what are you doing
what are you doing <malay>bukan</malay> how are you doing
[oh] ya I forgot how is your <malay>haus kau batuk lagi ke</malay>
(mm) cause <malay>aku perasan juga</malay> like I notice your cough in your (um) videos I notice that your voice is like almost gone you know and (um) and also like when you have <malay>kahak</malay> li~ in your throat and then you like you need to clear it before you talk then I'm like why is she speaking like this why is she not (um) clearing her throat first before she talk
ya I didn't know now I know at that time I was like
<malay>kenapa dia ni macam gini kenapa dia kenapa dia tak dia tak rasa sakit ke</malay> and then turns out that you've been having bad coughs like for a long time so how is it is it better now that you started your medication
k~
[oh] o~ okay [lah]
have you how many times you had to use it so far
<malay>susah tak nak pakai tu</malay> like how did you know how to use it did you like Google it because if it was me I would have to Google it
[oh] I think I think I saw that but I think I saw that like <malay>lambat</malay>
[orh] <malay>kalau tak kau macam tak boleh nak nak</malay> inhale like deeply [ah]
must be hard because actually now I'm better but I think when I was in school <malay>pun</malay> I used to have bad coughs <malay>yang dia tak teruk tapi dia lama</malay>
[ah] I used to have to eat a lot of (um) cough medicine but I didn't it didn't get like too bad that I had to go to clinic [lah]
(mm)
I did not know that I think at that time my my sinus was (err) developing my sinus allergy so actually one of my (mm)
symptoms when I'm like having an allergic reaction is that I have a throat I have phelgm
I have <malay>kahak</malay> so I have a lot of <malay>kahak</malay> that goes in my throat and then also in my nose like in this area so <malay>dia macam satu</malay> it's the same thing where it's like all over the place
[ah] so <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> I can recognize it [lah] when I'm having when I'm having a sinus allergy reaction
<malay>macam</malay> at that time I think I didn't know cause [ah] before
how do I what
actually (err) is a lot better that I can eat chocolate now the only thing I'm not eating right now is (um) <malay>tempeh</malay>
(err) <malay>roti kicap</malay>
I know I know a~ no but ya I think the~ these three <malay>yang betul betul</malay> I've been avoiding because
(err) at first <malay>memang</malay> I avoided everything I avoided like #vitagen# #yakult# [lah] yogurt I mean I still don't eat yogurt [ah] <malay>apa tapi macam kalau</malay> yogurt is in (mm) is like a flavor <malay>aku boleh makan tapi macam tak banyak</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia</malay> is is in at yeast allergy a~ it's like (um) (err) fermentation is fermentation because
because yeast [kan] is a product of fermentation [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> temp~ <malay>tempeh pun aku tak boleh makan</malay> because it's like soy bean fermented
(mmhmm)
<malay>kicap pun aku tak</malay>
[ah]
ya <malay>macam tu sebab</malay> [lah] is it's hard for me sometimes to detect what I can or cannot eat because <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] because (uh) in some <malay>kadang-kadang aku makan</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba macam ni</malay>
(err) <malay>apa gatal</malay> but actually you know (uh) when I went to clinic my sk~ it was really bad my skin was in bad condition because I just got like new <malay>macam</malay> active (err) areas <malay>yang gatal</malay> and everything
and he asked me if I started to eat any vitamins recently and I did I started because before that I had a very bad [ah] episode of sinus <malay>punya ni</malay> like <malay>selsema</malay> for like one month
so my dad told me to start (err) drinking <malay>yang</malay> effervescent tablets <malay>tu barakah</malay>
so I did and then he ask me I started (err) started drinking that and then he said that [oh] ya it's very bad <malay>padahal</malay> [kan] I look at the ingredients of the vitamin and it doesn't say anywhere that it contains (um) <malay>macam</malay> yeast <malay>ke apa</malay> but I guess is one of the by products when they make it
(err) so (err) <malay>tapi</malay> recently because I at first I <malay>memang betul betul jaga</malay> my diet and then I notice at this one time okay at this time is funny at that time it was like very very bad
but my aunt she forgot that I cannot eat <malay>kicap</malay> because <malay>kicap</malay> is such a common common thing <malay>kalau kau masak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dia</malay>
ya ya no a~ at that time she's making #nasi goreng# #sambal sotong# tau like leftover #sambal sotong# so <malay>dia letak</malay> [lah] <malay>kicap tu sikit</malay> just for flavour
and then I was a~ I already ate like one full plate and then she's like #aina# I'm just like but I don't know how I don't remember how but she said that she put <malay>kicap</malay> and I was like
<malay>tapi</malay> I was already but you know I can I have medicine to help with the itching so <malay>malam tu aku macam aku</malay> [dah] ready [lah] <malay>untuk makan ubat</malay>
but I realised that I didn't react
so at that bad <malay>macam</malay> is just a little bit because when my skin is not dry so the <malay>gatal pun dia kurang</malay> [lah] I can control it so when (err) after that I realise that you know I should try to because it's been
(uh) nine months since I've been to the doctor
so <malay>macam</malay> I should start
I should start (uh)
trying out food <malay>yang</malay> I'm not eating
so I s~ I drank like vitagen once and it was okay <malay>tapi aku kurang</malay> [lah] I don't make it a habit to drink it a lot
[ah] <malay>cuma sekarang ni aku tak makan roti</malay>
(err) <malay>kicap tempeh</malay> yogurt [jer] [lah]
actually supposed to go and see the doctor <malay>bulan enam</malay> but at that time [kan] I was M_C_O [ah] I couldn't go because clinic <malay>tu dekat</malay> #tangkak#
ya #tangkak# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# but it's far [lah]
(mm)
#tangkak#
it's li~
(uh) is like one or two hours
yo~ you know why because J_B is <malay>betul betul dekat hujung</malay>
<malay>betul betul dekat hujung dekat</malay> singapore like really is like there
so <malay>macam</malay>
ya
because especially because my house is (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #danga bay# which is
I think [ah] the nearest point nearest to this nearest to singapore
beca~ and then my window is facing the (um) memorial the #sungei# that goes like I can see the boats the fishermen boats <malay>ada kelong</malay> and then I can actually see the island of singapore in the distance
ya <malay>tapi</malay> I'm no~ I didn't go to singapore I've never been to singapore
I used to because when I was younger [kan] (mm) <malay>kalau kitaorang balik</malay> #johor#
I and my parents and like their cousin and their siblings [kan] <malay>dorang semua</malay> [dah] ready <malay>bawa</malay> passport cause they would go for a not even a day trip <malay>dorang nak pergi kat dorang cari</malay> (um) like the juice fruit juices that are not here in malaysia some of the products juice juice
juice like the drink yes yes
<malay>dorang</malay> some some [ah] <malay>dorang tak</malay> produce <malay>dorang tak hantar</malay> that brand <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia
at that time [ah]
so they will go there <malay>macam</malay> is a trip for them and then <malay>kitaorang budak-budak</malay> would be left at home it's like freedom for both adults and kids
ya and then
we'll all be like so jealous !wah! <malay>tak dapat ikut pergi</malay> singapore and then I realize and I got older and I realised that singapore <malay>dengan</malay> malaysia <malay>takde beza</malay>
<malay>sama</malay> [jer] [kan] <malay>sebenarnya</malay>
I think I think it's the same also because I grew up in (um) in a neighborhood that's mostly chinese
I think is it's gonna be the same
ya it's the same I think ya <malay>sama</malay> [jer] it's just that you know at that time I was like !wow! singapore
did you (um) see
<malay>apa</malay>
ya
[ah] that's why it's at first it was hard for me because the <malay>memang</malay> my family <malay>memang suka makan roti kitaorang</malay> we can go through like one <malay>bantal yang besar tu</malay> like two days so now substitute is wraps [lah]
wrap wrap
wrap
(mm) so <malay>macam</malay> always <malay>ada tu</malay> or you know like <malay>prata yang</malay> frozen
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> if I go to AEON I will buy the croissant
and make it a sandwich
it's croissant
(mm)
because you took because you took french and now you know how it's pronounced correctly so it's (err) you wonder that I never wonder before you told me that it's pronounced croissant
I think is
croissant
croissant croissant <malay>itu memang</malay> one of the <malay>benda yang paling kelakar</malay>
because <malay>kau</malay> [dah] <malay>terbiasa</malay>
ya <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] cousin <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>belajar</malay>
why are you not eating
[oh]
<malay>tunggu</malay> [jer] [lah] lunch is almost lunch time
are you going to cook or [what]
usually <malay>kau yang masak ke</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya I know she's on medication also
can can
[oh] how old is she
[oh] S_P_M
(mm)
(mm)
(um) I think <malay>dia tak</malay> not used to the routine yet but as a experience based on my experience is a very good
(err) routine to have to moisturize and when I say moisturize [kan] it's not it's not just (um) <malay>sapu</malay> lotion on dry skin you have to be <malay>bilas</malay> with water first and then you have to pat dry and then <malay>baru</malay> you lotion because then <malay>baru dia ada</malay> moisture
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] ya ya <malay>tapi macam</malay> you know if I if I <malay>mandi</malay> awhile like
seven or eight and then I sleep at twelve before I sleep I will just
wear it <malay>bilas</malay> and then I put lotion and then is very effective <malay>kalau</malay> you moisturize it overnight
[ah] ya
[ah]
<malay>dia sendiri dia tak pandai jaga</malay> that's why you know when I was
(mm)
(mm) but when I was younger and it was bad <malay>memang</malay> my mom would <malay>paksa</malay>
like
if she caught me
(err) because sometimes it hurts tau <malay>untuk mandi</malay> cause when you have open sores and then my mum would force and she would watch me
shower
to make sure that I properly (err) you know clean and moisturize
and then she always force me to eat (um) olive supplement olive extract actually is very good
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so <malay>macam masa tu</malay> [kan] I
[ah] <malay>tak tak</malay>
<malay>yang ini yang yang aku makan ni dia</malay> powder <malay>tapi dia dalam</malay> capsule
[ah] and then [eh] that time I cannot I couldn't eat pills I couldn't swallow pills <malay>pasal kau tahu</malay> (uh) <malay>sampai menangis</malay> like I tried to eat it until I cried
and then (err) I gave up you know what I did
I open the capsule onto a spoon <malay>lepastu aku makan</malay>
it's disgusting <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm)
[oh] your your cough medication is too much
<malay>kau makan ubat</malay>
okay [lah] [kan] maybe
maybe you should try you know work yourself up you know <malay>potong tiga ke</malay> to get used to it instead of cons~ <malay>makan powder</malay> [jer]
(hmm)
[ah] you need to take your time [lah]
(mm) have you have you done the L_I portal
<malay>tapi dia macam</malay> faulty [lah]
can <malay>jap</malay> I give you the link cause I just gave it to darren but it's like
it's like (uh) after I register <malay>tak boleh nak</malay> log in <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> website <malay>dia macam</malay> faulty <malay>tu yang si</malay> #nai# <malay>cakap semalam dengan</malay> doctor john
[ah] you when you register to use your <malay>apa</malay> E_M_S <malay>punya</malay> account
(mm)
try [lah] <malay>nanti apa</malay> I think they need to (um) solve on their site before they do before you can log in
you have any idea where you gonna do your internship
(hmm) (hmm)
(hmm)
do you know
other than aquaria or you know I did go to aquaria
(mm)
I get it I get it [lah] but thing is <malay>kat</malay> K_K you need like a car
[ah] to go to work
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [lah] I think that's that's really the only <malay>macam</malay> problem that I have
(mm)
but
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tak banyak pun tapi</malay> they haven't responded to my email
<malay>aku dia ada dia ada dia macam</malay> (err) inquiry box <malay>dekat</malay> website <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] so I I left my email and then the topic was internship and that if they receive (um) interns undergraduate internship pro~ <malay>apa</malay> ya program
<malay>tapi dorang tak</malay> reply maybe I need to email them directly
(mm)
ya actually I I agree <malay>dorang punya</malay> one of the malaysia <malay>punya</malay> government or any authorities when <malay>punya</malay> weak link weak point is that <malay>dorang punya</malay> website is very poorly handle
[kan]
because because I think the people who are in power still are like our parent's age
[ah] <malay>bukan tak pandai</malay> they don't see the need
[ah] <malay>macam kita</malay> [kan] <malay>apa-apa pun kita akan</malay> website <malay>dulu</malay> [ah] website website
so <malay>tapi aku cari</malay> [lah] <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>kat</malay> #johor# <malay>pun banyak juga</malay>
more opportunity <malay>banyak tempat</malay> but it's definitely gonna be far from my house [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] as long as you know
[ah] ya
yes <malay>apa ni apa aku cakap</malay> [oh] when I was in second year
I did go to aquaria [kan] <malay>aku pergi dengan</malay> #shikin#
and I saw (um) some of the stuff <malay>dia tengah macam</malay> recording record of the the fish and the the thing in the tank
<malay>macam</malay> like writing on the clipboard so <malay>aku tanya dia aku tanya dia</malay> (uh) <malay>kalau apa dorang ambil</malay> aquaria <malay>ni ambil</malay> intern <malay>ke lepastu dia kata dia pun</malay> intern
[ah]
<malay>dia cakap apa lagi</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya and then she said that (uh) <malay>apa</malay> I ask [lah] <malay>yang selalunya yang</malay> feeding [kan] <malay>yang</malay> diving and feeding <malay>tu dia kata</malay> anyone that has a diving license <malay>boleh</malay> I'm like [ah]
(mm)
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I wonder also
(mm)
o~ it's hard
<malay>jauh ke dari rumah kau</malay>
<malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> it's either you have a long commute <malay>atau</malay> you <malay>sewa rumah dekat situ</malay> [lah] <malay>sewa bilik</malay>
(mm) actually actually
<malay>kau tahu tak</malay> #fasha# #fasha# <malay>nak buat</malay> intern <malay>kat</malay> #johor#
<malay>sebab</malay> (uh) ya [lah] but she wants to be close with #shami# <malay>dia nak jumpa</malay> [lah]
so this so <malay>kita orang macam</malay> [dah] <malay>pernah cakap sebelum ni</malay> that if she gets an internship in #johor# I would I mean if we get in the around same area
we would rent a place together [ah]
(mm) but don't know [lah]
[ha] <malay>mari mari</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> #johor# <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>besar</malay> so we don't know [lah]
(mm) (mm) <malay>tak tahu kat mana tu</malay> [jer] [ah] when I think that
you know a lot of anxiety regarding our internship because of how it is now
<malay>macam</malay> is I'm so scared
<malay>ye tak pasti macam</malay>
I saw because I se~ did see my brother going through his internship <malay>pun susah gila nak cari</malay> no no company would want
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak nak bayar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I did see some private companies <malay>yang bagi</malay> internship not bad [lah]
I think you just have to find the right one
#wei# you apply to a lot of places and then we see what they offer [lah]
[oh] [ah]
i~ <malay>takde</malay> I'm trying to find material for my F_Y_P <malay>tapi</malay>
I don't know if I can just use the paper that my supervisor <malay>bagi</malay> like
you know did I explain to you my new title
<malay>dia dia</malay> [kan] my old title was combining water quality <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) macromentoes
so I did my field work <malay>tapi</malay> since we cannot go to the lab
I'm doing the same concept but the water quality is
(uh) the data is from the paper that he published
<malay>dia</malay> [dah] published [dah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> co author [jer] <malay>dia bukan</malay> the main author doctor #chan# <malay>lepastu dia ada</malay> data <malay>dekat tempat yang sama</malay> of macromentoes so <malay>aku kena</malay> analyse the data of macromentoes compare it to the published paper <malay>punya</malay> data
yes
so
for my and I'm not sure for my introduction and my literature review should I find more or should I just use
<malay>dia punya</malay> paper as a reference for my water quality part
(um) I think I have a I think I have an idea of how to do it [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> you know [ha] I actually finding the material for me is the hardest part
ya
I also agree about the reading part
<malay>macam aku aku</malay> try the system where when I read I highlight the paragraph
<malay>pastu</malay> I go back to it and then <malay>aku akan</malay> copy paste for the whole paragraph I go I put it in my word document
<malay>pastu</malay> I try to retype it
in a different way
<malay>tapi</malay> sometimes it becomes <malay>macam</malay> disjointed because you know you're taking a lot of sources and make it into one paragraph
sometimes it feels bad <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>gunanya</malay> supervisor
(mm) so far so far my progress is very little
tha~
are we the same
are we the same
[oh] <malay>laju kali ni</malay> supervisor <malay>kau laju</malay>
last sem
last sem <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> supervisor <malay>aku</malay> [jer] <malay>yang asik minta</malay> ya your supervisor was so quiet
I think [kan] I think she knows (uh) means she learn from last sem
<malay>sebab haritu</malay> [kan] <malay>kitaorang ada</malay> meeting mentor mentee [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> doctor #chan#
and then he said that (um) #farid# ask how we how did we do as a class
uhh <malay>macam</malay> on the our F_Y_P presentation <malay>dia cakap</malay>
the examiners all are impressed <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> presentation
<malay>pasal</malay> our presentation wise we are all <malay>macam mantul</malay> <malay>tapi</malay> when it comes to the writing
[ah] writing <malay>kita ada macam</malay> slack
(mm) I think it's a bit be~ it's a bit hard to do when you're not communicating face to face with your supervisor
(mm)
I think must me and my feelings <malay>pun macam gitu macam</malay>
because especially because when you go through when you just discuss through text sometimes your tone doesn't get there
(mm) sometimes <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> [oh] my god is he like mad at me or is he like not not so not satisfied with it <malay>tapi sebenarnya</malay> okay [jer]
<malay>tak</malay>
(mm)
no but you know [lah] how she is she's very like
she's she's encouraging
(mm) ther~ I think
is like we you know we have in this other lecturer <malay>yang</malay> (uh)
the opposite
y~ because sometimes sometimes you do have a questions that are like stupid
[ah] and <malay>tapi aku rasa macam</malay> my supervisor and your supervisor they are not the kind to dismiss that kind of questions <malay>dorang akan jawab</malay>
cause I I've had experience with it before because I did ask stupid questions ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita nak tahu</malay> [kan] we I'm I was scared of doing the wrong thing when I was going on my field trip
make sense (mm)
but you know some some lecturers like to laugh when we ask questions like that
make you feel like
(hmm)
[ah] <malay>memalukan</malay> like you feel embarrassed
did you hear about the girl
<malay>yang dekat</malay> #terengganu# [eh]
did you hear about the girl <malay>kat</malay> #terengganu#
[ah] <malay>yang kawan</malay> [ah]
#wei# <malay>tu gila</malay> [dah]
but my but they said that she's clear of drugs
(mm)
<malay>maksudnya</malay>
<malay>ye lepas lepastu dia boleh</malay> Whatsapp <malay>lagi macam</malay> acting as if like nothing
<malay>macam</malay>
[eh] <malay>bukan bukan mak dia ada kat situ ke</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>macam ramai</malay> [kan] <malay>orang punya</malay> story <malay>macam banyak</malay> version
<malay>kesian</malay> [dah] like
imagine imagine the dad
wife [dah] [lah] <malay>sakit lepas tu anak dia yang anak dia yang</malay> first [kan]
but it's so sad [lah] <malay>tapi memang</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> video evidence [kan] that she entered the house
(mm) <malay>dengan apa</malay> I think like hair in her hand
(mm)
<malay>tak boleh</malay> log in [kan]
[dah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I think you just wait [ah] because think somewhat <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay>
I think someone did text the <malay>yang apa</malay> doctor <malay>jaga situ puan puan</malay> #lin# [eh]
(mm) we just have to wait and see
<malay>adoi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>apa dia</malay>
no if my mum is around I don't cook
(mm)
<malay>aku tak tolong masak aku tolong dia basuh</malay> [jer]
I do the after part
(mm)
[kan] <malay>dia macam semak</malay>
[orh] <malay>dia panggil</malay> okay [ah]
I think my m~
my mum doesn't ask us to help <malay>kalau dia tengah masak</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> after <malay>tu</malay> I usually just go and see [lah] <malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang dia minta</malay> [lah] <malay>minta tolong</malay>
excuse me
<malay>aku pun tapi</malay> <malay>aku kurang</malay> [lah] because <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>tengok</malay> drama <malay>yang aku tengah tengok ni bukan dekat</malay> netflix
so <malay>macam</malay> is a lot of more steps to
to watch it <malay>tapi sebab</malay> you know K drama they are so long
<malay>macam kau kena tengok tu kau kena duduk situ</malay> for an hour to watch it
actually that's why that's why it
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
I didn't watch that because I saw a lot of people <malay>punya</malay> comments
but I think the K drama <malay>yang</malay> I watched that had a lot of (err) long episodes was prison playbook
<malay>itu</malay> [kan] I don't usually watch (uh) slice of life <malay>punya</malay> drama
I usually watch <malay>macam</malay> investigative <malay>atau</malay> medical <malay>tapi</malay> somehow prison playbook <malay>ni</malay>
(err) [ah] best
it's interesting and <malay>dia kelakar</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay> just a nice balance of <malay>kelakar dan sedih ye dia kelakar</malay> more <malay>kelakar</malay> than <malay>sedih</malay>
best <malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> episode <malay>dia yang</malay> one one and a half hours
<malay>lama</malay>
ya #wei#
<malay>ni pun kalau sejam aku rasa</malay> [dah] <malay>lama</malay> [dah]
<malay>sebab</malay> you know I'm used to watching (um) english
english <malay>punya</malay> series english <malay>punya</malay> series <malay>paling lama pun</malay> like forty minutes [jer]
and then <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>kalau</malay> comedy <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>lagi</malay> [lah] twenty minutes twenty minutes [jer]
you know what I grew up on was (um) how I met your mother
that's where I really like pick up on spoken english because I used to read a lot <malay>tapi macam tak bercakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
so when I watched it I pick up on the slang and the the the pop culture the references <malay>macam</malay> inside jokes
<malay>pastu</malay>
ya [dah] you know <malay>masa tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia kat dalam dia kat</malay> channel hallmark
<malay>kot</malay>
and it was at eleven forty five at night every episode <malay>baru</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> my mum was (um) was very strict with this about bed times [ah] usually <malay>macam</malay> ten <malay>tu</malay> we're ready to go to sleep

<malay>pastu kalau</malay>
I don't know [ah] sometimes <malay>dia perasan kot tapi dia macam biar</malay> [jer]
I think my parents do that a lot when we were kids so that you know <malay>biar</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
let us get away because sometimes <malay>kita kena belajar</malay> [lah] to be
you know have to break the rules
especially because <malay>kitaorang</malay> [kan] <malay>ramai</malay> there's like six of us
so my parents sometimes and they used to work both of them when we were kids so I think both of them they were like
[ah] <malay>benda macam ni</malay> is like a small thing let it go [lah]
I used to <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] my sister and I would break (um) bed time
a lot <malay>sebab kitaorang nak baca buku nak tengok</malay> T_V
<malay>baca buku yang</malay> I don't know time at first it was <malay>bagus</malay> you know but then after a while we really like bought a lot <malay>kalau kitaorang pergi</malay> big bad wolf or sale <malay>yang</malay> like ten bucks
and then we would have nowhere to <malay>simpan</malay> and then the worst part is that we have books <malay>yang</malay> we haven't read but we want to buy new
<malay>tapi</malay>
