okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
I definitely eat <malay>rendang</malay>
yes
cause
<malay>rendang</malay> actually that's a good question why <malay>tau</malay> because
I <malay>selalu makan rendang</malay>
when
<malay>hari raya</malay> but then <malay>mak mak</malay>
<malay>mak</malay> always <malay>masak</malay> like anytime she wants
so when she everytime <malay>masak</malay> I everytime <malay>makan</malay> and I love the taste of <malay>rendang</malay>
so I <malay>makan</malay> everyday [ah]
and like you~ you know I have I've ever gone
<malay>dua bulan makan rendang</malay> straight
not really [ah]
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
maybe in~ for my breakfast example then maybe <malay>petang makan</malay> with <malay>roti</malay> then <malay>malam makan dengan</malay> noodle
<malay>faham</malay>
yea
ya [lah] <malay>ketupat</malay> is the best [lah] definitely
you put <malay>serunding</malay> !oof!
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
!huh!
what
why
[oh] okay
actually <malay>kari ayam pun boleh makan dengan</malay> noodles and like
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
you had <malay>lemak cili api</malay> pasta
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle [what]
besides
you know the
#lanzhou# beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes !oof!
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah [oh] my god
you know just now
tender
<malay>sendu sendu apa</malay>
<malay>sedap je</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap</malay>
<malay>pekat</malay>
<malay>sendu lain</malay> [lah]
<malay>sendu lain seru pun lain</malay>
but
the what reason
pettiest
(mm)
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
[oh] my god is that your
<malay>macam</malay> step know it all [ah]
<malay>kan</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> the big shot [ah]
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
people <malay>yang</malay> ego
they are like
how I say [eh]
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no [lah] I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
so <malay>macam</malay>
I just can't stand <malay>kalau orang nak macam nak</malay> step <malay>besar</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> step <malay>orang yang nak</malay> step I really just cannot
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion [ah] <malay>kirakan dia</malay> champion
ya so like
(uh) actually
more better <malay>lebih baik</malay>
<malay>bodoh</malay>
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
[ah] this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
<malay>astaghfirullah</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
then <malay>hidup tak ada</malay> objective
<malay>tak ada makna</malay> ya because for example if someone
right now in the world when there are doctors b~ especially this kind of (uh) jobs doctors so if no o~ they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah (uh) that should be my answer but if
work in terms of because <malay>orang dulu dulu mana ada kerja orang dulu dulu</malay>
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
ya so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so <malay>macam buang masa</malay> [ah] <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
that's what I feel [lah] because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on th~ on the fence [ah] on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I ha~ I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
(mmhmm)
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
he was searching for things that he wants to do so he was trying so many different industries if his he has like failed <malay>banyak banyak</malay> industry he <malay>dah masuk</malay> he fail <malay>banyak</malay>
but then
at forty two [eh] forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
and then after the <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>buat</malay> the apprenticeship <malay>dengan</malay> tattoo artist <malay>dia buka kedai dia sendiri</malay>
at forty five and <malay>kedai dia</malay> successful
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but (uh)
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at [ah]
(mmhmm)
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
(mmhmm) but the moral is don't give up [ah]
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
you <malay>rasa</malay> you
<malay>dah puas</malay> with the thing you <malay>buat</malay> [kan]
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
if not <malay>sampai bila bila pun kan</malay> you <malay>tak akan</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> that this is the life that I want
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said [ah] everything you explore
on after the next day
all that thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> explore remain inside your body
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at [lah]
(mmhmm)
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
!wow! okay
okay
that's the first wish [eh]
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this [one] it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
(um)
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
ya because when I learn a lot of this traditional stuff <malay>kan</malay> you know I did all traditional stuff
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
and <malay>susah untuk kita nak</malay>
<malay>ubah pikiran orang</malay>
yes
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
that society <malay>punya ape tu</malay> what do you call it requirement
the society's
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
[oh] yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel
satisfaction and happiness in all the decisions I take
because sometimes when you do something
you might look back and like [oh] my god I shouldn't have done this I should have done this instead I should have
I don't want that feeling
yes
yeah
even
even if it so if so if it's the wrong choices
you want to be satisfied with it
you would want to be you would want to take pride in it
yeah
so it's like
(mmhmm)
I mean
that's good for you [lah] because I hardly have that
you went through that life path
yeah
ya with me
yeah
ya so to me [ah] I just want that
satisfaction the feel of satisfaction the feel of happiness
<malay>apa</malay>
yeah you go first [ah] I <malay>tak tahu apa nak</malay>
we're like serious people man
skills of every cook [oh]
why didn't you take culinary [eh]
I think you will like breeze through that course easily
[oh] okay
because <malay>melayu</malay> always <malay>masak with agak agak</malay>
so it's nice when it's <malay>agak agak</malay>
ya ya ya
and
and when it doesn't hit it becomes a troubleshooting
journey
yeah yeah
(hmm)
yeah
precisely what I what I I said [lah] it's like this is the journey of troubleshooting
and then it's nice
but okay anyways ya you want to have skills of all the
cooks in the world
I want the <malay>rendang</malay> italian
italian
<malay>rendang</malay>
<malay>rendang</malay>
my last
my last wish
my last wish
it's to me it's not serious but it's fun for me
I wish for the arts industry to
in this country
no it's a fun thing like because
no no like because that's what I really want it'll be fun to be able to like see
our
yeah our our creatives our singaporean grown talent to to display their creativity out there and be appreciated and paid well
and make it as a career with all the talent they have
yeah I want that that'll be great
ya but they don't pay as good I don't want to get into details but
yeah you know I know
yup
yeah yeah
ya so
just just just
you know
okay [ah] what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
