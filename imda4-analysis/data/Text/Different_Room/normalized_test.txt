what he did was he like borrowed money from <malay>kawan aku cakap kawan aku</malay> [lah] [ah] this one guy
I don't know who
I mean I think you can guess [lah] who what this entity is [lah] rather than who <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>abeh lepastu</malay> then
thing is
<malay>kawan aku</malay> texted me
[ah] my our mutual friend <malay>dia cakap</malay>

<malay>lama</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> like with pictures of his house and everything
<malay>tu aku dah macam</malay>

in a bit I thought he was kidding [ah] cause <malay>aku</malay> saw the pictures [eh] <malay>ni</malay> legit [sia]
so I call him [ah] called my <malay>aku</malay> called tenet <malay>aku cakap dengan</malay> tenet [eh]

<malay>aku tak kasi nombor</malay> #wafan# <malay>abeh</malay> I don't know how they got #wafan# number
<malay>abeh aku macam</malay> okay [ah] initially <malay>aku percaya dia</malay> [ah] then afterwards <malay>aku</malay> talk to my friend on the phone [ah] <malay>yang kena</malay>
<malay>tu aku cakap</malay>
[eh] #afan# <malay>kau ingat tak</malay> that time there's this one time <malay>ada orang tiba-tiba</malay> call <malay>kau cakap</malay> they are from A_I_A

<malay>macam</malay> okay [ah]
<malay>abeh lepastu</malay> [ah] [ah] then after we came to the conclusion that <malay>tu yang</malay>
that entity he borrowed the money from [ah] standard [lah] <malay>nak</malay> verify
whether
you just anyhow give random person's number <malay>ke tak</malay> [kan] ya
so that afterwards <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh]
damn
ya
ya
ya
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend <malay>ni</malay> that he didn't know that <malay>dia</malay> would be part of this [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
basically like he was caught in the crossfire [lah]
collateral damage I keep saying collateral damage [pe] <malay>semalam</malay>
<malay>abeh macam</malay> we were just
once in the
<malay>abeh terus</malay> when I call him about it <malay>aku cakap kau</malay> tell me honestly [ah] <malay>kau cakap kau tak kasi</malay> number then afterwards I ask him
<malay>yang</malay> that time this [one]
shady number called my friend <malay>tu betul tak</malay>
[ah]
what you claim it was <malay>ke ini</malay>
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
<malay>abeh dia cakap</malay> [ah] actually <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>asal kau tipu</malay>
you tell
<malay>kau</malay> tell us [lah] when you already in this shit
<malay>kau</malay> tell us properly [ah] <malay>abeh macam terus</malay> sorry <malay>kata dah</malay> clear
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
<malay>aku dah macam dah</malay> !haiya!
last month not a lot [lah] close to one thousand
yup that's it [ah]
at least that's the only thing I know of [ah]
(uh) his credit rating is bad
[oh] <malay>tu aku tak</malay> sure [ah] but he can go there [ah]
I think he needed money A_S_A_P [ah]
ya
so ya <malay>aku abeh lepastu</malay> then yesterday [eh] this morning <malay>ke</malay> yesterday he said
[oh] that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
I'm going to move out and by the end of the month <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
don't do this [ah]
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
cause any harm to me or my family yet <malay>apa</malay> so I don't think it's fair
so <malay>aku cakap</malay> it's okay for you still want to stay here <malay>tapi</malay> like end of the month <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah]
you know right not the end of this month next month [lah] cause our initial agreement was six months [what]
ya by october that was the initial agreement <malay>abeh lepastu dia cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>yang dia nak</malay> extend until first december <malay>aku</malay> okay
then afterwards she said <malay>dia nak tukar</malay> until
(uh) next year
[eh] no ya five <malay>ke</malay> march I can't remember
ya <malay>aku</malay> okay [ah] cause he's been a good
friend [ah]
so far <malay>tapi</malay> then
one thing on top of another [lah] that happen to him <malay>abeh</malay> then <malay>aku</malay> keep telling him don't do this you want to do them not here
<malay>abeh</malay> well
no one listens to me [kan]
the voice of reason
ya
what <malay>macam</malay> very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term <malay>nya</malay> thinking
now I have problem
I have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem I don't care [ah] that kind of thing [ah]
ya
you know those kind of people <malay>apa</malay>
I have a problem their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it fixes my problem now
ya
snowball <malay>anjing</malay>
<malay>dia belum</malay>
<malay>dia belum</malay> move <malay>lagi dia cakap dia nak</malay>
actually by end of this month
<malay>abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah</malay> [lah]
end of next month <malay>dah</malay> okay
<malay>abeh</malay> like he thinks that
I don't know he thinks <malay>macam ye</malay> [lah] #paiseh# [ah]
but
<malay>kau</malay>
if he knew about shade <malay>kau asal buat ni semua</malay> [kan]
like I did tell
ya just say
ya
ya he should have been <malay>tapi</malay>
that's the thing [lah] that's as good as me using your name <malay>abeh aku tak bilang kau macam</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>nak pinjam duit</malay>
but
you know <malay>aku</malay> secretly put you as the <malay>macam kau</malay> applicant [ah] without your consent
<malay>tu</malay> shitty thing to do [kan]
<malay>abeh kawan aku tu gi</malay> #geylang# <malay>dengan dia cakap macam</malay>
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed [ah]
rightfully so [ah] to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
not really doesn't have a place <malay>macam</malay> I dare not kind of thing <malay>macam kau</malay> [lah] basically
you have a place to go but you rather not [ah]
that kind of situation [ah]
ya bas~ basically [lah] same thing [ah]
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it [ah]
but
now seeing this
<malay>aku</malay> didn't really bitch at him about it [lah] <malay>aku tak macam bising ke apa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak</malay>
you know
like I wasn't really angry at him I told I told him upfront <malay>aku</malay> I said
I'm not angry at you <malay>aku</malay> more concerned rather than angry [lah] cause I was not in the receiving end of this [ah] so it's fine [lah]
you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend [ah] rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
cause that time <malay>pun</malay> the previous issue <malay>pun</malay> he didn't tell me then I found out <malay>aku pun</malay> pissed [ah] I told you already not to do that anymore
I have
I have
C_C_A [eh]
his side business side hustle
what
how I know [oh] but
you know people are driven by greed [what] some people do not know how to control their greed
<malay>macam</malay> it's addictive [what]
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you [what]
(um)
ya he left
(uh) some cash cause I don't know [ah] he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
yes of course it got stolen <malay>abeh lepastu</malay> he was really bummed out about it
I keep advising him keep your money in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
alright
<malay>aku</malay>
am thinking [lah] what to do now <malay>abeh ada</malay> other [ah] <malay>ada</malay> issues as well
no he borrowed me money <malay>abeh lepastu aku</malay> trying to recoup back the amount that he took
<malay>bab tu</malay> [lah] he's going to pay back I hope [lah] eventually
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap [ah]
okay
so
(mm)
sort of
#fahim# no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I don't know [lah] whether
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us <malay>ke</malay>
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl [lah]
I mean technically there is a plague going on [ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(hmm)
okay
ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably [lah] [eh]
(mm)
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does [tau] maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
[ah]
from what <malay>aku</malay> understand [ah] my wife said the same thing you get me
ya like it's inside [lah] and so it's called what you said is right correct [pe]
ya
why you were there [lah] at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
#farid# <malay>cakap</malay> he would just <malay>salam</malay> me and just <malay>cam balik</malay>
I mean okay [lah] it's true [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
be a part of it [lah] cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> do feel that every time <malay>aku</malay> hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress [ah] now they divorced [kan]
<malay>aku</malay> every time
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> do feel
(um)
in a moral dilemma every time
that
what I shouldn't be there okay [lah] #kim# said it perfectly [ah] <malay>cakap</malay>
you know I don't feel good that she's there
I don't want to validate this relationship <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want to say <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you cannot hang out with us [ah]
it doesn't feel right [what]
<malay>macam</malay> I want to hang out with him
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that [oh] I'm approving this [ah] it feels wrong [ah]
so it puts us in a tough spot [ah]
back then [ah]
but then eventually what I did was <malay>aku</malay> just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical #farid# [lah]
like shadow boy
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] good names
I think eight years
twenty twelve I think [ah] <malay>aku</malay> don't really remember exactly
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>anal</malay> [lah] then okay anyways stress [ah] <malay>aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas</malay> think
okay
(mm)
<malay>nanti kalau rosak macam mana</malay>
what the
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>cakap</malay> please <malay>boleh</malay> #astagfirullahaladzim#
okay
(hmm)
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> just the
okay let's say it was just <malay>aku</malay> #fahim# and
#loco# [ah]
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] good names okay whatever [lah] <malay>bukannya</malay> [ah] okay anyway <malay>aku</malay> #fahim# and mistress <malay>lepak</malay> just the three of us the whole time
I wouldn't
<malay>tapi</malay> this [one] whole group
know [what]
she's gonna be there
<malay>tak</malay> usually we will know though
it came to a point where if #riz# there she's there
so we knew what to expect [ah]
I mean initially my wife was worried [lah] <malay>dia cakap</malay>
what if you get tempted to you know <malay>macam</malay> add in to the dark side <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
<malay>aku dah macam</malay>
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
(um) from what I see [eh]
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs [ah] maybe she fulfils both not sure
to be fair [kan] <malay>aku</malay> only met his now ex wife [lah] very few times I think
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean let's just laid it all down here [ah] [ah] the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him [ah]
<malay>abeh kalau dia punya</malay> bad points <malay>aku rasa</malay>
she is too deep in this mentality where <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before <malay>cakap macam</malay>
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
you know they don't have [eh] [eh] concrete plan to do whatever [lah] cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial <malay>ke</malay> emotionally or both usually both [lah]
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks [ah]
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all [lah] definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
ya okay it is controversial <malay>tapi</malay>
but <malay>aku</malay> I don't know why I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating [ah] this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
not saying that it's super common [lah] no [lah] just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
[ah] recklessness (um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay>
probably lack of ambition
okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family <malay>punya</malay> background <malay>dia macam</malay> financial background [ah] more than anything [lah] of course [lah] that plays a huge part
[ah] ya privilege [ah] ya [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] to be fair
usually
usually [lah] generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things [ah]
generally speaking [ah]
so based and on that
(um)
scenario like you always quite common [ah] for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible [lah] I'm not saying that
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not [lah] I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay you get my point okay back to her <malay>aku rasa dia punya</malay> other point
bad point would be
she <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [eh] #fahim# [ah] probably it is [ah] maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is <malay>macam</malay> he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would but she did not <malay>macam</malay> many times
ya <malay>aku</malay> agree [lah] I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
or fittest [lah] even
not even the fittest man alive [ah]
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
[oh] did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already [lah]
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what and it's racist [ah]
<malay>aku macam</malay> how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
it's nonsense
ya
no some <malay>apa</malay> no surprise [lah] where you came from like which country you came from
[sial] [lah] brunei
<malay>aku rasa</malay> that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
ya
(mm)
[oh] is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
ya
<malay>aku</malay> believe [kan] the country could do much better if the royal family
okay let's just call them government [eh]
if the government invest in their infrastru~ infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism [ah]
for investment
attack tourism [ah]
yup that's the thing
invest in infrastructure in country <malay>lagi sikit cakap</malay> company
country
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come <malay>abeh lepastu</malay> boosts a lot of opportunities blah the list goes on [ah]
but they don't so <malay>aku</malay> found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia [lah] but still quite bad [lah]
if you look at the [ah] if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free [lah] it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or P_R I think
[ah] then uni isn't free
ya it should be [lah] or very heavily subsidise [ah]
but it's not okay [ah] let's talk about
[oh] so just now you wanted
to ask about
<malay>siapa</malay>
[oh] #khai# right
ya
anything [lah]
ya
[oh]
more
when it comes to that and
other things [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #wan# [ah]
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't happy about with her [lah]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> find that to be very thought superficial is one thing [lah] the other [one] is
too trivial [lah] to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
<malay>lama</malay> [sia]
<malay>kau</malay> okay you talk to the guy before [kan]
you know how we talk [kan]
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> [oh] anyway <malay>dia cerita abeh</malay> then he emphasise one point for that half an hour
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> please [lah] get on to your next point [lah]
something like that [lah]
[oh] mistress
well he consented to it [lah] so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [eh]
she he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know [ah]
then she slimmer
ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> find that
<malay>macam</malay>
if you want to do this
<malay>takpe</malay> why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial [lah] [eh] he said this one line [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> palm his face [ah] he said you know initially I thought
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out #wai# was the one who needed help
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me [lah] [sia]
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> please don't give me a
so ya
I mean that's why he deal [lah] him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant [lah] rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
<malay>macam</malay> there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married [lah] if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her [lah] personally
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see [lah] for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue <malay>ke tak</malay> if it's what you really want then go for it of course [lah] no one listens to my advice [pe] <malay>aku</malay> [kan] just an N_P_C <malay>apa</malay>
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
which she should have done from the start [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu kenapa</malay> she still engaged P_I to follow him around
<malay>aku</malay> just find that very creepy
<malay>korang dah</malay>
<malay>takde</malay> anything anymore together <malay>asal kau</malay> do this also I don't know
ya probably yup
[oh] six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying [oh] my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much <malay>macam</malay> you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her [lah]
fifty percent is fine [what] it's both of your kid anyway
<malay>macam aku</malay> don't agree with the mentality [ah] <malay>ada orang cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua kerja perempuan macam</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>ni untuk kau</malay>
<malay>salah tu semua salah ni</malay>
ya
<malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> you know some people would step up [ah] <malay>dorang macam</malay> believe that they are better at it
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it [lah]
yes I do only <malay>aku</malay> only one t-shirt <malay>aku</malay> don't iron
the rest I have to iron
it's good to have one <malay>kau</malay> at least buy a steamer [ah]
<malay>masai</malay> [sia] <malay>tak</malay> iron
yes exactly
[oh] okay [ah]
(um) so <malay>aku</malay>
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
you know lose not losing weight <malay>apa</malay>
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
#safwan# told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
he said he was at her play [ah] their place [ah] her place there so long if he was their place he and #din# this <malay>mat salleh melayu aku</malay> very confused
his name is #saifuddin#
his balding <malay>tak penting</malay> [ah] but
both of them went over to #fahim# place <malay>abeh</malay> [ah] #ruqayyah# was asleep
then #zafran# I think #zafran# has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her [lah]
so I don't know
<malay>macam aku</malay> gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain [lah] cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared [sia] to the point where <malay>aku</malay> realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it looks like it [lah] I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] when life is good
ya [lah] I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> you can tell [what] there's a huge difference when you look at the photo <malay>macam</malay> from six days ago <malay>ke</malay> ten years ago
then <malay>macam</malay>
[eh]
I really gain like twenty kilo [sia] <malay>macam</malay> you can tell [lah] [pe] the difference
I think for me <malay>aku</malay> at most gain about
ten around ten <malay>aku</malay> actually gain more initially then I <malay>aku</malay> started losing weight
I'm on a
<malay>aku</malay> controlling my food intake these days
<malay>aku</malay> don't really care what I eat more of

ya
<malay>tapi</malay> honestly
<malay>banyak orang suka pergi</malay> thrift shopping
(err) I think at
(err) lucky plaza <malay>banyak</malay>
ya

really
[oh]
[orh]
ya
ya
the best [ah]
I can't believe you know <malay>baju</malay> champion <malay>yang</malay> our parents wear last time
can fetch up to fifty and above <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya
okay no not bad today was good (uh) you know as usual sunday (err) <malay>pergi</malay> football [eh] hang out with the kids had lunch a little bit did a little bit of admin and now I'm back home doing this thing with you how about you okay <malay>tak</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>biar</malay> [lah] I mean like ultimately <malay>kita berbual pun dia orang tak faham</malay> context <malay>pun</malay> then [ah] so [lah] [kan] but anyway <malay>kita boleh</malay> kill two birds with one stone [lah] <malay>orang cakap</malay> [kan]
ya so for me ultimately I don't mind [lah] <malay>apa-apa</malay> topic <malay>pun sembarang pun boleh</malay> (uh) and but since this is useful okay [lah] a little bit of update on myself [lah] (uh) I've been touching base <malay>dengan orang-orang yang</malay> you know those I can get into contact with but [ah] ultimately what is happening is
(uh) the feedback I'm getting is cannot start (err) straightaway and then ask a lot of people <malay>tak nak</malay> (err) <malay>tak nak</malay> (err) not willing to [oh] you know ret~ (err) reticent or unwilling to support right so <malay>ada</malay> chance <malay>kita tengah buat</malay> case work <malay>kecil-kecil dulu</malay> then after that (err) with whatever budget <malay>yang kita ada dulu</malay> then after that
<malay>baru kita boleh</malay> expand from there [ah] so <malay>kita</malay> in essence <malay>kita</malay> gonna start with whatever <malay>yang kita ada sekarang</malay>
!wah! then hopefully maybe <malay>kalau boleh kalau orang nak</malay> support <malay>dia orang datang</malay> join <malay>tapi</malay> price <malay>dia kecil</malay> [ah] starting <malay>tak kita tak boleh macam</malay> price <malay>dia besar macam</malay> (mm) the other tournaments [ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] the <malay>masalah dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
I think okay <malay>yang</malay> league <malay>yang itu dia punya</malay> response <malay>takde orang nak main</malay> [ah] so registration <malay>dia tak</malay> successful [lah]
<malay>tak</malay>
I
ya [lah]
<malay>penat</malay>
<malay>yang siapa yang</malay> organise <malay>ni</malay> league <malay>pasal</malay> like ya [lah] <malay>dia memang</malay> you gonna obviously tell <malay>yang</malay> it's a little too much <malay>terlalu panjang</malay> [lah] for like the amount of effort you get and the amount of money that you win [lah] so is it organised by <malay>yang</malay> the S_F_L_B <malay>tu betul tak</malay>
ya [lah] okay <malay>cuba nampak dia punya</malay> sign up <malay>punya</malay> link <malay>saja tak tahu dia punya</malay> number of <malay>peserta belum tahu</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] <malay>dia</malay> okay [lah] this is a bit too long for to justify whatever is going to they're going to be <malay>naik</malay> even I see okay from my point of view right I think the one tournament thing we can just run it anyway it's just okay there are two benefits for it [lah] the first thing
<malay>kita dapat</malay> (err) to gauge the response of (err) the people who will watch a tournament that we run that's one second thing is (um) anyway always goes on a portfolio <malay>apa-apa yang kita buat</malay> we go on the portfolio and this is also a plus point it goes into two portfolio it's running in organising an event plus <malay>kita punya</malay>
(uh) short casting the (err) portfolio [ah] so I don't see any harm in it I mean whatever we get from it right screw it anyway because we are going to have a (uh) the weekend is pretty much free anyway just clear up a weekend and then just
get it (uh) you know running [lah] the money isn't the particularly important thing for us per se I mean like money is always important [lah] but I mean the grand context of things right if you wanna run something then at least we have something to show for it giving successful then <malay>kita boleh</malay> run
weekly <malay>kalau orang nak</malay>
I mean <malay>kalau orang nak</malay> join weekly
then <malay>kita boleh</malay> run weekly if you want to spice it up a bit more <malay>pun boleh</malay> so at least we have a gauge to see if we run it <malay>habis tak ada orang tengok</malay>
and then after that at least we know <malay>takde orang tengok</malay> then we must improve on marketing or whatever then we get feedback from them from the people if there instantly <malay>kita ada</malay> stand up <malay>tapi takde orang</malay> respond <malay>langsung takde orang nak</malay> join
[ah] <malay>itu pun masalah</malay> then after that we also know that probably we're not reaching out to the right people or the right people are not interested and then we can also can do market feedback and ask them
okay why you not interested <malay>kalau</malay> ultimately if nobody signs up in that way then we put it out then at least you can scrap it move on try it and try again
ya so but at least we find out what in the universe is wrong and for this one right (err) maybe the ones who organise this upcoming D to D league [kan] they obviously didn't foresee that you know they banking too much on the people's (err)
(err) goodwill they are gonna play for cheap many games they are hoping but the price doesn't justify it's too much work just to go and get the amount of money [ah] because people are gonna just end up playing <malay>macam</malay> weekend league and stuff
because why would you play so many games just to get like a hundred bucks when you can play weekend league and then earn like [ah] you're in game players you don't get anything out of the hundred dollars [what]
it's a bit predatory [lah] you can see that he is if it takes fifty percent out of everything right and then he barely has to do anything then administration <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] only problem only headache <malay>kalau ada orang</malay> not happy <malay>ke apa-apa</malay> and then he has to resolve the issues [ah] but apart from that
it's a really long tournament for really very poor pay off [eh] if he eats half of it no
I mean if we pitched it right no tournament sponsor or whatever right it's going to say okay you can take half of it
ya because most of the it is a is a norm right like seventy percent or whatever goes to goes back to the players
ya it's almost every tournament that we casted will <malay>begini apa</malay> it's mostly goes back to the players it doesn't make any sense in my head why anybody would join this in the first place [lah] when and I get why the responses are so poor [lah]
so that's what I think that (uh) on the flipside if your tournament is like that and then we take barely anything <malay>kita</malay> just take as you would say [lah] <malay>duit kopi</malay> [jer] just for like a couple dollars just to
pay for our refreshments or whatever ya
people will be and then and then we get pitch it like
and I mean ho~ honestly if you want to be completely benevolent and make it selling point [lah] hundred percent of the thing so I honestly think yes we don't make money but if it won't suck too badly if we didn't take anything out of it to be perfectly honest
ya but the most important thing is then we get the numbers then we can go and pitch with numbers
and if you can sell it to many people to go and watch it right then those numbers should convert into dollars and cents later on in our other planning for the bigger things [lah]
(mm) that's just my opinion [lah] so I don't mind I don't mind trying I mean anyway there's a lot of people staying at home right now <malay>budak-budak</malay> also (err) <malay>tengah</malay> holiday
ya so might as well try and organize one soon
for christmas <malay>ke</malay> before christmas <malay>ke</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya [lah] <malay>dia takde</malay> continuity between one week and another week [lah] that's the only weak point of having this weekly thing [lah] I mean maybe the weekly thing like I say it's just a
stepping stone or showcase [ah] we gotta think of it that way (uh) because if you don't put anything out then we won't get anything back in
correct [lah]
okay [lah] then I think maybe we can work it [ah] then after that the number of players right we just need to use the standardized [ah] the thirty two sixty four will be nice
then break it down cause it makes it is a direct number right because it's like thirty two sixty four hundred and twenty eight right
ya but I don't know if we're gonna be able to get a hundred and twenty eight people
<malay>kalau kita punya</malay> prize money is at ten bucks each and then after that if we vinyl back
(um) next to every single cent back into the thing if we making a hundred and twenty eight with a total of a thousand dollars worth of prize money right
as easy we can make some there also honestly little bit [lah] not a lot [lah] but we can make a little bit for ourselves also [lah] so with a thousand dollars is a nice number [ah] if you can see a thousand dollar price part
cause everyone loves a thousand dollars it sounds like a nice four figures [ah] like sounds big enough for one day event but then it's only con~ contingent if we can get a hundred people [lah]
I honestly don't know I never entered tournament <malay>tak pernah</malay> enter tournament so in any case I think we should ask guys who entered tournaments your <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> on the chat do they entered tournaments
[a'ah]
okay so
(mm)
(mm) [oh] ya that's also true [lah] so <malay>kalau</malay> let's say we take a I mean I don't mind putting in a little bit to sweetened the board [lah] I mean
ultimately you know put in to get out [lah] (err) in my opinion it's like I don't see any other way
because we cannot straightaway get (uh) sponsors to do anything
(mm)
that's what my hope is that <malay>kalau kita</malay>
(uh) show some sort of (uh) viewership numbers then after that maybe (err) people will start to see and then will like okay we will chip in with some of some part of the
the prize pool [lah] like little bit here little bit there then hopefully we can get some people to help us [lah] but that's why I say [lah] like if you don't kick off with something we will never start
ya and that's the problem [lah] so <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita dah boleh kena</malay>
<malay>kalau keluar duit pun kena keluar duit</malay> [lah] <malay>sikit</malay> [lah]
I mean in essence I don't even think <malay>pasal nak buat duit</malay> [lah] like now so right now it's just I wanna get something off the ground and see [lah] at least <malay>nama kita ada juga orang dengar</malay> then after that <malay>kita boleh juga pakai</malay>
<malay>pakai</malay> footage [jer] <malay>ke pakai</malay> the numbers then we can just shop it around to other sponsors [lah] ya
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm) more
okay <malay>boleh</malay>
(mm)
you know ya that make sense <malay>macam orang senang ke apa duit datang balik apa</malay>
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya hundred and eight dollar <malay>tu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm) you once you get the quarter final [kan] then you get something back [ah]
forty percent <malay>pasal</malay> eight times four eight times five ya
<malay>jap</malay> [ah] forty (err) forty percent is sixty four dollars [lah]
okay can
okay <malay>jadi kau bawa balik dah lima belas peratus</malay> [ah]
top four ya [lah] ya [lah]
also it increases the amount [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
twenty
yup
(mm)
the amounts that we need to be at [lah]
[ah] <malay>masih ada</malay> fif~
(mm) so <malay>kita masih ada</malay> fifteen percent to blame with [lah] whatever it is [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) so the incentive is <malay>banyak orang</malay> sign up [lah]
<malay>tapi kalau dia punya</malay> number uneven <malay>nanti</malay> matchmaking <malay>pun susah</malay>
(mm)
that's why then they automatically capture the buy and automatic <malay>dapat duit balik pun tak</malay> achieve <malay>mesti orang</malay> argue <malay>punya</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> very hard to determine who gets a buy <malay>nanti orang mesti cakap tak</malay> achieve <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>pasal aku kena menang dua dia menang satu</malay> [jer] <malay>mana boleh</malay> [sia]
(mm) so <malay>nombor dia</malay> thirty two <malay>atau</malay> sixty four <malay>itu yang masalah dia</malay>
<malay>nombor dia tak boleh</malay> uneven
<malay>cepat</malay> [ah] <malay>cepat dia orang dapat</malay>
<malay>itu pasal</malay> [lah] and I know sixty four <malay>memang susah</malay> mes~ regularly <malay>kalau</malay> five dollar <malay>punya</malay> registration fee [kan] sixty four
I mean <malay>macam dia orang yang cakap</malay> one hundred twenty eight <malay>tu pasal dia orang tak dapat</malay> apply <malay>apa-apa</malay> free <malay>saja masuk taruh nama</malay> [jer] <malay>tu pasal taruh nama ada orang tak datang apa</malay>
[ah] so this one is a bit more [lah] so the numbers may be smaller but I think they'll be more invested in trying to actually play in the damn game [lah]
ya
I don't know I think we can start with thirty two I think it's a good idea
and like breaking it down
then we if we work on the premise of thirty two open then obviously we have (uh) a number that we can
play with you know but this is only season one if it's <malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>macam</malay> season two [ah] there's more people then we will open it to sixty four
but the numbers then become bigger because the end prizes become bigger we need to gauge I think initially the first (err) the first round [lah] is to gauge interest and to see how many people we can drag in on by sheer force of personality heater
(mm) that's the one thing I think
if <malay>macam kita buat ada memang ada</malay> thirty two players <malay>tapi takde orang tengok pun</malay> hard to go and pitch the any what else <malay>apa</malay> cannot justify
to others
(mm)
okay <malay>boleh kalau kita nak pergi</malay> end and (um) I am no qualms <malay>kalau kita</malay> deal <malay>kat</malay> N with who is he working for SCOGA or is he working with SCOGA <malay>itu yang</malay> question <malay>dia</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) so <malay>tak ke sama macam</malay> all the other events <malay>yang</malay> (um) <malay>itu macam</malay> supported by SCOGA you know <malay>apa</malay> we can still have branded our way but supported by SCOGA
while the other events <malay>pun nampak macam dia orang</malay> is put (err) supported by SCOGA it's not even really truly sponsored by SCOGA
[ah] so maybe it is not a bad direction to go with SCOGA <malay>kalau</malay> SCOGA is the best way to go and find funding for this kind of things
I would don't particularly mind <malay>kita boleh</malay> set up <malay>kita punya</malay> entity and our entity will work with SCOGA
that SCOGA event [eh]
(mm)
so

I get
I get that <malay>tapi macam</malay>
sometimes it
I it not keeping the idea is one thing [lah] like is there a way that we can some sort of legal binding thing where this idea is our idea like we can't copyright an idea either [what] to be perfectly honest
ya
it's not novel in any sense it's just bet~ the U_S_B [ah] unique selling point is it's better run as opposed to <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia dia tak unik dia cuma macam dia lagi bagus</malay> you get what I mean ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's the thing [lah]
we <malay>kita kena</malay> establish the who does what [lah] I mean like
but I think also part of the reason [lah] is if we don't let's say we don't know we try to be very insular <malay>habis tak cari pertolongan dari orang lain</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> chance <malay>tak akan menjadi juga</malay> because
sometimes people's expertise in different areas might be better because we played to our strengths <malay>apa yang kita tahu kita boleh tolong tapi ada benda yang kita tak boleh buat</malay>
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cari tu susah</malay> and it's a circular thing [lah] you know <malay>macam kalau ada</malay> other sponsor <malay>datang</malay>
[ah] <malay>ada</malay> and then after that more sponsors will come by getting the first one everyone will wait for the first mover everyone will wait for <malay>macam siapa yang nak masukkan duit dulu</malay> you know who wants to put their money where their mouth is
that's the thing [lah] that's why like right now my confusion is every time I kind of mood ideas to people then after that people will be like okay who else do you are you gonna get or who else can you get
then the thing is if I don't get you I cannot get anyone else in if I cannot get anyone else I cannot get you know like <malay>pusing-pusing</malay>
ya
it's a that's the thing
<malay>tapi siapa yang nak pergi</malay> start <malay>siapa</malay> [lah] <malay>nak ambil belas kasihan kat kita</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
that's the thing [ah]
ya [lah] that's the best part [lah] (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] that's true [lah] I mean my initial idea is that if I come in later on with the thing right then after that it makes a lot more sense I won't mind like topping up and getting making it bigger
cause you also kind of benefits me but you all right I cannot be the first mover that's why I am hesitating also with the first mover thing <malay>pasal</malay> ya like you know like you ultimately like okay who are these people <malay>nanti dia kalau</malay> check <malay>nama aku yang keluar</malay>
(um) that's the thing [lah] unless we move in the fact that <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>tak boleh</malay> okay that doesn't work either I was just thinking <malay>pakai nama kau aku kat belakang</malay> then after that <malay>aku</malay> come in as the sponsor <malay>pun tak boleh apa</malay> people will smell it a million miles away [ah]
ya
ya true
and
ya [lah] I get that but my like I think ultimately right I still don't want to be the first name in there
I don't mind I don't ya I don't want to support it first and then people come in the only reason you putting this name is because it's you are putting your own money so that doesn't come then I got nowhere to calculate already <malay>apa</malay>
(mm) (mm)
J_F_S
football school
no problem
[a'ah]
monitoring board [ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya
like I mean okay we keep that as a possibility most definitely
that's what I <malay>cakap kalau kita dapat</malay> decathlon [ah] will be accident <malay>pasal</malay> decathlon sports company
<malay>adik aku</malay> the only thing that <malay>dia boleh cakap</malay> is okay decathlon has no direct line for this kind of things because so far decathlon <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> decathlon <malay>memang tak</malay> sponsor <malay>banyak benda</malay>
ya <malay>dia cakap</malay> but you can just randomly throw into their <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it's a very generic which <malay>punya</malay> contact (err) email [lah] so ya you can just throw it there and see what happens [ah]
you have to do it I guess ultimately it must be done [lah]
okay so this is the thing we need to go and extrapolate the viewership from a previous
events [ah] and <malay>macam mana nak buat itu</malay> previous events <malay>punya nombor</malay> [eh] <malay>itu pun masalah</malay> because who will hold these data people are
<malay>ada</malay> viewers <malay>tak</malay>
ya helen <malay>pun</malay> register this tournament
the latest <malay>kalau nak pasal bola</malay> is <malay>itu</malay> SAFRA <malay>punya</malay>
[eh] <malay>tak engkau punya</malay> [ah]
V_P_G
N_V_P_G format <malay>dia lain sikit</malay> [lah]
okay <malay>aku pergi cari</malay> SAFRA
<malay>tapi ada orang tengok</malay> [kan]
nine hundred and ninety ever
how much is that words to people I don't know
!wah! <malay>berapa lama</malay>
not bad <malay>boleh tahan</malay>
(uh huh)
(mm)
one point two
one point two K
that's not bad
(mm)
#aiman# will blast it for us
(mm) (mm)
he gives a platform [oh]
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>kalau dia</malay> free [kan] best
he's the voice that people want and he is the malaysian pool now even in the philippines
ya
it's been a problem that #aiman# has talked about so the sending of money overseas like that it's a headache and a half [ah]
ya
(mm) (mm) <malay>dia</malay> busy <malay>gila</malay>
[a'ah] [seh]
<malay>dia orang pun nama dah lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak</malay> appear
<malay>dia takde langsung takde</malay> that's the thing
[ah] yes the wrestling
[ah]
ya
<malay>dia</malay> taking it to heart [lah] then <malay>pasal itu dia punya</malay> aim [lah] I mean <malay>dia</malay> miss out on <malay>dia punya</malay> the disappointment is evident [lah] but I get it I get it <malay>dia</malay> upset <malay>tapi macam</malay> ya [lah] in the balance of things and an impossible given <malay>tak teruk sangat</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and we can get and we can get #sekaiichi# to come and help us out
that's not the easiest thing in the world [lah] to be honest
(mm)
you can try I can try and pull whoever I can possibly pull also [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) that's good
I mean I don't see the problem <malay>kalau kerja dengan dia</malay>
I think in my lesson our burden in things that I think we can
honestly spend less time on cause our value comes elsewhere
he can if we can work around the sponsor thing the money thing like once the money thing is out of the way [kan] if he can run the event proper right no problem I'm very sure that once it gets up and running like we can get it done <malay>cuma</malay> the negotiating for this kind of thing maybe it's not
the best use of whatever is my ability you know (err) our ability as well cause like
finding sponsors is not something that we particularly been doing with our lives I guess <malay>dia orang lagi pandai</malay> but I think [lah] that's my opinion [lah]
I mean <malay>kita kalau nak nak cari</malay> sponsor [kan] the right now the foot through the door <malay>pun tak tahu macam mana nak masukkan tu</malay>
I can't even get a headway into anything right now I feel so defeated
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
understandable [lah]
that's why the logical play in my head right is SCOGA cause SCOGA's only aim
is this
but SCOGA right (uh) what kind of organization are they a profit making organization are there a benevolent and do you know organisation are they like <malay>aku nak</malay> support any <malay>pasal aku nak</malay> E sports <malay>mengembang dalam</malay> singapore where or are they like
<malay>aku nak buat ini pasal aku nak buat duit</malay> where the hell do they get the funding
okay

I <malay>nak</malay> try [lah] <malay>baru</malay> try I <malay>nak</malay> try stock then I <malay>macam rasa-rasanya</malay> tesla will grow [lah] in the future
<malay>sebab</malay> ya because a lot of countries are <malay>macam</malay> adopting (err) are banning petrol vehicles by
in the future
so
by investing in <malay>macam</malay> electric car company <malay>ini</malay> [kan] all those clean energy ones
(uh)
the shares would probably go up [lah] in the future like maybe not now maybe <malay>dalam lima sepuluh tahun</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> also low [kan] but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits [lah]
so what do you think how about you
!huh! serious
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance <malay>tapi</malay> I think like <malay>macam</malay> those stocks <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> permissible <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>yang tak</malay> go against the basic purpose [ah] <malay>macam</malay> those thoughts <malay>yang</malay> deal with (um) vices then
alcohol
you know all those <malay>macam</malay> clearly <malay>apa ni</malay>
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
that's my <malay>pandangan</malay> [lah] on this
okay for me [eh] I think <malay>kita kena macam</malay>
diversify [lah] our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like <malay>macam</malay>
segregate your assets [lah] so I think one good (err) platform to that we can use is
(uh) #wahed# invest so this is a <malay>macam</malay>
I as far as I know this is the
only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>syariah</malay> compliant <malay>punya</malay> stocks trading platform [lah] so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
commodities [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cash <malay>ke</malay> gold
<malay>ambil</malay> bonds and all these are like certified to be <malay>syariah</malay> compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in <malay>macam</malay> these kind of companies
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
you don't have to put in effort [lah] you just <malay>letak</malay> your money then you just
(uh) forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
based on my experience <malay>dia punya</malay> fees is
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will charge you ten dollars so this is one of the downside [lah] of using
#wahed# invest
<malay>tapi</malay> like maybe this is one
(um)
how to say [eh]
what (err) things you have to face [lah] if you want to go through the halal way
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms <malay>yang</malay> offer no service charge or something but then you don't know what they are investing in
ya so you have to put up [lah] with this all these service charge [lah] when these banks
new way
true
maybe you can feedback to U_O_B <malay>jangan</malay> invest in bonds
<malay>macam</malay> bank <malay>bapa kita</malay>
[oh] like <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>yang</malay> what you say is true <malay>cuma</malay>
I mean you want <malay>apa</malay> ethical investing [eh] in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
do it the halal way then it's the best [lah]
[ah] correct
[a'ah] deep
ya correct [lah] I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with
those the regular accounts [lah] me you have no choice [what] <malay>tapi</malay> that's why (err) you have to do your own research [lah] if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
(err) <malay>mana-mana</malay> company I mean <malay>mana-mana</malay> banks
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>cakap pasal</malay> investment <malay>ni macam mana kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>bau dia macam apa tu</malay>
so <malay>dia punya kentut</malay> signify more to yes <malay>ke</malay> more to no
okay [lah] ya
<malay>kita</malay> (err)
I think she I mean she's free [lah] it's whether <malay>dia nak ke tak</malay>
ya maybe <malay>dia malas</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> anyway <malay>dia dah</malay> agree <malay>apa</malay> sunday <malay>dia</malay> okay

generous my parents are

ya shuttle correct
(mm)
ya
[oh] I mean any I'm a kind of guy anything goes [ah] you know it is [lah] just so happens [ah]
that
ya that is her [lah] so ya but it's quite funny though
if you I mean you know that she was from our J_C right
ya or I think cause she was like a year younger so
#wei# I haven't told you this [sia] how would you know [eh] true
ya it's actually same
ya
ya we met at a bus stop at (err) near my ho~ my hostel there [ah]

(uh) it's
<malay>nasib</malay> [ah] <malay>nasib</malay>
no I always thought she was a science kind of student [ah] like take engineering and stuff
but ya
correct ya I also quite surprised
well I guess communication is key [ah] <malay>yang penting</malay> [ah] so
you know what I mean
ya
well it's only been a few months [ah] since the start of the year
[ah]
ya [lah] as of now just chill [lah] just ya
occasional stuff
ya don't want to get my head too high
in the clouds
ya
(mm)
ya later you know my
potential <malay>nak kena</malay> backfire [ah] you know this kind of stuff so better to keep it <malay>macam</malay> tame first
ya
before it gets ya
ya pretty I pretty sure I already told
a handful of people only
[ah] including you
ya that's the thing
see
ya I've been wanting to
have this conversation quite awhile [lah]
I thought we could have played games you know during this (err) holiday period like how he used to [lah] but
ya I guess this busy schedule
right I mean
furthermore <malay>kalau main</malay> also like
how many hours
and we don't have that kind of time [ah]
so
(mm)
so cannot play <malay>sampai lambat</malay> also [kan]
ya
so that's how it is [ah]
if not I would have updated you about more of this kind of stuff [ah]
but it's okay [ah] (err) I have this time now to you know
[oh]
(mm)
[oh]
(um)
[oh]
(err)
can I do it I actually don't mind [lah] even though I'm not close to loofy
[ah]
I would I wouldn't mind [lah] ya I mean
as a natural bass player I
I think I can handle
the responsibilities of a lead guitarist [ah]
ya shouldn't be a problem [lah] but when is this [ah]
(um)
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] [ah] I know [ah]
ya that time [lor]
[oh] <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>baik</malay> [tau]
[oh]
(mm)
he quit or <malay>kena buang</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] but ya I heard back then <malay>dia punya</malay> temper also quite
quite serious [ah] he was your classmate [kan] J_C
(mm) true
[oh]
(mm)
I see
but <malay>kalau</malay> I think
I should be down to jam with you all [lah] <malay>kalau jumaat lepas solat</malay>
probably four [oh]
together
[eh] but
I heard
if you want to go together then <malay>kena</malay> apply online [kan] to get the queue
[oh]
so should I apply like
like how long how much in advance can I apply now can already [leh]
[orh]
[oh]
<malay>dia orang</malay> fast game [ah] [dah] apply online
ya but how's the slots like though
the best seats is <malay>tingkat berapa</malay>
[oh]
cause closer to god [kan]
(mm) so that means the
<malay>takde yang rapatkan saf</malay> [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> expand
(mm)
do it [lah]
(mm)
I heard
the <malay>wuduk</malay> area now they <malay>dia orang taruh apa</malay> sanitizer
[oh] no [ah]
[oh] okay [oh] so they
they close off the area [ah]
because then again it's a
to prevent the spread of
the water borne infections [ah]
(mm)
so then that means <malay>salam pun tak boleh</malay> [ah]
[ah] okay
the gentle tap [lah] at the knuckles
speculation [lah]
situations ya
I mean
ya
<malay>orang</malay> only the <malay>orang atas</malay> would know [lah] all what is set in stone [lah]
ya
[oh]
yes
[oh]
suggestions [lah]
(mm) I would say I've only been out a few times for work and
ya I didn't get to hang out with my friends like
on less than a handful of occasions
and that one <malay>pun</malay> mostly <malay>kat</malay> my
housing area
ya
ya so it's the same old <malay>kedai kopi</malay> and (err) you know the P_P_P mall right ya
ya
ya the standard breakfast <malay>punya mee rebus mee siam nasi sambal goreng</malay>
ya
ya
ya that's why bro I've been meaning to on that [ah]
[oh] ya I did (err) the west ham versus watford right
[oh] my days so did you manage to watch like a bit of it or not at all
(mm)
[ah] okay ya I also thought I thought you would also do that <malay>macam dah</malay> second nature [kan] <malay>ambil wuduk</malay>
(um)
ya I mean
it's quite impressive [ah] that you've been a west ham fan for
twenty years [ah]
[oh] <malay>cik jamal</malay> [oh] I always thought he was
ya all this while right I thought he was like a nottingham forest <malay>punya</malay> supporter
[oh] at any pressure [lah]
(mm)
but ya [lah] I think end of the day
jokes is on him [lah] cause west ham
can't remain in the premier league right after that match
ya that's true
I'm quite happy [sia] for you
ya on other hand
as for spurs right
ya
ya (mm) I would say they are doing fine now
but I'm just stress [ah] bro for the last two games [ah]
cause you <malay>punya</malay> opponent (mm)
ya correct
mid table but <malay>kalau menang</malay> the last two matches then
confirm qualify [ah] europa
ya champions league [dah]
<malay>dah tak boleh dah</malay>
a bit out of reach [ah] ya <malay>jauh sangat</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] so that's that [lah]
quite sad [lah] cause you know
we have a lot of quality players like sean playton [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya that is expected of them [lah]
ya so
<malay>tu yang</malay> quite disappointing [ah]
but (uh) you know foot~ football just football [lah]
it just a game so
(mm)
ya
correct this [ah] can't be predicted [lah]
ya
but you know how prouds to liverpool
for securing that
(um) win [ah] so <malay>syabas</malay> to them
yes
(mm)
true
ya
[oh] ya speaking of liverpool right so how is (uh) your good our good friend [ah] #havi#
ya
[oh]
[oh] the usual springleaf or the #prata# place [ah]
(mm)
ya that's true
!wah! so you'll be meeting him later [ah]
[oh] !wow!
ya
that's good
ya just send him my [ah] regards [ah]
(err) like him to know that
I'm always happy for him [lah]
cause this is like first time in
<malay>dua puluh tahun</malay> is it ya liverpool won <malay>punya</malay> premier league
[ah] ya correct
yes
(uh) that's amazing
ya now he already ya [sia] he already almost thirty already
and ya so about time [ah]
[ah]
but I will have to say [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> though he quite <malay>semangat</malay> [ah]
in supporting liverpool sometimes his tweets will be <malay>melampau</malay> [ah]
how emotion emotional football gets [ah]
(mm)
ya true
but [oh] wells
is he still the regular <malay>kat</malay> your fire station
[oh] so what to go into full time studies is it
does he say the requirement for like what do you call it [ah] the those that above twenty five year old
one of the scheme [oh] the
something to do with like mature student or something [eh]
[oh] james cook (mm)
[ah] okay
he but his passion nice [lah]
under him [mah]
(mm)
(mm)
trainings
(mm)
ya correct
(mm) no doubt [lah] he is really a <malay>budak baik</malay> [lah]
and (uh)
<malay>polis</malay>
ya
ya I was at (err) I was at the N_P_C and #ang mo kio# over there ya
ya correct
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah] you know just
you know drive around the neighbourhood
(mm) do roundings only [ah]
ya but I would say I never
had like a close friend throughout the entire two years [ah]
cause no one from my my squad [ah] actually went to the same ya N_P_C as me
ya so a bit <malay>sedih</malay> [ah]
cause they base you based on your
where your where you stay your residence ya so I <malay>kena</malay> posted <malay>kat</malay> foxtrot division [ah] <malay>tak banyak orang yang tinggal kat</malay> this area [ah]
sorry can you repeat that again [ah]
(err) didn't get to hear clearly
(mm)
[oh] I would say there's a fair share of calls [lah] there's still ongoing back then [lah] (err) but I won't say it's as much as the those hot zones like <malay>macam</malay> woodlands #jurong#
ya I would say that central area quite tame [mah]
ya
but no doubt [lah] there's always calls here and there [lah] whether their severity <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's like (err) important or not [ah] it's a different thing
ya so that's how it was [ah]
ya but all in all
okay [lah] N_S life
valuable [lah] ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya I feel the same way [ah] as much as like you know the <malay>berita dia orang</malay> cover and all these cases of
<malay>macam</malay> mismanagement
ya
I think it's isolated <malay>punya</malay> cases
cause
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
true
ya
cause <malay>biasanya macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam gitu</malay> [ah] usually it's more civilized and laid back [ah] I would say nothing much going on [ah]
ya
but [oh] well that's
it was a good times [ah] back in the days
ya
so ya man
I wish (err)
I wish I have plans after this [ah] but sadly I don't
(err) you know during the usual probably just go for a run
ya correct yes around
this (err) my vicinity [lah]
correct [ah]
[ah]
I usually go for a minimum ten K_M [ah]
ya
you know ten K_M run ya
I think I mean
[kan] <malay>kena</malay> stay active [kan]
ya
(mm)
[oh] okay
ya but I think is <malay>tak susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak susah sangat</malay> [lah] but it's
<malay>kena biasakan</malay> so
ya I think if you were to consistently do it right it doesn't seem like a very long distance ya
(mm) cause when you first start [lah] like after one ten K_M and then usually you <malay>togok air</malay> like <malay>melampau</malay> [ah] but
now I barely need a sip of water [ah]
ya
ya correct
(mm)
ya
ya correct I that one I fully agree [ah] [kan] I mean cause <malay>banyak orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak begitu</malay> informed [lah] about this kind of stuff [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay>
the
it is the right way [lah] is to <malay>jangan minum banyak</malay> [ah] you have to conserve
cause if you drink too much then later your system
like <malay>macam</malay>
it's hampered with already [ah] so you need to stay clean [ah]
ya
ya but not to you know pam~ pamper it until to make it seem as if like you have to go full
<malay>kena</malay> full cool down mode already [ah]
it's just
you know quench a bit
skip
(mm)
ya correct
heatstroke [ah] heatstroke
no it's not cause you drink to little [lah] it's cause you <malay>minum melampau</malay> [ah] basically
(mm)
correct
[ah] that's true [lah] cause <malay>kalau kau minum banyak</malay> [kan] the you're over dependence on water is the thing that will make
you more vulnerable to heatstroke [lah]
ya cause the more you run then like the more you are without that amount of water then confirm
<malay>kau punya badan</malay> is like you know get gets in a shock
(uh) so the more you <malay>biasakan</malay> with more water then the more likely you will
<malay>kenakan</malay> the effects of that heatstroke [ah]
[kan]
<malay>ni semua kena belajar</malay> [ah]
(mm) <malay>yang tepat</malay> [ah]
to combat this kind stuff
speaking of drinking right so how have you been
you've been drinking you know
(mm)
ya
well
(uh) I haven't been a fan of you know alcoholic beverages [ah] but I've been (uh)
(err) a good a very good consumer of like (err) juices
ya like apple juice
orange juice [ah] yes you as you saying
(uh) I would say at least
two bottles [lah]
two bottles (err) five hundred M_L kind [ah]
of juices ya correct
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
yes correct
ya
[ah] okay but where do you get this where what what brand are your juices
benefits [ah]
(mm)
[oh] the <malay>biji</malay> [ah] <malay>biji</malay>
<malay>biji-biji kecil</malay> [ah]
!wah!
!wah! that's
I think that's (err) that's the right way to go [ah] to be honest
[ah]
[oh] serious
then
the <malay>biji</malay> take out then you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> but then
<malay>bila kau minum</malay> [kan]
then is the texture smooth
<malay>kalau</malay>
[oh] do you blend the <malay>kulit</malay> [ah]
ya correct then I think I read somewhere that if you blend the fiber
it will be drinkable [lah] but
you need to use a
good blender [lah]
ya I would say that [lah]
ya
but <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>kau kena</malay> like see first [lah] whether this the type of fruit
already has natural sugars [ah] before <malay>kau tambah</malay> extra sugar or anything [lah] when you blend
[ah]
(mm) true ya
that's why I would suggest
but
some fruits like oranges apples actually those
with the sugar level already <malay>dah cukup</malay> already
<malay>tak payah tambah</malay> extra stuff
(um)
but as for
(err) grapefruit
(uh) those kind of stuff that one maybe add a bit [ah]
ya
so be smooth [ah]
sorry grape
[ah] <malay>lain</malay>
ya different
(err) grapefruit is <malay>besar sikit</malay>
ya grape is just small smaller version of grapefruit
<malay>sama</malay> ya
ya it's (uh) <malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
<malay>nama sama tapi</malay>
different size ya
ya that's why the best is to
drink coconut [ah]
(mm)
ya but <malay>kau kena potong</malay> [ah] before you put <malay>dalam</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> blender
hello yes I can hear you

and (um) I'm not sure whether it's compulsory for them to wear masks there
and then (um)
because #johor# has (err) strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so I don't know whether because (err) the last that I heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if #johor# (um) numbers demote back [ah] but I think after a week it does in its red zone
(mm)
ya I still have my dirt bike to go [oh] my god

I didn't even get to go and I was like should I and we were like should we go
we were like should we go home that night or should we go home the next morning
actually we wanted to just go for the dirt bike and book a train ticket at night so that we can go back to singapore
but then I think a colleague of mine her mum was quite worried that we don't even get to
(err) ya get on board and get back to singapore on time ya because it closes at twelve A_M you see ya just say twelve A_M so
I was texting the dirt bike organiser I was like !hey! I get this (um) news about your government closing down the borders blah so how is it now then she says that okay

the europe
country is new zealand and I don't know which other country allow the singapore is allow certain countries okay example one of it is our country [lah] singapore to actually go over there without having to (um)
isolate ourselves [lah] but then again you know if you were to come back to singapore you still have to abide our the ya the rule by isolating yourself for
two weeks

that german is having a second lockdown europe is having second lockdown and then
(um) we are having this thing we call circuit breaker for like two months after that phase one phase two and now when we want to open this phase three also government is thinking twice whether to open and they have this pilot thing going on like you know you can go for clubbing but you still have to wear mask
