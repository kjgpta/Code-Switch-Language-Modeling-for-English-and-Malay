okay no not bad today was good (uh) you know as usual sunday (err) <malay>pergi</malay> football [eh] hang out with the kids had lunch a little bit did a little bit of admin and now I'm back home doing this thing with you how about you okay <malay>tak</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>biar</malay> [lah] I mean like ultimately <malay>kita berbual pun dia orang tak faham</malay> context <malay>pun</malay> then [ah] so [lah] [kan] but anyway <malay>kita boleh</malay> kill two birds with one stone [lah] <malay>orang cakap</malay> [kan]
ya so for me ultimately I I don't mind [lah] <malay>apa-apa</malay> topic <malay>pun sembarang pun boleh</malay> (uh) and but since this is useful okay [lah] a little bit of update on myself [lah] (uh) I've been touching base <malay>dengan orang-orang yang</malay> you know those I can get into contact with but [ah] ultimately what is happening is
(uh) the feedback I'm getting is cannot start (err) straightaway and then ask a lot of people <malay>tak nak</malay> (err) <malay>tak nak</malay> (err) not willing to [oh] you know ret~ (err) reticent or unwilling to support right so <malay>ada</malay> chance <malay>kita tengah buat</malay> case work <malay>kecil-kecil dulu</malay> then after that (err) with whatever budget <malay>yang kita ada dulu</malay> then after that
<malay>baru kita boleh</malay> expand from there [ah] so <malay>kita</malay> in in essence <malay>kita</malay> gonna start with whatever <malay>yang kita ada sekarang</malay>
!wah! then hopefully maybe <malay>kalau boleh kalau orang nak</malay> support <malay>dia orang datang</malay> join <malay>tapi</malay> price <malay>dia kecil</malay> [ah] starting <malay>tak kita tak boleh macam</malay> price <malay>dia besar macam</malay> (mm) the other tournaments [ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] the <malay>masalah dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
I I I think okay <malay>yang yang</malay> league <malay>yang yang itu dia punya</malay> response <malay>takde orang nak main</malay> [ah] so registration <malay>dia tak</malay> successful [lah]
<malay>tak</malay>
I
ya [lah]
<malay>penat</malay>
<malay>yang yang siapa yang</malay> organise <malay>ni</malay> league <malay>pasal</malay> like ya [lah] <malay>dia memang</malay> you you gonna obviously tell <malay>yang</malay> it's a little too much <malay>terlalu panjang</malay> [lah] for for like the amount of effort you get and the the amount of money that you win [lah] so is it organised by <malay>yang</malay> the S_F_L_B <malay>tu betul tak</malay>
ya [lah] okay <malay>cuba nampak dia punya</malay> sign up <malay>punya</malay> link <malay>saja tak tahu dia punya</malay> number of <malay>peserta belum tahu</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] <malay>dia dia</malay> okay [lah] this is a bit a bit too long for to justify whatever is going to they're going to be <malay>naik</malay> even I see okay from my point of view right I I think the one tournament thing we can just run it anyway it's just okay there are two two benefits for it [lah] the first thing
<malay>kita dapat</malay> (err) to gauge the response of (err) the people who will watch a tournament that we run that's one second thing is (um) anyway always goes on a portfolio <malay>apa-apa yang kita buat</malay> we go on the portfolio and this is also a plus point it goes into two portfolio it's running in organising an event plus <malay>kita punya</malay>
(uh) short casting the (err) portfolio [ah] so I don't see any harm in it I mean whatever we get from it right screw it anyway because we are going to have a (uh) the weekend is pretty much free anyway just clear up a weekend and then just
get it (uh) you know running [lah] the money isn't the particularly important thing for us per se I mean like money is always important [lah] but I mean the grand context of things right if you wanna run something then at least we have something to show for it giving successful then <malay>kita boleh</malay> run
weekly <malay>kalau orang nak</malay>
I mean <malay>kalau orang nak</malay> join weekly
then <malay>kita boleh</malay> run weekly if you if you want to spice it up a bit more <malay>pun boleh</malay> so at least we have a gauge to see if we if we run it <malay>habis tak ada orang tengok</malay>
and then after that at least we know <malay>takde orang tengok</malay> then we we must improve on marketing or whatever then we get feedback from them from the people if there instantly <malay>kita ada</malay> stand up <malay>tapi takde orang</malay> respond <malay>langsung takde orang nak</malay> join
[ah] <malay>itu pun masalah</malay> then after that we also know that probably we're not reaching out to the right people or the right people are not interested and then we can also can do market feedback and ask them
okay why you not interested <malay>kalau</malay> ultimately if nobody signs up in that way then we put it out then at least you can scrap it move on try it and try again
ya so but at least we find out what in the universe is wrong and for this one right (err) maybe the ones who organise this upcoming D to D league [kan] they obviously didn't foresee that you know they they they banking too much on the people's (err)
(err) goodwill they are gonna play for cheap many games they are hoping but the price doesn't justify it's too much work just to go and get the amount of money [ah] because people are gonna just end up playing <malay>macam</malay> weekend league and stuff
because why would you play so many games just to get like a hundred bucks when you can play weekend league and then earn like [ah] you're in game players you don't get anything out of the hundred dollars [what]
it's a bit predatory [lah] you can see that he is if it takes fifty percent out of everything right and then he barely barely has to do anything then administration <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] only only problem only headache <malay>kalau ada orang</malay> not happy <malay>ke apa-apa</malay> and then he has to resolve the issues [ah] but apart from that
it's a really long tournament for really very poor pay off [eh] if he eats half of it no
I I mean if we pitched it right no no tournament sponsor or whatever right it's going to say okay you can take half of it
ya because most of the it is is a is a norm right like seventy percent or whatever goes to goes back to the players
ya it it's almost every tournament that we casted will <malay>begini apa</malay> it's it's mostly goes back to the players it doesn't make any sense in my head why anybody would join this in the first place [lah] when and I get why the responses are so poor [lah]
so that's what I think that (uh) on the flipside if your tournament is like that and then we take barely anything <malay>kita</malay> just take as you would say [lah] <malay>duit kopi</malay> [jer] just for like a couple dollars just to
pay for our refreshments or whatever ya
people people will be and and then and then we get pitch it like like
and I mean ho~ honestly if you want to be completely benevolent and make it selling point [lah] hundred percent of the thing so I honestly think yes we don't make money but if if it won't suck too badly if we didn't take anything out of it to be perfectly honest
ya but but the most important thing is then we get the numbers then we can go and pitch with numbers
and if you can sell it to many people to go and watch it right then those numbers should convert into dollars and cents later on in our other planning for the bigger things [lah]
(mm) that's just my opinion [lah] so I I don't mind I don't mind trying I mean anyway there's a there's a lot of people staying at home right now <malay>budak-budak</malay> also (err) <malay>tengah</malay> holiday
ya so might as well try and organize one soon
for christmas <malay>ke</malay> before before christmas <malay>ke</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya [lah] <malay>dia dia takde</malay> continuity between one week and another week [lah] that's the only that's the only weak point of having this weekly thing [lah] I mean maybe the weekly thing like I say it's just a
stepping stone or showcase [ah] we gotta we gotta think of it that way (uh) because if you don't put anything out then we won't get anything back in
correct [lah]
okay [lah] then I think maybe we can we can work it [ah] then after that the number of players right we just need to use the standardized [ah] the thirty two sixty four will be nice
then break it down cause it makes it it is a direct number right because it's like thirty two sixty four hundred and twenty eight right
ya but I don't know if we're gonna be able to get a hundred and twenty eight people
<malay>kalau kita punya</malay> prize money is at ten bucks each and then after that if we vinyl back
(um) next to every single cent back into the thing if we making a hundred and twenty eight with a total of a thousand dollars worth of prize money right
as easy we can we can make some there also honestly little bit [lah] not not not a lot [lah] but we can make a little bit for ourselves also [lah] so with a thousand dollars is a is a nice number [ah] if you can see a thousand dollar price part
cause everyone loves a a thousand dollars it sounds like a nice four figures [ah] like sounds big enough for one day event but then it's only con~ contingent if we can get a hundred people [lah]
I I honestly don't know I I never entered tournament <malay>tak pernah</malay> enter tournament so in in in any case I think we should ask guys who entered tournaments your <malay>kawan-kawan</malay> on the chat do they entered tournaments
[a'ah]
okay so
(mm)
(mm) [oh] ya that's also true [lah] so so <malay>kalau</malay> let's say we take a I mean I don't mind putting in a little bit to to sweetened the board [lah] I mean
ultimately you know put in to get out [lah] (err) in my opinion it's like I I I don't see any other way
because we cannot straightaway get (uh) sponsors to do anything
(mm)
that's what my hope is that <malay>kalau kita</malay>
(uh) show some sort of (uh) viewership numbers then after that maybe (err) people will start to see and then will like okay we will chip in with some of some part of the
the prize pool [lah] like little bit here little bit there then hopefully we can get some people to help us [lah] but that's why I say [lah] like if you don't if you don't kick off with something we will never start
ya and that's the that's the that's the problem [lah] so <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>kita dah boleh kena kena</malay>
<malay>kalau keluar duit pun kena keluar duit</malay> [lah] <malay>sikit</malay> [lah]
I mean in in in essence I don't even think <malay>pasal pasal nak buat duit</malay> [lah] like now so right now it's just I wanna get something off the ground and see [lah] at least <malay>nama kita ada juga orang dengar</malay> then after that <malay>kita boleh boleh juga pakai</malay>
<malay>pakai</malay> footage [jer] <malay>ke pakai</malay> the numbers then we can just shop it around to other sponsors [lah] ya
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm) more
okay <malay>boleh</malay>
(mm)
you know ya that make sense <malay>macam orang senang ke apa duit datang balik apa</malay>
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya hundred and eight dollar <malay>tu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm) you once you get the the quarter final [kan] then you get something back [ah]
forty percent <malay>pasal</malay> eight times four eight times five ya
<malay>jap jap</malay> [ah] forty (err) forty percent is sixty four dollars [lah]
okay can
okay <malay>jadi kau bawa balik dah lima belas peratus</malay> [ah]
top four ya [lah] ya [lah]
also it increases the amount [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
twenty
yup
(mm)
the amounts that we need to be at [lah]
[ah] <malay>masih ada</malay> fif~
(mm) so <malay>kita masih ada</malay> fifteen percent to blame with [lah] whatever it is [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) so the incentive is <malay>banyak banyak orang</malay> sign up [lah]
<malay>tapi kalau dia punya</malay> number uneven <malay>nanti</malay> matchmaking <malay>pun susah</malay>
(mm)
that's why then they automatically capture the buy and automatic <malay>dapat duit balik pun pun tak</malay> achieve <malay>mesti orang</malay> argue <malay>punya</malay>
[a'ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> very hard to determine who gets a buy <malay>nanti orang mesti cakap tak</malay> achieve <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>pasal aku kena menang dua dia menang satu</malay> [jer] <malay>mana boleh</malay> [sia]
(mm) so <malay>nombor dia nombor dia</malay> thirty two <malay>atau</malay> sixty four <malay>itu yang masalah dia</malay>
<malay>nombor dia tak boleh</malay> uneven
<malay>cepat</malay> [ah] <malay>cepat dia orang dapat</malay>
<malay>itu pasal</malay> [lah] and I I know sixty four <malay>memang susah</malay> mes~ regularly <malay>kalau</malay> five dollar <malay>punya</malay> registration fee [kan] sixty four
I mean <malay>macam dia orang yang cakap</malay> one hundred twenty eight <malay>tu pasal dia orang tak dapat</malay> apply <malay>apa-apa</malay> free <malay>saja masuk taruh nama</malay> [jer] <malay>tu pasal taruh nama ada orang tak tak datang apa</malay>
[ah] so this one is a bit more [lah] so the numbers may be smaller but I think they'll be more invested in trying to actually play in the damn game [lah]
ya
I don't know I think I think we can start with thirty two I think it's a good it's a good idea
and like breaking it down
then we we if we work on the premise of thirty two open then obviously we have (uh) a number that we can
play with you know but this is only season one if it's <malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>macam</malay> season two [ah] there's more people then we will open it to sixty four
but the the numbers then become bigger because the end prizes become bigger we we need to gauge I think initially the first (err) the first round [lah] is to is to gauge interest and to see how many people we can drag in on by sheer force of personality heater
(mm) that's that's the one thing I think
if <malay>macam kita buat ada memang ada</malay> thirty two players <malay>tapi takde orang tengok pun</malay> hard to go and pitch the any what else <malay>apa</malay> cannot justify
to others
(mm)
okay <malay>boleh kalau kita nak pergi</malay> end and (um) I I am no qualms <malay>kalau kita</malay> deal <malay>kat</malay> N with who is he working for SCOGA or is he working with SCOGA <malay>itu yang</malay> question <malay>dia</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) so so <malay>tak ke sama macam</malay> all the other events <malay>yang</malay> (um) <malay>itu macam</malay> supported by SCOGA you know <malay>apa</malay> we can still have branded our way but supported by SCOGA
while the other events <malay>pun nampak macam dia orang</malay> is put (err) supported by SCOGA it's not even really truly sponsored by SCOGA
[ah] so maybe it is not a bad direction to go with SCOGA <malay>kalau</malay> SCOGA is the best way to go and find funding for this kind of things
I I would don't particularly mind <malay>kita boleh</malay> set up <malay>kita punya</malay> entity and our entity will work with SCOGA
that SCOGA event [eh]
(mm)
so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I I get
I get I get that <malay>tapi macam</malay>
sometimes it
I I it not keeping keeping the idea is one thing [lah] like is there a way that we can some sort of legal binding thing where this idea is our idea like we can't copyright an idea either [what] to be perfectly honest
ya
it's not novel in any sense it's just bet~ the the U_S_B [ah] unique selling point is it's better run as opposed to <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia dia dia dia tak unik dia cuma dia cuma macam dia lagi bagus</malay> you get what I mean ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's the thing [lah]
we <malay>kita kena</malay> establish the the who does what [lah] I mean like
but I think also part of the reason [lah] is if we don't let's say we don't know we try to be very insular <malay>habis tak tak tak cari pertolongan dari orang lain</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> chance <malay>tak akan menjadi juga</malay> because
sometimes people's expertise in different areas might might be better because we played to our strengths <malay>apa yang kita tahu kita boleh tolong tapi ada benda yang kita tak boleh buat</malay>
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cari tu susah</malay> and it's a it's a circular thing [lah] you know <malay>macam kalau ada</malay> other sponsor <malay>datang</malay>
[ah] <malay>ada</malay> and then after that more sponsors will come by getting the first one everyone will wait for the first mover everyone will wait for <malay>macam siapa yang nak masukkan duit dulu</malay> you know who wants to put their money where their mouth is
that's the that's the thing [lah] that's why like right now my my confusion is every time I I kind of mood ideas to people then after that people will be like okay who else do you are you gonna get or who else can you get
then the thing is if I don't get you I cannot get anyone else in if I cannot get anyone else I cannot get you you know like <malay>pusing-pusing</malay>
ya
it's it's a that's the thing
<malay>tapi siapa yang nak pergi</malay> start <malay>siapa</malay> [lah] <malay>nak ambil belas kasihan kat kita</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
that's the thing [ah]
ya [lah] that's the best part [lah] (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] that's true [lah] I mean my my initial idea is that if I come in later on with the thing right then after that it makes a lot more sense I won't mind like topping up and getting making it bigger
cause you also you also kind of benefits me but you all you all right I cannot be the first mover that's why I am hesitating also with the the first mover thing <malay>pasal</malay> ya like you know like you ultimately like okay who are these people <malay>nanti dia kalau</malay> check <malay>nama aku yang keluar</malay>
(um) that's the thing [lah] unless we move in the fact that <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>tak boleh</malay> okay that doesn't work either I was just thinking <malay>pakai nama kau aku kat belakang</malay> then after that <malay>aku</malay> come in as the sponsor <malay>pun tak boleh apa</malay> people will people will smell smell it a million miles away [ah]
ya
ya true
and
ya [lah] I I get that but my like I think ultimately right I still don't want to be the first name in there
I I don't mind I don't ya I don't want to support it first and then people come in the only the only reason you putting this name is because it's you are putting you are putting your own money so that doesn't come then I got nowhere to calculate already <malay>apa</malay>
(mm) (mm)
J_F_S
football school
no problem no problem
[a'ah]
monitoring board [ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya
like I mean okay we keep that we keep that as a as a possibility most definitely
that's what I <malay>cakap kalau kita dapat</malay> decathlon [ah] will be accident <malay>pasal</malay> decathlon sports company
<malay>adik adik aku</malay> the only thing that <malay>dia boleh cakap</malay> is okay decathlon has no direct line for this kind of things because so far decathlon <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> decathlon <malay>memang tak</malay> sponsor <malay>banyak benda</malay>
ya <malay>dia cakap</malay> but you can you can just randomly throw into their <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it's a very generic which <malay>punya</malay> contact (err) email [lah] so ya you can just throw it there and see what happens [ah]
you have to do it I guess ultimately it must be done [lah]
okay so this is the thing we need to go and extrapolate the viewership from a previous
events [ah] and <malay>macam mana nak buat itu</malay> previous events <malay>punya nombor</malay> [eh] <malay>itu pun masalah</malay> because who will hold these who will hold these data people are
<malay>ada</malay> viewers <malay>tak</malay>
ya ya helen <malay>pun</malay> register this tournament
the latest <malay>kalau nak pasal bola</malay> is <malay>itu</malay> SAFRA <malay>punya</malay>
[eh] <malay>tak engkau punya</malay> [ah]
V_P_G
N_V_P_G N_V_P_G format <malay>dia lain sikit</malay> [lah]
okay <malay>aku pergi cari</malay> SAFRA
<malay>tapi ada orang tengok</malay> [kan]
nine hundred and ninety ever
how much is that words to people I don't know
!wah! <malay>berapa lama</malay>
not bad not bad <malay>boleh tahan</malay>
(uh huh)
(mm)
one point two
one point two K
that's not bad
(mm)
#aiman# will blast it for us
(mm) (mm)
he gives a platform [oh]
(mmhmm)
ya <malay>kalau dia kalau dia</malay> free [kan] best
he's the he's the voice that people people want and he is the malaysian pool now even in the philippines
ya
it it's been a problem that that #aiman# has talked about so the the sending of money overseas like that it's a it's a headache and a half [ah]
ya
(mm) (mm) <malay>dia</malay> busy <malay>gila</malay>
[a'ah] [seh]
<malay>dia orang pun nama dah lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak tak tak</malay> appear
<malay>dia takde langsung takde</malay> that's the that's the thing
[ah] yes the wrestling
[ah]
ya
<malay>dia</malay> taking it to heart [lah] then <malay>pasal itu dia punya</malay> aim [lah] I mean <malay>dia dia dia</malay> miss out on <malay>dia punya</malay> the disappointment is is evident [lah] but I I get it I get it <malay>dia dia dia</malay> upset <malay>tapi macam</malay> ya [lah] in in the balance of things and an impossible given <malay>tak teruk sangat</malay> [lah]
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and and we can get and we can get #sekaiichi# to come and help us out
that's not the easiest thing in the world [lah] to be honest
(mm)
you can try I can try and pull whoever I can possibly pull also [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) that's good
I mean I don't I don't see the problem <malay>kalau kerja dengan dia</malay>
I I think in my lesson our burden in things that I think we can
honestly spend less time on cause our value comes elsewhere
he can if we can work around the the sponsor thing the money thing like once the money thing is out of the way [kan] if he can run the event proper right no problem I'm I'm very sure that once it gets up and running like we can get it done <malay>cuma</malay> the the the negotiating for this kind of thing maybe it's not
the best use of whatever is my ability you know (err) our ability as well cause like
finding sponsors is not something that we particularly been doing with our lives I guess <malay>dia orang lagi pandai</malay> but I I think [lah] that's that's my opinion [lah]
I mean <malay>kita kalau nak nak nak nak cari</malay> sponsor [kan] the right now the foot through the door <malay>pun tak tahu macam mana nak masukkan tu</malay>
I I can't even get a headway into anything right now I feel so defeated
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
understandable [lah]
that's why the the the logical play in my head right is SCOGA cause SCOGA's only aim
is this
but SCOGA right (uh) what kind of organization are they are they a profit making organization are there a benevolent and do you know organisation are they like <malay>aku nak</malay> support any <malay>pasal aku nak</malay> E sports <malay>mengembang dalam</malay> singapore where or are they like
<malay>aku nak buat ini pasal aku nak buat duit</malay> where the hell do they get the funding
okay
(uh huh)
