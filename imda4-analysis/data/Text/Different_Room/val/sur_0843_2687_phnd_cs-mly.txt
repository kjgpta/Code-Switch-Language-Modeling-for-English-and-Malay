so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
(mm)
ya right right right
the best so far
one of [ah]
[ah] better than runescape
[ah]
ya confirm laze [ah] after a while
ya ya
maybe [lah] perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but I think they earning a lot [sia] this game it's like available on all platform except like console [lah]
console also <malay>ada</malay>
!wah! <malay>gila</malay> that means like it's quite a lot [ah] this

how I know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
but the game <malay>gerek</malay> [ah] the game
#bayern# very sick
ya ya okay
ya I know stop back forth back forth [ah]
(hmm) ya each to its own [ah]
<malay>esok buat apa</malay>
[ha] when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
!fuh!
when's the last time when's the last time you went
[ah]
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>kena</malay> book in advance
[oh] so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
(err) they you know <malay>kasi</malay> chance (uh) to (uh) other people [ah]
cause your name <malay>busuk</malay> already bin masli</P1> banned
and then <malay>esok tak ada apa-apa teman</malay> me [ah] <malay>pergi tengok</malay> kro~ (uh) what's this <malay>kerusi</malay>
[eh] <malay>rasa</malay>
can [ah] try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent [ah] and like
they really build up their name [eh] you know like
those DOTA players E_A players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands I would say
pricing <malay>mahal</malay> Secret Lab <malay>paling murah</malay> four nine nine [sia]
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality P_U leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding [eh] I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than [eh] APOL is three nine eight
ya
similar <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> Secret Lab <malay>ada</malay> five years warranty APOL <malay>dua</malay> year [jer]
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya ya
no [ah] it's like covered a few stuff like you know (um) for Secret Lab they have this tear protection thing so where like if the material <malay>kalau terkoyak-koyak</malay> [kan] <malay>kopek-kopek</malay> then after that
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
I
<malay>tapi air tumpah tak</malay> damage <malay>apa</malay> you can just straightaway <malay>lap</malay> the thing then the water is gone already
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is it is
ya
<malay>tu</malay>
ya <malay>aku nampak</malay> I saw that [one] <malay>basuh</malay> the <malay>lantai</malay> then all the stains all just come out right

ya ya #sheikh# ya okay I tell you about banquet the #sheikh# and this another friend [kan] <malay>dorang kerja</malay> banquet <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] because <malay>dorang dah kerja lama</malay> so they got a lot of seniority
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like

the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so this #sheikh# and the my this friend right step manager <malay>dorang tak buat kerja</malay> just like manage them tell them what to do then <malay>lepak</malay> so basically for like let's say maybe ten hours of work right they only do
<malay>dua dua jam tiga jam</malay>
<malay>tapi dapat gaji</malay> for the whole thing then they just <malay>lepak makan</malay>
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot

but then he return vouchers so people like think like [eh] <malay>aku bayar macam gini tapi dapat</malay> voucher so like

<malay>boleh</malay> [ah] [eh] you want play or not
[eh]
<malay>pergi</malay> download <malay>ni</malay> [eh] [eh] apex <malay>boleh main sama-sama</malay>
<malay>kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya nanti kau pergi tengok dia punya</malay> game play it's like <malay>macam</malay>
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish (uh) cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
!huh!
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
I plan to but then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> need to work [ah] then like don't have much time to play games this [one] now DOTA also I don't really play that much
ya
P_S five I don't know [ah] I never see since the pre-order part
I think no [ah] like they still publish [ah] it's just that it's out of stock on the main (uh) website if I'm not mistaken
<malay>gila gila</malay> [kan] right
<malay>pasal kau dulu budak-budak</malay> town east [kan] P_S one P_S two
[ah] but you don't actually own you didn't own one right
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
[oh] I understand they control with the time guard [ah] <malay>ada</malay> time limit all these
ya
ya ya funny [ah]
!fuh!
[oh] you strike a deal before the exam [ah]
I see
but all the while you did well not
above average [ah]
nice nice
!fuh!
your sister also get P_S_P
[oh]
[oh]
ya it was dying down right nearby that time cause P_S_P came out
[orh]
<malay>yang gemuk punya</malay> [kan] <malay>bukan yang</malay> slim
[eh] don't <malay>terasa</malay> [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] wasted
okay [ah] P_S_P was short-lived also [ah]
it
it's good good actually I quite surprised the thing (err) like just die down like I thought it will be a continuation but
I think P_S and
say again
ya no it's because the Sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that [ah] P_S_P Vita
[ah] Vita Vita
P_S Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice D_S came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why D_S became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> necessary [kan] <malay>dia punya</malay> touch screen and all
I think
(mm) I think the main appeal is just because D_S can support the
(uh) what's Pokemon games people literally buy D_S just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
<malay>macam</malay> minecraft [ah]
but it looks like minecraft is just I don't feel appealed in playing the minecraft kind of games
ya ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick sick
or is it just to garner the support of like I don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad
that's why every single move they made it's all got (uh) impact they want to achieve you know
!duh!
(uh) not !duh! [lah] but like possible
fortnite aha bro [eh] you never play fortnite [ah]
[ah] fortnight graphic is cartoon-ish there's that cartoon-ish as heck like damn cartoon-ish
like what
!huh!
adventurer conquer sounds familiar [eh] it's it's not the those war kind of games [ah]
[oh] I think maybe I got play before
it's like total is like the total war series [ah] no [ah]
(mm)
total war you got play
but you heard of it [lah]

it's on Steam
(mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] that aches
ya ya
[eh] have you seen this game a latest game not latest [ah] I think like
quite some time but
it became popular for a while
it's called what [ah]
plasma something or what
no plasma it's plasma something [ah] I forgot what's the full name <malay>tapi</malay> the game play <malay>macam</malay>
this you (uh) you and your friends are like ghosts investigators or something
then <malay>korang</malay> (uh) <malay>kat korang</malay> trapped in a room [kan] then after that <malay>kena cari</malay> clues on how to solve a crime or something like that
then like ghosts will just appear all that kind of stuff
