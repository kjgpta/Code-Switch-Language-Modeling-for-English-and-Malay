like I I I know I know the
is it march was it march that they open or was it march that they're closing
ya ya ya okay so march
the second week of march then I'm just like okay I need to do I need to do my stuff
exactly but okay but then they still send me [oh] okay [ah]
[oh] you've been shortlisted so please do our online interview
ya I do the online interview but I screwed up entirely
okay let me tell you okay so basically right there was one weekend where okay we you know that time we're in N_S right
ya so
you know how how high volume my work is good <malay> kau tahu
okay [lah] okay [lah] okay [lah] sorry [lah] okay [lah] okay okay so <malay> apa aku nak cakap okay so basically <malay> macam
it was
(err) during my intake <malay> macam my my B_M_T intake
so
I had to focus [ah] <malay> macam
every weekend I book out right <malay> aku terus macam malas [ah] just
like straightaway on my computer
just watch video or play game and just like (mm)
don't know what to do [ah]
okay then once my
that (uh) batch <malay> habis okay that batch finish
then I was like okay [lah] I need to do something [ah] the deadline coming close
okay I start I do I do all the needed documents
I print (err) not print I search for all the
(err) (err) what what all the
courses that I whatever paper whatever certifications that I got I
<malay> cari [ah]
I dig up for it okay then dig dig dig dig
then (err) they want us to submit that online
okay so (err) at that point of time I applied for two course
which is one is the course that you're in what is it [ah] what is it called
okay okay so I applied for the is honours [kan]
okay okay
ya so I applied for that one and then <malay> macam
like okay [ah] maybe one application or
one choice a bit too little [lah] so I choose one more
ya but I only applied for one
like I think
they gave me four options or six option I cannot remember but
I don't know I and [ah] [eh] is it I don't know okay okay
so I was like okay (err) maybe I I put two [ah] so one was
infocomm security then the second [one] was
(err)
I think some design or
I_T course [ah] I don't know it's related to I_T but <malay> macam they asked for portfolio
okay at that point of time right I thought portfolio is
like resume C_V so like okay I I just took I just dig up my C_V I just dig up my
(err) resume
ya bro
si~ sorry [ah]
[ah] [ah] okay [lah] okay [lah]
so it's <malay> macam [oh] it's it's like production like (err) <malay> macam editing
course I think
I think I (err) (uh) [eh] [eh] what is it called
entertainment course [ah] I cannot remember [lah]
so okay so they asked for my porfolio okay then I was like wait
and when [ah] they ask for my portfolio I was like what
okay okay okay I I have no idea how to put this portfolio
ya sec~
ya ya
no because okay I haven't finished my story [eh] sorry sorry
so there this is where I realised
that (um) the portfolio is specific to what course you apply
okay so the second course that one about (err) entertainment or something [ah]
they requested for a portfolio because <malay> macam they want to see what what I have done
back (uh) any <malay> macam past experience or whatever
so that I can so that they can use it as a baseline
whether they should [ah] so
ya that was when I realised [ah] so
what I did was I
like (uh) screw it [ah] I don't want to apply for this course then I delete it from my option
the moment I delete from my option right the portfolio was not needed already then I was like [oh] okay
ya I only applied for one option [lah] I only put one choice
second course S_I_T [ah] [ah] infocomm security
is the [one] I'm saying [ah] <malay> macam the editing or (err) digital entertainment or something like that
ya
if only I applied earlier [ah]
ya
cause the first the first year of (err)
N_S was it twenty eighteen [ah]

[oh]
actually like the six questions
then the first question is like (err) (err) please pro~ put your noti~ (uh) N_R_I_C or whatever your I_C and put it to your webcam
that that [one] okay I think I I I did the same [one] with you

S_I_T revolves around teamwork
team collaboration
team effort
okay so
now
the moment COVID strike
everything is done online on Zoom meetings
whatever forum that they try to
implement within that short period of time to ensure
students still can (um) collaborate do team effort all that
but I feel like like (err) this current time this current period is like the the most
(err) hardest [ah] I feel

something like that
so like I feel <malay> macam okay [lah]
(err) honestly [eh] I might
might not lose a lot within this year that I have a gap

computer here I I check the reason then I was okay they check they check they check then they the
that lady was like [oh] (err) are you still are you still in N_S are you still serving

!hais!
you know you know my my <malay> encik wanted me to extend six months [eh]
I was like nah~ nah~
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that [one] is before (err) [ah] C_P_F but six months is a very long
think so I don't know [lah]
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing [ah]
[a'ah]
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work [ah] honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
[eh] I would not think twice
(err) I I don't like my <malay> encik (uh)
I just
I just don't like my <malay> encik [ah] that's all
ya serious [ah]
one last talk
[oh] I see
[oh] [ho] <malay> dua jam
[oh] I see
<malay> kau punya
<malay> kau punya boss <malay> apa umur
okay [ah] <malay> muda [ah]
<malay> aku punya kau kau rasa aku punya berapa
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
<malay> apa otai [sia] <malay> orang tua
I see I see
no [lah] okay so (uh)
<malay> kira I don't like working with my <malay> encik [ah] it's just like <malay> macam
<malay> kau bayangkan
(err) <malay> kau kau ikut apa dia orang dia suruh kau buat tahu
okay then <malay> tiba tibs
ex~ <malay> dia tambah lagi dia tambah dia tambah dia tambah tambah tambah aku [dah] tak boleh tak boleh tahan [lah]
then <malay> macam
when we expect him to cover for us [eh] <malay> macam we do what he expect us to do
and then
there's a second layer so basically <malay> macam my <malay> encik is my first level
to [eh] no sorry my P_S
is my first level to le~ to complaint [lah] <malay> katakan
and then followed by my <malay> encik
and then basically then go up to O_C [ah] so there's this
thing in S_T_S [eh] there's one more layer in between my P_S and my <malay> encik which is that directing staff
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
(err)
(err) expect a lot from the from us [ah]
basically so <malay> macam
S_A_R standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he ex~ they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
[a'ah] ya
and okay so you know how in
(err) B_M_T they say [oh] okay (err) the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the [one] doing all this (err)
all these checks right correct
(uh huh) okay
so we also have the
<malay> macam what's
we also had the schedule [lah]
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
(err) the [one] that we don't like [lah]
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about (err) the duty (err) is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
for example I have five sergeants one person will do the check for that day or for that morning [ah] <malay> katakan
then
so this directing staff came down he was like [oh] (err) what time already I was like !huh!
what do you mean he's like (err) why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like !huh!
what you expect [sia] you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check [ah]
you get what I mean
ya [lah]
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check [ah] rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like [ha]
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
check <malay> gitu something like that [lah]
so we're like (err) when when I going O_R_D it was like [ah] don't care already [ah] because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already [ah]
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies [ah]
(um)
okay okay
what you have done [lah] [ha]
sometimes like I think sometimes you cannot really like do
like full comparison like okay like between you and him
maybe okay how how were you like when you just came into the unit was there like a proper handover or
[oh] don't have [eh]
okay then I guess (err)
(mmhmm)
okay [lah] but okay that
and he still cannot
(mmhmm)
last week
that one your problem [ah]
just say that [lah]
[oh]
(err) you feel bad for him [ah]
okay [lah] okay [lah]
your brother [ah] your brother [ah]
I guess ya
<malay> aku lain aku everyday [jer] stress [ah]
I have to
<malay> kau imagine okay <malay> kau imagine (err)
let's say okay you you're taking this batch for one month
like then (um)
within that four weeks there is a few weekend correct
are are you di~ being disturbed on weekends or no
sometimes [ah]
then for me if I am every week every day
my phone will ring my phone will message got ping [one] confirm I tell you vibrate or whatever [lah]
everyday will do and everyday !hais! th~ that's why I'm getting tired of it
example like (err) interacting with
well
I have to deal with forty two recruits
[oh] then (err) the the recruit asking me if I single also that one S_A_F [ah]
is it
serious I got
like (uh) no [lah] no no no I got one I got one guy during my N_S right
he he was in a relationship with one other guy pin pin in his
in his (uh) vocation training
okay so what happened was (uh) they broke up
they broke up and I was and I was the direct (err) seccom
so ya so like I have to <malay> macam
coax him [ah] like [oh] [eh] don~ don't like (err)
(err) feel bad [lah] don't don't think like it's the end or something [lah] whatever
then finishing the course [ah] he come to me he say sergeant single or not what the heck
