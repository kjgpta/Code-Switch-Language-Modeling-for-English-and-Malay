but then my rest also <malay>dorang bayar</malay>
then
but then s~ s~ <malay>dorang tak nak ambil</malay> cause I still schooling [ah] then they say like <malay>apa ni</malay>
they want people that can commit more days
means
ya
but actually last sem

cause last sem last semester is everything was H_B_L
so I can H_B_L while I was working cause it's four hours rest [what]
then <malay>gitu duit masuk</malay> so <malay>senang</malay> [ah] but then wasted [lah] I never think of it [lah]
#al-ameen#
I not sure [seh] I think around
I think until two A_M three A_M like that [ah]
if I not wrong [ah]
ya
<malay>dah lama</malay> [ah] <malay>tak makan sana</malay> because like
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy [ah]
<malay>diam sudah</malay> no [ah] I mean like
if if I'm not exercising already all the more I shouldn't eat there [what] correct or not
ya diet [ah] if cannot cannot exercise then diet [ah]
but I think I want to start back soon [ah] exercising
but <malay>hijrah barang lama</malay> [ah] now the people there all
extreme [ah]
he he he
#faiz# #faiz# <malay>lagi</malay> extreme no I think #faiz# is like the epitome of extreme you know
(mmhmm)
but then I don't know [leh] like I feel like
going to the gym person <malay>pasal</malay> like my friend all say like if I go gym all [ah]
(uh) since I got the height already right
<malay>dorang semua cakap</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> confirm <malay>badan pau punya</malay> [ah]
ya but
the effort [ah] and like
I don't know [eh] I feel like going gym
but gym just very intimidating [ah] like <malay>aku rasa macam</malay>
<malay>seram</malay> [ah] like go there people all <malay>tengok-tengok semua</malay>
okay
<malay>tak tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi kecil</malay> is okay you know <malay>kecil</malay> cause
like
I don't know [ah] like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
but like if you see <malay>orang gemuk</malay> [kan] <malay>orang gemuk</malay> confirm people relate to being obese unhealthy <malay>semua</malay> [pe]
so but that stigma also like
I don't know [ah] later people <malay>kat</malay> gym <malay>tengok</malay> like [eh] try hard [pe] this guy
a bit
a bit #paiseh# [ah]
but I feel like if I don't start like
forever [sia] <malay>macam gini</malay>
[eh] you know I I looked through my gallery right
like
last time during N_S
I skinny [sia]
okay
not not not skinny [ah] I'm I was skinnier
like I was still big but like
at least I looked proportionate [ah] like don't look so <malay>bulat</malay>
I think hundred and four [ah] (uh) last time I checked was hundred and two
then these days I want to check already but my parents <malay>tak tukar</malay> the battery [ah] for the
weighing scale
so now
I just take as my weight still at hundred and two [ah]
I don't know [eh] my
cause since after N_S right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five [ah]
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
no not really after B_M_T [ah] after B_M_T still got a lot of outfields <malay>semua</malay> [pe] so we still <malay>keluar banyak-banyak</malay>
so
not say maintain [lah] but (uh) after B_M_T can order in already [what] so I always buy #nasi lemak#
<malay>makan banyak</malay> [ah] cause of
ya
then it's cause of N_S [ah] always order in <malay>asyik beli</malay> [jer] then <malay>sekali</malay>
like before I know [ah] like towards the end of N_S [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> getting rounder [ah]
cause army [kan] army the the longer
the longer you are in army right the more <malay>lepak</malay> the
the superiors all will be [ah]
ya
so towards the end is like every week
I eat #nasi lemak# I eat Fatty Bom Bom
[eh] fat~
Fatty Bom Bom free [ah] I want to eat [ah]
[eh]
watch your language man
woodlands have at #marsiling#
no no no no no no it's (uh) you know where #marsiling# M_R_T is
it's it's opposite #marsiling# M_R_T [ah] but not to the polyclinic side [tau]
you know you know #marsiling# got new shopping mall the where the police post is
<malay>rumah</malay> ella <malay>kat mana</malay> [eh] [oh] ya ya ya correct correct correct
(uh) (uh) <malay>rumah</malay> ella
<malay>kat belakang</malay> [ah]
towards the M_R_T tracks
like from <malay>rumah</malay> ella you walk to M_R_T tracks
then there's a coffee shop there [ah] Fatty Bom Bom <malay>kat sana</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
but what's the difference [seh]
[eh] it doesn't make sense [leh] I mean like okay like <malay>kau tahu</malay> (uh)
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that [one] is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
but then in this case like <malay>abang gemuk</malay> and Fatty Bom Bom no difference [what] both halal already [what]
so like they <malay>tukar nama</malay> for what [sia]
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name [mah] it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know [ah]
but
that time also <malay>ada</malay> [ah]
so like like when I go #lia's# house <malay>senang</malay> [ah]
like if got feels for Fatty Bom Bom [ah] it's just like
think like if we Grab like twenty minutes <malay>sampai</malay> [ah]
no no no it's not at #afghan# there it's at
(uh) <malay>kau tahu</malay> #dunman# sec <malay>kat mana</malay>
ya it's opposite #dunman# sec [ah]
then #lia# my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
[ah] <malay>dekat</malay> [ah]
<malay>malas</malay> [pe] <malay>dah cakap malas nak</malay> exercise
like really like it's it's like
it's like walking distance but it's a walking distance <malay>yang jauh</malay> it's like
#yio chu kang# to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far [ah]
may half half the journey [ah] from #yio chu kang# to your house
ya but like <malay>macam</malay>
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
confirm <malay>malas</malay> [sia] <malay>nak keluar</malay> it's easier for you to just order
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars [ah]
the
(uh) #tampines# [one] not so bad [eh]
I know
usually me and #lia# buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
but that [one] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay>
if only <malay>kalau ada</malay> discount [ah]
usually I get the
cajun cajun [eh] cajun cajun chicken [ah]
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice [ah] the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
(uh) then then got the then got the <malay>telur</malay> so it's like more like fried rice like that [lah]
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken [ah]
I never try <malay>abang gemuk</malay> before [ah] so cannot say [ah]
Fatty Bom Bom or FatBoy's
ya
depends [ah] some
you know some of the hawker centre [ah]
the western shop got like secondary school feels [ah]
#Idah's# Kitchen
I don't remember [sia]
is it the one the the thai shop take over [ah]
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
[oh] [oh] [oh]
I that [one] I thought that [one] is korean food [what]
[oh] I don't think I ate there before [ah]
now they got new [one] [ah] at Koufu
but a bit <malay>mahal</malay> [ah] that day I eat it's like six ninety
that kind of price [ah]
(uh) the
the whole range [ah] like you know chicken chop (uh)
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff [ah]
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it [ah]
<malay>pasal dorang</malay> ba~ <malay>dorang bagi banyak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak tapi</malay> even though the portion worth [kan] but I feel like it's like two people portion [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> the rice you know rice usually they don't give full bowl right do they give full bowl
usually they give like half bowl like that right
but over there they give the full bowl [ah] then the <malay>ayam pun dorang bagi dua</malay>
Koufu you know where the (uh)
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
I think new [ah] the shop <malay>dulu takde</malay> [ah]
but I not too sure [ah] maybe
I don't really remember [ah] because usually <malay>dulu kita orang makan sana</malay>
always <malay>makan</malay> the
japanese shop [kan]
[eh]
how [lah] I want to get better at DOTA [sia]
no [eh] but I play
I play public game like <malay>macam</malay>
always <malay>kena</malay> thrashed [ah]
it's like
if I get toxic opponent [eh] like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good [ah]
maybe [ah] maybe also
but I don't know [ah]
then <malay>aku tunggu kau</malay> download warzone <malay>sampai sekarang belum</malay> download
<malay>kental</malay> [lah]
I don't know [eh] like
I don't know how come your computer <malay>semua</malay> games <malay>tak boleh</malay> [sia]
like
the #genshin# impact also cannot right
but okay [ah] nevermind [ah] because #genshin# like you can't really play with friends [ah] like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode [ah]
like it's more to like <malay>main sendiri</malay>
then you just explore the world yourself [ah]
then
<malay>apa</malay>
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore [ah]
like cause <malay>dorang ada macam</malay> like a energy system like that
like the call it resin
so
you know [ah] so like (uh) this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge [ah] like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by [lor] then it recharge slowly
then <malay>kau boleh buat</malay> the stuff you need to do [ah]
so it's mostly a waiting game [ah] like you finish
you finish what you need to do already then just <malay>tunggu</malay> [ah]
I don't know [sia] I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
l~ like like really the game play is
fantastic [ah] phenomenal
but
I would say [ah] M M_M_O_R_P_G I've play [ah] so far
<malay>tapi</malay>
better than runescape [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
like <malay>kau kena tunggu</malay> [ah] resin <malay>kau</malay> fill up <malay>baru kau boleh main</malay>
ya so it's more of a waiting game [ah] so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term [ah]
ya true [ah]
[oh]
console <malay>pun ada</malay>
P_S_four <malay>ada</malay>
ya like I saw on YouTube got the whales [ah] they spent <malay>banyak</malay> [ah]
dude <malay>gila</malay> mam~ like okay the people that whale right they spent the first week the game came out
they spent like
like <malay>empat ribu lima ribu</malay>
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
so it's like really luck based [ah] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] your luck <malay>macam mana</malay>
I think maple [ah] cause this [one] is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already [ah]
like I I complete all the story mode already
<malay>pernah pernah</malay> [ah] M_L [ah] last time I buy the skin
ya ya ya it's like DOTA like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> I bought their equivalent of the battle pass
I think I paid like <malay>lima belas</malay> [eh]
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already [ah] like
wasteful [ah] spend <malay>duit kat</malay> game
ya some more it's like
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] additional stats but the additional stats is like what plus eight damage
like
it it makes a difference but like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak leh nampak sangat</malay> [ah] like you need like
an advantage is advantage [ah] but like they make it minimal [lor]
so <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>kau macam tak</malay> you like don't know me like that [ah]
since when I even watch soccer
(hmm) <malay>sejak bila</malay>
<malay>sejak bila aku tengok bola</malay>
I don't know [ah] like
I never I've never seen the the
what's the word [eh] the
the attractiveness of watching soccer [ah] like it's just
so slow
like <malay>kau</malay> compare <malay>dengan</malay> basketball basketball like very fast paced so like
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
[a'ah] <malay>tapi tapi bola macam</malay>
you wait pass pass pass I don't know [ah] maybe just not my thing [ah] I guess
<malay>diam sudah</malay>
[eh]
tomorrow tomorrow I got no school [ah]
like I book my <malay>solat jumaat tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dah lama</malay> [sia]
wanted to book [ah]
<malay>tapi tak dapat</malay> [ah]
(mm)
since the booking start I never I never <malay>kena dapat</malay> I think cause I always book late [ah]
so <malay>dah semua</malay> all the slots <malay>dah</malay> fill up [kan] then <malay>dah tak boleh</malay>
<malay>dah tak boleh dapat</malay> slot [ah]
I really not sure [sia]
I think the same week [ah] on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks [ah]
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
[eh] I do tomorrow already
then (uh) <malay>aku tak leh buat</malay> for the next five weeks
[a'ah] so other people can get [ah] but some more <malay>aku selalu tak dapat</malay> [ah]
it
[eh] I think they blacklist me already
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tengok kerusi</malay> all
where you where you (uh) where you plan on getting
APOL
(uh huh) I only know se~ I only know Secret Lab [ah]
(uh) and s~ streamers (uh) <malay>aku tengok</malay> mostly streamers <malay>pakai</malay> the <malay>ini</malay> [ah] Secret Lab [one]
but then the pricing [eh] similar [ah]
<malay>paling murah</malay>
<malay>asal mahal sangat</malay> [sia] it's just a chair right
like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi tapi</malay> even though
<malay>aku bayar banyak-banyak</malay>
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself [what] like it's not genuine leather right
it's P_U leather you know P_U leather actually <malay>murah</malay> [seh]
[ah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
(uh) five hundred dollars on a chair
<malay>kerusi</malay>
(uh huh)
I mean you you said it yourself right like <malay>dorang apa</malay> similar [kan]
!huh!
worth it [ah] got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site [what]
<malay>sama</malay> [ah]
I mean okay warranty <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> one for one exchange or what
<malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> right like
<malay>ada koyak sikit</malay>
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this [one] must ask [ah] I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it [ah]
every other week
<malay>kau ambil pisau kau potong</malay> [seh] already
[oh] really [ah]
okay how about <malay>macam kalau air tumpah</malay>
<malay>air tumpah</malay> on the thing
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but wh~
okay but what if it's like <malay>kau tumpah</malay> [kan] Coke
like you know Coke is very very corrosive right
that time that time <malay>siapa</malay> [eh] <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> (uh) I think
#achap# [ah] #achap# <malay>tunjuk aku</malay> the video
<malay>orang pakai</malay> Coke
<malay>untuk cuci</malay> toilet
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
I've never been a fan of fizzy drinks [ah] like even time <malay>hari raya</malay> [kan]
like
(uh) okay usually guest just [eh] (uh) <malay>tuan rumah dorang selalu</malay> just <malay>tuang</malay> [kan]
F&N [pe] F&N is like the standard [ah] the (mm)
my my <malay>nenek punya</malay> side more of Coke [ah] so they got like
they got like a lot of Coke
like one one what do you call that [eh] (uh) basket
not basket [ah] they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
then another container is all just (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> F&N
s~
ya <malay>hari raya</malay>
so if I go my <malay>nenek</malay> house
it's really just gassy drinks <malay>atau teh</malay>
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
like you know Pokka ice lemon tea <malay>gitu</malay>
ya different
syrup also not a big fan [ah]
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established [ah]
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons (uh) (uh) the ice lemon tea is the blue colour [one] but they got the
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] the other one <malay>yang</malay> [ah] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] the <malay>hijau</malay> [one] <malay>sedap</malay> [ah]
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea [ah] but the blue colour [one] is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness [ah] ya the sugar
<malay>tak tapi</malay> the best [one] I think is the Seasons peach tea
Seasons peach tea but <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak cari</malay> like everywhere I go like most most <malay>kedai tak jual</malay> [ah]
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
it confirm <malay>pernah</malay> it's the orange colour [one]
but <malay>sekarang susah nak cari</malay> I think they stopped production already [ah] I haven't I haven't seen it
for for a while already [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] (uh)
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job [ah] dude
<malay>takde takde</malay> ga~ <malay>takde kerja takde gaji takde gaji takde duit</malay>
<malay>takde duit takde</malay> table tennis
I think no more already confirm <malay>dorang dah buang punya</malay> like the thing so #lup sup# you know
haven't [ah] but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know [ah] I just scared
<malay>macam</malay> repeat
like history repeat repeat itself [ah]
lik~ (uh) ya that's why
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> not that bad because like
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much [ah]
so maybe not that bad [ah]
but then [eh] you got #lobang# for <malay>kerja</malay> or not
ya but like
I don't know [ah] like I want to do cafe all but like the cafe all <malay>semua yang tak</malay> halal
in the one that pays well [ah]
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet [ah]
okay [ah] honestly [ah]
<malay>aku tak pernah kerja</malay> banquet
that time you work [what] no [meh]
<malay>yang sebelah yang sebelah</malay> Hard Rock Cafe
[ah]
(uh)
[oh]
#sheikh# also work kitchen [ah]
[oh]
the one a
[eh] but that [one] also see your manager also [ah]
because
ya cause (uh) my friend from N_S <malay>dulu kerja</malay>
it's not really banquet [ah] but they set up for the banquet people [ah]
<malay>kat</malay>
#shang# Shangri-La
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
(uh) like the table chair stage <malay>semua dorang</malay> set up
then usually it's for like reception <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] wedding reception kind of thing
ya then after that they just <malay>tunggu</malay> for the event to finish then they teardown
I think so like who
[oh] yeah yeah yeah but
but <malay>dorang punya</malay> is more for <malay>ini</malay> [kan] is like
like <malay>apa ni</malay> concerts <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
[ah] ya then this [one] is only for
like wedding reception only [ah]
<malay>kat</malay> Shangri-La that that type
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager [ah] so
the manager is like #sheikh# and that [one] also
(uh) like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay [lah]
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much [ah]
he just delegate the work <malay>semua</malay> then <malay>duduk goyang kaki goyang</malay> [ah]
ya
ya
then I don't know [ah] I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends [eh]
ke~ <malay>kerja senang</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah buat banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
[oh] ya but Marche <malay>tak</malay> halal [lah]
[eh] <malay>jangan gini</malay> [ah]
(uh)
maybe
[eh] have you have you went to Fika before
ya [eh] the food there
ya it's it's
you know where working title is [eh] actually working title closed already it's beside working title [ah]
!huh! they work there
I cannot imagine #rian# at Fika though cause the people there are like really
<malay>berbual</malay> really like proper english <malay>punya</malay> you know and like
how to say [ah] I don't know [ah] I can't imagine #rian# there
like #aidil# #aidil# I still can see him [ah] working at Fika but #rian# a bit hard [ah] to imagine him working there
[eh] but the food there the food
the [eh] the ambiance all
top notch [ah]
like work there also I think #swee#
[eh] the food
a bit more to the <malay>mahal</malay> side [ah]
[oh] I I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause (uh) my friend tell me their service there is like top notch [ah]
but then my friend say [ah] like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
then <malay>dia dapat banyak apa ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>banyak</malay> freebies <malay>semua</malay>
but then <malay>dia kira balik</malay> [kan] actually what he paid for
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get [ah]
worth it [lah] ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend [ah]

apex apex game <malay>dia macam mana</malay>
<malay>tapi dia punya</malay> graphics <malay>semua macam</malay> cartoon-ish [kan]
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress [ah]
valorant is not [sia] actually it's quite realistic [what] is like same as almost C_S go but
only the suit like a bit
[oh] (uh) <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> halo kind of graphic [ah]
[eh] how
are you are you buying the P_S five or not
sch~ busy <malay>dengan sekolah</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang</malay> P_S five <malay>berapa</malay>
is now is <malay>mahal</malay> cause <malay>orang</malay> resell [eh]
[oh]
I don't know [ah] like <malay>semua orang</malay> like <malay>rebut nak beli</malay> P [eh] actually not ya I don't know I never see the hype of console [lah]
<malay>ada</malay> [ah] <malay>main</malay> [ah]
like when I go to my <malay>apa ni</malay> cousin's house
(uh)
ya like the first console I owned was P_S_P
(ugh) cause okay
<malay>aku dari dulu</malay> [kan] like
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
my parents <malay>macam</malay>
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing [ah]
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
but computer <malay>pun</malay> my parents let me play like what twenty minutes
ya so
<malay>dorang</malay> like <malay>cakap</malay> okay (uh) #haris# (uh)
<malay>kau main</malay> twenty minutes
then after that [eh] you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my P_S_L_E
[eh] [eh] no primary five exam primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
my father [ah] my father <malay>cakap</malay> like [eh] #haris# (uh) okay [ah]
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy I want game boy
not really strike a deal [lah] like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three [ah] so like I never really believe them [ah]
(uh) wouldn't say well [lah] like
so so [ah] A A B B
like A B B B
like I would say it's ave~ okay [ah] above average [ah] slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know [ah] one day I just come home [eh]
suddenly like everyone <malay>kat</malay> (uh) <malay>kat luar</malay> then I was like thinking what you doing then they were charging the P_S_P
then turns out one was for me [ah] one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted P_S_P I wanted game boy [what]
so my father <malay>cakap dengan</malay> the salesperson the salespersons <malay>cakap like</malay>
[eh] <malay>cik</malay> if you want to buy game boy
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no [ah] but wasted [ah] cause my parents bought P_S_P when it first came out
so it's P_S_P one thousand
[ah]
<malay>dah</malay> [ah] <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>tak yah panggil gemuk</malay> [pe]
[ah] ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my P_S_P the slim [one] come out
the once the slim [one] come out <malay>semua beli</malay> [ah]
ya
but then that the closest to console I got [ah] P_S_P
ya but actually the games there quite good [sia]
ya
D_S [ah]
I think D_S take over [ah] the market
P_S_P Vita Vita P_S Vita ya ya ya
downfall [lah] ya
then I
but I
I think
I think it's cause it's different [lah] like you don't really have any console yang <malay>kau boleh</malay> use touch screen <malay>kat bawah tapi</malay> still got the tactile buttons
ya it's like
just want to show off features [ah] <malay>ada</malay> dual screen kind of
[ah] that [one] is a Pokemon brand already [ah]
until now right ya Switch
no but Switch still got <malay>ada ada</malay> animal crossing <malay>ada</malay>
got other games [ah]
but quite popular [what] <malay>aku tengok banyak orang</malay> [sia] <malay>main</malay>
ya don't know [ah] mayb~
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked [ah] don't know [ah] this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing [ah]
ya
the (uh) he got post on Twitter [ah] I got see a picture of his (uh) like office like that
I think
publicity [ah] like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that [what]
got a rea~
probably that [one] also not he play [ah] maybe his P_R team play for him [ah]
ya
!hais!
<malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
[oh] okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay> ya
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice [leh]
like I okay this [one] is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular [ah]
until now I I looking to play it again you know but <malay>tak [leh] jumpa</malay> [ah] it's called what is it called [eh] (uh)
adventurer concourse I forget [ah]
it is [ah] it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
(uh) medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself [ah]
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war <malay>tak pernah</malay> [ah]
total war is what [ah]
is it
[oh] no no no
ya <malay>apa</malay> [eh] got once got one game quite sick it was on Steam bro <malay>yang</malay>
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from [lah]
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget [ah] (uh)
I !wah! I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side [ah]
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
<malay>korang boleh</malay> like form a squad then do like
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
(err) (uh) quite cool [ah]
I forgot what's the name of the game [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia</malay>
plazma burst
(mm)
isn't that just (uh)
escape room
[oh] [oh] is it is it the one <malay>yang kau kena kena</malay> fix the generators <malay>semua</malay>
and then there's a ghost chasing you
[oh] is it
I'm not sure [ah]
#farid# all [ah]
skipper
#aiman#
#aiman#
[oh] I don't know [ah] I never see [ah] they post on twitter [ah]
I never see before [ah] #ipin# I only see him post M_L <malay>punya</malay> video [ah]
okay [lah] not bad [lah] he was top top in singapore [ah] one point of time
for one hero no cause in M_L is as long as you play a hero <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> [kan]
then your
M_M_R for that hero will increase
[ah] so like (uh) he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again [ah]
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore [ah]
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands #yishun# ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's (uh) asian server [ah]
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> clamp the ranking <malay>kena main banyak</malay> [ah]
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
ya for other country is by state so like #johor# <malay>macam</malay> #johor# will be
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in #johor# top in #selangor# top in #sabah# that kind of thing
ya that's why
I think north south east west also like cause a lot of players so they need to <malay>macam</malay> separate <malay>semua orang</malay>
singapore is one state [ah] singapore is a state [what] it's a state country right
(uh)
