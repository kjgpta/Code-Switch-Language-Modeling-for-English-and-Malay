exactly <malay>kau tahu</malay> it's a stupid joke and yet you still tell that joke
the joke is supposed to be funny <malay>tak kelakar pun</malay>
ya
is it is it <malay>macam</malay> blind date like you
just did not know him or <malay>kau</malay> [dah] <malay>nampak muka dia</malay> and then you decide to go on a date <malay>dengan dia</malay>
it's always the cute guys <malay>yang buat kita orang macam</malay> like this
I think I think you <malay>kau ada cakap</malay> telegram [oh]
ya he was practically ghosting <malay>kau kesian</malay>
it is what it is
ya
actually [ah] I have one <malay>calon</malay> for you
and he is he is actually <malay>mak aku punya</malay> friend <malay>punya anak</malay>
so like but we kind of grow up together [lah] so <malay>sejak kecil</malay> until <malay>besar</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] the thing about him is the thing about him is <malay>dia pendiam</malay> so
[eh] no <malay>dia macam pendiam</malay> with certain people that's what I notice about him but but
the good thing is he is older than us by a year so I think it's like <malay>secucuk</malay> for you [lah]
no but you like you like guys who are older what you don't like guys who are younger than you right
<malay>adik-adik</malay> ya stop it [sia]
ya and the guy is soft spoken but then I know <malay>kau suka lelaki yang boleh</malay> fight <malay>dengan kau</malay>
but he's the only candidate that <malay>aku tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>yang</malay> I can recommend to you
no I I told you [what] he is my mum's friend <malay>punya anak</malay>
so like I <malay>kenal</malay> him from young and like my mum is friends with her friends <malay>sejak dulu</malay> so (mm)
(mm)
you you like guys <malay>yang suka bantah</malay> is it
I don't know
(um)
ya I <malay>faham</malay> I <malay>faham</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
but that kind of person <malay>susah nak cari</malay> [seh] because like nowadays guys are just
the most meanest guys are like very very mean and like the most nicest guys are like too nice
bye bye and (uh huh)
he's more on the mean side but there's like
no he's only mean to other people
I don't know you tell me is he is he like really <malay>kasar dengan kau</malay>
(hmm) I know actually now right is actually so hard to find a partner that is truly down to earth for you and really down
to to like date you and then to <malay>kahwin</malay> with you
act~ actually (uh) after the truth or dare game right I thought <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tak suka aku</malay> because like I feel like maybe
he feels <malay>malu</malay> because he had to do it so from then on <malay>macam</malay> it was like a forced thing to do and maybe he because of that <malay>dia</malay> just start to <malay>tak suka</malay> me
that's what I felt ya because that time when you know after that they ordered mac right
and [ah] I wanted a straw or something so I said [oh] !alah! can you pass me a straw I don't know why he like he just ignored me
then I am like wasn't the <malay>tak</malay> [oh] is he not at me
ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
she loves loves me
!huh! I don't think it was love yet because at that point of time I think he'll he'll still talking to his ex you know <malay>kau tahu</malay>
<malay>dia masih berbual-bual dengan</malay> ex <malay>dia</malay> [seh] ya
ya and then [ah] he was actually low key hoping to get back with his ex but then his ex was just like [eh] I don't know
ya
yes yes there was the story then [ah] you know then after that I <malay>teman</malay> him to go for one office <malay>takraw</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> sessions just to watch [lah] and then we were walking to the sports hall <malay>abeh</malay> I think <malay>kawan dia</malay> saw us walking in and then his friend took a snapchat then [ah] <malay>kawan dia</malay> upload to
snapchat and then [eh] his ex <malay>nampak</malay> [lah] then
(err) his ex message him and ask I thought I thought there was still something between us
yes <malay>dia</malay> playing hard to get but then she's also like <malay>macam</malay>
not sure about him but also playing hard to get <malay>macam mana</malay>
so <malay>dia orang dah</malay> break up [lah]
exactly
like
exactly there is my point that is what I mean
but
ya ya
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak suka</malay> when like (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> girlfriends are like so insecure of like the boyfriend <malay>punya kawan</malay> I mean just make it clear [lah] that
you guys just <malay>kawan</malay> and like the girl should understand
so she's like being two faced is that what <malay>kau</malay> mean by that <malay>ular ular kepala dua</malay> is it
what
it's not just
how will wait so the guy is gay
[orh] okay okay [dah]
for years
but why would the girl <malay>buat</malay> such a thing to the <malay>mata air</malay> [sia]
I mean I don't know that guy
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's okay if you want to <malay>buka aib dia</malay> to me because I don't even know who he is so
(mm)
wait so does that mean at some point <malay>kau pernah suka lelaki tu</malay> on
[oh]
(um)
ya
like <malay>kau orang</malay> are just platonic friends [lah]
the <malay>mata air dia</malay> just have issues [lah] I think because remember remember when <malay>aku</malay> used to have issues dengan #yasmin#
ya
I don't even know why and then now <malay>kita</malay> we're friends so like look [ah] the turntables
no is is is it is it the office reference <malay>entah</malay> [lah]
speaking of the office you know my sister [ah] I told my <malay>kakak</malay> about (uh) all my internship drama in the office it was so dramatic and then she is like
maybe (err) your boss should hire a cameraman and then like cameramen will like every time when there is a fight in the office
the cameraman <malay>kena</malay> zoom in so it's like more dramatic and then
and then (uh) <malay>dia akan</malay> (uh) bend into like the people around <malay>dia punya</malay> reaction that will be so funny and then the title should (err) the office two point O
ya
well anyways I didn't tell you about one of the main drama in my intern office
so basically [kan] [ah] logistics and accounts just cannot get along for some freaking reason and then
<malay>aku</malay> is the middleman because I'm the intern and I'm supposed to <malay>buat kerja</malay> for both finance and logistics
but then again finance and logistics are supposed to work together because like if they don't work together how are they <malay>macam</malay> how is the company going to <malay>maju</malay> right and then
and then so I have to be the middleman so for finance I have to scan (err) purchase order and invoices
and then after I no I will get a purchase order and invoices from logistics to do it for finance <malay>habis tu</malay>
[ah] after I scan and then I will pass to the finance person [lah] and then <malay>mesti perempuan</malay> finance <malay>ni pun cakap</malay>
<malay>asyik</malay> pass <malay>kat aku</malay> [seh] this one you pass back to (err) <malay>si</malay> logistics <malay>dulu</malay> then I'm like
what do you want me to do with this after this is <malay>dah kerja kau</malay> [pe]
(mm) it's like <malay>macam</malay> as if they make it look like <malay>macam aku tak nak buat kerja padahal</malay>
they are the ones that making <malay>kerja aku susah</malay> you know so frustrating
(mmhmm)
(um) I I get what you mean though because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] at N_U_S
speaking of work also you not because of the COVID <malay>kita kena</malay> work from home
so I have to bring back my laptop and usually <malay>kat kerja</malay> I will use desktop
but then like you know laptop is so <malay>kecil dari</malay> desktop and it's so hard to navigate things and plus the system is so screwed up and is always hanging
and plus I'm still new to the system
and then [oh] and then <malay>aku punya</malay> boss every damn day <malay>dia akan suruh kita</malay> on zoom and he'll have a meeting with us
(mm) I mean [ah] almost <malay>hari-hari</malay> [kan] my boss will <malay>tanya</malay> everyone [oh] what is on your plate today what is on your plate today like
<malay>macam</malay> every damn day <malay>hari-hari</malay> nine thirty A_M sharp zoom meeting without fail <malay>dia akan tanya</malay>
[ah] my office hours is nine thirty to six thirty
[ah] you end earlier [what]
about one hour
<malay>lima belas minit</malay>
ya
from
(um) #kim# #yam# road <malay>nak pergi</malay> #sengkang# okay [lah] and then plus you know <malay>bila nak pergi</malay> and <malay>balik lagi kerja kena naik turun bukit</malay> [oh] my goodness
so tiring
ya so depressing <malay>tu</malay> turbine intern so !huh!
what topic though
J J
[oh]
#jannah#
!wah! so <malay>jangan</malay> [lah]
is it #jannah# <malay>dari mata air</malay>
<malay>kau tak</malay> [eh]
who who who do you have in mind to be #jannah# <malay>mata air</malay>
but
honestly I cannot wait until #jannah# <malay>kahwin</malay> though because like
I will feel so happy for her <malay>macam</malay> yes
I know right
any guy <malay>yang dapat</malay> #jannah# is a very very lucky guy
is it
no because you <malay>kau tahu</malay> [pe] I don't really have a lot of friends especially especially guy friends
!hey! what do you mean by that
no my cousins
<malay>sepupu aku</malay> they are either <malay>lagi tua</malay> or they're younger than me
so like I don't think #jannah# will be interested in <malay>dia orang</malay>
allan no no no no allan's cousins already have [ah] girlfriends and one of them is younger than him and I knew #jannah# <malay>tak suka lelaki yang</malay> younger than her
so like scrap that
it has this is a very hard thing to do
[kan] <malay>saya ni</malay> like #shaza# really <malay>shaza pula jap</malay> I mean you deserve the best also but #jannah# also like deserves the best
why (ugh)
we
we all deserve the best
feminism and empowerment [oh] my god speaking of empowerment do you hear about the U_S elections
it's so <malay>merepek</malay>
did you know did you know that kanye west is really running for president
it's like americans don't even take <malay>dia orang punya</malay> elections seriously and some are actually voting for kanye
ya
you know actually actually [ah] U_S should take notes from singapore and make voting
a compulsory thing and not give them a choice because that I see
<malay>orang dekat</malay> U_S <malay>dia orang</malay> like [oh] have you registered to vote
I mean you have a choice to register or not
ya but
to get whether you get involved or not in politics
it's your <malay>masa masa hadapan</malay> that you are thinking of it's the <malay>masa depan masa hadapan</malay> of your children
so like
you get what I mean right
yes
[oh]
did you hear about the woke culture thing
especially <malay>kat</malay> singapore

<malay>macam</malay> no offence na na na na na but ne na na na
demographic
ya
ya
you know actually [ah]
(uh) actually women <malay>dia orang minta</malay> for equality I think like the proper word though use is not equality but the proper word to use is actually equity
ya call for equity
ya cause it's like
no no no no not not financial management it's (uh)
<malay>macam</malay>
being fair to both genders but added but at the same time [ah] seek catering to their needs better it's like <malay>macam</malay> for example you're looking over fence [ah] this guy can see because over the fence because he's tall but then
these (uh) but this other person cannot see so if you give both of them
ya actually I know
<malay>aku tak mahu bual pasal apa ni dah aku dah melalut</malay> okay nevermind
