okay
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on [ah]
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
so I say that to him [lah]
(mm)
so they were looking for people to debate [lah] like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
[ah] I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate [what]
so (uh)
(err) I
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
(mm)
seriously [ah]
okay
okay we don't talk about H_B_L [lah] [eh]
H_B_L is (err)
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
(uh huh)
[ah] right
that's the thing [ah]
even
but government allow sport activity [what]
[ah]
so I call this guy he's known for speaking [ah] good malay
(uh) to mix we always mix
[ah]
[a'ah] it's very standard [ah]
(err) okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have (err)
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay [lah] let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
[oh] my god
you know what
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
(mm) [ah] okay okay
so
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
something like that
[ah] alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my (err) future [lah]
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
[ah] be a professional sports player
okay
(uh huh)
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer [lah] cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
(err) but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England E_P_L who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
[ah] so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money [lah]
[ah]
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific [lah] but
Singapore soccer is a no no [lah]
all macam #haziq#
[ah] that's a bit unrealistic the passion is (uh) actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of (err)
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life [lah]
[ah]
alright
sorry
[ah] true true Malaysia pay better
(um)
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower [ah]
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport [ah]
anywhere and everywhere
!wah! so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late [lah] I don't want to be late [lah]
ya so for example [ah]
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
(mm)
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching [ah]
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about [lah]
[ah]
it is an emotional story
(um) sad
but
no it's a series series
(mm) but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
(hmm)
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
[oh]
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class [ah] in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well (err) in primary school
[ah] because
(um)
how to say [eh]
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no [lah] I mean that that's the problem [ah] because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have (err) you know
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
[ah] play soccer at the void deck all [lah] so
I will change my mindset [lah] but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this [ah] cliche phrase
it's true [ah] what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example [ah] that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like !wah!
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song [ah] [kan] maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone try~ I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
[ah]
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders [ah] basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start [eh] you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song [ah]
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because [ah] there was this video playing that song [ah] so like [oh] not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K [ah] I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
you know but I'm like [oh] ya [eh] nice song nice song [ah]
so it's damn annoying [ah] actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the D_J [lah]
okay [lah] okay [lah] we cannot throw shades [lah] okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
(mm)
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
(um)
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries [ah] will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
(mm)
ya
precisely
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's a sensitive (uh) topic
okay
let's see next question [eh]
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do (mm) very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds [lah]
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
(um) rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need [ah] okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and [ah] okay basically iphone is good [lah] those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
(um) shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at #pasar malam#
and then
shoe (uh) twenty thousand [lah]
you know [ah] Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
[ah] bought a very expensive car [lah]
(uh) so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like [eh] you know this pe~ this and this bought this and this I'm like [oh] okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money [lah]
you want to show off
and all
give me their money [lah] I can put to better use
okay [oh] yes sorry
(mm)
(uh)
but people just live to complicate it
[ah]
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face [lah]
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do [lah] right
alright next question
[oh] this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours [oh] my god
[oh] my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
yeah
ya so like
like they say [ah] everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different [lah]
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
so I'm like [eh] so there's now two shops [eh]
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food [lah] outside food the look is so important
(mm) (mm)
and
(mm)
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got N_S [ah]
hopefully
[oh] you know what I just want N_S to come [lah]
(um) next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
(err) [oh] okay okay [oh] okay okay
okay (hmm)
[oh] okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone [eh] sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
(mm)
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
some people just ha~ the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face [ah]
okay I wouldn't say expert because
(err) I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right [lah]
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on [lah] it was like what blonde
then I was like
[ah] see [ah] this [one] [ah] I_T_E
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in I_T_E
you have to admit [ah]
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
[ah] the H_O_D
[eh] don't do this [lah]
you know what I mean you are like come on [lah] you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but #kena# our H_O_D
you wanna get expelled is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
no comments
(um) okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
(um)
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
(um)
can [ah] but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is (err)
skill [eh]
maths
[ah] I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths [ah] maths [ah] like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of (uh) discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me [ah]
[ah]
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
yes
okay
it's good [lah] they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
!alamak! cannot search [ah]
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning [lah]
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events [oh] basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny [lah] okay we skip class
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding [ah] a serious scolding [ah]
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
[ah]
I mean
it's hard [lah] it's hard
yeah
damn but
[oh] my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss [lah] definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it [lah] [eh] let's not throw shade to people [lah] [eh]
but [oh] my god I miss our I_F_T class with
(uh) #ham# boy
S&W
(uh)
you only spend time when [ah]
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you [lah]
like that we really sit down and talk
[ah]
[ah] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was [ah]
[ah]
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time [lah]
[ah]
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
(um) graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or J_C correct
so okay [lah]
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
(err)
ya okay then you have to go to I_T_E okay
then from I_T_E where's where's the next destination
E_A_E
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
you know what I mean
but
[ah]
and I have better options [ah] I have better prospect so
if I'm gonna go this way
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do [ah] to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
H_B_L
because I hated every moment of H_B_L
one week then I didn't come for another one week
you know what I mean
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that [what] you know what I mean
like giving
so
true [lah] true
yeah
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free [ah]
cause I'm laying low a bit
[ah] I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things [lah] in the future
(mm) so you can actually come down
three more right
(mm)
alright alright I wi~ I will look forward I will look forward then J_B will be here for
!huh!
fifteen minutes fifteen [ah] serious expressway
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) in Singapore you wanna rev come on [lah]
you throttle abit beep
#kena# fine
okay
let's see
okay okay okay
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
(um)
let me think [ah]
it it seems good right
[oh]
I wanted to
like you know my friend buy then I get the free one [lah]
what happened
[oh] your wifi seems abit bad [lah] [eh]
okay [lah] I think we go next question [ah] it's a good question
good looks or fit body what would you prefer
okay we we apply it to ourselves [lah] [ah] not to other people [lah]
what would you rather have
yes
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that [lah] this I guess this my fate [lah]
so if
in the past yeah fit body now [ah]
whatever god give me I'll take [lah]
like (uh) whatever it is [lah] good looks fit body
but now I'm going to N_S so I guess I have to choose fit body again [lah]
like know because I_P_P_T
[ah] but [oh] my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body [lah] like
we don't need upper body strength
you don't pass don't shoot [eh]
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying [lah] because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
if you look at the oppunent team [eh]
the best is usually the fastest
[ah] but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst [ah] offensively
[ah]
so
but I have to keep up with those (uh) because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not (um)
used to it [ah] like I'm not exposed to it [what]
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
C_D
for me
for the rest of my life bro
frugal [eh]
the one near the bus stop to go to I_T_E
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with veg~ K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house [lah] because free [what]
right
[oh] N_Y_P chicken rice for the win bro
funny [ah] you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore !chey!
[oh] I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
chicken
beef
[ah]
#kampung# chicken they make sure it's from a
not say #kampung# [lah] but you know #kampung# means they bring it up naturally
[ah] it it it you don't have to worry about the
others [lah]
(uh)
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival [what] the basic survival need
[eh]
O K S I
okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe [ah] I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya !wah! I mean
true [lah] true
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
(uh) system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict [ah]
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
[ah]
correct
(mmhmm)
(um)
!wah!
yeah
you know what okay
no very simple
then we open
(um)
like (uh)
only for pioneer generation [lah]
why not
yeah
correct or not if the old people are not a tech savvy enough okay they go
[ah]
must use the [ah] reservation booking
yeah
(uh) whether they have space or not and but come on [ah]
the
this is the problem right find solution [lah]
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
thi~ thi~ this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who [ah]
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is [lah] [ah]
so we just have to take care of ourselves [lah] that's why you know [ah] like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot [ah] like
actually we don't have to go out always
[ah] but that is different thing but you know to go out every single day
you go out transport money
food money
shopping money
money money money
everything is money bro you wanna go here to here okay [lah] you never eat outside you bring food from home food food from home also cost money
you got out take transport also money
[ah]
correct
[ah]
ya because K want to #lepak# okay but
not outside you know what I mean like that's why I always invite you to come my house
[ah]
it is prone to have problems
like my neighbourhood is very peaceful so okay [lah]
nothing much

then later when the number of cases spike then everyone panic so
no comments [lah] this kind of thing is very
just let let

like you bring me to the most beautiful country with the best place to sightsee I would appreciate
like you bring me to a country with the best theme park I would go
[ah]
correct correct
okay that's different [lah] that's different [lah] #bali# nah
nah
but normal normal asia bro it's europe
or south america bro
okay [lah] if you talk realistically [ah] you want to go to europe also you have to go to the europe safe country [lah] Turkey
ya
they they handled the situation quite well
based on what I heard [lah] because you see [ah] like
U [ah] U_K they are very big hit
[ah] so it's quite worrisome to go there [ah]
(mm)
greenland

like
I mean ok like it when it comes to
my exes then that is another different story [lah]
is a is a lesson to learn
but at the same time if I didn't go through that I feel like
I wouldn't be this kind like I wouldn't be myself I wouldn't be the person that I am today
so to me I don't feel
an ounce of regret
in any of my decision so far
because like that okay I think my third wish I would

to like (err) online exams no no I'm I'm like not a huge fan of all this online stuff at all I hate it I really really hate it
I was like
[ah] really cannot I really cannot cause I'm type of person [ah] who like (um) prefers everything like to be there in the traditional way [ah] right like physically seeing your lecturer lecturer and then like taking down notes physically
like like I can't can't do I can't do it I can't do the virtual thingy I really I really don't find it like (um)
productive at all for me throughout the whole semester
what about you what about you
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) it's
still not the same right
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
[eh] but serious [ah] forty eight hours
[oh] my god
(uh) (uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) !wow!
(mm) okay I see I see [eh] (uh) but forty eight hours forty eight hours is really long [eh]
(uh)
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
!wow! five sections
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) not really ya it's it's not clear ya it's not clear at all
ya
ya is it wha~ what you using
(mm)
(mm) that's why
okay never mind
can [lah] but it's just like it's very hard for me to like
like there's like a bit like
anyway right (um)
like she gave like eleven questions eleven questions
like there was like minimum of words words in a minimum and then (um) [ah] she also specified [lah] like (um) the (uh)
it's quite a lot actually ya I mean if it's like maybe if it's five marks then okay which like I would say it's like worth the marks to write so much but it's like really just two to three marks but like ya so it was like very
very hard [ah] I I don't know it's like (um) it's the questions were not hard it's just that I find that (um)
ya
eleven essays
cause like
cause
ya ya I did I finish way earl~ way ahead of (um) the the the the submission period
[lah] cause I cause I honestly feel that (um) the longer the paper right the more you will drag the more you will procrastinate
you what I mean ya
you you
the questions were okay like just now I say [kan] it was just like okay the it just takes a lot of time and then like having to sit in front of a laptop for like long hours is like (uh) my back was like crying for help
ya from from I think like from having like online lectures to like online exams it's just
it's just the whole the whole thing is not like helpful at all like the whole in like for like studying something right it's like not conducive at all I I feel like being at home
studying at home like like managing like things alone no managing like having like classes at home it's very it's not conducive at all
ya cause like you have like family members around and then people are doing different things in the background and then you can't really focused and then it's like affecting your (um) attention and then you get distracted and then you will like get up every now and then to go to the kitchen and then get something you know
it's not like (err) I don't know I just feel like it's not conducive at all to be at home and having like lectures or exams is the worst
it's the worse [eh] and then like (um) like like like (uh)
my results ya it was it was it was it was surprisingly okay I exp~ like I like same as you [ah] I expected like worse cause I feel like (um) some of the modules they were like quite (uh) heavy
they quite heavy and then like the the workload was also very heavy so like
it took a lot of like my time and energy like completing most of the coursework so it's like I I I've I was like very very (um) drained throughout the whole semester like mentally drained physically drained so it's like (mm) like I was quite satisfied with (um) my results [lah] cause
I think the I think the lecturers are being (uh) quite lenient [lah]
ya ya
ya
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[eh] you know what was funny I I've been in the same situation
the attendance was like not compulsory but lecturers still took note of who attended class right
cannot [ah]
so I'm like virtually I'm there but I'm really not physically I'm just somewhere else
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(uh huh) (uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[ah] cause
for me like [ah] for me right (um)
I don't know why she wanted things to she wanted to make things more difficult for us you know like
she was like as like for like every week
like three three or four slides she would go through so like the slides was like was like nine nine to ten minutes and that's it so it's like she only goes through like first not even like first part it's like very small part of the whole chapter so had to be we had to really go every go through everything on ourselves
cause like you know it's it's heavy it's it's it's also a very heavy (um) course so it's like I I feel like it wasn't helpful at all and then she was always like she's very high expectations on her students [ah] I I honestly feel that way I mean
[ah] in the situation we're in right now is like not really helpful [lah]
so it was like more pressure on like whoever is participating in a group work
we just like you know it's supposed to be a group assignment and then like like out of like six people like only three
so I was like [ah] it was very frustrating cause like for me I don't really like to confront like
members who don't really do their work
especially when like
(um) like group members don't reply to your texts and they just like they only leave you on read everytime frustrating [kan]
ya exactly ya ya exactly
and then
ya ya ya
ya ya ya I mean
[oh] okay that's early I mean
we just finished exams right
(mmhmm)
(uh huh) [ah] [oh] same same
same I'm taking malay also ya
ya but level two cause I took the level one already
(mmhmm)
[ah]
okay
(mm) (mm)
[oh]

(mm) I really can't I really can't I don't know how but I really can't cause
I really I really
respect those people who really have that confidence to really to really you know just just say whatever and they don't even care if like I mean especially when people like (um) people reply and they have like (err) like there was there's like a clash of opinions and things right then they will have like a cer~ they will somehow have like a certain discussion

sometimes for me ya like it's like [ah] sometimes I feel like [ah] I get I get tired sometimes I get tired so like you know sometimes you just have to like (uh) just take a break from it but like it's still like you know a few days and then like [oh] okay can can already [ah] then you know activate back and then like okay already

(uh)
it's like (uh) like I mean
ya I mean like sometimes you like I mean I get what you want to say but then sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that people won't like have that same opinion as you you know

like maybe to build like my career first and everything then I can think about other stuff
[eh] it's good catching up with you though
(mm) ya you know when you don't have like classes
okay then bye take care
bye
it's so long since I've seen you
so how are you
[oh] really
how is it
[oh]
so ya because like I I wanted to go uni right but I didn't get in so I will try next year but for now like I need to find a job so is quite difficult [lah] because of the pandemic also it's like (uh) it's like very limited with the jobs so (hmm)
[oh] [ah] cashier job
[oh] that no that one temporary I mean they did ask me to extend [lah] but I it's not something that I want to do for like a long term you get what I mean ya ya cause like cause I work you know at N_T_U_C there right like as the cashier so have to deal with like a lot of like like for you [lah] your one is also elderly right then
ya we also have to deal with a lot of elderly like for example like [ah] we got N_T_U_C we got the you know the senior senior discount right on like certain days so I think it's ya no no no it's (uh) like (uh) for the elderly citizens like those sixty years old and above right if they buy their groceries on like for example wednesday they get a discount
ya so that's why I'm not working there anymore because it's quite difficult
right [oh] really [ah]
as in she working [oh]
[oh]
ya [eh] she working as cashier also [ah] (mm)
(um) I think I got make like a few mistakes [lah] once because I was just new what then I like had to do the cashier all by myself right because usually at the start right they the aunty will be beside you to help you so like after like a few weeks right then [ah] you have to do the cashier part alone
so ya then I got make a few mistakes like like something to do with the money [lah] I mean ya then after that (uh) the manager and the supervisor didn't scold me so I guess that's good like they were very nice about it ya even though it was ya
ya [lah] we need to pay back ya we need to pay back but like below five dollar don't need to pay back but if above five dollar need [lah] ya but so far never [ah]
[oh] ya got this one point of time when I was just new then like I was doing with the aunty [lah] so apparently like I think I miscalculated [leh] then got like a shortage of like ten dollars you know like ten dollars or more
ten dollars more ya because I think was fifteen dollars so five dollar offset right and ten dollars she need to pay well I I was supposed to pay [ah] cause I think I was the one that did the mistake [lah] then after that my aunty insist that she will pay for me so I felt so touched by her ya because they they're all very nice there ya ya I think it depends on the outlet [lah]
ya
[oh] my god
[ah] so nice luckily the uncle
so ya I don't know if it's like some of them may be on purpose or what [lah] but okay maybe there are others who really not on purpose then sometimes the card will have a error like they will say try again or payment not accepted or something so that means
[ah] pay on the spot right then the machine cannot use like ya so that's why is like we have to be like attentive [lah] also but also some of the customers like I think [ah] some of them are like purposely like never pay then they just walk off ya
ya ya cause some some of like okay [lah] the one that time cause I work with sophia right then she had to pay like how much [ah] eighteen dollars like she had to pay ya because the customer walk off then like she cannot find a customer
ya ya luckily only eighteen [sia] imagine if the person buy like hundred dollar plus or what !wah! that one is like is like one week pay [leh]
[oh] ya okay I wanted to talk about the the ya wait what's her name #fadreena# is it #fadreena# so you met her from C_C_A right the try out
(hmm)
[oh] no okay wait so my friend [ah] I don't know if you know her [lah] is she's the one that wear the hijabi she I mean hijab the she's my secondary school friend [lah]
so apparently she and the #fadreena# they are in the same course I believe it's ya same course but they are not classmates [lah] so apparently (uh) my friend she went to japan that exchange program with the school right
then after that the few the next few days [kan] (um) the #fadreena# was like getting close to my friend's friend so like there were times when they would just like she would like go into the hotel room right
then like [ah] the japan trip also like she was the #fadreena# was like very like I don't know like the vibes of her was very off and then like they cannot click because I think also #fadreena# like I don't think you know her much [lah] but her personality quite strong
ya then there was this one point of time I think they were like making fun of each other [lah] #fadreena# and my friend then because [ah] then like she they I mean she said something hurtful about my friend like say (uh) I forgot what [ah]
very bad from then then [ah] [oh] ya recently cause that time I met with her so the my friend #naziha# right she said like the #fadreena# sent her a long long text
saying like (um) what [ah] why you go around behind my back saying about me and all that when the last time they talk right was like two years ago because that that the the japan trip was like two years ago [mah]
so from then my from then on right my friend never talk to her because like obviously like they can they cannot click right so why would she talk to her right so ya and then suddenly like very recently she ask she just sent that long text [ah] of like why you talk behind my back then my friend also like !huh!

what what you study over there [ah] like in Australia
(uh) (uh)
(mm)
ya ya alright

now I in S_P [ah]
Singapore Poly [ah] that's
(mm)
so like okay so
(err) for like my third year [kan]
need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job [ah]
so like
ya that's why [ah] cannot [ah] you know
for me I don't know [ah] we usually we like homesick [ah] you know so I go
on overseas
[ah]
C_C_A
(uh) I haven't pick yet [ah] any C_C_A yet
club activities [kan] so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
(mm)
ya
(mm)
okay [ah] I find floorball quite interesting [ah] like
but like honestly it's not something I like [ah] as a sport [ah] you know if
(uh) sports C_C_A [ah] I will definitely choose something else [ah]
maybe like okay so for S_P they got clubs [ah]
okay so you know got different schools right
then you got my school [lah] called S_M_A the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs [ah]
so my one is (uh) S_M_A club
(uh) interview [eh] (um) when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply [kan] then I went for the interview
[ah] that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like !walao! [eh]
[ah]
ya that's why
[ah] that's why (mm)
ya ya true [ah] it's okay [lah]
sports
clubs [ah] I think clubs can [ah] but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you S_M_E you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can [ah] S_P so possible
kay
so like for you [kan]
your school what what course you take [ah] for you I know you are in year one but what course [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then what are the modules you will like learn
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) okay
[ah]
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me [lah] cause I got experience in secondary school [kan]
[ah] like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is (uh) about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A [ah] you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun [ah] for me
really enjoy [ah] cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun [lah]
ya
ya
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three [ah] is where like the interesting part [lah]
cause no no no before the internship [kan]
what [ah] the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine (uh) fuel system you know so like for us (uh) students right before we go for internship right you must understand [ah] all these kind of (uh) machinery how it works
cause if we just go for (uh) what [ah]
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills [ah] before our internship
[oh] what also [ah]
[oh] ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this (mm)
[eh] they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
(uh)
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like (uh) as the water level rises so it's about five minutes [ah] it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the wat~ okay eventually the wat~ water level will rise [lah] but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast [ah] ya
ya
ya that's why
that test [ah] honestly I haven't experienced yet [ah] cause I only year two now [ah] but something I look forward to [ah]
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or (err) what you call the inspector [lah] so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into [lah] like that [ah] ya
ya hopefully [ah] (mmhmm)
not bad [ah] not bad [ah]
spend a lot of time playing game [ah]
(oo) #shiok# [ah] I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
(mm) so something [ah]
something to kill time also [ah] in secondary school you know
then for you [eh] your free time what you normally do [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what S_P got any C_C_A I join right then for you [eh] cause like you know you are like
(uh) year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any C_C_A for your poly have or not
legit [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(oo)
(mm)
so okay [ah] based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first [ah] cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a C_C_A like promoting C_C_A for you to join right so you go see [lah] which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
so maybe you can make it to what (uh) #Temasek# poly (uh) floor ball team [ah] who knows [ah]
ya who knows who knows but I know the T_P floor ball team very competitive [ah]
know
see which one you like the most y'know

advising on the surgery
like okay [ah]
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery [ah] cause like I'm only eighteen [kan]

cause whe~ this surgery is it's like
quite risk [ah] quite high risk [ah]
have to like what cut open that [one] put me on anaesthesia
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya

three doctors in the room [ah] then they wanted to inspect the you know you know
the wound

the fluid [ah] come out then the blood all come out then I damn scared [ah]
it was damn painful [ah]
for some reason I don't know [ah] damn worried [ah] but overall okay [lah] I I
in two months' time I have to meet the doctor again at hospital you know maybe go for the surgery [ah]
[ah] don't know [lah]
whatever [ah] okay [lah] good good [ah]

(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
okay
me [ah] okay I have [ah] okay recently
so~ social innovation project [ah] (uh) ya
I think combined with
(uh) different types of (uh) people from different courses [ah] so like
(uh)
to do a project together so basically this like
what S_P is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry [ah]
so S_P equips you with this kind of skill [lah] but let me tell you something [ah] I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you [ah]
cause like (err) it's damn #rabak# I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like !walao! [eh] why why got so much workload [ah] [ah] I don't want do [ah] like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
[ah]
like this
ya
[ah] then okay okay this [one] [ah] it happen like
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal [ah] for our presentation slides
then these guys right
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate [ah]
then
[oh] then they say [eh] why like that we you the only malay just come [lah] then I say how can like that I holiday [what] hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
[oh] my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining [ah] keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school des~ designs right
or like do some drawing design [kan]
[ah] !alamak! legit I tell you I don't want [ah] but it's okay [lah]
ya but overall I think it's a good experience [lah]
S_I_P cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together [ah]
and also ya it's good [lah] so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made (uh) okay you know for our project our aim right
to help people with depression intregate~ integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if us~ usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely [kan]
[ah] they are like damn lonely right
!alamak! why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use [ah] then we decided to come up with something interesting for them [lah] cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
(uh) our the depression app [ah] counter
Pikachu [ah] Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
kay so what's so special about this tab right
(uh) when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app [kan] they can (uh) what [ah] (uh)
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual A_I controls right so when they talk then they type right say (uh) how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
(mm) it's it's quite cool [lah] honestly
and also (err)
you can also prompt for
(uh) real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one inte~ (uh) what (uh) questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool [lah] ya
ya (um) and also for our app right (uh) we also put what [ah]
(uh) since like most of us like like to game [ah] like we
most (um) people like to game like they download apps for what
(uh) games right
for most people right then
[ah] our app introduces like some mini short games [ah] so you got heard of (uh) what kind of games [ah] (err) like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
[ah] Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
so~ some mini games [ah] like also we put (uh) animal crossing [ah] concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
(um)
games for the user to play with [ah] which makes our app interesting [ah]
ya a lot of people [ah]
(mm)
ya so our app
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
[ah]
what ramen or some like cookie [eh]
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon [ah] which is I think quite cool [ah] so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to [ah] ya
forward to ya
so that's about it [ah] for my S_I_P module interesting [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong (uh)
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two [ah]
ya semester two [ah]
it's called (err)
C_P_R [ah] communicative I can't remember [ah] what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
(uh) improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach [ah] like one of them is [ah] time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance [ah] it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right [kan] do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what [ah]
what's that [ah]
[oh] your interview skills [ah]
for interview
he teach us (uh) the basic questionnaire [ah] like how to prep ourselves for interview
(err) what should we ask during an interview you know how to properly answer an interview
so I think is quite that [one] [ah] manageable
[ah]
ya
ya
so I respect [ah] S_P for doing that
y'know
like I always stutter you know but like how in the future how are you gonna present yourself like why why would the company want to pick you over other people [kan]
so you have to present yourself better
so which is what thi~ this module is teaching [ah]
how to how to out
outstand [ah] among the other other interviewees [ah]

so let's hear what's what's your tea on her
(mm)
(mm)
ya she has a boyfriend
ya the fuck but the the boyfriend quite (uh) handsome though but then like why are you bringing your boyfriend into this he's not a part of it also
[oh]
ya but she do two K though I saw I saw
ya but I feel like same
[a'ah]

then what about your friend the toxic another one

(mmhmm)
for me [ah] cause to be honest you told me about her ex right like the ex cheat on her then always use her money all these then like why would you want to be with someone like that some more certis cisco you know it's not a stable job you earn a lot of money only cause you O_T O_T (um) and is very the timetable very #rabak# so if you date someone like that you can only go out with them at night like that
and most of their days is very busy [what] so I'm like just go for the N_S guy [lah] he seems like a better choice but then if she really cannot wait for two years then I feel like she should just let go of the guy cause he deserves better imagine you with someone then you keep on thinking why I have to go through this again bastard [sia] the guy can could've find someone better [what]
then
what she want to do now
it's a new relationship and you already keep arguing like that it's a red flag though just tell her to get back with her ex [lah]
cause he doesn't sound good
I think my boyfriend would beat him up [sia]
then
how did the new guy react

#rabak# [sial]
ya keep on every month also got new drama from him
okay alright
let's move to the
let's check a topic
yes
cause
when
and like you~ you know I have I've ever gone
not really [ah]
no
no you have to switch the carbohydrates around so for example if I were to eat
rendang with rice today
yea
everything also you don't like
okay what about you what's the food that you would eat
!huh!
what
why
[oh] okay
with
nice what
no actually when you go
when you go outside you know those chinese stall
that sells curry noodle
it's nice
why
excuse me
pastas are noodles what
it's still noodle [what]
besides
you know the
#lanzhou# beef noodle
the ya the beef noodle beef noodle
yes !oof!
can have that everyday
yeah yeah tougue tip yeah [oh] my god
you know just now
tender
but
the what reason
pettiest
(mm)
I
I can't think of one yet you go on first
[oh] my god is that your
actually I I cannot I cannot stand
they are like
how I say [eh]
they
well I had the answer in my mind but I don't know how to phrase it into a sentence but someone
like you know how some guys
they wanna show that they're the men in that room
or they wanna show that they're the alpha
and ends up they're actually a freaking beta
no [lah] I mean like I'm just saying like
you don't have
to put up
a show to prove to everyone else in that room that you're the lion on the mountain
you know
ya so like
(uh) actually
well yeah yeah
okay
let me see
[ah] this is interesting
if if humans no longer need
needed to work to survive what would we do
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya capitalism is an issue
I
it consumerism yes
I I feel like I'm on this
on the fence on this question
because
first thing if there's nothing to work on in life
right now in the world when there are doctors b~ especially this kind of (uh) jobs doctors so if no o~ they don't have to work then we might not have doctors we might not have scientists but also I would say that there are people who are willing to do it
for free if let's say they don't have to work and they can get everything but also the word work is subjective because what do you mean by work if you talking about work is just for money then sure yeah (uh) that should be my answer but if
they found their own food they eat their own food
you know that kind of thing so if that's considered work
and you don't have to do that
honestly your life is there's nothing to do in your life
yeah it's it's meaningless like it's objectiveless it's
basically you're just surviving and die
that's what I feel [lah] because that's why I say this question is quite
I'm on th~ on the fence [ah] on it
ya you can go both ways you know
what would I miss
well I'm already risking everything for my dreams
even right now
exactly I'm risking my financial future
doing the job that I'm doing right now
there's no financial stability so I'm already risking so much
ya so
for my passion for my passion I drop everything I ha~ I have dropped everything
yeah
what about you
you only twenty four
you only twenty four
(mmhmm)
yeah I get it
yeah
I I get where you're coming from
but there was an article that I read about
this guy who was forty five years old
but then
at forty two [eh] forty two or forty three like
two years before his interview
he had an apprenticeship in this tattoo tattoo artist
so
I understand where you're coming from your worries and everything but (uh)
there are people who found themselves at a later age
which is an interesting thing to look at [ah]
(mmhmm)
luck is another thing fortune is another thing
(mmhmm) but the moral is don't give up [ah]
that's I think the biggest moral to take away from all these things
I mean
what do you mean by that
well I think that after you try all these things these skills remain within you
so when you continue searching for that thing
and you continue living
probably you'd find something because at the end of the day to make something means mean meaningful to yourself
the only person to be able to do that is yourself so
until the day that
then you will find that inner peace with yourself
because you are
yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah
and when you explore like I said [ah] everything you explore
on after the next day
remain inside your mind you have that knowledge
which is
the thing that we should look at [lah]
(mmhmm)
I would wish for like three three thousand more wishes
okay okay
you wanna go first you wanna go first
!wow! okay
okay
that's the first wish [eh]
my first wish will be world peace
world peace
no because like when I say world peace is not just the end of wars and everything is the end of
the sense of
hatred and the sense of
power control
that a person wants inside you know inside them
like that sense of they want power
if we can eradicate that sense
in everyone
honestly there would be you know world peace so when I say world peace that's what I meant
yeah not just stop wars or stop the this [one] it is it's not it's more than just stopping all these things but it's
more like
understanding
that
sense of
having
power
should not be there
(um)
of course
yeah yeah
yeah
and when I learn
about all this traditional stuff every time a role of a women would be seen as
the least powerful people
and
it's so hard that
in in in this age you want to go against
them
against this ideology
but that ideology is stuck within the culture
yes
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
what we try to focus what you trying to focus right is
how the social view things
social pressure
I think social pressures is an important thing
yeah
yes
the society's
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah and women
ya and like women must be must be kind demure polite and men
yeah
it's so annoying
and
and men have
and men have to be
a certain tough toughness no no mental
yeah
it is like
removing the human in you
ya which is stupid so society is the problem
yeah
[oh] yeah my second wish my second wish
is to feel

ellen degeneres
(mm) true true

(mm)

okay
ya
per month
okay

okay
so
(mm)
ya
ya
the same
have you checked
[oh] okay
ten gigabyte [kan] per month okay
[oh]
ya ya
(uh)
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years [eh] but I think you just bought [kan] iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade [eh]
[oh] still iphone [lah]
[oh] but I think recently you bought [kan] a new phone
[oh]
ya
unless you have wifi [lah] at home you already have wifi [kan] or
ya
ya
iphone S_E the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
there's about four point seven inch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition [ah] I don't think so
let me check
there's no more [ah] sorry they don't sell anymore [ah] iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone S_E starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven [lah] so I think for camera wise if you love the camera [kan] take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough [ah] iphone eleven (uh)
not too sure [ah] cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven [ah]
ya !alamak!
who
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off [ah]
I'm not really looking to job search yet [ah] cause I'm doing freelance [ah] so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year [lah] I try to finish this projects and without expecting much [lah] I think I think the most important thing is experience [ah] and the skills that I will acquire ya
once I start working [ah] I'm more prepared [ah] prepared than ever
I think it's a bit hard [ah] because once you already
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test [ah] they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills [ah] you have the knowledge
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
[ah] ya
and they will ask you like on the spot [lah] like how do you solve this [ah] [ah] this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem [lah] I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is (uh) that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them [lah]
ya
it's more mostly interview skills [lah] that
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
[ah] monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast [ah] (mm)
the expected
[oh]
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you [lah]
[oh]
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
[oh] okay okay
ya
ya
ya
[oh]
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[oh] okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
[ah] the
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
microsoft office [ah]
okay okay
[oh] ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed [ah]
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is (uh) I think
[oh]
(mm)
ya over work [ah]
ya
ya
yup understood
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding [kan] they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like commu~ the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable [lah] you can still read the code [ah] like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
[oh] okay okay [eh] never heard before [eh]
even though I am a computer science
C hash [eh]
I think it's called C sharp [ah]
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before [lah] during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know [lah] this kind of
mostly low level [lah] like C sharp python [eh] sorry C sharp (uh) what is it called [ah] ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable [ah] than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing [ah] more structured
ya
(mm)
how do you spell logs
[oh] log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya ya
ya R_C_A
ya

through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running [ah] it will still run ya because it need to keep checking [kan]
I'm not too sure [ah] I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise [ah] so I think they need like support of
I think so [ah] I think it's just the bluetooth [ah] like wha~ because bluetooth will detect the nearby device [kan]
ya this is not this is not easy [ah] because because I think they still updates [ah] they're still updating they are still improving
for apple [kan] and google

ya
[ah] there's something
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
like
ya amazon products
ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I al~ I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
I think not too sure [ah] like they have their own ya they have their own brand [ah] I'm not not sure what brand is that [ah]
maybe maybe they collaborate (hmm)
I think there might be [lah] not too sure like
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house [ah] like T_V or what like
ya
ya because
they use leg
[ah] pedal pedal ya so they have to use
(uh) our hand [lah] our hand to press the button
ya
#paya lebar# ya I saw I went to #paya lebar#

(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya ya ya like
[ah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (hmm)
(mmhmm) true true true true true
I mean to me it's good in a way like (um) all the lessons are pre-recorded so like I mean in times like you are not really focus during the class or the period of that class you can always go back to (um) the recordings [lah] because like if we ya I mean like
ya but you you don't really get the quality of the teaching [ah] like ya as you said [ah] traditional traditional methods are the best [ah]
but then ya obviously but then I mean like what can we do right in the midst of this pandemic like !aiya! I app~ appreciate [lah] they they still continue classes through online cause like some of our friends like
from like ya from different univer~ universities they don't even have like those online classes right ya
(mm) (mm) and ya I I mean
I really appreciate for the university swift updates and all [lah] like they really accommodate to the international students I mean like they have to since it's an it's international university
and all right ya [lah] I really appreciate that part ya
(mmhmm) I mean
okay it's really draining
(err) cause like the
ya then (um) like this time round it's like six hours and ya there's this one subject I mean the exam was like
for two days [ah] for forty eight hours [ah] so that was really crazy [ah]
I I couldn't sleep well I couldn't even eat well or like even rest [lah] because like I mean like each time you want to do like your own stuff or like
(um)
(uh) know
ya like
(um) (hmm) so they gave us forty hours to like do I mean (uh) I need to do videos presentation videos so I mean ya it's
it's very like (um) it's very and for the for the amount given ya but also for the amount given [lah] so it's really appropriate [lah] I would say reasonable reasonable timing
ya
ya (mm)
ya but then I mean like if if they were to shorten it I don't think I can finish in time [ah]
(um) ya ya ya cause like my my lecturer told us [lah] (err) beforehand she was like (um) ya for educational psychology ya you guys have an exception of like forty eight hours for the exams then we were like !huh! really forty eight hours then she she she was like
[ah] later you see the questions and you know why I give you forty eight hours
so ya so when I'm given the question then I was like
okay now I understood why
but ya I mean
[ah] I mean like I think she she I mean I I scored well so ya I'm good
there there were like (um) five sections [ah] five questions five five questions

ya they they they they ask us [ah] like (um) are you guys okay
(um) ya like (um) if you I mean you know some some wouldn't be okay with like having group assignment right
cause like due to I don't know maybe different time zones or such so they like give us like (um) options if you want to do like if you want to go for like individual (err) individual or like group assignment [ah] things like that [lah] so like they like I would say they cater and acco~ accommodate to us [ah] to our needs [ah]
but then ya she mentioned [ah] like cause ya cause the university asked them to do so
but then ya then there's there's this lecturer was like
[oh] they usually ask us to tell the students that it's
okay (uh)
I mean like to go lenient on them [ah] but then she she like somehow like rant to us ranted to us [ah] she was like but then they never
(uh) take care of their like the the the lecturers [lah] like cause they are also like going through new things right like to have like a full-fledged [ah] online classes is equally like very (uh) what difficult for them [lah] basically
(um) so it's like ya it's like a new thing (mmhmm) cause

okay one thing that I wish was free
(err)
it'll be hard [ah]
transport
just free transport for everybody

[oh] my god ya okay so I ended up buying the gold [one] apparently on Apple it says gold but then actually it's rose gold like she's like gorgeous and she's obviously rose gold not gold so I don't know whether people are blind or something
I like yeah she's gorgeous
what about you what have you been doing baby
[orh]
okay then
you like on apparently on the freaking website it says gold but then the actual thing is actually rose gold like it's very very tinted pink
ya so there's that
yes girl girl bought MacBook air
cause she's airy or what
(err)
I don't know I upgraded some shit and I don't know what
so like around one seven
some
sushi for two dollars and I solid like contemplated for a solid ass like five minutes in front of that thing and I was like I think the uncle was just like
I thought he was like thinking I'm gonna take some like twelve dollars sushi and then I proceeded to take a two dollars sushi I was just standing there just like
should I buy should I no but I'm broke I'm broke I have to last like fifty dollars for the next like three weeks or something like that then I want to go drinking and all that blah blah blah I'm like (um)
there's that there's that tea
okay so that day
no
I had always had money then after that when I realised that I wanted to buy the a new laptop
then I just set aside all my money and then I started
working to hit one point seven so at the start I think I had about one K already then I need seven hundred more so last month I was broke to get that seven hundred and then now I got the seven hundred then now I'm broke cause I have no money at all you know what I mean
I was
but I had this amount of money and this entire amount of money is set aside for my baby ass laptop my baby boo so I am broke okay girl girl doesn't lie
kay
so that day I was
(um)
going to
I don't know who I was meeting
then
I remember like
this
I don't know why I like just suddenly I was just on the train and then apparently like we pass by Admiralty then I think I saw somebody who looks similar to him or not I just don't know so (um)
so
since I don't know whether I got tell you this story [ah] like since
(um) primary six
so my mum will go to this auntie's house
so it's like super complicated then my mum I don't know how she just
then since primary six up until last year because COVID was this year what so up until last year I will always have to go to her house to cut hair
this auntie has a son who is two years older than me okay
even though I have a thing for Chinese guy he's not ugly when you have like put it on a Malay scale if there's something like that [ah] give me a Malay name
kay let's just use
!hais! neither do I but like there is one there is one
kay
let's just use
okay let's just use his name [ah]
so his name is
then like she will like when she will like
yeah his name is something
ya I think
like it's a long name [ah] but let's just use a generic one [ah] then after that
so
then after that like I will just avoid the question just act blur #sotong# and all that all [lah] I don't know what I will do [lah] I cannot really remember
everytime she asks questions like do I have a boyfriend
or all that I will let my mum talk [lah]
then I will just never talk to the aunt even [eh] the mum even though like
the questions are posed to me
so last year right dude
then I was just like
!huh!
(err) I'm like my fucking future is a freaking pitch black hole and this base is like
number one
not even a single word to the dude you know not even one word can you believe it she wants me to marry a guy that I have never even said hi to
like hi like I don't even know how his voice sounds like that's the problem right now
like they will just laugh and then they will just like like that like that and then I'm just like I obviously know you you're talking about me and laughing and like you know teasing me but like why like I've never even spoken to the dude before and I don't know why
how I cut my hair
[ah] the last time I went to an actual barber
ya so after I told !huh!
no after I told my mum that I was genuinely uncomfortable with everything we stopped going there
it's been sometimes since I went to the house already
ya cause the harassing or like I don't know whether is considered harassing or not it's kinda cute
if you think of it in one perspective it's really cute
but if you think of it that it's been happening since primary six I'm kinda traumatized is how many years already

(mm)
#Serangoon# [a'ah]
okay
you're already late
confused
!ee! [oh] my god dude
[oh] my god okay okay I also have a story to tell you okay it's like kinda similar so my friend met this guy like recently okay so they've been talking
like from then until now is only been two months okay one month into knowing
(err) one month into knowing each other
they got together
and then recently I met her so it's going to be about two months but not really (um) I heard that
the dude already met the girl's mum
on an actual like they actually plan the thing you know I was like thinking
like we actually planned a day for her mum to meet the guy and then I was like
!huh!
and then apparently like this coming okay I mean today is what day Friday so apparently they say either Saturday or Sunday the girl my friend is the one that is now my friend is going to meet the guy's mum
or or Sunday
yeah
yeah
don't you think it's fucking fast first of all right they've been toget~ they've known each other for less than two months got together in less than one month and have been together for two weeks and within that span of two weeks both of their parents like they met both their parents so the first week of getting together the guy met the girl's mum and then the second week is the girl meet the guy's mum
isn't that a bit fast
and then this one
ya and cause he's Chinese but like
I cannot comprehend
like you know they took for less than two months and then you are confident enough
that
you bring
even if I start dating like while lo and behold
I go and date some Malay guy I am sure as heck not gonna like ask him to come meet my mother in the first two weeks of getting together
okay
maybe not even like one year
so like I don't understand
how does this work
what the heck like it's cute
that the guy actually
but like one week into getting together though
I don't know
like just touch wood [lah] imagine if you don't
have gotten together in the first place [ah] of knowing a guy for less than one month
but then there's also so
#Aip#</P1> what's up
okay cool
!huh!
what
what
!huh!
wait what I cannot even comprehend that
are they still together
to get out of jail
[ah]
because I met another person
like the effort
I don't know babe like you cannot really judge
like
I don't know
I don't know man
[oh] ya [sia] like I don't know recently like
I I get both sides cause you know as a girl you want reassurance but like you cannot deny you want reassurance but then the fact that you are asking for reassurance about something so far fetched
is very weird like
cause
in but I would like
want him to tell me like !hey! we're gonna be in this for the long run [lah]
so okay so
(um)
there's this one friend of mine
like
(um) her name is
then like
[ah]
[ah] yeah yeah yeah so
most of our friends like our mutual friends are like dating like have been dating for like five years or whatever like really really long so they actually know let's say like
we're gonna get married here this day [eh] this year and like we are gonna plan for it [lah] like they actually have a plan like a future has been together with her boyfriend for like a solid five months
and then her boyfriend is the logical type okay like and me are the same we're like fucking romantic and be like baby I love you I love you from the moon to the moon back whatever bull crap right and then the guy is the type that won't say anything that
he knows it's might not be true you know
so
(um) she's then recently she got jealous that
her boy like her friends are like all thinking about marriage and future and then
like her boyfriend doesn't even want to say like she will say shit like
[oh] I hope it's going to be you in the end or like I hope it's you
the rest of my life that kind of shit and then like he will just dodge the entire thing
and then she got so sad
and then
she got so sad that now she wants to try a fucking keto diet
she wants to try let me reiterate and repeat these again okay she was so sad that he doesn't want to you know like
give her reassurance that he's gonna be there for her like
till the end then she wants to do a keto diet so that she can be skinny
that body goals I don't know man it's just a whole ass mess like she's just so sad
there's that but then you also need
ya I just that's why I was thinking like I get her point of view like I get it cause I really think that if you really love someone
no matter what
you still want reassurance that they're gonna be there
for a long time
because you love them that much but then like if you compare it like five months and five years is two different things [ah]
no I just got blocked nose
I don't know why
suddenly like throughout this thing suddenly got blocked nose I don't even know why
but yeah there's that
I just like
[ah]
ya so the next time asked me to drink there you better bring your ass down
and then if texts me I'll let you know
there's that
there's so much
!huh!
[ah] ya that's why how to go drinking I ask pay [ah] my daddy

I came back home
one day from school cause my parents will always fetch me cause it's like in the middle like it's not even in
but is in the middle of a road
and then after that right like
after that
(um)
one day I went back home and then I just told my mum
ma somebody kiss me on the cheek
I'm a fucking kindergarten kindergarten is what fucking six years old or five five to six years old I went back home I was like ma somebody kiss me on my cheek and then my mother was like the fuck is wrong then after that they realised right that
but like they went right
was like a family friend

I remember like they will talk about it so recently like they will just say you know like instead of saying the guy's name or the mum's name
[ah] then I was just like
somehow

!huh!
after this I am going to sleep
(um)
alright we have just made it to the one hour mark
(um)
hi #hamzah#
(uh) no contract [ah]
(um) ya but then
the new plan iphone eleven so you pay about
four hundred dollars
but I think minus fifty because got voucher
(um)
every month
pay fifty five so it's thirt~ almost double [ah]
okay bottom western epitope so calculate (um) mahjong
what okay two years [eh] so it's two years times fifty five dollars
times twenty four months [kan] about extra seven hundred dollars [ah] [kan]
but iphone eleven (uh) how much [ah] iphone eleven now
ya the lowest one [lah] I think thirty two G_B
okay
(um)
ya I check a bit the difference is about the incoming I think free [eh] same [ah] same (um)
twenty G_B I think
I think
maybe less than ten [ah] maybe seven also
a southern or northern her window kaliyah asean
(um) ya [lah] almost four years [ah]
[ah] that's why
[ah] sorry again
is two hundred and seven two hundred and eighty dollars I think seven [ah] but seven also like
also present #lobang# [ah] no haunted
[ah] no contract
but
no but
[oh] [oh] K then
[oh]
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight
(mm)
but
ya but now starhub plan [ah] the iphone eleven is cheaper than iphone X
no what are they doing
ya
[oh]
[oh] then (uh) how how's your job search
then (um)
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now [eh] all the interview [ah]
the developer they [eh] you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
this kind of coding test [kan]
[oh]
the the you must type the code inside
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
(mm)
okay
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
[ah] I think they really keep calling you know
it's like
very pushy [ah] so like
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
[ah] what is the maximum [lah] the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm [ah] [kan] because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit [ah] pointless [kan]
so like
[ah] I forgot the word lowball [ah] something like lowball [ah]
no no value [ah] [kan]
but like the des~ destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
it's not permanent [ah] but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
be eager to you know (um) ya
join the company like this
[ah] mostly
so tuition
but ya that's why
so that time middle of october [kan] so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months [ah] [kan] so actually
I think one or two weeks before [ah] two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right [ah] so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest [ah] maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same [ah] one week difference I think
the normal tech
!huh!
ya
because like the hall
it's like a big group [ah] then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better [lah] until october
data entry [lah] you know those
just typing on excel [kan] basic [ah]
[ah] office [ah] and typing or sending email those basic admin work [ah]
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description [kan] is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said (um) they said okay monday to friday the timing is (um) I think
about five P_M to ten P_M [ah] or four P_M to ten like five hours [ah] or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
(um) for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply (um) sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear [ah]
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer [ah] so
like but mostly mostly also must support [ah] because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support [kan]
so phone support is a bit too much [ah] you know
[ah] that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable [kan] it's a it's it's python programming considered high level [kan]
(uh) they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
(mm)
it's called [ah] fortran
A N ya
is it C hash or something hash
[ah] C sharp
!huh! golac
G G O L A C [eh]
[oh] golang
(mm)
okay then
because
building [kan]
or web development
I know how to like maybe like S_Q_L all these [ah] data and then maybe
a bit of support [ah] the support kind of role [ah]
because like for me last time I work in a bank [kan]
twen~ twenty nineteen [ah] twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
[kan]
that time I work in a bank [kan] so
so (um) laymans [kan] the back end [ah] so
you know logs [kan] you know logs
L O G S [ah] log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
go to back end and then take everything out [lah]
then investigate maybe S_Q_L or something
(um) the front part is a investigation [ah]
R_C_A but the it's like ticket [ah] like they say what
support and ticket and then
(uh) raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close [ah]
then last what you call that analyse [ah] whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite (um) interesting or it's it's quite a
how do they expect you call me at four A_M right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called (uh) run the bank [ah] not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means (um)
it means that the the app is ongoing [ah] you understand like it's not a project [ah] that means the project already finish that means it's live [ah] live product being used by users [ah]
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china (uh) U_K all this so the timezone all weird weird [one]
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so U_S time is twelve hours before us [what]
ya then their working hours until our six A_M [what] so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues [what] I think there's only one period that
low low what low traffic [eh]
[ah] nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven P_M [ah] because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right ja~ japan all ahead [what] only U_K [lah] then U_S just wake up [what] that time
because U_S there's two countries new york [eh] no two states
new york and where [ah] san francisco right L_A [ah] L_A L_A
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server [ah]
I don't think so [ah] or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like U_S because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank [ah] our local bank so ya U_S the business not so much [ah]
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this [ah] this basic functions [ah] [kan]
[oh] they call it the green f~ [eh] green lane [eh]
but but
we cannot go right
ya but somebody must handle that [what]
they can come
[ah] they they can say [ah] ya they can use the fact that their house right at #clementi# need to do something [ah] right collect the mail the mailbox [ah] because
(um)
but the the tenant [kan] you know the [eh] now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail [ah]
who
okay
cousins (uh)
they I think busy also [ah]
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight [ah]
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
!huh!
(mm)
so there's money
it's not in the fridge [eh]
[oh]
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
fry the chi~ [eh] fry the fish first right
I think the it [ah] the the the prepa~ preparation is a
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife [ah] hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid [ah]
but it's it's good if you have a maid [ah] but
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house [kan] so one maid right (um) share our #woodlands# house
they maybe my future house or your future house [ah] so then like the maid right
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else [ah] like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first [ah]
(hmm)
ya
no but I think
internally [kan] if
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off [ah] right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal [ah] because (um) as long the maid
!huh!
normally the maid off sunday [kan] one day off [kan]
ya
but I think N_T_U_C they're a bit
[eh]
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map [kan] is fixed [ah]
but what you see in the V_R is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual [ah]
ya then if the stock finish
[oh] !wah! cool [ah]
so call move [ah]
I think no but
I think I think [ah] Singapore difficult because you know why or not
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental [ah]
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface [ah] the mapping [kan] the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue [ah] [kan]
but they they can they will monitor your work [ah]
[oh] ya [ah] stan~ standard meeting [ah] [kan]
[oh] last time that time zoom you all also use zoom [ah]
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people [kan] du~ during the COVID
really [ah]
!huh! they going to open H_Q here [ah]
ya but singapore smart [ah] I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues [ah]
[oh] good [ah] [ah] are you b~ buying anything else from ikea
ikea the foo~ the food open or not [ah] now
ya
[oh] open already [ah] I don't know [ah]
half [ah]
I think half of that
[eh] I think because I think
[ah] predict the people [kan] because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
[oh] actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those (um)
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what [ah] counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot [ah] like last time I went I went exchange also same [ah] I I
because most people will eat solo [ah] because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so
the counter table is like just one person [ah] then you face the you face nobody [ah] like you know face like a the wall or something [ah] so it's like against the wall [kan]
[ah] actually they should make like that
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
#serangoon# garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor [lah] you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting [ah] like like #al-ameen# at our place the the woodgrove [kan]
ya open concept [ah] like is is like sheltered [lah]
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person [ah] then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side [tau] that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
so that means like the four of you [ah] or three of you [kan] will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing [ah] but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then [ah] section off like one table instead of six right become four [lah] you know
I mean they can do that [lah] but I think
maybe today they change [lah] because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
or if they more than five
so I think recently there's a news [ah] then they like to inter change like I think they
but I think
but must pity the the business owner [ah] for because actually right like M_O_M very strict [ah] I mean [eh] it's it's not M_O_M the N_E_A [kan]
(uh) M_O~ [eh] it's N_E_A so they are very strict [ah]
so
I think some of the
N_E_A [kan] complain [ah] like [oh] call police [ah] I don't know what they call [ah] they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually [oh] at first maybe they ask them to go out [lah] say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
another search [ah] you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy [kan]
ya I think maybe like they have a counter [lah] like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't [ah] what you call that scan out [ah] checkout from the place
!huh!
[ah] trace together [kan]
[oh] that one
[oh] because of bluetooth [ah]
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at A_U
ya
[oh]
so like between [ah] android and I_O_S they also know what to do right
ya
(um)
may~ maybe I_O_S okay or maybe I change to Google [ah] [kan]
I don't know [ah] because like maybe I want to try Google [ah] but
because I have the you know la~ last time I buy the macbook air [kan]
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini [eh]
you can play (um) I mean you can play the [eh] what's it called [ah] the radio station like singapore radio station
[ah] live streaming [ah] as long you got wifi [lah]
so actually from the wifi [eh] but actually dangerous [oh] I realise [kan] they recognise our voice [oh]
the google home speaker [ah] I mean the pe~ I mean google home [ah]
because right that time [kan] my friend [kan]
so
I ask google [ah] using my voice [ah] like when is my birthday or what is my age [ah] something
then they know [ah] cause I think like google gmail [ah] all this something
so like they know (uh) something like my birthday or my name [ah]
then because my friend got google phone right
[oh] there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker [ah] the google home speaker [kan] then he ask (um) like what is my name or something [ah]
then the google know that it's him then say his name
[ah] or birthday [ah] [ah] I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess [what]
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person [what]
[ah] so a bit scary [lah] I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community [kan] instagram or something [kan]
but if the wifi off [kan] but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device [kan]
so will it still listen
(um) connect you
to the
but default [ah] but if you ask like questions like (um)
[ah] offline what do you call it offline data [ah]
what basic basic functions [ah] [kan]
ya
it's good [ah]
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon [what] a lot so
I think because they also got money [ah] so their apartment like one room one bedroom [ah] so like those studio [ah]
got how many version [ah] I also don't know [ah]
smart home device [ah]
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven [kan] like is there a brand for smart oven now
[oh]
[oh]
got smart shower or not I don't know
[oh] but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there [lah] because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen [ah] I don't know
or voice [ah]
[eh] but that means right COVID better [what] if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene [kan] then I think maybe future [ah] singapore the lift also maybe smart [kan]
or lift system
I think can make right
[oh] the base I mean there's a pedal [kan]
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working [ah] so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens [kan] too many screen one is left one is right [kan]
because you card is only one level [ah]

they actually having promotion where like I think you have one day staycation from like ten to eigh

cause it's really really bad and I also heard about your manager your manager i
is not a very nice person [lah] as I can se

ours is below three hundred so she can refund us on the spot for two hundred sixty

nice ya talking about it right
like I totally forgot about it I was like
resting
then I totally forgot that she texted
then I felt bad then I told my mum about it [lah] I was like
[oh] the D_P is still convinc~ trying to convince me to like (um) C_A for her
I was guilt tripped
ya
that's about it and I'm excited for the zoom meeting
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
so let me tell you how my day went
we're going out at one P_M
tomorrow which is today
cause like
we wanted to go spotlight and then we want to go B_H_G
but then
at
okay I woke up at eight
and then like I was too tired so
I continued today
ya so I woke up at eight when I slept at two
then I fell asleep
freaking six P_M ya
busy you know cause okay
family members [kan]
then
(err)
but my another
dress patterns [lah] the one that I told you about that I wanted to
make
[kan]
so
the first thing I did was
and then I was like flabbergasted I don't know why
but I was like super
anxious and then and then I walk you know like the entire spotlight
and I forgot to take the the pattern
and (err) and then like (uh) I tried to find the pattern then like I I I went around like the entire
spotlight but I couldn't find it
like a drawer
like in front of a
counter
and then I was like a~ am I allowed to like just pull this out
I didn't know cause no one was attendi~
no one was attending to me [ah] so I just like
so I just like did it myself
ya that's about it I will show you but it will make like
sounds
which is
not ideal ya
ya that's about it [lah]
ya
ya
hello
that's call cheat
ya
small [kan]
usually it's like this
but have the circular containers [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
like while I was
bathing
it's very noisy at my neighbourhood
like super noisy
and then
like sometimes I stay up until like five and stuff like that [kan]
like the freaking
am I allowed to say that !huh! like the the motor and the and the cars are like
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
but I think it's because of our neighborhood though
cause
it's quite
it was
close to this timing and it's quite quiet [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it's the it's the app that you told me about right that time since
I haven't checked it out ya
apart from school
ya
(mmhmm)
was it
I feel like that's like a lot of my friendships though like with #irfan# #zahidah#
once every
twice a month or something
!huh!
[oh] [ah]
ya
by who
blanks
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
yes
like it's quite
like hats off to them [lah]
cause I watch like the it's okay to not be okay [kan]
like
there's a castle in the
T_V series in the series
and
my sister told me that it's
it's a set
it looks very
you know some some sets you know that it's a set [kan]
like you can know that
I I I haven't watched so I wouldn't know but ya like
it looked
like a legit castle
and I think
it's really
(err)
it's really
[oh] my god (uh) I cannot (uh) my brain is like fried it's really impressive [lah]
but then again they've been like
they're they're quite big [lah] in the industry so
it's not really surprising I guess
that's why I like
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I've never
heard of him though what's his name
I shall look him up
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
okay let's talk about
let's follow the prompts [lah] [hor]
let's talk over the worst
is it is it the worst
one for one
[eh] buy one get one free thing yes
okay you want to start first
(mmhmm)
ya ya
makes sense food
oka~
[ah] !aiya! okay
so you know the one of the specs that I
so the reason why it's
and then
one for one specs [lah] like at at that point of time I was like thinking
you can buy one for yourself and then the other one you can
like someone can just get it for free [lah] for free
which is technically not free cause like
four hundred for a pair of glasses is really ridiculous
ya
so (um)
this was like a discussion between me and my family like after that heated
(err)
exchange not really heated exchange it was just him telling us that
he cannot do anything about it because of the sweat
but it was heate~ a heated argument [eh] discussion between me and my
like we were like
like
it doesn't makes sense for someone
for you to like get a one for one glasses
like normally people will just like have one
like if if they have another one it's just for
I don't know at home
do people do that wear different glasses at home
my sister does that [lah] but
but like
the reason why you change your glasses is because
I don't know
and
it all
like
ya
I'm doing like a lot of like
hand gestures [pe] ya like
who one for one
but I think like owndays
(err)
if you see [ah] the people who who buy glasses from owndays [kan] they also keep on changing their glasses
the quality is still like
not that good for them to keep on changing
but it depen~ I don't know maybe it's a paid sponsorship or what
but ya
owndays started the whole like
glasses (um) spectacle shops are following s~ following it [lah]
but to compromise the quality though and for the price
I think it's not worth it
buy one
ya cause before that [kan] usually [ah] specs
engage a staff then they will open for you then they will take out
then you try on
but when this is like you just like
human interaction
like lesser human interaction
ya
there they like
prepare a box where like you can put
to
like you can put after you try [lah] so that they can sanitise [kan]
and then
I was looking at like other customers [ah] and then there's this like two girls who were trying on the glasses
didn't even follow the protocol like they try and then they put back they didn't even put the in the
box thing
and then I was like what
did you not see that box there with a sign that like
you have to put in in there
I don't know [ah]
I feel like a lot of people are not like taking it seriously and it's kind of
worrying
especially like when I see people going out in like
more than five
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] ya
ya
ya
that's the thing that my dad say also [ah] the other day
he was like
you know the migrant cases thing
there there there are more cases than they reported because like
the only reason the reason why they
to make people feel secured
ya like
because they have to do
they have to
ya
then I'm like
I mean I guess that's like
what a lot of countries are doing also [lor] I I mean
I wouldn't know but I suspect
ya
cause like it's all because of
(mm)
ya
[oh] my god
we're not even halfway through
ya
[oh] ya talking about it
ya
wanting to become a journalist right
I was exactly like you [sia] I was like in sec
two or three I think like
during my parents' divorce
I was like [oh] my god I want to like
write
about women empowerment and like
like writing
because of the
it's it's because of like the nature of it [lah] ya
ya I mean media right like
is meant to be two faced
ya
ya
ya
ya
but I think
like that whole thing
phenomenon started because of
this whole
if you work harder that means you are more hardworking kind of
stereotype [kan]
ya but like that's the sad that's the sad thing [lah] like it's so normalized that like
if you say you're tired
as compared to somebody else and then they'll be like !huh! why are you so tired
ya
it's a very asian thing but I don't know about other parts of the world I guess
as long as
capitalism is involved
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
as in cause you wouldn't know if it's like it's going to
so you're like
I trust the economy
I'm just going to take out my money before the economy go down
that kind of things
ya
my
I should do that when I work I should buy shares and like stuff like that
but I'm like
isn't that gambling
(mm)
ya
I guess it depends
on the individual [lah]
and their self control I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we literally like move wait what
so
and I think we were not supposed to talk about that
wait wait let me check
!huh!
I mean
hopefully we won't be penalised [lah] cause we were not like
shitting on anything or what it's just like a general discussion
ya
honestly I haven't thought of that before
ya it's something to it's something for me to like look into [lah] to like read and then
I feel like I haven't been reading much I have been on tiktok
for the entire break
it's this small like ya
I can tell from the number of tiktoks you send me
is she on tiktok also
nice
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
ac~
ya
I feel like
and the
like I like tiktok cause there's a lot of content on there
but I feel like
it's kind of exhausting
like
like it's getting exhausting [lah] cause like
they keep on
giving you
different (um)
like if you go on tiktok and then like you accidentally press
the top button like use scroll all the way to the top or like press the top thing
and like it's good because it's giving people it's giving content creators like a platform
from the consumer
point of view it's kind of like exhausting that's why I haven't I haven't been on tiktok
for like a while
scroll for like one two hours now it's just half an hour and I'm done
like it's get~ I mean
that's the thing about the algorithm thing [lah]
like I keep getting the same
type of content
but different no
I showed you about the tinder algorithm
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(uh huh)
maybe that's why you've been seeing #jufri#

dude
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[oh] my god
(mmhmm)

an idea of like what
they going to like serve him or something that's why he wants a maid
!ee! I hate guys like that
(uh huh) like
[ah]
(mmhmm)
!ee!
and and the thing is
each like
ya
I mean cause it's their passion right that's why they're like a chef in the first place
ya
[ah]
it's it's it's a big kind of
like stay away from me
(mmhmm)
like even if they don't have
do you not have goals in life
ya that was what like
like a lot of guys I
met before is those like

so since you the graduate righ
I'm curious what full time job you currently doing no
that's so shag you know since this pandemic like what ever since march or something it's like affecting everything well we at home watching T_V and just feeling like me myself but what to do right adult life and that's how you gonna face through out an
I think you can follow up like that too I gues
right degree lik
no matter what you take for example for diploma or something people will just look at higher certificate nowaday
and [oh] it sounds interesting though and I wish this COVID thing is over so it'll be much more easier for u
an
I think you can cope [lah] knowing you for so lon
and time management is the main key like I said before and you know this pandemic I'm having online class and my eyes degree keep increasin
s
and what's new right holiday we just sit at home no
can'
it's lesser things that we can do also now this COVID it's corrupting everythin
(mm) why not we go karaoke or something and talking about karaoke I kinda miss how we all use to g
like back in secondary school but if you want to go out also limit also five people so it's kind of hard [lah] cannot bring everyone with us well I'm currentl
in my semester break for like a mont
for example (um) maybe we can do like it's a a three star hote
you want to check the place out plus it looks like those kind o
korea hotel if I'm not wrong with double decker bed [lah] but don't have pool so I don't kno
maybe we can find something that affordable an
more fun chillax place lik
!wah! really that sounds nice since you've been to lyf hotel before so you roughly know how it's gonna be like but right you're right if we never get a hotel wh~ which come with a pool can just chill watc
like around town are
(hmm) but righ
I think we can just search mor
so that we know and plan out early where to go and suc
and yes I like water activit
and if I'm not wrong I think you got send me before the link like like there's kayaking swimming and all those fine things maybe why not we give it a go since like what seventy five dollar for vacation if not interested we can jus
go staycation just chill at the hotel [jer] and since I'm single and you've got a boyfriend I just nee
(err) my friend say it's not bad though it'
it's like a #bali# vibe someho
where you can just chil
without anyone disturbing yo

and many more that time I went (um
(um) cafe hopping with one of our old friend with #hidayu# if you can remember her we wanted to try the #taufik batisah# cafe but end up it's like too many peopl

then I go they change the plan then I feel bad [what] then it's like (uh) just go ahead [lah] without me
yeah
(um) yeah then but it's like I don't know if I mean your group of circle then you naturally gravitate to food that I cannot eat I think that is very alarming to me
then they were like never mind [lah] you just sit here first then after that we go somewhere else that you can eat then I like
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
same is like they
[oh] my god yeah
exactly [oh] my god (ugh)
but how [seh] that time I topped up twenty dollar then I think I only went out like four or five times only then finishing then I'm like !huh!
(err)

that's like
(mm)
(mm)
I think so like that like that's what I remember
I mean
then it depends on your station also [lah]
(mm)
I think it's a very how to say [ah] first world problem I feel
(mmhmm)
right yeah
(mm) yeah
that's true
I
exactly then that's why I think it's considered a million dollar like idea I guess to have those wheelchair friendly buses
then I'm (mm)
no no you can
which is
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah
(mm) that's true
that's why it's like if they didn't have a guide dog how do you tell if they are someone with disability
(mm)
yeah it's not like they cannot survive without help it's more of like
yeah
yeah it's sad [lah] because they if you were to compare our levels of convenience with them is very different
(mm)
yeah but I know their other senses will be heightened [lah] like if you cannot see maybe your hearing and your smell are stronger but it's not easy
yeah so I was like (hmm) I wish I was smart
yeah
yeah
forest fighting
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
yeah
it's like why why must have fire
there's no other word for it
(mm)
[oh] my god can you imagine me
my parents thought I was a boy then when they give birth it was a girl yeah they really thought I was going to be in a boy it was so funny
like
[oh] that one I never ask so yeah
okay maybe I should ask is !wah!

so funny
it's like
it's like a sike [eh] like [oh] it's a boy [oh] no it's a girl sike
I think gender reveal parties are very I don't know it's so over the top
it's over the top yeah
yeah it's
I don't need to tell my friend who's a friend of this friend that I have a baby who's a boy and it might not be even accurate so
yeah I'm like (um)
[ah] yeah
(mm)
yeah yeah
(mm)
(mm)
eighty
is that like your commission or like your pay
[ah] yeah yeah
(err)
I mean you can't do anything if no one comes in
(uh) yeah
(mmhmm)
(uh)
[oh] my gosh
then
then then it's like should I be sad that there's no customers or should I be glad that there's no customers
(mm)
very easy money
(hmm)
I mean that's considered one of a good like working days I guess
(uh) yeah
that's true
[oh]
[oh]
!oof!
(uh)
right I'm still amazed that she did it [eh]
you are the one who made it
like
(uh)
I mean
(mm) understand
[ah]
(mmhmm)
yeah yeah yeah
yeah then is like you're like (uh) what is this [ah] then you scrape the frosting off

that's why when we were bringing the cake in it's like !wah! Kelly the cake is so pretty
yeah
(uh)
yeah
yeah when you guys were working
!aiya! [lah] but it was just you know in case
then
right
yeah right I felt smart
that's why
and then I was like (err) what's Kelly's (um) faculty
and that's how we were discussing what to get for you
yeah
you know the round card right okay sorry side track but you know B_T_S released (err) !wah! you know this whole week I think everyday right I think four days in a week right it released new merchandise then that one I don't care never mind

ya it's the weverse the the the the new fan cafe that one
yeah yeah it's so funny [ah] (ugh)
in the SOOP
merchandise you can just Google
yeah I think they're trying to bring in money [lah]
a lot you know they are re-releasing the you know Skool Luv Affair album the repackaged version
right I was like [oh] okay no no no no no I don't need
don't tell me I don't have the money to do that this month
yeah
yeah that's why
I mean if you have the self-confidence and the self-esteem to wear it out go ahead girl or guy or whatever
(mm)
yeah they picked a very pretty shade of green then I was like genius
(mm)
!wah! yeah
B_T twenty one is like the success is you can't even compare [leh]
it's
even people who are not their fans right see it and like [oh] is cute buys
[oh] I didn't know that okay
yes an~ and it fits the aesthetic
(mm)
(ugh)
(ugh) don't even get me started on shipping (ugh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
!oof!
(mm)
that's why (ugh)
if
yeah [lah] what's the point if I never buy the membership kit if I signed up
so I was like the thing I do for you guys
(mm)
what thing
that's why it's like you the thirty dollar you don't want to use for other things
right !wah! the thirty dollar I think I can buy my whole new outfit that I've been looking at [leh]
yeah Shopee [lah] what where else can I buy I am not that rich
yea yeah
yeah then the sh~
(uh) yeah
yeah
!aiya!
okay can I will share to you
that's why and I feel bad for using fast fashion but is what I can afford so yeah
(mm)
yeah
yeah
yeah
(mm)
yeah
okay
(err) I think
it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say [ah]
how's your day
okay so was what happened okay I'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday [kan] she tex~ I told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it I'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
[oh] miss not happy I'm like okay so miss not happy then I told her already [what] what's happening
yesterday right
then #cheng san# was like [oh] I think she wants to like
convince everybody I'm like ya I know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three P_Ds
and #ming gee# that's six people okay
and she's like [oh] some of them say they are open to it
(um) and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say [oh] they confirm don't want that three weeks I'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group [lah] if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya I'm just like
annoyed
but
ever since then like okay I'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
I mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it [oh] so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her [lah] and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and I find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes I get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else [ah] like
you got your own issues then
(ugh) okay whatever
so I just like did it bye
good luck
ya but I mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a H_D_B right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do some~ thing
sub for school
she won't stop
I'm just going to submit this time [ah]
then now she go
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
for like
a lot and then she's like I don't know
it's so funny [ah]
[oh] she wants like the square one which I think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but I told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
[eh]
do not off
(mm)
unfair I think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
I guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim #boon lay# [kan]
man it's just generally quiet [lah] also
the only night shoot I did
I can remember well was #syaza's# #syaza's# shoot
but #syaza's# shoot jingle was there
#serangoon# but the landed houses
I forgot that cats are like nocturnal
I swear
!ow!
but ya I'm quite nervous about thesis
I did like I moved my to dos
to this new app called notion !wow!
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and I've been using it for awhile
then I moved it all on notion
and now I'm like a bit overwhelmed when I see my list
[ah] I don't know [lah] it's like I know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but I cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and I don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering I'm already struggling with one (uh huh)
it is supposed to be simpler
I got nothing to say [ah]
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday [lah] in school so ya
[ah] ya
once every twice a month
okay [lah]
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's I actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
I don't know it's very groovy
[eh] but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that I like B_T_S songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and I cannot figure I like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and I can remember like the words
I feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
and I'm like
(mm) I don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like dyna~ scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
but it was quite cool [lah]
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job K pop
like the hotel #del luna#
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy I think like ten years ago he he's from I_T_E right
(mm)
this malay boy and he graduated I_T_E and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many K pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya I think it's quite cool [lah]
I don't know
I cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead I'm like !huh!
maybe I should do that !duh! I will never do that
my social anxiety will be like [ho]
ya
but
it was an option [ah]
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
cause your your your heated my my I start first [eh] one for one [eh]
I don't know I always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent [kan] to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so I usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya I usually don't buy one for one and I can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
I always buy things like notebooks for one for one
okay you I know it's heated
depends I guess
just appalling ya
!huh!
are you sure are you sure
but on~ only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
that was the deal that they had
but I don't know they have a good reputation [kan] a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like [oh] you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then I don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now I know they closed down the
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty [ah]
I have nothing to say about that [ah]
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility [kan]
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are respon~ you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not [kan]
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
migrant workers and community cases like as if
like it's the same thing both is humans
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
obviously with everybody [what] with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
!aiya! it's so
shady
but we know that [lah]
but
but just what like
(mm) but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like I remember going to C_N_N thinking like !wah! I'm going to be a journalist
you know I'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad [lah] like
we ha~ we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
(mm) just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere !aiya! it's just
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
[oh] okay this is how I'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
I just want to say I'm tired okay cause that's how I feel I don't want you to feel
insecure for the way I'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like [oh] I'm more tired than you
so I'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
I don't know why but ya
I don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
I agree I was people
but that's not true
I don't know [lah]
it's similar I think
it's human nature
that's true
I started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them I met I'm like I don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what I mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
(mm)
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because I mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what I mean
but we have no i~ firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so I'm going to keep my options open
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
!yay! we love grey areas
!aiya! and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
you know
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
because this is
islamic law [kan] but it's not like
until the scholars were like (hmm)
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like (hmm) we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
I don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
then it's like (hmm) you know
culture changes also so it's like (ugh)
just
like I don't know I always thought about that I'm like
it's still going to change like
I think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change [ah] but
I'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end o~ like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
and not
whether
thoughts of this so deep
moved a circle
really [ah] shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but I love tiktok
[eh] I spend a lot of my day talking (err) like watching tiktok
I don't know if you can tell
sometimes (err) sometimes I never notice then [oh] marina is like can you stop then I'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent I'm like no I just go
ya I forced her
I told her I wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am I supposed to send it to you I don't want to download everything I said that then she's like I'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like I got it
I made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
[oh] all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then I'm like it's the same with you [what] all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them [lah] and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move I said that
then she's like I will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
(mm)
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the tik~ the tinder algorithm
I didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
!wah! I don't know man
are you saying me and #juri#~ #jufri# have the same face
attractiveness level
!eww!
do I look like that
so I already quit
so so in a few weeks because I've been super busy
and I got no time to even look anymore and I feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and I'm like (err) so I just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app [kan] I I
at first I put my name
[kan] like my whole name I'm #nabilah#
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary I was like
this boy
just like me
and then I haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private [lah] and then got nothing
also cause I don't post but
it was just scary I was like !whoa! people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then I'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
!ee! that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
(ugh)
(oo) I have that family member
you know that family member I don't know if I told you about him but he got married already [lah] to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
so that's like
it's very long right I cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable [lah] because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch I'm like
!ee! sh~ and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly [lah] actually he's worse than #jufri#
ya
I think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
like
are you okay
you know and then
(uh) but his
he's weird [lah]
I don't know I've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then I'm like I didn't know he was family
cause I see him like twice a year like
it's just funny [lah] ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that I knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child [lah]
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
but it was like damn disgusting
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like !eww! like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and I'm like
I know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
!eww! no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the [ah] the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
[oh] my god
like
I thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
it is funny [ah]
(mm)
I think he
he's crazy [ah]
[oh] my god that's that's like the fir~ the kind of guys that I will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
it's damn stupid
ya
I don't know
(mm)
it should swing that way
but I like male ch~ male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs I talk to are like
I will cook for you then I'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like I will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then I'm like [oh]
that's a good change
but I don't know
ya
[oh] my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like I I I [ah] ya
it's like I get it [lah] okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but I think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like [oh] I just
do like part time and
nothing much then I'm like [oh]
nice I don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
(mm)
like I'm sorry
I'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
I got to where I am
like I'm not saying you never worked hard but I worked for what I am and you know (ugh)
now now sometimes also I'm like
I don't know I find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if I really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which I obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
(mm) (uh) you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
!aiya! and you feel shit~ shitty about yourself I don't know I hate people
maybe I should just die alone
good for you good for everyone I don't know
uneasy
that is just not my style
!aiya! my worst match just for ego boost [lah] lately only when I sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about P_M_S specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which I kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
I don't look like that in real life (mm)
it's quite funny [ah]
there was a guy who asked what wa~ what was my weight
then I'm like I don't know if I should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how I look
and he's very curious because I didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell [lah] then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then I was like if I tell you
what are you going to do
if I tell you I'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
(err)
I don't know I think I will still talk to you [oh] you think
then he he left me after I said I was sixty
if you know I'm not sixty obviously
[ah] that's quite funny
I mean
(mm)
actually I'm the same [lah]
but I short lady [ah] so good for me
(mm)
I'd feel iffy about it [lah] but I I'll still talk you
you know I'm like I'm [eh] I'm short right
I'm let's be honest I'm short so I I always thought that
so the guy that I will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time I actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and I used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause I was like I don't believe him he looks damn small that's what I said
and he was small and
and I bet he was like !huh!
and I couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay I'm not thin you know
I'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and I'm just like okay
you know I almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then I I just like he was like nevermind I will pay I guess
and then
he look at me he look I look at him then he like
okay I'll I'll pay like half I'm like okay I mean I thought you're going to pay for your own ticket [lah] bitch
cause I think you should be paying for the ticket
I didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so !aduh! it's quite funny
I didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
I have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height
ya
he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
I was like
this is like a technique I will use I guess in the future
!aiya!
I lazy [ah]
ya
higher angle [eh]
is it I don't know
I don't have people to take for me like nice photos and I I cannot like pose also
so I feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when I never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
I'm not
insecure
[oh]
that's my only photo that I use for C_V until today because I don't have other photos
it's so sad (ugh)
ya
I have so many selfies
after at the end it's like
like that
it's like it's like cheating myself like okay this how you usually look like
it's quite stupid [lah]
okay [lah] at least I rent a smart eight one [lah]
but he's damn tall [sial]
he's damn tall to me [lah]
you talk about him I'm like [oh]
[ah]
ya
she you should ask him to like hold
sarah just texted me
then I'm like
ask him to ask him to hook up a camera and like take a picture of his view
it's okay [lah] he sees you like that [what] and he still like you so
that's all right right (hmm)
you you you know it's it's legit
I don't know I never checked she's like sorry it's a bad timing I know I think it's about me
I'm like !aiya!
okay [ah] okay
okay
(mm) (mm) (mm)
okay okay
okay
okay [lah] full name haikal bin hasani</P1> can just call me #haikal# [lah] so (err)
actually what what I had planned for this year was
okay
I was in the I was doing (err) project management in their construction line [lah]
[ah]
yes
they get back to me
like within a few weeks
it was quite a quick quick response [lah]
and the
[ah] ya ya ya ya
back then was was much simpler times [lah] so
then (err)
(err) when I started
when I just got the job like six months into the job
it was just a job for me
(uh) it's just a job for me to pay the bills [lah]
and [ah] just to
to to to earn to earn money [lah]
most of them they further their studies
[ah]
dig dig dig dig about it
I was like okay [ah] just go go go ahead with it
doing project management then might as well just get a
a a degree (uh) which
is related to my work [lah] so (err) maybe (err) (err) few years down the road (err)
down my career path [lah] in in my in my company at that time
so I I took up my
ya go ahead
[oh] okay (err) I was from poly I I went to singapore poly I took up (uh) civil engineering ya [ah]
(err)
it it it
(err)
it's related [lah] but
(uh) not I I my my scope
of work was not really into the (err) engineering aspect [ah] it's more to the project management side
it was just like [ah]
ya
so [ah]
ya I I can't relate I can relate
to do what you are you are facing right now [lah]
even before O_R_D during my poly I went for my (err) internship
so it was during my internship that that made me (err) think twice to to join the construction industry
(err) it was
in a way I would say more of
a bad experience what I went through
[ah]
the working hours the nature of the work (uh) the work environment
(err) (err) ya
(err)
just sharing my my my experiences [lah]
okay okay (mm)
ya they attach me to a local construction company
(err) so
ya I mean I think it's it's the same for all industries [lah] or you can see a big difference between a local company and (err) (err) foreign or multinational company [lah]
I (err) in terms of budget in terms of work environment and all that [lah] so I was attached to a local construction company [lah]
[ah] the the project I was attached to they were doing a
a [ah] up~
a
everyone in the office was so busy with their work
acknowledge
in their office ya that was that was how I felt [lah]
it's a it's a foreigner I think [ah] he he's an indian guy
and because you can speak well so they they they they put him as an office boy
[ah]
so [ah]
he was the first guy who acknowledged me
[ah]
abeh [ah]
the project manager (err) then the project manager
on that day on that day [ah]
(uh) I think every every everywhere you work [lah] every month they will have a progress meeting [ah]
so the
so
[ah] okay for now you
you just follow my engineer
these big drawings construction drawings
(err) the T_V size
this [ah] project [lah]
so
that that repeated for maybe two or three days [ah]
who wa~ who was was I was supposed to
to follow
so okay [lah] and then
he literally
ya ya I am [ah]
ya (err)
I'm I'm the I'm engineer but not for this project my upcoming project haven't start yet
[ah] so ya
the only
(err) the higher up
once a month [ah] just for the meeting [ah] just for the progress meeting (mm)
[ah] ya ya
so ya then (err) that that was it [lah]
it's like maybe (err) five five workers five staff or five to six [ah] (mm)
he's from (uh)
ya
[ah] [ah] [ah]
so [ah] and [ah] this [ah]
organisation he he he is a student from this (err) organisation [ah]
(err)
(err) the the students from china during the (err)
try try to
(err) like (err)
(mm)
(uh)
what (um) what's the
[ah] ya ya ya [ah]
(err) (err) like
[ah] language barrier and
(err) in in his own world [lah]
(err) (err)
[ah] ya office hours [ah]
stay back at work [sia]
then
only then you understand
what he meant [ah] which is true [ah] which is true [ah] [ah] ya ya
this industry like this is the work environment that I'm gonna be in
(err)
(err) wasted [kan]
(err) in this industry just just to just to have a job [ah] just to have a job and just help out help out the
(uh) pay the bills have part of the family ya which I which I did [lah] then
(err)
this thing
there were also doubt in my mind [lah]
for all the new stuff so okay go for the induction course get to meet all the new staff of course you all the staff are all are of different ages [ah] it's not it's it's no longer
(err) that time was like what
early twenties [lah] [kan] early twenties
then you literally work your way up [ah]
but at that point
didn't didn't thought had that in mind [lah]
ya so
(err)
[ah] like
and it also [ah]
you need to have some technical knowledge [lah] which I was lacking [ah]
(err) with the engineering the engin~ in terms of engineering aspect
I was lacking [ah]
so but we were my nature of work
was more into project management
which is actually
project management is quite
broad [ah]
i~ i~ like this all kind of all industries in a way they have
project management in a way it's just different different areas [lah]
so
[ah]
[oh] okay
(mm) ya ya
so ya (err)
my nature of work also we we deal with consultants
[ah] consultants usually they provide the technical (err) aspect [ah]
so (err) when when when whenever you
ya it turns out it didn't turn out
quite that bad also so ya I mean you just make do with what you
what I
what was more on the soft skills
but
[ah] when the work requires me to I can now I can I can do it [lah]
[ah]
a a
a degree [lah] then I took up a degree in building and project management
I took up a part-time degree
(err) previously was unisim now they call it S_U_S_S [ah]
ya so
then you decided not to
okay [ah]
good for you [lah] good for you I mean
[ah] ya so
I took up
(err) my part-time degree
[oh] everyones
at that time ya like
really take up a degree in what really interest you [ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya
in the industry because your industry (uh)
is more on your portfolio
on the works ya is on the work that you do
so ya you don't really need a a a degree
(uh) with the the the
bosses like
doing this long term
like [ah] so like
(uh) we are a big
C_E and then they got their directors [lah] and then they got their assistant director they got this and that they got a lot of hierarchy [ah]
like sometimes the conflict like
if you are you are holding a high
position you are literally [ah] living a comfortable life [ah]
it was
in my last year of my degree then I decided to
to
under T_V production [ah]
under it's under W_S_Q [ah]
took up a media degree ya then for me to
transition into the media industry which is
I mean because
like you are running out of time [ah] so
we'll just go ahead go ahead with just took up a media degree ya
we are are we
pick up another three years of study
at that time was
was so was want to
[ah] there's this
(err)
it's called a [ah]
and then the new zealand (err) working holiday is is a visa [lah] basically it's a visa called working holiday visa
(err) the visa is for six months
(err)
so they they use the foreigners as cheap labour so for us for new zealand the is is
(uh) is that horticulture industry [lah]
reservist [dah] approve
the more money I have can save up the more money
so this early this year when COVID everything happen [eh] like
only god knows what I was feeling [ah] at that time like
[oh] singapore at at first
[ah] [ah] at first
the new zealand government they
announce they close the borders

[ah]
I was
[eh] so you went in already then rain or what
[oh] it wasn't heavy rain [ah] it wasn't like lightning storm kind of thing [ah]
it's just a drizzle [lah]
[oh] okay but were were you cold
cause I remember when I went right Kelly wanted me to go swimming what in the morning she's like let's go in the morning [ah] then then I like I went in to the pool I just wanna go home already I was freezing inside the pool it was so cold I was like Kelly Kelly Kelly Kelly I like I keep stuttering in the in the pool cause like I just want to leave I just want to take like a hot bath after that
it was so cold in the morning
then then second day is it you all three days you just relax at the hotel
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
[ah] yeah yeah [lah] true [lah]
(mm)
[oh] so when you went it's just messy [lah] is it
[ah] nothing much
okay
(mm)
I mean like I I understand that I need to go out like every every week cause if not I feel very like stuck at home
(mm)
it's nice to go out with your family and staycay [lah]
what
(mm)
yeh so one night is you go weekday one night already what five hundred [ah] no
!wah! so expensive
!oof!
try different hotels [kan]
this staycay in Singapore quite fun [lah] especially when you go with family or friends
yeah
[eh] why you never apply for like Coffee Bean
then
then
[oh] never got reply [ah]
(oo) my friend got Coffee Bean then I like (uh) I hear I hear her pay like I wanna work there too
if you reach a certain amount of hours per week you get ten dollar per hour but I think she might hear wrong [lah] she might hear wrong [what] that's why I scared
yeah but okay [lah] she like becoming one next week like she's taking the health basic health hygiene whatever thing
November [oh] my god this week got like tick-tock September October you got like nearly two months man
[oh] very long [eh]
home bum because you got no work is it
it's not like you're not trying to find [what] you tried but a lot of jobs like
they never reply or they got different criteria than you expect
[kan]
(mm)
yeah they ask a lot of jobs they asking for like for like three years [eh] (err) like at least a year experience then I'm like I haven't even start a job then you want a year experience a bit too much [sia]
yeah
what to do
yeah
is it
is it I never check like jobs right now
(mm)
yeah that's why
what to do
you got play Among Us
you know there's this game called Among Us
can ask like
yeah
but like it looks so fun right but I cannot lie I can't I I cannot lie everytime I lie they like okay it's #Nisha# it's #Nisha# I'm like [oh] no okay yeah it's me it's me just just kill me already
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
yeah
(mm)
(mm)
what
you can hide the body
!wah!
I didn't know you can hide the body !wah! I should I should try
(mm)
then so many people there right I just kill someone then everyone was like who who would kill someone in front of broad daylight when everyone's here then I just keep quiet
both especially with the plus four plus two
stupid games [eh] ya
is it all meat or is it just (err) beef
!wah!
I mean I know I know you can but you just prefer not to right
yeah but it'd be so random imagine your guy like knows that you don't you don't like beef then one day you just craving for beef
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I was trying to make sense of your sentence then I'm like (uh) (err) !huh!
yeah
(mmhmm)
that is like no helping buddy like that right no buddy system
(mm)
they're waiting for you
but you also not interested then they like okay sorry guys next time
then
sometimes I also like that [lah] but but most of the time when they know then they will change but if they don't know then they don't change and then when they don't when they know you do't go then they stay to the original plan [lah]
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
yeah that's why it's like it's worse I mean would they like it when when I say that [oh] we eat this one later we we specifically find food for you like like you like left out you know that kind of feeling
then then that's why that's why I keep like distancing from a certain group of people in poly
(mm)
(mm)
yeah
[eh]
four five times as in like to and fro back or what
!wah!
then next week just take bus all the way later I like I don't really
yeah I'm your guinea pig now [ah]
and then Natalie idea did you read Natalie's the that thing
I I did the survey but I didn't see the point of having one
I think
I think that will be more useful [lah] in my cause like they only have disability for what the one that we know so far is a wheelchair only
you never actually heard of other disability kind I think that will be more helpful if they research in that [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that's why they probaby don't get on the bus they probably take taxi [kan]
(um) I mean (hmm) continue you continue first continue first
no no you finish your sentence first [ah]
(mm)
then other than that a lot of people also cannot afford having that kind of help [what]
cause it is expensive to have a trained dog
(uh) (mm)
yeah the yeah
yeah (uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
yeah like I feel like we should cater our technology more towards the disabled [lah]
convenience right
(mm)
yeah cause they had lost one of their senses you know (err) not one maybe like some it's very sad [lah]
(mm)
yeah
have you heard
I mean I I wish we are smart and got money to do this thing
have you heard of the of the of the forest fire in #California# is it #California# or ore~ #Oregon# [ah]
it's constant like even in this in the morning is red colour then like it's so bad this isn't the first time that happen this is the second time that happen cause of a gender reveal thing
exactly like okay [lah] you want do gender reveal party it's okay I think I think it's a cute idea to have a party like that but if you wanna make an explosion in the middle of like flammable things it's a bit no brainer [lah] that one
yeah then like can you the the the thing is right the family already have children
then they exposed them to this kind of this this kind of stupidity
yeah [lah]
really
[oh] man you should ask cause I think it will damn funny
I didn't know
(hmm)
[oh] boy is a girl joke [lah]
rated
(mm)
yeah it's like so isn't it like betting like you betting is actually a betting it's like just a party kind of thing it's like a party idea
a blessing right

Ethelene and Kelly I was so shocked

and then I'm like
but my family said a bit dry but I don't care whether dry or not I care for the frosting the the the the cream cause some I don't really like whipped cream [kan]

(mm)
I was really contemplating whether it's okay whether I need a cake then Andrew was like you don't need a cake I was like okay I don't need a cake then I didn't buy a cake
that's why you say you want a cake then I did ask #Yin Shen# cause like I know #Yin Shen# felt left out but I asked in the in our our group chat whether anyone would want a cake
then Kelly has been telling me cause even at work I asked her do I need a cake for my birthday then she's like no need [lah] I just buy for you [lah] then I'm like don't need [lah] don't need buy [lah] don't waste your money cause it's my birthday right she's like nevermind [lah] nevermind [lah] I'm like no Kelly you don't need to buy then she baked one cake

the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
(uh) it can be done but it's just very hard
my course is interaction design [kan] so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm (uh) ideas together and then come up with like (uh) a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting [lah] because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
(uh) how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
ya that's about it
for you [eh]
(mm)
why kay you tell me
how #rabak#
!wah! I legit also don't like this type of people [leh] like they really make my blood go up [eh] like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to [ah] take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works [lah]
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] I know what you mean
hanoi

(oo) that's good
ya ya ya very interesting [eh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game

the like

like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school [lah] so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another

then you know you kind of knuckle jack hits a bit
!wah! man I cannot [ah]
but that's terrible [ah]
like
we are talking about like thousand two right or something
to be honest your rental rates is nonsense [ah]
you know
I would pay you five like like five six hundred for like
rental
[ha] [ha]
or there's
or there's an actual plague going on [ha] [ha]
okay so (um) about #fahim# thing

brother herme
[kan]
right
#ayip#
pick me up after work
I you know like like the good boyfriend
he he he
ya
and all that
then on the way back (err) I I don't know why we were talking about random stuff
then I was talking about
[oh] down to V E
you know
ya cause I think we were
like emotional relationship issues that someone
call in and like kind of thing
ya that's what I'm what
no I'm pretty sure you know is trust some of them are just pure fan fiction
if I were the D_J I will get a kick out I think the most stupid things [ah]
so it's one of those like
standard cheating thing
then I'll
sorry I just thought of of of him
[ah] then we were I was talking about it till like
ya ya then I was talking about it too
how to
tired [ah]
then he was
eighty nine
I wonder if you still ever uses that email address
ya
really
[ah] us ya
so (um) then he was saying how (um)
how did they go into it I
then we were talking about you
for some reason
then I was saying how you know it's awkward and all that
then he was saying how
(err)
[kan]
I would
I wouldn't support all these things
ya
so I was I was saying that I don't think #hilmi# actually supports [ah] no of course not
the act of
still hanging out with the guy
and everything like that and you hang out with the guys
release stress
ya end up the guys the guys they steal the show it shows kind of like support
in that sense
then he was saying how
it
he felt that it wasn't
a
something to
that you should do [lah]
or like it's
it's
like it's normally a bit
fucked up [ah]
then he was saying how (um)
I think he was talking to you about it
once or twice
before
this
like if you ever had that kind of conversation with with him about that [ah]
so now what now is just
!huh! !huh!
it's
it doesn't feel
great [ah]
I was telling him [ah] like they are gonna
[ah] when
when I had that relationship
issues back at the time right
then I was saying him [eh] I but mine wasn't cause of cheating [ah] of course
so
like if I was the cheater
in that sense
then he had he had he had a pause for like a bit [tau]
ya
like nor~ normal
angry guy
shadow boy a new guy
[eh]
sad sad you know you know until now he's been driving for like how long has been he he's been he's been driving for
right
that guy still wouldn't let me play music on his car okay
no
no the idea I was just saying okay
!hey! brother
you should remind me to bring an A_U_X cable then I can you know play play play some tunes then he was like
it it
singapore is very small
[oh] !wow!
!wow! that's that's going into the wrong direction [ah]
so anyways right
ya so (um) about that I think then he was
telling me that
but
I don't want to have the girl there like I cannot
fair enough [ah]
right that's the whole to the other thing like it's not like you know beforehand
like you know you know you you don't know who's in attendance were
that's a bit of a stretch [ah]
to be fair
exactly right
okay there are some exceptions you know
okay but how do you okay how do you defend like from a moral standpoint like how do you make that argument that
like how do you defend
[ah] his his actions from a moral standpoint [ah]
okay you are much closer to the whole situation than I am [lah] [kan]
(uh) being with the wife on our ex
and the current girlfriend
well if you if you're with your with that guy patience is a given [ah]
(mm)
I don't know that's a very controversial statement [ah]
so by those dates
you you describe it as (um)
how you say recklessness
or like apathy
lack of ambition
to me that [one] it's more of
not yet it's it it's more from a position of privilege rather than gender [lah] like that's true
right
okay
#fahim# isn't exactly mister olympia material himself [pe]
I mean
what
I mean ya you know but
has ashley put on a lot of weight I I've always known her to be a bit of
on the (err)
how do I put this
okay
rounder side of life [ah]
at !wah! that's
brother why you got to use the F word
what it post
!wah! I cannot
[sial] [ah]
brunei
[eh] no no no no no
I've been to brunei
okay so
[ah] people in brunei
no I'm not talking about like the
workers are like the they have a lot of like foreign workers
no but they are middle
income people there
right
half of them are
ya
so like (uh) I was asking bell [lah] that time it's like why [ah]
like
when we do say you know
a couple of
chonkers due here in
singapore
[ha] [ha]
but
do you see more that there
then she was saying [oh] then she was expecting okay (um) one thing is
[ah] it's
that's A
B
(err) a public transport is a fucking nightmare
everyone drives
but there's no tourism to speak of
free education free healthcare
right
I mean
but healthcare is not free [what]
ya
[oh] ya
so basically I was
I was talking about [ah] about #ruqayyah# and then we talking about ya okay so
your your whole day your
I think what you're trying to say in summary is that
a bit spoilt
like
and she doesn't have that drive in her to
do more
like
(uh huh)
wait so there are
december anything
yes
yes
okay so what is it about the
no no no no no
[ah]
you know
[eh]
!wow!
why does it sound (mm)
(mmhmm)
like it just physical
[oh] man
!wow!
but
I don't
the thing is right
I don't think right
having someone else was seeking comfort in someone else would solve anything
how else you gonna get X_P and loot
you know
I don't know but then now it's all it's all over messy as hell
it's a revenge thing [ah]
maybe
very complicated stuff
you know like I know we've known the guy for like forever
I never thought
(mmhmm)
now is what
fourteen years
no I never
don't want to say that but you said but you said it
ya I never thought you with #tino# until but then again all of us
ya but somehow in in in your mind you always thinking you know okay (uh) marriage is like the big leveller [ah]
it would down
calm down his raging lions that kind of thing
do you even iron clothes
[oh] I haven't seen an iron board in years [ah] dude
what for
ya
(mm)
so anyways
I don't remember that
[ha] [ha]
!wow!
like like no one just wakes up one day twenty kilo heavier [pe]
don't care what you eat but the [oh] how many times you eat [lah] in that sense
wait
what's
what's your weight now [ah]
!wow!
[eh] is it
I I don't
is it
is it normal for your height I I don't actually know
right so if you
it's like you're on the the yellow zone kind of thing [ah] is it
[oh] no there's a difference you know you you you you cannot use the [ah] #ang moh# ones
ya ya ya result
white guys different [ah]
in terms of what lean body mass
ya
I mean we just evolved from different monkeys [lah] I guess
[ah] I don't think there's a big difference between malay and chinese
you know
[ah] wait wait wait wait
[eh] wait wait
what were they talking about [ah]
that [one]
okay okay
okay how how how tall are you
one six seven let me cal~ cal~
[eh] brother you are at low risk good job
[ah] ya your B_M_I is twenty one point nine
[orh] without what is mine hold on
but the
but this one thing isn't accurate also cause the H_P_B [one] doesn't ask for your gender which makes a difference [ah]
according to this my B_M_I is twenty three point six
moderate risk
ya but I used to but I think (um) I think a couple of months ago I was
I was I was a bit of a
in a chonky
I think my my highest

my peak was I was nine
you know at my peak I was ninety kilos [jer]
right
I
I think I know which [one] you're talking about like the picture

!huh! !huh! !huh!
and then lunch and then breakfast and lunch is just blurs together so it's just like
(mm)
no no it's a roasted milk tea
ya
roasted
what
I don't know it's like probably toasted tea leaves or something not sure but there's a definite taste to it [ah]
ya
alright
in law no not yet so [ah] cause she
she's dating this
guy right
ya
and then
vacuum guy ya
[ah] german guy did I did I told you what he does for a living
like so he works for this german company of course [ah] and then what they do is they sell medical devices
so (um) it's like things to do if the if (uh) for you know respiratory things [ah]
so as you can imagine
they made a bomb doing (uh) this time ya
ya
so he was telling me that time [ah] he was telling me this I wouldn't say funny but kind of funny story
that's a bit #siao# also
[ah] quarterly report or something [lah]
company profits and all that
then one of his executives sent out a message [ah]
saying that you know
(um) good job let's hope we can keep this up
which is kind of fucked up
cause
ya
ya and then he was like celebrating it back via email quite cynical
company kind of like white email [ah]
then then at then a while ago were like complaining [ah] how can you say this kind of things
you know
what if he someone you know has you know
COVID
ya
ya like
you
ya you're doing work like you're earning money but you shouldn't you know
celebrate the fact that people are suffering
ya
I don't know german guy
[ah] then
he will he told me he told me that first [ah] that was like the first time I met him then when when I met him again he was telling me the same story that I thought okay [ah] this old man might might have been repeating his story again
but he say he just filtered that just to remind me about the initial story
and then he told me
then the guy like
the guy is on medical leave
for like a like a month or two [ah]
or a few months medical leave
then then I was like [oh] why
I wasn't thinking that
at at first I was thinking like something else [lah] right
then said no
he got COVID
what the fuck
is this real life it does actually happening that kind of thing
what you think of that
ya okay so anyway
(um) the initial thing was
they wanted to get married [ah] this year
but it's not is more of like my sister was pressured into asking him to get married this year
my parents [lah] of course
it's usually like a like a mother thing [lah] like
ya this kind of
ya so (um) and then what you call it [ah] then okay cause he has to do a lot of things right so the guy has to convert first
actually his name is dominic
then
do you do do you get to choose your your muslim name
or did they like
right
ya so anyway he has to do that (uh) he has to convert
and then he has
he had to like screw things up cause with his side of the family and all that right
islam [ah]
in general
like
which you know
can I can totally
ya if you talk to me about it !woo! you can go on for like this [ah] but my sister wasn't too happy then she was asking me about it [lah] then I'm like
yes
then I'm like
ya that's what I told my sister also [lah] I haven't actually talk to him myself ya it's not like you you don't have to give to M_U_I_S then I I told my dad I told my sister you know
I never give M_U_I_S I just donate
on my own
what I didn't mention was I donate to myself so it's a different thing
[eh] you know it's you know
it's up to you to determine who's needy [what]
in a way ya and you know self self-care is my is my priority now ya self-care is a priority now
so anyway I
so
ya so anyway then (um)
blah blah blah and all that then he was saying about it's not fair for his ends cause his family isn't around cause they cannot travel
cause
#wuhan# flu and all that
[ah] chinese cough as they say
and then (err)
ya so now they
ya so
there was like a bit of a fight
and then they kind of compromise in the sense where okay he will still go to the
conversion classes and (um)
and they will
try to take it a little bit slow [ah] from from from there cause they say they're okay he kind of needs he wants his family involved [ah] which is fair
ya [lah] of course [lah] you know you get married then your parents not over there
okay [ah] mine is a different thing so
yes so it feels a bit messed up [ah]
then (uh)
so my mum
I thought I thought they were in a good spot
[ah] and they were kind of
having some progress [ah] but at a good pace
then my mum's feeling anxious again
cause (uh) [kan] they both work from home
like
(uh) my sister and him
ya
so
my sister cannot go I think she can but she chooses not to go into
the office
ya I wish I could do that
(um)
ya then [ah] he goes over to his place a lot cause (uh) K so my my parents live in #bedok# south right which is
basically near #tanah merah# right
then he lives at the condo at #tanah merah#
ya I think that's what it's called ya I've been there before once [pe]
ya
so she goes over there like every other day [ah] to like you know to do her work and stuff which to me makes a lot of fucking sense cause you know
your the house is crowded
you got to deal with that
with two teenage boys
and there's no air con
[ah] okay three teenage boys
ya and there's no
ya [sia] ya what the fuck
no is like he feels like he was born a teenager and that's it [lah]
one of those guys
ya
and then [ah] she's there like every other day then (um) that day I kind of went to meet my mum
ya then of course after the whole initial
five ten minutes of [eh] why you pierce your ear blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
kind of thing
ya
then after that she was complaining about (uh) that issue like my sister
(um) being over there [lah] what
and saying how [oh]
my mum
then
ya then and all that then she was asking me what do you think she should do [ah]
I don't know then I I told her that I think the best thing to do is
so the best thing to do
ya [lah] exactly then I told her like you haven't talked to his side also
ya
the guy's side
ya ya
ya then
right
I think they should know
then the last time [ah] he talked to me and (uh) he brought me out for beers
[ah] I've got things to do [ah]
ya so I didn't
what
an online class that that I want to do
ya
no no no no as in I am I am I am doing like a psychology course [lah] so
no it's one of those like fucking cheap cheap cheap ones [lah] it's just to like you know
[ah] ya
so anyway (um) what what I saying ya then he was telling me about
[ah] at first if his parents have some reservations [ah] about him
going out with a malay asian girl [ah]
you know how the whole stereotype is like right
not only but it's more like white guy then coming to to east asia where they're getting taken advantage of
I get it
fair enough
no [ah] [ah] !whoa! this just !whoa! !whoa! that's fucked up
that's true
then at first I was kind of offended and then I had then I really thought about it for like for like a bit then I realised okay
after certain incidents
that had that happen in germany and the whole influx of like foreigners right
ya and some of them are from like [ah] muslim countries [lah] right
turkey and all that
then felicia was like okay then it makes sense for them not to have not a very
positive views on like muslims in general
but I don't know how to like explain it to my mum
in that way [tau]
was it aus~ (mm)
ya so I think in the end just closed like that you know I think there's compromise already
to try to talk talk my sister into
maybe getting an engagement first [lah]
okay can you hear me
okay okay can start talking already
ya
don't know you you are the one who was who is confused [ah] there's a cake on top of the macarons
unless
ya cause the macaron want to send you for what because my mum made the choice already
ya [lah]
colour colour is the flavour [lah]
ya ya ya
ya so that [one] cause since she they decorated ed the cake already ya so she just choose the macaron
cannot COVID cannot do cake tasting
ya by right can but because it's COVID
ya
I also don't know I mean I'm just waiting for them to answer
ya I don't know [ah] but I asked them what do you mean by that
either that or they want like within these two hours like what time do you want them to come or something whatever [lah]

exactly [ah] [sia]
I was like

ya
I I I I'm young at heart

and then after that finished N_S no money already cause I spent it all on new zealand
(mm)
there there will be a tattoo of a
ya the the the japanese wave shit then after that it's always like a koi fish going up and then after that the koi fish is at the forearm
seriously I
why do you think I saved up money for three years when I wanted to get tattoo
I don't know [ah] depends on the quality [one] [ah]
obviously I di~ I I didn't do much research [ah] I didn't want a koi fish tattoo I wanted a pirate [one]
you know it will be like like
!huh!
!wah!
ask her to do an apprenticeship [ah]
what the fuck
man
I wouldn't I don't I wouldn't trust myself [sia]
cuppin
the one you bought after you exercise
[ah] ya ya ya
(uh huh)
!woo!
[oh] that's cool
[eh]
[ah] cause
because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast [lah]
ya
I almost got a tattoo there
no I was planning it
and then after that just when we were there he
so and then
so I was like fuck it [ah] like
and when you come back we talk about it
then after I googled do
do tattoos affect your kidneys then they said like [oh] if you want to donate a kidney you shouldn't get a tattoo then I was like [ah] fuck [ah]
ya
ya
no [lah] she know [lah] (uh)
I I stayed over at her friend's house of course she know
no
it's just m~
me
like I
ya I mean
one time I literally passed out
on the living room
yeah
I don't know [ah]
I I know at one point she she she didn't
yeah
ya never again though
yes
throwing up
no
yeah
ya
ya I did it was like one of the first few conversations we had
cause she asked about halal haram ratio
then I said [oh] ya I st~ I st~ I used to drink a lot and stuff
ya
cause she said
ya (uh) I stopped already so okay [lah] that doesn't bother her
that kind of thing like that
[ah]
what
ya then happened like three
in the same night
and then after that
no I don't I don't remember
ya
that as
ya and then one time
then after that
then after that you know like they dance very close [one]
then my friends were behind me then they were like egging me on
that one I remember
I he~ I was so angry at myself [sia]
ya
I mean I feel kind of bad but
also kind of
good
ya
how is it how was your last duty you get into trouble or not
surprising
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[ah] okay
action [sia]
I
[oh]
[ah]
hand over shift
reservist
actually not really [lah] N_S I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
(mm)
(mm)
night shift I wasn't like that [ah] because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning [kan]
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning [kan]
ya
last time my rota quite bonded [ah]
[ah] that's like fucking eight bicycle [sia]
(mm)
[oh] ya how was it cardiac arrest right
[ah]
cannot [sia]
(mm)
[dah] expect [ah]
(mm)
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
[ah]
(mm) depends [ah] depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
[oh]
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
[oh]
why [sia]
ya ya ya
all medics
my time it was like optional
they expect you to go
(mm)
[ah]
that's cool
the this captain from
(err) division #yishun#
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
so ya
[oh] ya my last
you know my (err) last duty
[eh] no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
then they but the I think it's because
ya it's like
pretty much [lah] but most of the time we still try [ah] just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare [ah] unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing C_P_R [lah]
to do C_P_R that kind
ya
then he was like like
you fucking terrible at C_P_R until like an N_S_F has to take over you
and like the N_S_F that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay [what] actually last time medic
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do C_P_R is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
[ah]
ya
(err) they started right after I O_R_D
as in
ya that's true
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
so I think like the F_M_V
[orh] firefighter
[orh] the~ then turn out for s~
[orh]
ya
the firefighting [ah]
like the the green the green one
[ah] [ah]
T shirt [sia]
[ah] [ah] ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what I saw also [ah] when I turn out with them
but fun right
(mm)
[eh] wait so were you were you the covering sec com
[orh] so even then like if even if you turn out the P_O will take charge [lah]
[ah] so so if anything like the P_O will take charge of the call [lah]
P_O what
[ah] ya
[oh] then
[ah] I see I see
ya
[orh] they want to put people into the
F_M_V [ah]
[eh] but actually now P_L also turn out for
P_L also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity C_P_R or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is [ah] high intensity C_P_R H_I
ya let me google [ah] high intensity
S_C_D_F
high performance high performance C_P_R
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do C_P_R
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance C_P_R to resuscitate a patient
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
make it better
I als~ I also don't know
that kind of thing but ya

!alamak! sister
(mm)
your house at night when I walking
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
like a lot
[oh] sister amazing
(mm) (mm)
ya
[oh] serious [ah]
I very
I very hungry [lah] [eh]
my side recording
five four three two one
you know I think that's one topic you can do because I don't think even if we talk all these [leh] I don't think this (err) all the researchers I think it's okay [lah] to all these to talk about all these things [ah] I don't maybe they won't even understand what's that it all about
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) (uh) god knows how many weeks at least thirty two weeks (err) assuming one game a week [lah]
you know maybe we can have a community thing alright where
per person and have this a sixty four or maybe even one two eight maybe even one two eight per [ah] for the whole tournament [kan] then we take just ten percent that's (uh) between us and what sixty dollars to or even a hundred twenty eight dollars divide by two thirty to sixty dollars each
I mean ya it's not it's not that bad you you earn that in like one hour [lah] outside [lah] now but at least this is a start this is you know we we don't really need to put in money
if we could have done this for free but at least we're getting some money and and the community we get ninety percent in total we can even have top eight get something
maybe the if you reach top eight you get your money back
something like that ya you get or or even more than that top sixteen we'll we'll figure we'll figure things out [lah] but whatever it is at least [eh] the whole tournament (um) one winner on one day two hundred dollars not like that league you gotta pay so many different matches to not even to get less than that ya
(uh) I drop it in discord
ya so
so they have this new league
I don't know how many people have signed up so far
(um) I just didn't know
you know the this league not worth it seriously
[ah]
[ah]
en
(mm)
ya
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah] exactly exactly ya
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
I'm thinking because
the our original idea the main selling point [lah] is that so~ social media aspect [lah] so
but (um) the social media aspect of a one off thing [eh]
(err)
[ah] ya
ya
[ah]
ya that's best best
that's the truth as well there's a truth it's a bit of a bumper about what to do what what you said earlier was right and [ah] we we don't have anything on our port~ on our portfolio [eh] how are they going to trust us with their money as well
we also got to make it
not [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(hmm) (hmm) (hmm) maybe maybe who knows maybe
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
I
[ah] okay all the C_C tournaments then
you know so
ya so
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(err) five dollars
five dollars okay I'm thinking
what if okay one okay let's let's set a price pool one thousand dollar price pool strictly for the community one thousand dollar price pool we have then we tell them look guys we got no sponsors no nothing
you know (err) so (err) or maybe we don't even we don't even need to say that [ah] we just say look there there's a competition we're gonna make here one thousand dollar price pool [eh] wait but if we are this is not gonna be a one off [tau] this is gonna be like a weekly thing so how are we going to
(mm)
(mm)
ya correct
(uh huh)
ya okay
(uh huh)
ya
(mm)
okay I have a idea they just came to mind okay so let's say [eh] we do everything for every
let's say every saturday [lah] [eh] every saturday we have something
okay we have we have this event K to get to to to enter each week you got to pay five dollars just five dollars first each week
okay so let's say I can get (err) thirty two players
on average K that's one hundred sixty dollars
once exhort ya it's not much right but every week
K we tell them alright we have (um) four four prize winners
each of the prize winners (err) okay and then at least (err) total weekly prize pool maybe two hundred dollars something like that
alright (um)
or we could just put it every every week (err) the cash price right winner guaranteed a hundred dollars plus twenty percent of the of the registration fees
something like that I I don't know the actual number [lah] K the the hope is that I'm telling them look you guys you want to increase the port get as many people to sign up as as much as possible
our limit for the whole day alright will be a hundred twenty eight players per day
okay [a'ah] and then like this [ah] we go all the way down to maybe like top sixteen top sixteen you get five percent of the registration feedback
of the all the registration pool [lah] basically [lah] alright so let's say top sixteen so that's thirty two okay let's say [eh] thirty two players alright top sixteen you get five percent so that's one hundred sixty dollars
ya
something like that okay so okay ya we can do something like that [lah] so let me get up my word pad my notepad [ah] so let's say top sixteen five percent so I six five per cent sixteen times times stuff about sixteen times five
[oh] six eight
that's eighty percent for the top sixteen that's five percent each and then ten percent ya that's actually [ah] we can't do that maybe top eight [ah] top eight get five percent [lah]
yes
[ah]
ya get a wise five per~ (uh) [eh]
so top eight
that's forty percent ya correct correct
top eight
forty percent okay
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
no no no not top four ten percent
ten percent [ah]
top two
fifteen percent
and then champion
twenty percent
asked the floor just my percentage turn out is great [lah] okay
okay so let's say okay so we got four winners who will only get five percent
four winners only
K
(um)
ya
[eh] of the total registration fee
correct correct and that is before any additional cash prize we can put champion gets thirty percent of registration fee plus guaranteed
two hundred three hundred whatever it is [lah] whatever amount
there will really get people to like [eh] !siala! if I can get top eight so so top eight is five percent of total registration fee plus another fifty dollars
so people are thinking at [eh] I only pay five dollar registration fee [tau] I get guaranteed fifty fifty percent plus god knows how many much more
people register
the more people register the bigger my price pool
[a'ah] correct
so that's it we need to have at least
(um)
(um)
okay but that's why okay you (um) then it's only top eight get prizes
if we have thirty two players even if they get a buy they're still into the top sixteen
(mm) (mm)
(mm) true also true also difficult [ah]
(mm)
sixty four possible
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
en
(mm)
so this idea [eh] is basically if I were to go to N
en
(err) but I can't guarantee whether he is that he is not working under SCOGA
you know and they want and if this is going to secure a FIFA market for them [kan] they're all out for it
his words [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
let me
[ah]
let me try and see if I can find (err)
(err) what's that called [lah]
SCOGA event and see how were they mark~ how they marketed it
(err) basically they're having this league I don't know how long the league is which is just it's a two V two thing
strictly for boys and girls aged thirteen to seventeen years old
SCOGA is the one that does the the the operations [ah]
it's a it's a carbon copy
so is SCOGA will have the logo there and then (err) this (err) will have (err) the our
what I'm afraid of [eh] is that got they're gonna keep the idea for themselves if that's if that's a that's a legitimate thing or not
everything has to be done by us
ya exactly
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya ya ya definitely definitely so so that's the thing that I'm I'm you know I have been thinking of and I've been battling myself about [lah] like
(err) like (um) even when I I told her the idea look [ah] why not (err) we work together we are loudmouth and see what they can get as well
and she said you know like no it it it shouldn't be under loudmouths she doesn't want us to work under loudmouths to do all these [tau] she want us to be on our own
we need to have our name because we are promoting us if people were if we were to show you know like potential sponsors hello we did this event [tau]
and then that's definitely you know parleyed didn't african [lah]
that's the number one thing [ah]
yes
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
like our problem right now is finding our own third party sponsor [lah]
a
[ah]
[ah]
so that's the difficult part also so that that is one reason why as much as possible (um) you know
the main reason is I don't want if adult person I don't want us to spend money at all [lah] you know ya so that's that's the main thing right ya so and you know another thing also I think it doesn't really help us in this particular
(err) potential conversation that we're going to have with potential sponsors as well
(um)
ya ya correct
a
(uh huh)
a
you will have your own you know shout out [lah] you know the sponsor what they do and stuff like that
and there is a a match that because you're doing real life football academy for kids and some of the competitors are dads they also have kids so you have your name up there you know and it will come who knows maybe we get one person to join your academy from there
or at or even more than that or at least the word of mouth will come in I mean that's the whole point of advertising [ah] a lot of my understanding of people sponsoring events [eh] is that you know it's just to get the name out and most they (err) how to say that the
ya there's no monetary returns you're just getting your name out there it's just another way of getting your name out there that is not on billboards you don't spend money on paying billboards and stuff but you know you're going directly to the customer [lah] in a way [lah]
it's the same as T_V advertisement [ah] so I'm thinking the the one positive is that at least your company is football related and our our event is virtual football
ya ya ya or even worst the only them in there
a
(mm) but I'm okay now I'm okay ya still in my head [eh] I totally agree with what you said I'm just entertaining what if we what if we actually do it and how can we work it into our product
we can also say that K look this is the amount of time that we spent talking about junior football academy
we can tell to potential sponsors look ya okay let's put aside the fact J_F_A is it J_F_A J~ junior football academy
football school sorry about that sorry about that so J_F_S okay (err) so J_F_S we go okay we make one weekly event alright then we can go back to the sponsors and say look in that one weekly event right I spent a total of thirty minutes running time just talking about J_F_S you know
let's put aside the fact J_F_S it belongs to us [lah] okay was like that but that is for for whatever money you put in alright thirty minutes of our air time goes to you of the whole eight hour whole eight hour thing thirty minutes of the time we spent talking about you and nothing else when we talk about you your product
and that's that's a lot of airtime for relatively little a mon~ money input from you guys
you know so and that just one week that it's just one day not even one week one day so with our league that's gonna run for two months plus and we don't need you know again we only need that set amount of money from you you know so what is thirty minutes times
eight weeks how many hours and hours I was we spend time talking just on your one product
we can talk a lot of shit man you know for you guys
ya
(mm)
yup (mm) (mm) (mm)
so
[ha] [ha]
[a'ah] [sia]
!alamak!
!alamak!
okay
okay
ya
okay
(um)
there's another
[ah] correct correct so but I can I can load I can load V_P_G one and one play E sports [lah]
one play E sports
pure (err) pure cup malaysia nine hundred ninety views
per hour for one hour nine hundred ninety views
you know
(mm)
ya the singapore premier league a week ago (err) three point eight K views
(mm)
(err) what's that called
okay E #singa# cup the one that we so called we lost to game gamers semi finals to our song fourteen thousand views fourteen K the finals is six and a half K views
quarter final seven K
(err) E #singa# cup
okay ya well that was for the pro clubs [ah]
for the one V one E #singa# cup
one V one E #singa# cup
[oh] they split it into
the whole league
part two another three hours was five point eight K view so it's actually in the thousands [ah] early thousands
you know so ya
[oh] shit
one point two people like this
so on that much one point two K
[ah]
two thousand two thousand eight hundred followers
two point eight K followers
so okay and what we can do is we can cost
force you know we can one stream
we can post it on my at the and my channel will post it your channel will stream it my channel will stream it your channel will stream it our you know our new channel (err) you know like specifically for these events will also stream it
so that
ya that would that would really help
because [eh] if it'll be better it will be a lot better
instead of just (err) #aiman# giving a shout out
for us people might not follow ya people might not follow but if we are able to cast stream to his thing
to to his channel
and then (err) what's that called [ah] ya and then like this [ah] people will be alerted
ya
exactly
[ah] correct correct
so so that's the thing if we can if we are able to pull him ya and then you know we can
we can actually I I I've been trying to find a way to pull him in but the thing is this is gonna be a strictly singapore thing because [ah] I don't know how to send prize money to malaysians that's one problem
[ah]
sorry researchers I didn't mean to say but it is a really huge thing I understand you're feeling gutted you didn't get the huge thing but
a
ya
(um)
ya not that bad correct correct so I'm thinking you know maybe we can we can pull him in and get the malaysian viewers also
you know and all we want [eh] it's just boost the numbers the viewership you know that's all we need
or whatever we can (uh) we can get [lah] we can tell them look that's an easy ten thousand views
[ah] ya so
(mm)
so I maybe we can tell them a lot of things it's okay maybe they don't know who #sekaiichi# is [ah] they just look at pure viewership numbers [ah] we can talk about them [eh] we can talk about the concurrent numbers the viewership and stuff like that
that's no issue get a number of views
ya I can
ya so
so now we've got two two routes here we can just make everything on our own without sponsorship then you have to go the long and slow way I got a slog it out it's a outward slug if we do it this way every week one separate event and we try to build up viewership from there
[ah]
the other way is if we go to existing partners like SCOGA zenway or whatever I I I think of the three that I personally know of which is one place zenway and SCOGA I think SCOGA have the best in because (um) and you know really likes to work together with me [lah] basically [lah]
ya but I don't know anybody else in SCOGA [lah] so it will we will be highly or solely dependent on them
if we were to go there [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
okay so
it's a society
wants to make a difference in the local gaming scene especially in developing the local E sports in I think ya there will be
who do they have
okay me too ya
ya
sorry
(hmm)
[oh] you you also quit your job ya

(mmhmm)
(mm)
hi
my name is #Intan# and this is weird
later on like the when the government give like the government (um) announced that they're going to give like they're gonna roll out like sets of masks to give (uh) you
okay well
well as you know [lah] [kan] I came back in January as in like I think by the time it was mid January (um) there were already like
if I'm not mistaken there was already a case like especially I think around the twentieth to twenty sixth of January I think that was when the report (uh) Singapore reported their first case
like we didn't care so (err) after that when (err) Jan no actually when February rolled by we had a bigger trip
like you know the the threat of the virus is there but it's just not as severe yet so we thought like okay why not we we just go ahead
but (err) my my boyfriend was like the most #kiasu# of like the there were three of us went together so basically my boyfriend was the most #kiasu# and he was very irritating
and then is like he just insist [ah] right wearing the mask the entire time when like me and the other guy were like nah we are not going to wear a mask
err ya so we we as in like basically most of the time we went around Japan without wearing a mask and it was quite and also like you know #Tokyo# is near
yok~ #Yokohama# no is it is it near I mean like (err) there there are lots
of like I mean eventually the the cases are like kind of like like blew up in in #Tokyo# [lah] so
(err) we were lucky to have left before that
and then after that like (err) luckily we came back right before when (err) Singapore start imposing that fourteen
days stay at home thing like the quarantine at that time wasn't like stay at home so it's like you know they were like other L_Os and (um) L_O_As and whatever
the aviation industry went to shit then basically like a lot of my friends are losing their job and then that like you know some of my friends came back
ya but I didn't expect this to happen right but still you know it's very difficult for all of us so
so I can balance I can juggle my life with (err) studies I can keep my time occupied [eh] and like you know just do my stuff
okay I mean I feel bad for laughing at her because I kind of know her [lah] but as in like the fact is that like stupid [sia] you should just just shut up
and like you know go and like promote other things instead of like trying to ruin other people's lives
no but the fact is that
no it's just terrible P_R
[oh] my god stereotype [sia]
that's another unwanted
then after that she was like (err) even at times at times we we I suggest [lah] okay I say nevermind [lah] mama stop cooking why don't you just like you know call
Grab food or something
and then ya then after that like ya was great so I guess if even until now also
they should be acknowledged as well I feel
ya
it's true like you know I as in I'm not sure if you watched the the National day segment I mean like I only watched it for like a few hours
I won't say personalities like they I mean they picked (err) they they featured some characters like you know (um) everyday Singaporeans and everything
(um) like so~ I think one of them was about like (uh) a guy
who is disabled and he provides like free food to (uh) the needy [lah] basically and (uh) you know they they feature all these individuals but
if I'm not mistaken or maybe you know I did not watch the whole thing but they did not (err) feature
food deliverer (uh) like you know food delivery people riders
so I mean they they they they how to say they lauded like (um) healthcare workers which they should but I guess there are more people out there who deserve
(err) like you know like for example they they do a featu~ they did a feature on like the N_T_U_C (uh) cashiers and the people who who do the stock and replenish
that there was a there was a segment on that but I think there as in like maybe like
[oh] really
[oh] it wasn't cheap
(mmhmm) but I think that
I don't know as in like the I think that like like a lot of other industries is very temporary it's a very I won't say is not a long term job but it's a very
(um) you know as in like to bridge the income gap between the low in I mean like the low income and the people who are earning more than them
and the fact is that a lot of people fall between
like the lines of they are how do you say this they are like (um) not considered
how do you say this I need to gather my thoughts cause it's like (err) very it's a very sensitive not not exactly very sensitive but it's like it's something that I put quite
in your head then after that suddenly is like you when you come when you try to like say it out then it turns out like bullshit so ya
[eh] what
but in order to in order to get
(mm)
but like no but as in like don't you have to don't you have to as in like that Grab takes a good load of commission like
cut from like for example if you earn hundred dollars right I if I'm not mistaken like Grab takes about
you were the one who digressed
don't blame me for that
not bad but you know what usually we talk for longer is like we'll sit there for hours talking about nothing
being recorded feels very strange
ya more seventy days seventy something days my friend
right school
so like school as usually I have to go back to school a few times a week right and then after that (um) like
(err) the the the the whole thing about like the virus like spreading (err) (um) like how do you say the community cases in in in Singapore started increasing
(err) our like everytime we have to go and take temperature and then we have to stick that stupid sticker wherever on like you know our body or whatever and half the time it's like stuck
on my card holder and then after that is like you go to school and then that is like there's so much uncertainty
then like we all thinking [lah] like [eh] so how [ah] you think that next year [ah] no sorry next sem which is like in a month (um)
we will do it at home or what because it's like a lot of other schools already are are are doing like home like
so so (um)
(err) we we were like somehow like quite happy that (uh) we managed to no no actually we received an email saying that okay we're going to test out like you know Zoom
then (err) then we we tested out the Zoom (err) interface then it of like sucked [lah] because it's like you know Zoom and then with all the security issues and everything
then (err) we had exams
what is that module I took I forgot [oh] (uh) it's a wellbeing module so basically right in an actual exam is like a set format and then after that in like
so basically we were stuck at home so (err) like the school has to think about something
for like all those four years I never had an online exam before so ya very interesting so we we we sat at home
and then we we did our exam pass everything then after that we continued the new semester and this time was like online
it's open book as line like they know okay wait there's this one let me like
so this open task (err) is like
a forty eight hour it opens like (uh) forty eight hour window so from like for example right now is one thirty right
and then (err) it opens at one thirty then after that is like you you do you can do the the exam at anytime and then after that it's like (err) by one thirty A_M on
let me see Saturday it will close and then there's another one where it's time
because number one where in the world are you gonna find someone to do that time exam for you and number two I think you are more
you are more focused on looking for the answers then go and find someone to do the exam for you come on [lah]
okay
maybe people do that maybe people do that but
for me [ah] I personally I rather do myself [ah] because I know I can do it
it was basically an assignment so was like like three assignments put together and then it was like based on ten marks like ten marks each can you imagine it's a P_R assignment so basically I had to do (err)
P_R stuff !hais! like I prepared F_A_Q questions prepare prepare press release and also a speech
and I have to do that all and all of them are ten ten marks only then I was like
usually it's twenty five marks and I spend like more than two days doing one assignment then after that like this exam you have to sit down and do this shit for forty eight hours I cannot
deal but I finished it in like less
I did I did it was fine
well you know do you know
well you know why I went back to school anyways is not because I want I mean isn't that at some point in my life I want to [lah] as in like you know when I left
when I left (err) when I graduated from poly I did go to school after that but obviously after like what how many years
[eh] thirteen thirteen ya after thirteen years of like education straight and I wasn't exactly doing very well in school also cause I was so fucking playful [ah] sorry
I was so damn playful and then like and then
and then after that it's like I can't I don't think I could have like continued my studies then so I went out to work [lah]
I decided to go back to school to get that degree and [oh] my god the characters I have to deal with
is like is like
there have
I do not no I really
(mmhmm)
(ugh) I'm doing a media and communications course so definitely there is project I mean like whatever that I'm doing now is no different than what I was doing
eight years ago holy shit it was eight years ago ya eight years ago when I was in poly except that during poly it was a more intensive
like not intensive like what we learned there was extensive [lah] I really enjoyed my poly life even though I kind of like played around a lot
and that like my dad told me that you know don't don't
don't mess it up [lah] you mess it up once and then after that is like if you mess it up again I don't know what to say about you
and also the fact that I have a support from my boyfriend obviously and that he is very intent on seeing me get the (err) that that degree
and so it kind of like motivates me a little and it helps that that because it's like I am more focus I guess I mean like you know like kids right
I totally get it [lah] okay like my my classmates [ah] my my my friends are all like twenty twenty one years old and then there's this girl
the report was about one thousand five hundred words and we have to write it together can you imagine
so because I know what she's capable of and she's so distracted and besides I have nothing better to do in my life [kan]
and
if she has the effort to prepare the twenty three birthday presents you can bloody well do your assignment you know
tell me about it the fact that she can afford twenty three birthday presents and they are of varying price tags really intrigued me
[eh]
I really I really salute them for that because I cannot do that
I
no man I like my sleep I enjoy my sleep and you know sometimes okay [lah] I I don't think my my (err) my lecturer's gonna hear this I'm just going to say it like you know because we are on
in the morning and then after that you are on I'm still on my bed and then I'll be like listening to a lecture
and then it's like this particular lecture (uh) eleven (uh) sorry in on Monday mornings is just a drag cause it's like she constantly wants
it's it's kind of like the same routine
so basically I know from nine to nine thirty at least I can get like an extra shut eye then nine thirty she will break us into one group which means that I have to turn on my mic and talk
and then !huh!
shut up ya anyway so I mean like I'll get up to do my work and then after that it's like by the time (err) by the time it's
ten o'clock ten thirty I will be like more refreshed to actually you know participate in the class ya so apparently I'm not the only one who does that [lah] so sometimes like and I I I mean like I am
for some reason like that class I made a lot of friends and we don't see each other on (err) in real life you know we haven't seen I haven't haven't see my classmates most of them this
actually this sounds like internet the internet games we used to play as children
that
yes it is a word I think
I'm the complete opposite of you like I really enjoyed circuit breaker time it's like
ya you spend more money on that shit then you sit at home and the snacks is there so I sit at home
yes
well no as in like the fact is that you know during the whole circuit breaker time I only ordered in food
four times ya but basically
ya
for free [eh] (uh huh)
(mm)
no because
no no no like period~ like periodically right periodically (um) (err) Grab host like have this like (err) promo like not promo ya promotions where they offer (um) a monthly subscription of like
six dollars or something and then [oh] no sorry the most recent one I think was thirty dollars and then you have like an offset of like
(uh) the four dollars delivery charge for four dollars off delivery charge or something so during the circuit breaker right
none of this shit was like available because obviously people a lot of people are gonna stay home right and they're gonna order food so (err) ya
and then (err) so isn't like basically is this was this (uh) service available on (err) Foodpanda even like during the circuit breaker
of course [lah] because now everybody can go out already [what]
ya true but people cook
yup my boyfriend gets to stay at home for the next four months
ya no know you know #Nurul# is (err) #Nurul# has been working her butt off all through circuit breaker until now
ya
if Russia if Russia produced I mean if that vaccine claim by Russia is proven effective then maybe we have
we wait wait shorter [lah] there goes my Korea trip at the end of the year
we will see whether it works or not but ya like I said let me reiterate this point I said that I'm going to misses I'm gonna have to cancel my trip at the end of the year
how many vacations did you go on this year
I went three times okay minus the fact that I came back from #Doha#
ya but February we are still gooing out to Japan and then after that is like
ya
I think we went to [oh] ya we went we went to J_B once in March
no no no no I can't remember when (err) no it wasn't it was before way before like the part
I think it was one week before Singapore said that whoever who left overseas have to go undergo like quarantine or whatever
Fernando
I know but he she he was so antsy to leave the house like whatever it takes
I swear to god but whatever is it up I think it's up
okay three more minutes of talking shit
wait
you are not young anymore you know this is not like ten years ago
this is not ten years ago already okay hello I remembered when we were it was ten years ago we we used to sit
like for hours doing nothing and doing crap on on internet
ya [oh] shut up
ya I'm I'm going for a class that I'm paying for so thank you very much and it's my holidays now so I'm chilling
whatever

technically
I complete four hundred hours [lah] around wednesday but I stretch over
I took half day half day
[ah]
ya !alamak!
(mm) two and a half months around there
ya ya I just need to complete four hundred hours
like was just getting into like the hang of it then after that like
#kobe#
I don't know
(uh) it's not project (um) it's just basically more case management
what I did [lah] for my previous job
we do [lah] same around the same [lah] it's more intense cause
(err) it's residential areas so it residential institut~ not institution [lah]
[ah]
I don't know if I want to say
okay [lah]
I don't know
the (um) from the office my my office there [lah] so
[ah]
so he decide and he he decided he wanted to try out I think corporate world so leave it be [lah]
ya
I think so
I think so not too sure
okay [lah]
but ya
finally somewhere I go is near my house
like at least at least [ah] fifty minutes travel
that's so sad
(um) not
I apply right then I turn up at the interview
then they ask me a lot of questions then it felt like an interview
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya ya no issues [lah] ya I think
I would say that she overrides him
ya ya I know
(err) [oh] last time
(err) the assistant director did this (err) blah blah blah and then she always say if I need help can come and ask [ah] then
(um) ya you can just give the money just collect the receipt and then log it in [lah]
ya
then I was like but the chat I thought the chat is also meant to be used internally
(mm)
I guess so good and bad [lah]
like what is it there's no bad impact [lah] on the client at the end of the day [ah]
like ya but
but at different locations [ah] under different program
(mm) (mm)
I think
in the social service ya
[ah] then it's also under A_I_C so previously my previous job (um) they are the funders ya
so (err)
how to say
(err) fast and (err) presentable results
that's your M_P
it's considered private affairs [what] (uh)
so in the end you have to get consent from them
they cannot
then
ya and then ya that's why
emotions and what happen during their period of time and usually christmas chinese new year spend with family right usually is like a big major events for them
ya
ya correct correct
ya
supposed to
supposed to ya
(uh) no no
(um) you have to record down [ah]
and I was like
I don't know I I think I'm not suited for F_S_C at all
so it sounds a bit
like case management same thing but for youths so then [ah]
so then I ya so then I was like asking so what's the difference [lah] because last time like this kind of services still the same and
I mean it's duplicated in different services and then second of all is that it's just basically you asking the
(uh) people I think can't remember where
[ah] so I don't know [lah] what's going on
(uh) ya so
as as long as the place is position is empty [lah]
ya cause I just
(uh) like
I just like finished my practicum I just like submitted my last assignment
ya
and then in two weeks time I have like exams which I like I haven't even started studying
ya ya
no no no no it's okay it's okay (uh)
my line is very small I don't know if it's clear or not but I'm holding the the the the mic ya near to my mouth but sometimes I move [lah]
so cute
so maybe when I take a break from studying [lah] I start applying for a jobs
that's so sad
(um)

I think there might be some tension
ya
(mm)
ya [ah] ya
one person stay at home like you still need that double income somehow
ya
is (uh)
babysitters so
ya so
ya
ya
ya
I know
four months four months
(mm)
(mm)
you send the kid to play group [lah] then even then even then it's not full time you but not sure [lah] ya so do you want to work part time and then
I think ya
okay
okay ya
we're good
[ah] [eh] [eh]
[eh] bro school is [eh] I hate school
school S_I_T can go suck dick I'm telling you
okay [eh] I got one website for
for this one module okay I've five modules [lah]
so I have my student portal that's one website
okay [ah] then I got one website for my
(uh) module submission for another module
I have one website for this other module submission
ya
it's okay so one of the one of the websites [kan] is for
like this community discussion
okay and
like communi~ you know you know
amongst the students [lah]
ya so you know how
if you have physical lectures right at least you can ask on your left on your right
okay like [eh] this one how this [one] how
you know then after that this community discussion is basically to replace that [lah] to replace
it's like a forum
ya then after that there's like (um) there's
there's weightages going into it so this
for example this community forum okay
I have like it's like ten percent of my total grades
for example like that then I have to ya then I have to meet like
a quota every week
ya so they force us to interact so I ask around some random stupid questions [ah]
it's just
it's just we're forced to meet that quota [lah]
and you know that you know that because it's online there's so many limitations
and and it is so
it's nothing can beat [lah] having a lecture or hav~ having school in person because online is just so ineffective where
ask even the professor [lah]
in person and the professors
they can explain better in person cause they have a white board
but if you use Zoom
they cannot really explain everything effectively [what]
seriously it's so ineffective then I'm
I sp~ I like stay up until like two A M almost everyday [sia] just to do work
(mmhmm) ya
ya
but
not not on the first week [lah] like almost all lectures I have
this one lecture I have this one module for example
where the professor would just talk about
this one concept right
and they would just bro~ like touch and go like that
they don't even talk about it in detail
then after that they expect us to know everything
for example [ah] python (err) you kn~ there's this [one]
[ah] ya python programming
so there's this one thing where you can use a system argument to
ask the user to input as opposed to
using an input [ah] input forma~ format [lah]
so the the professor didn't even talk about it he just talked about it for like two minutes
and then he expect
he expect us to know how to do it for the first assignment
like
he expected us to know how to do it for our first assignment even though he just touched on it for like five minutes
that's that is so terrible
that that is so bad
it's it's just so bad [ah] like and then
I don't know like even the other day
(err) I have this other module okay
[ah] it's basically I'm learning about digital electronics [lah]
I I got some friends [lah] I got some friends here and there
then the other day I tea~ I taught two of them I only took
two hours to teach them I think less than two hours
and they already understood everything whereas the professor took like a few
[ah] like an hour to explain things and no one actually really understood what he was trying to teach
so it was quite bad [lah] because if you compare poly with uni right
poly is
you know you know how you have like one whole week or even like R_P you have one whole day
to learn this one concept right
but uni un~ my uni right my one
my one lecture is like three concepts in two hours
just uni things [eh]
ya and
ya and honestly I didn't expect that it would be that way
because I thought that
when people say S_U_S_S Singapore university of self study [eh]
okay like that's what people say [lah] my friend also say that he's in S_U_S_S
and then after that I'm like okay [lah] maybe S_U_S_S is terrible [lah]
but then when I come to S_I_T I expected them to at least
guide us through the way but
they don't really they don't really do that
I don't know [ah] to me it's it's it's just nonsense [ah]
and the gap the the gap
between uni and poly is just too big it took me like I think
two three weeks to actually properly settle in to the lifestyle
like like doing work doing work until like two A_M
(err) asking asking around people who
for things and they also don't know how to do it essentially
and just
in uni I have to constantly stay up until two A_M just to finish up my work
not even not even finish up [ah] just to do it
then it's just like it's just so I don't know
this is just too crazy [lah] honestly it's just too crazy
ya ya
was seriously too drastic but one good thing is the people there are are decent [lah]
N_T_U N_U_S this type of high
(um) really high highly regard uni right
they the students there are very snake you know they're very competitive they're very snake they not brother [one] [ah]
they really not brother [one] but S_I~ but S_I_T right at least it's they quite brother [lah] because
(err) and I found out most of them are around my same age
where like twenty three twenty four twenty two I have never met a person who is actually younger than twenty [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] your age [lah] but what I'm saying is
wait what's your age what's your age
ya I've never met anyone below twenty [eh]
ya I [eh]
ya ya (uh) everyone there is from like I_T_E or from poly
wait [eh] hang on [eh]
ya [ah]
[ah] okay
but
[oh] part time uni
(err) (um)
[oh] honestly the
I don't think S_U_S_S even is a
I don't know S_U_S_S is a good choice or not I got fr~ I got two friends in S_U_S_S
and they say they're constantly being barraged with work [lah]
there's things to do here and there
ya I think S_I_T is mainly for people from like I_T_E from poly the more #rilek# ones [lah] the [one] the not so snake [one]
ya
but I but ya
a few accounts what
ya ya ya
which is ten percent of my grades
ya it's an it's an online it's an online test [lah] [eh] no it's a
test from home
but I'm this browser that you know how R_P you got this browser you cannot
access internet you cannot alternate tab all this right
ya ya ya something like that
ya so ye~ so my S_I_T they got this lockdown browser where they
where they shut down [eh] where they block on all the other screens except for your main screen
and they [ah]
they force they shut things down like
your Telegram
like Discord Steam all they force shut down then you cannot access them
ya [lah]
stewing from that [lah]
ya is it is a browser [lah] on the computer
ya the then
ya well ya
ya
I think I no I'm I need to have I need to have internet connection to have the test [lah]
but I cannot access anything else
ya but I need internet connection because it's a test [what]
so they [ah] and then after that the test got webcam [ah]
I need to on the webcam
so so you can use you can use laptop or you can use your own webcam [ah] either one
if you use laptop then after that you just use your normal laptop your laptop for school already got webcam [what]
ya ya ya (um) the one of the professors actually do that
using her phone for a webcam for like writing things down because maths
and maths how can you teach maths without actually writing things down right
ya
by the way
you have a report ya [ah]
cause
ya then yesterday I spent like the
I think I spent like two hours writing on just like a few paragraphs of my report because I've never actually I have done a report in poly
but report in poly and report in uni is you know the standards are different
(err) like you actually have to put in some effort
for a report in uni
I mean
but
would uni I actually have to write I had like ten tabs open just
for
(um) just for this report section
ya [lah] I'm but as in what I'm saying is thatthe the step from poly to uni is very drastic you know
I got one friend who is taking this module as me
then you know he's just panicking [ah]
(mm) trimester
[ah] so but then for the first year
[ah]
okay so it's very weird
when the other day when I was comparing I was talking I was telling I was talking about this with my friends the other day it was super weird
so you know how in N_U_S or even in R_P you had
thirteen weeks in one semester
right
and then after that my trimester you'd would expect because I have three trimesters in one year right you would expect it to be like okay [lah] maybe
lesser lesser weeks right lesser weeks because yo~ because trimester you have three terms as compared to two terms
right
so you would expect like okay [ah] trimester but then [eh] my trimester
thirteen weeks also [eh] then I see N_U_S [eh] their semester
what did I sign up for my my S_I_T I got three terms each term is thirteen weeks
N_U_S got two terms each term is thirteen weeks also like what
ya my break time is small [lah]
but it doesn't it doesn't defeat the fact that
my one term is the same as other university's one term eventhough I'm trimester based you know
ya
no [lah] (err) ya [lah] ya [lah]
serious I didn't I didn't expect it to be
I didn't expect it to I have to put in so much effort you know
like (mm)
ya like my sisters were like !wah! #koi# #koi# run
utterly hardworking [eh] and I'm like no [lah] I just unfortunately I have to be a hardworking [lah]
I also don't want to be hardworking but
you know unfortunately I have to be
it's just unfortunately I have to be
[eh] but you're applying for uni you you're applying for uni or are you going to apply for uni
what was your G_P_A
(mmhmm)
I think I think march close I think march close
so you did online interview
why ho~ how did you screw up

everyone's volume is (err) everyone's work is high volume [lah] basically
[ah]
okay

(mmhmm) (mmhmm)

(um) information security
(mmhmm) ya with honours
wait how can you apply for only two courses they asked for like six seven courses [what]
!huh! seriously

(uh huh)
you thought portfolio was C_V

[ah] okay
(mm)
okay
okay
(mmhmm)
interest
ya like a reference [lah]
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
ya
what was the what was the second course
what was
ya
no that was no the [one] that with the portfolio what was it
(mm) [oh] okay okay
not bad [lah] [ah] [sia] [lah] if only (hmm) if only you were
ya I know right then you'll be stressing out like me also
(uh huh) ya
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[oh]
I I applied for S_I_T on (err) twenty seventeen [eh] no twenty eighteen or twenty nineteen
[eh]
ya but then the thing is (um)
I applied too late like I applied in march also
so I was too late for the for everything so (uh) there was no slots for me [lah]
then on the twenty nineteen I applied again and then they asked for a video interview
and then after that the video interview then got the
mass interview like a group interview
ya ya ya but the gr~ video interview I got tell you or not the story before
[ah]
they were like okay so the video in~ they were giving me instructions [lah] it was like [oh] video interview is prerecorded
so that means it's not live
questions
then they send it over to me
then
ya ya
yes yes ya that type of thing [ah]
ya so the other day right (um) I I had that [lah]
and then after that [one] of the questions I can remember I two of the questions I cannot remember one of the questions was like
(err) out of all the modules
out of the out of all the modules in the module list right
what modules do you like the most and I'm like [oh] shit
while during the interview while during the thirty seconds break in between questions right
I realised that there's this this this [lah] and have done
this this this in the past and also (uh) I have some experience with it okay next question
(err) what modules do you like the least then after that I I reply in this exact same way
looking through the module list (err) I realised that there's maths [lah]
I I'm I'm okay with maths I'm I I did well for maths
but I don't like maths [lah] that's how I replied you know in the interview
and I managed to get through the through the video interview and into the group interview [lah]
ya so the group interview it was like stage two right
so the group interview (um) it was (err)
the group interview was like I thought it was like one group by one group
okay then after that they brought us out to this (err) to this like before this room after registering
then after that I'm like [ah] then I was talking with my group my [lah] then I was like [eh]
if it's a group interview how come we're all over here [sia] going inside this one room is it a mass interview
don't know [ah] maybe [ah]
then they're like okay so this is the
this this is the like the contents okay this is the problem
I want you all to you you all got thirty minutes I want you all to work on this
and by the end of the thirty minutes you are to present a
maximum hundred eighty second video presentation using your phone
okay if there's nothing else that's all you just can go home !huh!
ya and then like [ah] okay that's all I was like [ah] okay I expected something a bit more difficult [lah]
then after that like ya we'll then you can go then we'll send you the (uh) the email
saying whether you have passed or not [lah] like next week
okay so I I expected seven days from now [lah]
(mm) okay then on the seventh day from the interview I was like [eh] shit I never received any email [sia]
[ah] [ah] okay because S_I_T right
S_I_T is they want to build it such that
you are working in a team
right so
that's why the gr~ group interview
is is mass as a group interview but then they want to see how well you work in a team
how your how well you work in a team
how you would communicate with people how you work with people from different backgrounds
with people that you don't know
so S_I_T is mainly built on top of that
of how you
it's a very team effort [lah]
so I I guess they evaluate as to how we
were acting in a team okay then after that how well we do our things our
video interview [eh] our video presentation how was it
all all that thing [lah]
ya that's that's how I did it [lah] I don't know maybe because
but then last year
there wasn't be any COVID yet right
ya so I don't know maybe maybe because you applied too late [lah] honestly
no no no
okay
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] so you are saying that like
so is that what you're trying to say
[oh] okay [lah]
(mmhmm)
[ah] okay
okay
(mm) but what type of jobs are you applying for that's the question
okay
(mm) ya
no but all these all these honestly right all these like
they ask for like two three years of experience right
okay
(uh huh)
(uh) (err) ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] like prorated kind of thing [ah]
ya ya ya okay

(err) okay [lah] for me I didn't have to [lah]
(hmm)
okay
(err) sometimes [ah] ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)

you know what I'm saying is like like for example
like for example dealing with your life [lah] you don't have to deal with a lot of life things that are out~ that are outside of the S_A_F [what]
just have to deal with S_A_F okay and then the rest of the time just flies
that is still under S_A_F [lah] hello

(mmhmm)
[eh] [eh]
!oi! don't like that [lah]
ya [loh] then I don't know I just then (uh) the other day my I met up with my my officer from my unit
ya [lah] then because he also I have to meet him soon because
to me it's unheard of [ah] okay when you an N_S_F okay then after that when you want to O_R_D
[eh] ultraboost is for casual this [one] is for running
eventhough I have no time to run unfortunately
no it's not that I have no time seriously you know I wa~ I doing work
right you know I the other day I spent three almost four hours right
trying to troubleshoot this one python bug okay I had this code
okay and what it's supposed to do is I take in a bunch of inputs
okay with a commas in between so for example twelve comma
two comma eight for example that's my input then what it would do is that it would
do some stupid calculation [lah] so I had this [ah]
I had this lake concept method the other time
and (err) I will I couldn't get it to work [lah] even though the concept was there
the idea was there but I couldn't get it to work so I asked my friends
then they tried they tried my concept I two of them tried my concept and both of them can get it to work
can get it to work you know but I cannot get it to work even though they have the same idea as me
the problem was because my input no it's okay syntax [lah]
it was supposed to be twelve comma two comma eight right I put twelve comma
space two comma space eight
because because of that space right it costed me three four hours you know
[sia] [lah]
they're showing that there's a my string cannot be converted into an integer
because bec~ then after that they said it cannot be converted into an integer of the input twelve comma
so it takes up it takes in twelve with the comma so of course [lah] comma cannot be converted into an integer
ya
two thirty A_M
no [lah] my friends they don't mind me leaving the house
but
that type of thing you know

how about no I should get rid of the person instead of my cats my cats has been longer okay
are staying longer at my place
but just two cats [lah]
but
some people have like six
seven cats you know
I saw that coming from a mile away
!huh! ya [lah] basically #jurong#
people are weird I understand I get that a lot
okay they always say #jurong# people are weird
I I have to admit [ah] because down here there's a lot of crime that
steal underwear kind
(um) okay cool I didn't know our area got a lot of
weird people
I
I like nowadays I don't
ya
ya
#jurong# shady [ah] #jurong#
especially the west side
country
there's a lot of (uh) there's not much of commercialised building it's more of (uh)
industrial building
so a lot of (um)
foreigners there [lah]
a lot of foreigners there that do not follow the law
in terms of police or anything
no no
I don't like that although it's quite quiet at my area there's no traffic there's no noise from
you know M_R_T or vehicles
but
you will be scared [lah] because
(uh) all around us there are people
especially
guys because we we're we're told you know that my area our area there a high crime rate
and most of it is consisting of molestation (um)
those (um) touch and run away kind
thief you
when you're not looking or some of them will just follow you back home
I have many cases where I was followed back home like from my house [kan]
I take I walk from pioneer M_R_T
it's like a ten minute duration
so while I'm walking back home
like I feel that (uh) people you know walking behind me
ya
there are people walking behind me but then
after a while you notice that they are following you or you know (uh)
they even take he even took the same lift as me
(uh)
you know this watch group
basically they watch group
ya
events kind of stuff you know so there's any crime or anything they will also know [lah]
so I told them about that then they raised it up to the C_C
the C_C members and then the C_C members said that ya a lot of people have been complaining about this guy who has been following people home
weirdly enough
creepy
what
I
I would confront them but
I'm a very small person
more daring
you are more daring
ya
fight [ah] come [ah] fight [ah]
ya
ya #ang mo kio#
ya got industrial places [what] there
(uh huh)
ya I get you
if you know what it's always like that though
I would rather
#tanjong pagar# still not bad [what]
#tanjong pagar# still not bad I feel like around cause my
at city hall
around there
I cannot [ah] I just for me I feel I get
anxious over crowds
so I'm not a crowd person
I I cannot deal with big groups
I prefer to
stay clear away from that
so #jurong# staying at #jurong# west is quite fitting for me [lah] you know in that sense because
nobody exactly lives in #jurong# west
some more it's the last few stops so
there's not much people in the M_R_T
ya it's it's too quiet it's really quiet it's it's quiet to the
okay [lah] I mean it depends [lah]
#jurong# east also considered C_B_D area but then
what's that area called [ah] you know #hua yi# there I forgot what is it called but ya
there are areas where
it's not far it's not really far away from the M_R_T
but it's also not close to any

we went (uh) we just walk around and we talk and I thought it was going so good but the thing is
I thought it was going so good but then after we went our separate ways I saw that he block me on every single social media platform and even my number
I have no idea [leh] it wa~ it was going so well or at least I thought it was going so well I made jokes he laugh he made jokes I laugh
and then after that I couldn't contact him at all you know that's the thing because after that date right usually after every outing I would say thank you [ah]

(mmhmm)
[ah] okay
but I'm also specific about whether they are [eh] yes man or no man you know sometimes guys can be like
[ah] ya ya ya do whatever you want or like [eh] no way cannot do that just because you are my girlfriend you can't do that and stuff like that I don't want like that [ah] I want
okay to make it simple I just like someone who
won't restrict me from doing the right things in life or at least things that will do me good but at at the same time I want a person who can correct me
like if I do any mistakes they won't just let me go off just like that
just because I'm their girlfriend and don't want to correct me like for example
ya I want that type of person it will be so sweet
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya that's true how about your boyfriend is he on the nice side or is he on the mean side
is he mean to me [ah]
that that sounds so wrong [eh]
that's sounds okay okay anyway ya it's very hard to find these sort of nice but not too nice guy I know a lot of man who would say
[oh] this girl is too picky for saying like that if I see these online and then I'm like what the hell do you want to fight me that's like the most basic thing a guy could do for a girl [leh]
don't you think so
ya
do you think you and your boyfriend got lucky I always feel like that not lucky [pe] [seh] but like that time in I_T_E
he went by chance someone said for you to look into his eyes and for him to look into your eyes are like !wahseh! so cute
!huh! really
[ah]
[oh] my god are you serious
ya !huh!
ya
(uh huh)
maybe maybe he was acting cool you know like those big macho guys like [oh] my god girl loves me they say the inside themselves
but then you know but then on the inside there also like what the heck this girl likes me she's crazy
(uh huh)
what [lah] this boy this what you was talking to his ex when he kind of likes you and then after he is with you then the ex wants to right wasn't that the story
(mmhmm)
ya
[ah]
ya
[oh] my god so she was playing hard to get is it
you know I've heard a lot of stories about this you know let me tell you one so I have this friend !huh!
(um)
basically same story as you he was with this girl but then they broke up okay they already separate [ah]
they ya they already separate then suddenly when the guy wants to be with another girl suddenly the ex girlfriend came running back
why you are you with girl why you with this girl blah blah blah blah then I was like what [seh] this !huh!
when he told me the story I was so confused wasn't she not with him anymore and the thing is right she broke up with him ya ya ya ya
!wah!
okay like ya after that (um) once I got to know the story of course I cannot confront her right because I not I not in their relationship [what]
and but the thing is I don't know how
I got roped into this drama and somehow the girl thought the guy was cheating on her with me
ya ya that's true
because we did we did clarify it with them
the girlfriend [lah] I'm not I'm not so sure what's happening with her but
ya
ya you you used to hate her so much [eh] I I found that so funny
turntables or the table turn
I wanted to watch the office but I don't have the V_P_N

at (mmhmm)
[eh] (mmhmm)
!woo! spicy tell me
[ah]
yes
(mmhmm)
alright
ya
(mmhmm)
what
I feel like every time we are at the workplace or something especially if we're at an intern level or like those lowest [ah] of all candidates
we would always get told to do one thing [eh] we get to do one thing and then suddenly when we do that thing suddenly someone else say [eh] don't do it don't do that [leh] like
isn't that the job of another person or something like that then they make us go round and round and around and then I don't know we we will get scolded for it in the end
ya that happened to me also at my workplace (err)
(mmhmm)
yes work from home
ya
yes yes
ya
(uh huh)
or home or whatever we will we will bound to use it and when we use it of course you have to use it at an optimum speed [pe]

does she know know not that I know but I feel like I want to find someone for her someone special
I have no idea but you know [lah] like any of our friends who aren't judgmental
I would feel so happy for her too she's so patient with us and I feel like she would be even more patient with her husband or spouse or whatever they call that
ya but at the same time I want to find someone for her but I feel like most of my friends aren't good enough for her [leh] it's ya do you have anyone in mind for her
I know you don't have a lot of friends
what do you have
but do you have anyone in mind maybe your cousin your your your boyfriend's friend

(mm) (mm)
U_S elections I
[oh] I don't really care too much about it but I do stay up to date sometimes what about it
(hmm)
ya correct correct and the thing is I feel like (um) to them right voting is just
it's just
something to do and then if it's funny they feel like they should do it which is so weird because in singapore we have this election thing we have to choose and then we are actually serious about it like or we have this good points and bad points
ya (uh huh)
ya [oh] ya
but but the thing is like maybe their country is
of course [lah] their country is super big it's bigger than singapore of course it will be harder to maintain right then I guess [lah] it's
it's harder for them to keep track of the votes and I I also think that most of them are like or I don't want to get involved in politics so I don't want to vote for anyone you get what I mean
ya correct correct but
nowadays [kan] everyone is sensitive about everything you you know that
I I saw I saw these two video [ah] it's like satire and then it's basically [ah]
showing that people nowadays almost every single thing you have to be offended about it if you don't feel the same way
no no no please explain

but no offence to this culture blah blah blah ya you know ya okay I feel like I understand the meaning of woke culture now is it like a also something like let's say you were defending woman

A two
[oh] unbelievable [oh] (uh) (uh) ya
#alhamdulillah#
that's true ya okay what is the most fun aspect or memory about I_T_E that you have
ya ya
that's true
ya ya ya ya
they do ya they do care about us until now they do care about us
ya it is not an obligation to them right for them it's just a natural thing to do
[oh] my god I knew that [mah] ya
okay
okay like you already recall right these fun times you or like those non-judgmental times you had in I_T_E and we will remember this is the most non-judgmental thing you remember or not we were in I_T_E and then (um)
basically the girls can put colours in their hair they can
[ah] I don't know dress [ah] wear like outstanding jackets and then the guys would taper their pants I don't know in in those little ways it just shows their
their how to say [ah] their creativity their expressions and [oh] my god that's so good
ya
yes
miss judy and mister #farhan# to be honest
yes we really didn't like them
ya but I get you we we didn't really like them because I I have no idea I guess we weren't used to people being harsh to us we were still babies you know we were from secondary school and stuff like that
and ya and ya basically we didn't get to be scolded most of the time so once we got scolded by them
we we felt attacked in a way
(um) yes
is this relatable woman she you remember when she said that she would drink with most as we some of the seniors like after they graduate of course at the right age remember that drinking isn't responsible before the right age
ya (mmhmm)
I_T_E was ya one of the best times of my life though
yes ya
(uh huh)
(err)
it's okay it's fine
(mmhmm)
[ah] [oh] [oh] my god
it's the sisterly affection [oh] like [oh] my god that made me recall something
ya
miss really I am not lesbian I have nothing against lesbian I like girls but as at a certain there's a limit to it I like boys I really liked boys thank you for your concern
I think I think mister alan was the one who told her because (um) our first lesson for that day we was with mister alan ya ya I guess okay I I guess I put myself up to it [ah] cause my sleeves was wore right and the blood was like dripping but I cannot do anything over it if
no the thing is if I wanted to fix my scarf right I would be late for school and you know instead of being late for
school I'd rather go [ah] go to school on time and let myself bleed to death that's a natural thing to do
[oh] my god you believe that story how [lah] correct correct okay
I
everyone knows that story was fake lady
[oh]
okay let me tell you [ah] the the real story was that I was fighting with my cats
I was fighting with my cats because they were fighting each other I naturally put my hand there right ya it's why cat
I'm not lying to you now I only lied to you two to three years ago but everyone knows that was a fake story okay everyone knows
okay ya so I was I was there [ah] and you you know you always talk to your cats right ya I always talk to my cats like the humans so I'm like
stop it [lah] what the hell stop stop stop stop stop then I put my hand in between them then one of them
[oh] got caught caught or
what is it what is it called they they hook my hand basically they wrap themselves around my hand then they kick then they bite also then my hand started bleeding [ah]
because they follow the owner I'm their owner so if I'm aggressive I'm an aggressive person ya aggressive also but they are sweet too so which means I'm sweet [ah]
then ya so basically I put my hand to between them and then they scratched me and I cannot do anything about it I'll just
decided or I'll just wash a bit then I go to school [lah] I go to school then mister alan thought I was suicidal weak weak
mister alan did have you seen this snapchat picture I I merge his face with mine
no no no no as in you know snapchat we could merge our face I put my face with his face right
it was the perfect match I look like mister alan in a young girl's body and I felt
weird later I will send you ya okay to sum sum it all up I guess I_T_E !woo! poly !aww!
I feel like ya I feel like going back right I had I don't know
I want to kit from there the kits that are so pretty and so cheap
I I guess so I don't know I guess ya and then but the thing is I feel like we should also move on [lah]
K and K got that
you can put your earpiece back on
so anyway (um) how has your work been
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay
how long was it [eh] the practicum
!huh! so fast
(mm)
[oh] ya okay ya ya ya no no (err) what was I
suddenly
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] no
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya that that's why
ya
ya [oh] so
they offered you full time is it
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
that's good that's refreshing
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya that's (mm) awkward
(mm)
(mm)
go and at least resolve it internally
ya ya that's why
(mm)
wait that that that's a good thing [kan] or
(mm)
(mm)
ya
[oh] okay
or people with experience [lah] so they don't have to train so much
independent
(mm)
I see
ya
(mm) LOL
ya
ya that's true
[oh] that's a lot
that's why #siao#
(mm)
ya
I mean you mean in a single point at a single point in time you need to have like a hundred cases
like at at any point in time
[oh] so not like say this month I have ten next month I have another ten that's crazy hundred case how do you keep track
[oh]
ya
what I hear from a lot of my social worker friends
so you're not gonna take take up their
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] okay
ya
(mm)
[ah] okay okay
[ah]
I mean I got exam but I don't think that is comparable
am I am I talking too loud like do you do you feel like I'm talking very loud
no right
the phone the mic
ya see when I laugh it kind of
jumps up a bit so like [oh] no sorry whoever's transcribing I'm so sorry okay
that's where I'm at I mean that's not where I'm at I'm kind of past that but ya totally understand
ya
(mm) make sense ya make sense I mean you also still
(mm)
considering a different industry I mean at this point like my previous job was doing what I liked
but like it was
(mm) dream job kind of like like it had all the characteristics of what I wanted to do like child psychology in (uh) you know in a clinic setting in a clinical setting and everything and then I got to like
you know do creative things do research still and like do projects and stuff but at the end of the day like it was a horrible time
(mm) it's been good I am teaching
eventually when I'm no longer a trainee I will we will alternate like one will be lead one will be co-lead so the lead will be the one going through the activity and then after the activity is done
(um) switch [lah] so then the other the co-lead will be the lead so the co-lead basically what we do is we just look at everyone make sure nobody's like sleeping or like playing with the virtual background or like
there was a kid last week who kept pressing the clapping and the raise hand button and I was like [oh] my god
doing that thank you kind of thing and it doesn't come naturally to me [lah] cause I I I have a habit of being like can you can you (um) (err) I need I'll be like (err) [oh] sit down okay or like (err)
I need you to be quiet okay or like can you be q~ can you be a little quiet actually I'm I'm like okay I can that one they they want me to like not say that okay be more firm because otherwise you know they are they are they are in the comfort of their own home so they feel like they can do whatever they want [lah]
ya and these are young kids like from kindergarten age to like primary school age so
ya it could be a little bit
practice
ya
(mm) be strict first
ya that actually makes sense that's what my mum said also
make sure they are muted got question unmute must mute chat disable then sometimes when you ask for answers for them to type the answer in
you know my period's coming
[tau] like I'm just tired not enough sleep so I just continued but then it continued to
I'm not coming and then turns out that nobody came (uh) okay [lah] like out of the six of us only like four people c~ [eh] two people came ya so that were only like three people including the coach
(mm)
(uh) yes but in that case do you want to go with me I'm going on monday
I think like there's
there's
I'm hoping that !aiya! I can go
did she reply me nope not yet
with whatever hurts or what the issue is
(mm)
[ah] okay
[oh]
I see okay good that I
don't then
(mm)
[oh] then hers is how much
(mm)
(mm)
ya cause I was thinking if I went to see my sports doctor like the doctor that I was seeing when I was playing rugby [kan]
movement she she she's legit like the the one to go to but she's
ya just a lot
ya that's why I'm thinking
so doesn't really need like a doctor
you know I mean I can still move it's not like a herniated disc or anything like that
ya
ya so she also like told me to just
ten ten ten ten ten ten but twenty times
ya so it's like an endurance thing it lasted like forty five minutes it was horrible
(mm)
[oh] that is so
[oh] my god
I cannot imagine I cannot imagine and then like
you know
it's just like (ugh) gross
way lower than you thought
[oh]
(mm) and doesn't like fluctuate too much like like you won't go like super high (mm)
ya ya ya
ya
the first time I heard my voice as in I feel like I sound like a preadolescent boy I kind of feel like I sound like a boy when I listen to it by myself my god I sound like a ten year old boy or something (uh)
cringe
ya I feel like I sound like a kid I think #inhan# sounds not like older than me I feel
I don't know I feel like I sound like a kid I don't I don't sound like like a girl I don't sound like a like a lady or a woman I just sound like a like a like a boy
wider range of
that's true that's true imagine if we start singing you know right now you know
it is raining right now alr~ is any super heavily actually near my house
[oh] mine like stopped just now and now it's started again
ya how does my voice sound like to you like does it is it do you think it's low or high or medium or does does it sound like a boy
just sounds like me [lah] I mean like you heard you heard my v~ okay okay
(mm)
yup yup
it's like from the we are like listening to our voice from the inside I feel I think something like that [lah] it's something like that so rather than but but
but but like say you you are listening to my voice as it passes through like
the air like not [kan] so it's a different ya so
I mean if maybe if we're on the moon we would sound different like so if we were on the moon and we
took off our ma~ our astronaut gear and we started talking we'll probably sound different ya but those few moments before we die if we have conversation we probably would sound completely different
no
chris evans [oh] chris evans I thought cause love love space or elon whatever his name is elon musk
(err) ya ya he wants to capitalise off another yet another thing
I wonder if we can talk about these politics I mean it's not all politics I mean it's not even politics it's just (ugh) celebrity
I guess
is it (mm) I had no idea I thought his late dad left him like buttloads of money
where shall we where shall we go on tuesday
which which interest you the most I feel like the train track ones is cute but then I'm just a bit scary looks a bit scary
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) #ang mo kio# park
so this one is easy cause it's just walking
(mm) ya and then there's
na~ dairy farm nature park
and this one quite
[oh] eco green
like would it be very crowd~ is it a park or is it like a a hiking trail like an actual hiking trail
I know #afiqah# #afiqah# you know she take some nice she goes to some areas you know
actu~
[eh] were you staying at our table
(mm)
she got married (uh) I if I'm not wrong she got married at quite (um) because like (err)
I guess circuit breaker kind of disrupted her plans a little bit and I don't think they wanted they want to shift the date too much so I think the period that she got married in right
(um) they only allow like ten people
(mm) and then she had to wear like a face shield but she bejeweled it [lah] like with her
like with her veil and stuff it was really cute
that she was she's always
talking about
(mm) I don't think so
[oh] is the is the one that her long term the one that always [eh] ya the one that's always been with her I've I think ya and he's really n~ he's really nice really nice so I think
I was talking about someone else
I don't know but ya
(mm)
okay maybe I just don't remember but ya
(mm)
think he's just shy but he's very like supportive of her and everything I think that's really good
nope
think he's younger than her
ya
(um)
I'm not sure I think her place
I think because like when I see her her pictures and stuff she seems to be at home so I think
(mm) makes more sense
[oh]
I don't know like he goes out to work anyway so he's not
I mean unless they are both working [ah] then maybe
I don't know I don't know what I'm saying but ya
what would I know
(mm)
[oh] like the dad is more chill [lah] usually
and also like cult~ it's a culture thing also [lah] like [oh] you some mother-in-laws are not happy if you are working you know they'll expect you to be
ya especially in this day and age and in in living in singapore and stuff
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya I ya
that's true also that's true
ya ya ya ya it's like a double it's like a you expect you say that and on the other hand ya
ya then when when he's at school or she's at school then it makes it you know slightly you have more time [lah] to like (uh) you know when when he's at school we're at work so your kid won't be like left alone and like someone has to take care of him or her
ya that's true
okay I think we're recording
(err) so my name is #Umar# and my conversation partner today is
so
so okay obviously okay I start [eh] so basically (um)
then after that (um) when we heard about this corona virus issue actually I was in #Jakarta# (err) celebrating Chinese new year [lah]
(um) the the the hype so called or the whole issue (err) it it went up and then
it was a paranoia or something but when I came back to Singapore (um) and then I slowly see Singapore move to orange alert and then (um) the whole of Singapore they were taking it very seriously
and (uh) at first I was going to work and slowly (um) you see more and more people
(um) we were eventually taken over by (um) okay [eh] at first it was China [lah] and then second it was Singapore
at first [ah] this is the global ranking towards it got worse in certain countries (uh) in Italy
U_S is the highest [lah] so Singapore although we had our ups and downs but it looks like we are getting better
(err) but that's how I remembered my experience (um) when it first started (err) and how at that point of time I was
let's put it like (um) I wasn't employed anymore (err) after this whole situation so now looking for job [lah]
some authority figure [ah]
you know
I'm just okay
ya she more or less got a big
ya and
I think
and say that (uh) you sorry you didn't intend for this to happen (err)
at least apologize even though you're right even if you think you're right even if you are right just apologize let's say (err) I understand
ridiculous thing that happened during this whole COVID situation that (err) gone viral for no reason
(um)
#Hadi# dresses exactly the same as that guy
so ya no no okay exactly okay so when I see #Hadi# [kan]
last time when he was riding panda Foodpanda he just stop by my place once in a while for smoke or something
that's why I tagged him and a lot of people thought that I was insinuating that that was him
so that was quite funny [ah] but I saw the article [lah] I think Mothership covered this article about him
okay my input is okay first of all
the thing about that whole situation is it's not about him per se but what he symbolizes [kan]
because if you think about it (um) just the fact that during this whole (uh) circuit breaker period and the contributions they did
(err) actually it is it is the symbol you know it it's not just the fact that it's Foodpanda but it's also the fact that
(err) the unsung heroes has to unofficially be there to be recognized
(mm) (mm)
(mm) well I have this opinion about (uh) all these food delivery [ah] so to my understanding [ah]
but (err) food delivery [eh] so I feel that (um) it is a way to bridge the income gap from the lower income to the higher income and here is why okay first of all (um)
and they are blue (err) blue collar workers [kan] so think about this for a second [eh] to be a food delivery rider and all these you don't need qualification you don't need to go for an in~ interview
you don't need to (um) like basically if you apply [kan] most likely you will accept
and you don't need a qualification it doesn't matter whether you N level you're O level you're A level you're university degree masters doesn't matter
you still get treated the same the way that you do things it all depends on your effort
so I thought it's really good if you think about it is a way for (uh) the lower income group to catch up
the chances are a lot of this food delivery a lot of richer people higher income people
they will will be doing this deliveries and then they will passing on the money to the lower income who is most likely doing it [kan] so if you think about it
it's a way for the blue collar workers to get a white collar (err) job salary and it will help bridge the income
also if you think about this one thing I like about (err) food delivery also it requires no interview no experience
and she earns only about thirty six dollars a day [lah] for example on her electric (err) wheelchair and stuff like that delivering food and because
but the fact that she can make that small amount of money no matter how small it is [ah] okay and maybe people might tip her or something I don't know
but the fact is (um) you can it it it can it lets you stand on your own two feet [lah]
relying on people or even when you can't get a job at all maybe you have some sort of special needs or special syndrome food delivery
people hope because there's no need for interview imagine if she is looking to (err)
you know you need to interview but food delivery it doesn't matter whether you have a masters degree you have O level or you are in a wheelchair
so
ya you need to write sheet down together your thoughts but anyway (um) with regards to that (uh) there are some people who are like that as well
and I guess the good thing about this panda thing is it's quite an in~ indiscrimination kind of
(err) (err) employment
your gender stuff like that but in this case also it it it it doesn't discriminate your education level as well
which is something that has a high emphasis [lah] in singapore so whether you are (uh) as mentioned before whether you are
(err) low educated or highly educated you still earn the same it depends on how much work was actually done and when you think about it is it something like
because of so much flexibility in your timing you get to decide [kan]
so the last time there is so much flexibility in this kind of work is a taxi driver so taxi driver I assure you should know my dad is a taxi driver [kan]
so basically the only commitment you need is you go out and then you grab (err) you pick up passenger and then that commitment is between
your (err) (err) picking up the passenger to dropping them off but
here's the thing right so with taxi the commitment is you have to pay for rental hundred dollars a day so
so for this drivers they have to actually make sure they earn at least hundred dollars after they earn the hundred dollars whatever they earn is theirs
meaning to say actually let's say you
chose a bicycle and you really (err) let's say you already have a bicycle [lah] let's say you choose a bicycle and you want to do this delivery
whatever you deliver whatever food panda give you that is exactly what you get in your pocket is much easier to calculate
so it it simplifies a little bit
so you can calculate very easily rather than having to go through the process and it cuts down the stress basically if you decided
and then you already made two deliveries you want to go home you can go home you don't have that stress of
it has that sort of it extended flexibility [ah] and I don't think a lot of Singaporeans see it this way [lah] it's just something I just thought about recently
maybe (err) do a three hour trip (err) three hour or four hour or five six trips
then go home [lah] so you have that extra income cash it go straight to your bank account
(uh) as opposed to waiting at the end of the month that kind of thing you know it's instant so it it it is something that (um) a lot of
the there's a lot of factors why it is such (uh) active (um) kind of employment especially for the lower income (uh) people to help a bridge to the higher income people
well it's not like we have a focus so it's okay
okay I think we will stop for about half an hour so
what
okay
(err) it does
(um) so during the circuit breaker period of [pe] was it two months
I think it was two months
so how how were you coping what were you doing (um) did you
actually even go out at all did you do a lot of food delivery (err) did you meet anyone or
[oh] okay nevermind
but won't they make you have the camera turn on
okay another question what is stopping you from hiring someone to do the exam for you
no [lah] if you have forty eight hours and you know what exam it is you can prep what you don't have to get it within the forty eight hours
you can prep earlier on and say [eh] I'm doing this (err) exam (err) next week
(err) I pay you two hundred dollars [lah] just come to my house you sit in front and then you do for me okay [pe]
seriously
right well characters is something inevitable
brief shallow comparison between school and work I would say that
I think also it depends on school as well [ah] because when I was in uni (uh) (um) a lot of people who went to S_I_M like me [kan] they (err)
towards at the end of the year one big major exam
so in a way you can balance [oh] out you can you know work together and you know maybe you are not the most academically inclined
and it can help make you up it it's a little bit a balance of both but (err)
sometimes (err) if you want things you've got to do it yourself you want to get things done
there is more to life than giving your girlfriend or girlfriend twenty three gifts my goodness save save the money
anyway you are broke so anyway I think the difference between your classmate and you is that you have been at least out in the working world
(err) for a couple of years you actually (um) understand and appreciate what (err) higher academia can bring compared
to your peers (err) in school at the moment [kan] even for myself [kan] if you ask me to go to school now and I were to go to school and (um) if I really want it
I think I would be able to have that kind of motivation because you know what it where where it can bring you
and you know that the results or (uh) it it it you will you more or less know what will happen if you don't do well you more or less know what happen when you do well
so for them they don't know they don't know exactly what they are the consequences of not
getting a respectable grade it it hasn't hit them yet so I can understand I mean we were all once students who I mean even yourself when you were in poly
(um) you know it's the uncertainty of (err) okay [lah]
you know if I don't do well then don't do well [lah] you know but (uh) once you are in a position where you are out
is very exhausting and (um) some of my friends did try that route
and they were successful (err) well kudos them
but social life go all the way no problem
she knows she knows
you probably deserve it you probably deserve it anyway please continue
there's some people like myself better focused when not at home and distracted by I don't know
snacks [lah] toilet [lah]
you actually groom yourself you know you comb your hair and then
you go out you take a shower and then you feel refreshed take coffee and then you're ready to get on the go so some people (um)
the productivity for some people such as myself is not so good to be honest
(err) I don't know for me it would be doubly hard
(um) if doubly is even a word for studying
so !aiya! I mean so
I don't know [eh] ultimately it is a state of mind [lah] so if you are in that state of mind and you of course you have to have discipline also
when you order you still when you order food you still need to
pay someone has to pay say you pay or your family pay
but if you are on Foodpanda there's a system called panda pro where you pay like
eight dollars ninety cent a month or something like that and you get like twenty deliveries
it's really a good deal okay you you check it out you go to Google you just type (err) Foodpanda pro
ten dollars and you get five deliveries that's already two dollars per delivery
so I I don't know why not more people are not into it a lot of people do ala carte
circuit breaker I wasn't sure but (err) if you go now it's definitely available
its not like ya most offices are still closed
most people stay at home during this whole period until until the end of the year
well ya well #Nurul# didn't even have a break in the first place she is an essential worker [lah] so it's a different story but for those people who
suspect until the end of the year [ah]
personally I think if at the by the end of the year I manage to go one vacation I'm actually more or less quite happy already
I went this year I went #Jakarta# once only
that was the only overseas trip I did this year
what the the the thing happened in February ya the thing happened in February [what]
it was very fast
ya well I think also because in feb~ (err) late January it was Chinese new year I had to go #Jakarta# but I think we were supposed
to go I mean I was scheduled to go for another vacation I think in May or
no not May (err) April or something [ah] it didn't happen anyway so [ah] whatever [lah]
just need a break cause okay if you think about it [kan] people other than Singapore
who
[ah] that one is (err) he was so desperate for diving that one also is
ya
yup
nope it says (err) fifty seven minutes
on my timer
ya
so man I don't know now
you you're only as old as you feel
sleep is for the weak having said that I got a class tomorrow at nine thirty A_M
what am I doing recording this at two A_M in the morning
you you go for more class I'm going for volunteer class you are going for to get re-educated upgrade education
you paid for
I use I use the SkillsFuture is paid for
I still had to pay about (err) thirty plus dollars that's all just (uh) a top up [ah]
twenty five thousand dollars [ah] [jer]
I paid more for my education in my uni hello
but but I already paid my loan so I'm good no problem
what I'm done but at this stage I already have it so I'm good
no problem
ya I don't have a loan now also I am done
(hmm)
how many years have I been working six maybe should be longer but I had a lot of breaks in between
it's okay
I enjoy my life well how how how do you want why are we talking about this while the thing is recording we have thirty more seconds
okay at this point but did they say though it must be exactly one hour or about one hour
hello hello [eh] hi
what's good
got this like C_B you know very tired stay at home
I'm quickly
how about you
theme park that [one] got the universal studios singapore
(mm)
women who who who
[oh]
ya actually that [one] [sia] the
(uh) what work (uh) work from home and like H_B_L all that actually it's been like quite
quite hard [lah] because it's like it's you it's very hard to contact your team
ya ya your teachers all like
you have to email them you know then they don't even recognise them
so it's a bit hard to contact them
like left with their phone number
then you can
make friend friend with you know
true
ya
then like you know when you on Microsoft teams or like Skype or like [what] or they use zoo~ Zoom [ah]
Zoom
it's like a bit awkward [ah] because you don't know anyone like especially you go to new class
don't know anyone you know
so
very awkward
you don't know the name don't even know their
who they are you don't know their face also sometimes like especially like first day of school that time
so I don't even know anyone
fishing
ya because like when you don't understand like you have to email the teacher
then like you have to wait for the teacher to respond all
then like issue in class like you just can just say [eh] teacher how to do this [one]

ya
ya
ya
nowadays superpowers would be useful
ya ya then
[oh] my god Animal Crossing
it's been a while since I touch that game
then that time I go buy the Switch with you right
ya like I buy before during the circuit breaker period
ya I buy like how much [ah] six hundred plus dollar then I buy with that game the Diablo three
ya but then like when I play when I buy only after that I never play you know
I never played the Diablo three I think it became like what I buy I buy for
eighty five dollars then after that I never even like
I never even play that much like I only played it like maximum like fifteen times
like fifteen minutes fifteen min~
then actually I spent almost one hundred dollars on like Animal Crossing for no reason
ya
it was a bit sad [lah] but then
damn you should play it
[oh] my god you just now just saw you say miss #bae# right like miss #bae# from our secondary school
then you reminded me of like secondary school [sia] I haven't been to like visit secondary school swe~
why you don't want
like it's been it's been awhile since we talk with them
like most of them were quite nice to us
ya he wasn't he was just close to me
he he was the [one] I was I was the [one] I was of his first student
no I was his first student
first [one]
okay [ah] I might be the worst [ah] but like I'm I'm I'm the first
I'm the first at the best
ya no [lah] he was just a very nice teacher
and then actually like be with~ without him right I think I already fail art
O O level
ya no because like actually before he came I was with mister #irman#
that teacher
me out with my artwork
ya
then haiti
ya
so basically me and him we like went around the school and then we took like pictures of like the and then like bascially
ya it's like supposed to like be old like hidden in the grass
like
you know you know like for example like (uh)
world war two bunkers
then like the world war two bunker got all the forest grow around them already right
ya
then after that like the
ya actually he make me watch one of the what Studio Ghibli animations
in a way it was about they tiny people they were like hiding inside the houses of other people
then they like run around
then they like got found by those people
(um)
so my final artwork when it came out right it was actually like a
(uh) what [ah] it became like
I just did a photoshop [lah] of people like climbing onto the that was very old
[oh]
ya
and then I just made it like so it's like the was a forgotten toy you know the dead
and then below the bed
below the bed
ya then like below the bed then got like tiny people
then the tiny people were climbing onto the
you a tiny people
ya
so I just took some pictures of like people and then like I edited it into the
into the scene [lah] so that make it make it look like they were climbing onto the
ya [eh] I remember you were doing also [ah] but what was what was your artwork about
ya because you know like you haven't done art in like almost three years right because of polytechnic
[oh] my god ya actually that's the thing about polytechnic right now
polytechnic polytechnic is so like heavy on the modules right like even though the C_C_A
it's very hard to use your focus on your C_C_A and your studies at the same time
ya
(uh)
trail
seeing like how he busy school is right know because of polytechnic [kan]
ya
tired
even in english also I can say like tired [lah]
tired of like school like that school is so
especially if you in the engineering line
to me [ah] in my opinion
ya because like engineering like you have like so many exams
you know like for example like every semester I will always have at least four exams
like like my school rest no chill
then after that the for exams right like three of it is like theory
so you have to remember like different types of theory within one week
just to like pass everything at least you know
it's
ya
but
engineering is more less enjoying
that's why I would rather go to army [ah] even though it's quite bad for some people
then what about you what would you want to work as because #sui sui# in engineering
(mm) got chem~ chemical engineering
you know
[ah]
like you know people losing their jobs because like their company like realised they don't even need these kind of people
like they just basically tell they just tell you [oh] we got not enough money to hire you anymore
because of COVID you know
ya then also like
you know that time I saw like Channel NewsAsia released this statistic
most people who like lost their jobs even though they get new jobs
the new job will only be like one quarter of their their orignal salary
one person like my friend I heard before he earn like [what] five thousand in a month
but then like if you cut that to one quarter it's already like
how much like one one point five
then it's like one point five
ya
but the worst [one] is the people who who already have high pay [lah] because their
their lifestyle is already like (uh) I have high pay kind of hype lifestyle
so their their banks will be like burning off like way faster than usual
but it's hard [lah]
like if you are used to like eating somewhere that is like more expensive then you like like the food there
or for example if you like your the sports is like very expensive like
you need to enter the place every time you enter it's like twenty dollar twenty dollar
like you you have to cut off like things that are very
good for yourself
like mentally
ya like that time the gym all close then a lot of my friends were like
gym people they were like very like
[eh] why gym close [ah] cannot work out anymore because their the reason they go to gym because their their house is very small
[oh] my god talking about working out at home
you got see Channel NewsAsia
but it's a like void deck right outside their house
ya so basically like the coach they organise like Zoom workouts
but then the coach was act~ originally like a
(uh)
coach at the gym
then like basically he cannot do his gym workouts anymore so he he did his like Zoom calls at the staircase
then he showed all the the like
static exercises at at the staircase [ah] then they people were like following him
I feel like it's good [ah] because like
ya because like
it really shows like that you can do anything but like anywhere
like it doesn't have to be somewhere
okay [ah] obviously there's some limitations [ah]
but
ya he went to the extent
no [ah] because his house was too small like he he he showed (uh) showed the
like T_V programme like look at his house you know
he has like other people living there also like he cannot do his work out here because people will keep disturbing him
ya
because you cannot meet up at that time at that time we still cannot meet up for any activities
and then they they did the malay dance training on in the Zoom call
savage love ya I don't know but then like
it's quite cool [ah] because it shows right it really shows that you can acctually do things like not being at school
you know
true true
why you want to be farmer
like fun [ah]
[oh] my god wonder why
you wanna know why because you got the crush on the teacher last time
that teacher then he became he open up like the farm on top the roof
the mister darren #tan# that [one] or whatever his name was
ya
you should contact him man about the farming
no but he confirm like [eh] you last time from swiss cottage
then he like recognise you then he give you more chance what because like actually the his his concept of doing the farming is quite cool
he say like like singapore has so much like space on roofs like why not use those roofs to like make the farms
but to me also got one downside [ah] like what if hap~ what happens if
for example if the water on top start leaking
then later like they will start to do like roof damage to like the
big building you know then the person living below directly the farm like their roof will get
like damagedby water
ya
I know but like if if it comes to that point where
it gets approved where they do farming on top of like almost every building you know
ya
but but like I don't I don't eat vegetable [sia] but I like the concept
it's like
yes
ya
(mm) but mutton taste so good
I know you hate mutton taste but mutton taste so good
that's why you like that's why you like vegetable
[oh] my god you know actually why I love hydroponics so much
I got tell you before last time when I primary school I was inside this environmental club
and then like when when we it was like the first excursion I had during second~ [eh] during primary school
(um)
then basically they brought us to hydroponics farm
ya and then like (uh) they showed (uh) around [lah] like got the hydroponic all so they put they seed into like the sponge and then the sponge they put into the tube [kan]
ya then after that the tube is like constant running water of like
mineral water or something like that like inside the water got like the nutrients for the plants to grow
ya
[a'ah]
ya
more thick
to make it more thick
why it's inside the thing
like then you said like water inside the tube
something like that because we were only like sec~ primary school kids what we don't really like don't know anything [ah]
ya but then I don't know what happened to the Ribena plant [ah] I think my mum throw away already
I think we keep for like one week then my mum was like this is a very hard plant to keep then we just like throw away
ya I think so I don't really remember what happened to the plant
but ya then after that like (uh)
actually I saw this one whole circuit
[oh] like hydroponic
it's like very cool I think you would think it's cool also
it's like they use they use the fish the fish tank
inside got a lot of fish then the the fish like poop in the water all got mineral already right
then they will run the that that fish water into the hydroponic system so the minerals from the fish poop go into the plants
then they use the plants to feed the fish also
so it's like a continuous system
of like growing fish and and the plant so it's a fish farm and the plant farm
ya
ya
all the fish poop you know
and the fish will obviously get bored of the plants already for for once
ya the were plants like a filter filtering the system
because you cannot over feed you cannot over feed like hydroponic systems also
plant will die
what about you what do you think you can do to change the world
you know like the greenh~ greenhouse effect [ah]
ya F_Y_P question [ah]
[oh] my god
bicycle
excursion [ah]
their did mature more environment friendly too
unknown doesn't put like mature discipline implements
[oh] my god ya you know they they estimate the island to be like filled up by like I think twenty forty or something like not even that far away [sia]
ya we'll be fourty then like also like [eh] [oh] my god [eh] #ti# you know what's the best way to make singaporeans like not use plastic bags
where
make them pay for your plastic bags
because singaporeans don't like to pay extra for anything
you just stand [oh] the plastic bags extra twenty cents
you know like nowadays at supermarket right they always do like the
(uh) if you never bring your own bag you pay ten cent for each plastic bag that they use
ya
ya [sia] you know like especially all those aunties right
you know like you tell them [eh] plastic bags cost fifty cent now [ah] they they'll be like [oh] my god [oh] my god then they will like buy their own bags one confirm
because right especially these aunties right I see some of the aunties ten cent already they don't want to spend extra
then
ya [sia] they they will like be more inclined to like confirmed buy [one]
(um)
[oh] my god then that time right I was so proud [ah]
ya

I never listen [ah] michael jackson

but technically speaking if he comes back to you after two years right I think you would have moved on [sia]
I think you would have moved on already
like now you're in the process
for you for him it's easy
because guys will have the mindset that they can get everything they get they want
serious serious they they can they will use that

exactly
[oh] my god
#astarghfirullahalazim#

okay you get the feeling
[oh]
ya exactly
I mean if you moved on already what can you say
okay if caring okay
(err) his kind of
lead you on
ya
get you into thinking things that are otherwise the things
to get you into thinking things that
are otherwise that he thinks
okay
he talks to #humairah# about you right
K that makes you think he hasn't moved on right
but instead if you ask him that face to face he will say [oh] I just care care for you as a friend
ya exactly that's that's that's what I meant by he keeps leading on
[ah]
so you get what I mean now
that's why
don't high hope [sia]
(mm)
never ya just dont ca~ care about him move on zack is in front of you even if zack doesn't like like you again
maybe in the future may~ maybe will
ya exactly
ya [lah]
she got cheated

I_G
(mm)
I mean
for you
right
ya
C_B [ah] C_B circuit breaker
ya it's very rare to like find guys who are less
you know have that
ya
high hopes [eh]

(mm)
it's okay
it's okay
he does trust me
you told like so vaguely you told him what
okay I'm not I'm not saying it's a bad thing but
I mean ya you're kind of fast [lah] but
rather than him might as well you go for someone else right
ya exactly
you're right
!huh! really [ah]
straightaway the answer legit would you like to
would you like to have that
that that has been my conclusion all my years
you know that #mirah# tell me you know like okay
[oh] okay okay sorry then we were going home right
[ah]
then after that she asked me like have you had a boyfriend before
that was like somewhat close to
(uh) dating [ah]
then he told me
ya then like the reason was also so stupid
okay no I'm I'm not stereotyping [lah] but
I mean isn't that
she told me that you know #umirah#
she said she knows that some
the guy bought
[kan]
can you imagine if I tell #izuan# that
I say that
even if like there's there's plenty of guys asking me for it
I wanna see his reaction then he will be like very annoyed confirm
[kan]

[oh] #huzni# texted you while we were talking that one
I'm not the only one wearing like that what there's other girls also who wear like that
I'm just saying ya

[ah]
I mean it's your opinion on what you wear [what]
you're telling me not to wear things
ya exactly
as a friend okay I understand
your point of view
but don't don't make it seem as if as if it's my fault for dressing like that and then I lure guys into doing it
[eh] you !wah! shit [sia] cannot [sia] like you can see my whole face it's not that obvious
ya even if I I asked #husni# you know
like it's way before

right
cause I think now we have netflix right I don't like the idea of having to [oh] okay I have to watch this show at a specific timeslot like who got time for that you know

ya
sounds good
[ah]
okay
ya
pessimistic as in about your relationship
(uh huh) (uh huh)
okay as in like what kind of things are you pessimistic about
[oh] okay okay
ya
okay what is the thing that you want to do more of like you think you haven't achieve yet
monetary
or like but but then like to me it's like what's the point of just having a number there right like you can have hundred K in like in in like asset
ya
in general but I don't know I still think hundred K feels feels like very little but what can you do with hundred
you bought a house [what]
ya correct
but then how how would you okay I I mean if you think about it logically how would anyone earning like a normal pay for around thirty years old I think most people are earning between what four to five K around there
ya or or unless like you're a real high flyer ya and then
ya correct
ya exactly but then it depends
but like I I mean like if a normal office job that's about as much as you can go unless you already start off you know as a
ya
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[ah]
I don't know but #ros# also
[oh] like you yourself okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
okay okay I think
I think it's cause of the industry as a whole [lah] also
there's a lot of uncertainties there with the flying and all I mean with the aviation industry like this
cause if if let's say any normal given day then you know everything would be going smoothly what it's S_I_A you know what can happen
!huh!
[a'ah]
ya
what [oh] no but [eh] five hundred plus that means how much you put down your deposit you take twenty percent is it of the cost
twenty five percent
hundred
hundred K ya [lah] there's your savings
dope okay [lah] hundred plus
okay [eh] then okay [eh] not so bad [eh] hundred plus
then the rest of it finance through what bank loan [ah] is
but is but six hundred plus K right the the cost price of your condo
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay
then you you put down about hundred plus [lah]
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
to to to pay off your loan okay so I watched like this video right they say if let's say the interest of your loan is below three percent just
pay it off slowly ya don't even bother ya but if let's say the interest on your loan is more than three percent than ya you should pay it off as soon as possible
ya this is
ya
so what is the final amount like what's the max you have to pay per month
one thousand plus
but then part of it will come from C_P_F [kan]
[ah] okay okay can [lah]
then how then see how
but then you you're not really planning to stop working after getting married right
[oh] no
(mm)
(mm) (mm)

[ah]
like da da da and
actually I think can [what]
as in like as in a green light
you you won't get retrenched firstly cause of your seniority and then secondly
I don't know I mean if he this this would be the perfect time to see if he if someone can support you [lah] through difficult times [kan]
but I think it's just you [lah] you just want to you know make make sure that everything is perfect before you enter any serious commitment
ya now I have to try and change my earpiece
cause it's running out of battery
ya it's very annoying
so I hope it work
#inshaallah# [lah] [eh] now where is my
earpiece
I think I should borrow #hidayat# earpiece
[eh] there
cause this stupid google pixel [a'ah] google pixel
so every week at least one night he will stay there
ya
so I have I have some time to myself
my mother-in-law my mother-in-law wanted #hanan# to like stay over so we just do it [lah]
okay
okay
how about wait [ah] we pause for a while
okay let me try again so now I'm attaching my earpiece in
okay [ah] this is another wireless earpiece
please [lah] work please please
okay
okay good good good
ya so I will get
ya correct
I'm very lucky already still want to complain about my son I think about sending him all the time
crazy [ah]
he is I don't know I think he is
ya he he has his moments [lah] but he's becoming so naughty ya ya he like just the other day he falls off the bed [tau]
ya did he he he rolled off the bed
ya
so now we are trying to put him on the mattress
then you know I started baby proofing my house
ya so got the baby lock [lah] you know by the drawers you have to [ah] pull out and things like that ya but #hanan# figured it out like he plays with the hook
then he he he saw me doing it and then he copied
that is wishful thinking
okay [lah]
[eh] can you hear me clearly
okay good good good ya this earpiece is a lot better than that stupid airpod keep running out of battery [lah]
I didn't know this one got okay this is just ya correct
I can even
this is #xiaomi#
it's only twenty dollars
unlike the airpod which was like what three hundred
ya I think he's buying I want to buy this type too
I already got the job [lah]
like I mean you know they they like like on the website like I've already been rejected from all the other applications
but M_O_M one is still open like still pending pending approval so just wait [lor] it is what it is it takes a very long time
ya and I really want that job though
ya but ya [lah] I'm also scared but at the same time
for the position is
it's compliance manager
ya
so I hope they pay well
yes yes #jannah# was the one who suggested yes
ya I was quite surprised also
she should go
ya
she should go cause her sisters also going
[oh] my gosh
but her sister got degree
[oh] [oh] [oh]
okay
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya
(mm) (mm)
ya correct
ya
the house is a better investment ya correct
[eh] actually you don't need [lah] you don't need the degree yet you know why people use the degree to buy a house not the other way round
like you know people go get a degree so that they can afford to buy a condo not you already have your condo then you use your condo to partially finance your degree I mean like what's the point you know you've already achieve that
ya [lah]
ya which is ya which is which which I get it ya
ya ya I mean I totally get that [lah] but you can also do that after you have kids or do it with your kids in future
I don't know
but ya [lah] a degree is ya I don't know I don't know if it's pointless or what but ya I wish I wish I went through the
I think right it's more about the experience like you have in school like if you were a part of a campus at N_T_U N_U_S S_M_U then I feel it's really worth it
that to me [ah]
and then they teach you
ya [lah] around there [lor]
that is what for one year only right twenty three twenty three K
eighteen months
actually okay [what] right
[eh] but come
[ah] ya true ya true true
ya that's true plus you are also getting married
ya ya ya ya
but don't do anything you don't want to do
you know
but now you realised that !hey! actually my life is pretty good right unmarried not not married
and then you are not sure by getting married it will make your life better or worse like would you even feel empty if you're not married
you know what I mean
ya
(mm) (mm)
there is there is
no of course there's going to be a very good reason to get married
you
ya
ya ya ya it's a perfect size and width
(mm) (mm)
okay okay
ya (mmhmm)
ya
like I would go and save and look for couple massage and then buy right
but he splurged like five hundred plus okay then
[ah]
okay
!wah!
okay okay
[a'ah]
[a'ah] ya like the what the wave okay
[ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] nice and where did you guys go for dinner

(mm) okay okay
(mm)
so he cancelled the other one
nice pretty nice
!aww! so nice then what what you packed
like you packed like the clothes for the day
!huh!
cute [seh]
you know I trust him now
that's good that's good
ya
which is I mean to be fair also it's hard for him [lah] how is he going to talk somebody like robert right who's been in your life for so long
ya slowly in future to your family
ya [lah] I know
what what what about him does she wish would be better
that's good [lah]
there's a I do there isn't but ya she just decided that okay [lah] just let them live their life
you know I'm not gonna I'm not gonna interfere
then after that he's like why you so rude [ah] I don't want to go [lah] then he called his sister and said [oh] I'm I'm not going already then I have to go [lah] I went out with his family
and my sister-in-law and #hanan#
ya I was so angry but you know cause
and they they so excited [seh] they want to go out with #hanan#
!hais!
I want I'm trying to trying to so it's like
it's like on and off then you see on my instagram I'm not wearing ya
it's something that I want to try and do but we will see [lah] #inshaallah# [lah] and I keep getting deliveries to my door
he thought that all these deliveries
I ordered online on shopee and then after that I compare it with the slightly more expensive one and and totally the same okay
ya
I bought like of shopee [lah] like (um) you know the the non iron one
like the crepe material ya but then after that I also got a lot of hand me down
ya the line line one
then my sister my sister has a lot what so they also give me some
ya cause both both my sisters are wearing already so they helped me [lah] they helped me put it on and stuff teach me
ya
[ah]
no no no no it's not that
ya he just finds that he just finds my colour combi totally off
his family I mean his sister asked me [lah] I told his sister [lah] the truth
ya I think he just bad day they also know what that he
a bit
ya
like he got his temper
[ah] ya I told I told his sister ya
ya
!hais!
ya [lah] this is
[eh] you know that used to be me but now I'm like !haiya! I really cannot be bothered like I cannot be bothered by a lot of things
ya
he's okay if cause for #hanan# right I make sure he he he he is exposed or like he can see people without me around
so actually #hanan# is not very attached to me at all he can be with my mother he can sleepover and then after that he can go over my mother-in-law then he sees his paternal side grandparents he's okay he's like perfectly fine
he's not clingy
I think ya
ya I I cause I know eventually I want to go to work [what]
ya ya correct so I need him to not be so attached to me it's for his own good also [lah] but at the same time he's very clingy to his father cause he knows that his father is like he totally see daily
ya like #hidayat# will only come back only at night then he don't get to see him cause he will see him for a short period of time in the morning before work
ya
then he he will cry you know he will be like at the door
when his father goes off to work
ya he understands
ya [lah] but I love it cause he's such a smiley happy baby
ya I just hope he gonna be fine
like he won't feel like he won't
then today right I'm going to make stocks for him
I'm going to make chicken stock and vegetable stock from scratch
but like plain
no salt no what
now (um) next week [ah]
ya
ya hopefully
maybe
!huh! I really don't believe so cause the first one it feels like life is still to support them
you know what I mean
ya
it's like motherhood will never end
!hais!
ya
the only one for a long time
[oh] my gosh
ya so he
he's going to do it at #furama# (err) this girl is from N_T_U she's doing [ah] I think it's his schoolmate or something
ex schoolmate so she studies biomedical sciences
[ah]
cause of the cause of the way he responds
the girl the girl is works in a lab so she does
I don't know she tests things she run she's the ya she does research
#nazreen# is an engineer so he works in the east so he does he's like my sister [lah] they she they studied mechanical engineering
ya
he's been working a while
ya I saw the girl stays in the east
they they will stay stay with each other for a while la while they look for resale
ya so cause #nazreen# works in the east so they going to stay with the girl likely
ya but then the girl works at N_T_U so you imagine
!huh! serious
serious
(mm) (mm)
plus the set up all that which which is okay I I don't know I thought ya but then I think my degree was cheaper so but they got they got back quite a bit [lah] so in the end
[ah]
as in like okay [lah]
[eh] but still
you don't have to worry so much about the guests you can just
slowly take your time
(mm)
ya fifty is too little already
you cannot that means it's really just family [lor]

ya ya
I only listen to his podcast with #aisyah# his girlfriend #aisyah aziz#
it was okay [lah] but he comes across as very chauvinist
ya like
like I think he respects her but
he also questions her a lot
ya
but then he also talks about her what like in other podcast he will say like [oh] you know like if I have a girlfriend we must respect we must then everybody knows [what] his girlfriend is #aisyah aziz#

like
(mm) ya maybe maybe but if you notice even during interviews it is #dzar# who carries the conversation right with the
people like #razz# will intern~
[a'ah]
ya correct
correct correct correct
so actually #dzar# can go out on his own and make his own podcast
no [lah]
#din# doesn't add to the conversation I feel like he will just ask one question and then after that [oh] okay
no wonder he doesn't have like his own viewpoints to chime in you see at least #dzar# has like so many things to say right and he always makes the conversation more interesting
ya

[oh] my god
this is like toy story
like tiny people like just random people
that's cool
(err)
okay like I I retook
O level art like
so I took O O level art two times [ah] the first time like I did it then I took it again in secondary five
(uh) so there was two time like the first [one] was like achieve it to my
grandfather who passed away
ya
so that was quite like close to my heart [lah]
like (mm) [oh] my god I'm gonna cry like (err) I incorporated like things that remind me of him like there's this biscuit [lah] like he always like offered me
he
ya so
and also (err)
there was a portrait of me and my family like sitting on the sofa and like (uh) our expressions were like sad [lah] to show
and for the sofa pillows [kan] like
(uh)
apples was also like something that reminded me of my grandfather because he he always knows that (uh) I like I like to eat apples so he or he would always like buy buy for me then leave it in the fridge then ask me to eat
so ya I made the pillows like (uh) act~ apple like texture so ya it was kinda cool it's cool and for like the second
the second time I took (uh) O level art (um) it was
it was
I don't know it was like a quiff
artwork [ah] it was it was like mostly about my hair [lah] about my pink hair I don't like I didn't like it
at that time
it was just like a form of like expression
like (uh) previously there were like some people who say like I I wouldn't look nice with pink hair ya will look like
I don't know gross or something but then I'm like
no I'm gonna do it I'm gonna prove you wrong so I did it so I dyed my hair pink so like that became like my whole theme for my second artwork
so it was like
flowing hair
(uh) for like most of it was like a long canvas then then in the middle was like a self portrait and there was like ya a few other portraits around it
and I incorporated m~ my sister in the artwork
so ya that was kind of cool
I miss painting and drawing
also like lately I've been trying to draw a lot
also I I I I joined a art competition like my school's art competition [lah] like it's being held from
like (err) (err)
like N_Y_P's sketch club [ah]
so ya
ya for sure and I've been lazy
true true
yes
just high [ah]
true true
ya
like content heavy [kan]
true true
ya
just polytechnic life
so what are you planning to do for your future
(mm)
I see
I see
actually ya
ya I'm in like chemical engineering so that's quite interesting
so ya a lot of shit also is like content heavy [lah]
I think ever since like this intern right it really made me reflect on
like
what I want to do for the future and also like
what kind of work I want to be in too I think for now like my plan is like (err)
hopefully my grades is like good enough to go university [lah]
then (uh) let's see if I don't go to university
I think I might go for
earn and learn programme
ya like
like you study
but you also work at the same time
it's like
ya like
like you study for a few months then you go like attachment
so it's like a specialised diploma which I which I think is quite cool [lah]
like it's
some it's like a choice
that I can try
if if legit like I can't go to university or can't go to like earn and learn then I might just go to work [orh]
then if I go work I will I will like
work for two years then hopefully I can like try to
convince my future managers to send me to further studies
ya that's the plan
(mm)
because the pay for it is
still
true true
ya
it's quite sad
and I heard like there there will be like a second wave [kan]
ya
like
true
two K jobs like only earn like two K plus or like one K plus if you cut it even more it's like can barely survive [seh]
true
ya
but that's so bad [lah] obviously you have to change your lifestyle and if that happens
(mm)
true
true true
(mmhmm)
what
(mmhmm)
(mm)
but I'm shook
but I'm shook at the fact that he go Zoom call at the staircase like out of all places
(mm)
true true
(mm)
true true
a lot of C_C_A now is also like they carry out using Zoom Zoom calls
you know
but that's so boring though
but okay [lah] at least something you know compared to like nothing at all
confirm when I grow up I want to be a farmer
I don't know
okay [lah] that
that kinda satisfies the my dream a bit
but I want to be like a full on farmer I don't know I think I've had this dream like since secondary school
like I
why why
(uh)
I know but like maybe [ah] maybe that's part of it [ah] but it's not like entirely him right it's not like I want to like have a farm with him or [what] [sia] like but I genuinely just want a farm
like I want to be rural
then like just vibing
you know
no I'm so shy
no
no
ya
true
[oh] actually true
but I don't think they do it on top of housing though
[oh] ya I guess so
you don't even eat vegetable like you don't eat your vegetables at all
!ee!
!ee!

alright see I'm a genius
I need to tell that to my grandmother
but I hate mutton taste

like your thighs
(mm)
ya
[a'ah]

(mm)
(mm)
[oh] [ah]
I need that
I need that in my life but it's it's probably a lot of like
maintenance like you probably need to really take care of the plants and you really have to take care of the fish
I think you'll get dirty quite fast though
true
I think the the poop is gonna be more
than what the plant take in
damn that's
change the world
(ugh) (uh) is this a F_Y_P question
[oh] okay okay [ah] change the world I don't know [oh] my god I want to be more environment friendly [oh] my god talking about environment friendly

like (uh)
B_Y_O_B B_Y_O_B stands for bring your own bag like (uh)
they held this thing like (uh) we had to go to like various supermarkets then after that (err) we took the like bags that were donated from the public
then (um) we will take out those (uh) which are dirty then we will we will take the clean ones then (uh) we will go to the various supermarkets then we will offer
people who didn't bring their own bags so we will offer like the tote bags that were donated to for them to use as
like the grocery bags [ah] so it was quite so it's a
(uh) then
I think that is like actually a small thing that can like change the world like in a way like we should really like
cut down on our like plastic consumption [lah]
I think like plastic is really bad for us
like is so ingrained in our society that it's like super hard for like the society to change
to
like
like they implement like certain things [ah] to make it better
like I think the like #pulau semakau# like the like the island they put the trash all like
is getting filled out like quite fast [ah] then they go through
ya we will be fourty
ya but I feel like that tension is right not really pushing people like I feel like singaporeans are just like
ya true true
ya imagine like fifty cents it'll be like more like
ya for sure
so that's cool
why
and I never ask for plastic bag I bring my own bag

every time I plan every time I plan right like I confident know he ask me what time you want to come baby then I say okay ten thirty
babe still asleep right
I cannot so like even today I I'm ask him [lah] whether he got football not so that I know what time to come by then he said yup I sign myself up for torture session tomorrow's in the morning so you can stay a bit longer
there are things to do you just got to find it how about you guys go cycling
[oh] so he cannot cycle okay wait let me think what other things
kickboxing but then don't kick [ah] just box
that's what me and andre do too it's either cycling or kickboxing or gym that's what we do
so you must you must you must force you must force him you must do I don't know [ah] it's like it's a it's a two thanks to tango thing because if you keep allowing the relationship to like flat line right then
you will eventually get to a point where you will like ask yourself right is this really all we do
ya
ya so like it's very important like andre has a friend who's been like complaining about how like [oh] he's marriage is like failing and like how his him and his wife don't do anything anymore and andre just told him one thing like me
in a marriage like in any like relationship it's very important to always like do new things or like do things together because
it's the way a relationship is supposed to be like if you don't bring her out on a date then of course she's not going to dress up for you or anything like that
but I don't know why he's telling me ya
I mean just because he has that like it doesn't mean dinner has to stop like you can always do something at home ya like you can have your wine and cheese thing at home
ya see so like it cannot always be like one person like trying to clap if not you just making [eh] like it's pointless like I told andre because (uh) last I think last month andre got very like slack when it came to his active lifestyle [lah] so I felt very bad because a part of me felt like okay maybe it was because of me [lah] but he assured me he like he say it's not because of me as well I mean like he can always made the decision himself he he he makes conscio~ conscious choices [what] anyway so like he told me okay from now onwards he he's gonna start working out again so me as a girlfriend what would a good girlfriend do
like I'm not going I'm I'm I love being lazy I love the bed right but
if I allow myself to like
not even compromise then want kind of a girlfriend will I be [sia] so I told him like okay I mean I do enjoy cycling in the morning and I don't mind and also do enjoy kickboxing and going to the gym so we can continue doing that and we can just remain active and then even when I'm not with you I will remain active so like you can sort of like inculcate a habit and then that way you won't feel like okay like I'm not doing anything and then at the same time we can always do things together
have to compromise [ah]
(mm)
that's the thing about life
why can't he come to yours
#syed# better wake up better wake up
it's because you are comfortable
it's something familiar [what] and it's always scarier to start something new so people go back to familiar stuff it's actually why a lot of people cannot leave toxic relationships or like abusive people
cause it's familiar
it's very true
it's because you are so comfortable like already with the person and like you will tell yourself [lah] like that little voice in your head was sort of like tell you like okay what if you don't find anything like this again or like what if you don't find a better love but that's not true look at me
everybody can have that chance it's really not true like
and people shouldn't stay in places where they are unhappy because eventually over time like there will be resentment building and anger and like just sadness and it's not just healthy for like you is also going to be unhealthy for like the other person and your relationship and then of course more than ever you so like ya people just need to be more aware
and other people like I like I said like if you are in a relationship you need to understand that it's going to take work life is going to get away everybody is going to be busy everybody has work but look at andre andre is freaking busy
and he will still make time for me so nobody has an excuse like there is literally no excuse no excuse
he definitely has been
andre will do work like halfway while I'm there but he will still like once in awhile like let's say on monday monday has to work right so monday he will work from home then if monday he worked from home he will always he were really just concentrate on work and I will let him concentrate on work because it's to be fair he has to work
and I will never like you know like distract him maybe sometimes I will never like I will never like distract him on purpose [lah] but even then like halfway he will like stop his work and then tell me like come let's go to the pool or like let's go have lunch together or like
snuggle in bed for a while he was still make time so no excuses
like the other day he go in office and then because he went into office right I got nobody to wake me up
then I sleep until twelve P_M [sia]
right see no excuses my ex used to also be like that like everything was like [oh] (um)
I don't need to do this or like date nights were never like there he won't even like take pictures of me or like compliment me
and then he spent most of his days going out with his friends drinking getting drunk coming back late and I will be the one to like constantly imagine me carrying like a man taller than me like back home changing him because he's too drunk to even do shit
I was living your life girl
I was living your exact life I was where you are now
trust trust I was where you were now like literally he will pick a fight with me if he was drunk and I didn't like pick him up
and I will always stay at home I didn't even get to meet any of my friends I didn't get to go out because if I go out he will pick a fight with me things like that like it was so bad like
so
ya
I I really think it's just local men that actually like they just don't think about anything but themselves
my ex wasn't pampered because he didn't have like family he doesn't have a mom he didn't have a dad growing up
and he was made to like literally work his whole life but still
(mm) same freaking theories ya they they won't bother working you gotta listen to yourself damn you you really have to I mean like
now you may not but I'm very sure eventually you'll get there [lah]
eventually
you have to place your happiness above like somebody else because if they're not even thinking about your happiness what's the point of thinking of theirs
gotta love yourself more girl
I told you already [what] tomorrow I'm going gift shopping
on a saturday
but it sure is
upper #joo chiat#
because chances are but I'm only I'm meeting him at like one P_M [what] so I'm meeting at one P_M
we will probably like chill at home for awhile
I don't know
that's why gotta find one that will match him
but the other one I'm not sure whether he will have at least a matching shirt I know he got a lot of pink shirts [ah] but I don't know whether it will look good together I'll see [ah] I'll see tomorrow see tomorrow also we have to plan the outfit
and then I have to finish writing my speech
yes
I'm I'm very excited to be bringing him to like celebrate another culture that's not even mine
then he eat but it was really spicy for you [ah]
he eat but he's still white
so like white people [kan] standard cannot tolerate spicy food
ya man
he's so cute
[oh] my god that one would kill him
he will just die
I am hungry please don't like talk about food
ya we can do that I've been going to the gym it's the only problem is that we live on literally the opposite ends of singapore
ya we go we go to that one [what] I mean if you are near the area then ya [lah] if not it'll be very troublesome for you [what]
!wow! I wish you heard yourself girl we should do something healthy together besides drinking but then suggest going to the gym and then going drinking
andre has their beers after football
do it do it then we can we can do kickboxing together
what's his horoscope [ah] out of curiosity
when is #syed's# birthday
january what
[oh] my god it's one day after andre's birthday
the moon sign must be something else the moon and the mercury and the venus must be something else for sure must be something lazy
that's funny because the aquarius and gemini should be able to get along well it's actually mainly why me and andre get along well because like
I mean you are not a gemini [lah] but your gemini moon is very strong
no it's it's because like it's not just your sun signs [what] your other signs nearby so he definitely has like more stronger like signs that are much more like prominent in his chart that are lazy
because aquariuses actually love new experiences
and he is very unlike an aquarius like very very
he's getting older andre is forty two
he is such an underdeveloped aquarius
yes do that do things for yourself
that's how you start loving yourself bro
ya
!wah!
I'm still waiting for them to get back to me
ya and I I I will message them [one] know in like the last message I got was that [ah] [oh] it's still being delayed like it's still processing government agencies are seriously
(hmm)
it is a stable job but like can you hurry up
ya andre has
I can't wait to travel with andre
we can do that too girl but if I travel with you I know I confirm become mum friend cause you confirm like small kid
yes but you are the one that will get drunk
!aiyo!
I'm so tired
yes and I still have like things to do after this I cannot go to sleep yet
well I'm allowed to sleep in term just going to wake up at eleven then I'm going to pack my things and then I'm going to go out

like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part [lah]

well I just I just finished my reservist today also [ah]
never [sia]
then
it was to make up for the last duties mistakes [ah] more like it
[ah]
half was that half was
half was like
so they were
that was the other half [lah] the other half was
but ya other than that
(err) what time [ah]
like
(uh) ya
ya
[orh]
[ah]
[sia]
[oh] then my medical call
not bad [ah]
quite interesting [ah]
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my E_M_T was like chill [lah] yes [ah] okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
then we reached the lift lobby
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my P_O ask him
(err) are you the one who called just now then the guy was like [ah] ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he [oh] his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is (uh) pretty rare [ah] to to to see like shocks getting given by the A_E_D [ah]
ya but the guy
(uh huh)
[oh]
[orh] but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping [ah]
I I think so
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for sh~ with a shock
[oh]
compulsory to what
[oh] serious [ah]
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay [lah] I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay [lah] that guy quite nice the the community responder
cause he was at home [ah] he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah]
so from from no breathing no pulse [ah]
[oh] ya that guy
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
confirm gone [ah] is it
(uh huh)
got the what again
[ah] the the one and two and three and four and that kind [ah]
[ah]
wait that was a doctor [ah]
it isn't you know
#sian# [sia]
who gets to do as in nobody want to do [oh] nobody wanna do
why [sia]
(uh)
!huh!
but (uh)
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also [lah] so he was saying that
cause
[orh]
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is [lah] but like
no point
[oh]
so F_M_V can [what]
!huh!
[ah] ya ya the ugly one [lah]
[oh]
ya ya
[oh] ya I d~ d~ d~ #ding# was telling us [lah]
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the F_M_V [lah] F_M_V recall
[ah]
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
okay [ah]
cause I came also like
then go up
but okay [lah] fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress [lah] cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the F_M_V sec com ya
no [lah] but my P_O is E_M_T trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my P_O is E_M_T trained
ya [lah] definitely [sia]
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge [lah] but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the [ah] P_O take charge
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
but now makes sense [ah]
ya
F_M_V and fire bike
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
[oh]
(uh huh)
eight people
!wah!
[oh]
but wonder how often it's actually being used [lah] in
[ah]
[ah]
[eh] my friend from #paya lebar# also the madam told them don't turn out [sia]
they said they want to minimise
[ah] they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
[ah] fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I #suay# [ah] my
ya [sia]
don't know [ah] apparently it's the first time [ah] that
only the
they said because of the C_F_S or something [ah]
but I don't know [ah] not really buying it
okay [ah] #bo pian# [ah] just go [ah]
then they also all the all the people were like
so L_F one five two replace P_L one five two
so
L_F one five two crew also turn out for F_M_V
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am F_M_V I'm F_M_V one five one right
at the same time I am L_F one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
ya so it's called dou~ double meaning [ah]
so like
ya [lah] so must just be extra alert
okay [lah] but as in #bishan# usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
not bad [lah] at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay [lah] interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
ya
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different [sia]
what didn't you download the app
[ah]
(uh huh)
I think for you all different [lah] cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay [ah]
download what
[oh] no [lah] I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
[oh] the card [ah]
[oh] for a res~ as a reservist [ah]
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
what did I what did I teach you
[oh]
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
(uh huh)
[oh] I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected [ah]
[oh] ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know [ah]
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
that one they are not choking already [ah]
!huh!
[ha]
in case anything happen like just cover your back [ah] is it
[orh]
[oh] so she wanted to go to the hospital [ah]
!huh!
something [lah] you feel like you are contributing it ya
[oh]
[ha]
!huh!
so you were already were were you there on the scene already [ah] for this
that was that was was that you
[orh] wasn't you [ah] [ah]
!wah! yesterday they were telling me like
(err) ghost stories that happened in the station and stuff
ya ya that one that one
then
ya then the another one they said after that but it's only one more thing that happened
then after that so it was three of them
then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
that you can close
[ah] so like
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
then he like
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
then which doesn't make sense because
but he climbed downstairs
then door open then he like he told them [ah] what he saw
then the two people outside like [eh]
but we didn't even close the door [sia] we just bit~ like we just held it ajar
ya that's the
as my my my call
second hand stories so it's like not so scary
ya
then what you doing tomorrow
[ah]
(uh huh)
[oh] so you buying for yourself [lah]
[orh]
[ah]
[oh]
ya I
I realised right I have this thing where I get headaches in the sunlight
no serious like cause when I started my internship last time my internship was back in twenty eighteen [kan]
then I I was having headaches like every week
then recently when I started work again
then I got the same kind of headaches
then I realised like
[oh] shit the only difference is that
the the only similarity is that I've been working in the sun
ya
S_C_C
(err)
okay so my second thought is that I think when I went for lasik
then
after that it somehow
made me get this thing

tracetogether [oh]
(mm) maybe maybe
ya [lah] ya [lah]

[oh]
[a'ah]
(mm)
!wah! you not bad [ah]
still going strong (ugh)
ya
(mm)
is it I love wearing the mask [eh]
it's unpopular opinion I know ya because I don't like to smile
so when I don't when I wear the mask people don't expect me to smile I mean you can you can eye smile
what
ya [lah] that's why it it makes me tired
ya
ya I mean actually I'm not unhappy or you know I just have the (uh) the what they call the resting bitch face [ah]
do [ah] then after that then I will just like
my my resting face will go back during break time or something [ah]
you know
so ya but then
but then it's like you know sometimes you you see people
hope they don't recognise me and think I'm just another malay girl
so I just like walk past them
ya ya
tegur
sometimes I don't even notice them you know when I'm just like blur [lah] you know like
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
so
[ah]
hello
[oh] F&B but now no more [ah]
then I want to find another industry to work at
then also
[ah] ya still searching [lah] that's why I I end up
about knowing this [lah]
ya
[a'ah] ya [lah] that's why I'm trying to go for that but then
most of the stuff that I apply for right it's either I don't have the qualifications so I'm not accepted
or they say that I'm overqualified that's why they don't want to accept me so it's like
[ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
that's why
I don't know [ah] what's going on also
(mm) depends [ah]
they said
(mm)
ya [lor] recently I got a job offer
(um) the pay is okay [lah] the the work scope and time also okay
ya
[ah] what
then I mean
technically I think
normal people should have enough educational background to teach
I don't know about you [lah] but ya
(mm) (mm) then
(mm)
(mm) ya usually they they like (um) and they like they prefer
M_O_E registered people [ah] usually
but like
ya I
what
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's why I usually go like enrichment centre that one they a bit more lax [ah]
as long as you can like do the job scope they will be okay with hiring you
but then the teaching also that time
they closed all the education centres so it's like
you know
my flow got disrupted and then
ya ya ya you like you
already have a lot to do which is like plan the lesson and then like teach the lesson then suddenly now got added job scope [ah]
[ah]
that's why
ya
because I was there for training
(um)
not so terrible like I don't hate anybody then nobody hate me you know also then after that the third day onwards the management come to like
like they just like mood totally go down [seh] I don't know [ah] then
because it's ya then she say right because the one week is training [tau]
then she say to me like (um) what [ah]
you come here you don't know anything (uh) then how you going to teach the kids
then I'm like isn't this what's the point of training like I
ya
ya ya
ya
she said twice [eh] in chinese she said
no first she complained she complained to the boss
like because because we have a staff meeting [what]
so (uh) she complain to the boss in chinese
so ya the I was I know already she talking about me and she say about how like
fine whatever just
keep quiet [ah] then after that then she like
at the end of that day she
but then I'm like okay fine nevermind just do the test so obviously I passed [lah] because I do have the
credentials like
I know what I'm doing [lah] basically it's just
I don't know how they do it you know so cause you know some
like let's say if math
some schools they prefer like one plus one equals two
then they like
they use finger you know
but then some other schools they prefer to use mental sums
so I don't know what's their method they never tell me so I (uh) obviously but
if I if you ask me to do one plus one I know how to do [lah] because
do okay you can quite teach [lah] but then
ya so that one gone [ah]
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(err)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
but in in terms of I_T what do you mean
like
(mm)
[ah]
[oh] you mean dev~ [ah] are you like developers or
not really
[oh]
[oh] ya ya ya
!wah! that's interesting [ah] I was contemplating learning that
ya because (um)
upper course ya
that's cool [ah]
because I got media arts
(um) diploma advanced diploma ya
so I understand what you mean by
sometimes you just want to work from home because
it I don't know it's
pointless to go to the office I don't know
ya
obviously ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya ya
ya
that's why that's why
ya
it's okay
I think everywhere is always renovating [ah] so it's okay
ya like I
okay they pause be a bit because of COVID then I think because of the dorm situation also
ya
ya
(mm) suffocating
like means what
[oh]
I don't know [eh]
sometimes the whole day you know then we just like catch up then we like what the fuck ya because sometimes because if you like
like what like you know we always postpone postpone [oh] I I free then I'm not free then I'm not free
and then like suddenly like sometimes on the day itself like [eh] actually I don't feel like going out [ah] then like ya me too you know then never happens
so this one everyone at home online so
#shiok# [ah] like we living our best life [ah] but then I suffocated in a sense that
(um)
I don't like my family
I think I stayed
sometimes the things they do is just
[ah] ya it's like
why are you guys doing this
you know like
ya
ya everyday ya
ya
but it's so crazy [lah] because last time where it's like you know you work until like
sometimes you don't even meet the person for the whole entire day or you know
but then this one is like everyday wake up everyone at home kind of ya but ya
so it's just ya
[oh] (um) still the same also [lah] two but (um) I'm the eldest so that's why
I don't know it's very weird [leh] because (um)
like I'm the eldest [kan]
then I got one younger sister and one younger brother
ya
so
barrier crossed and then
(um) she got a
early childhood cert which is my according to them more stable which I also agree [lah]
so ya she got a more stable like job and like
qualifications so they want her to marry
marry her off [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
but then now she also not working in early childhood [ah]
ya but she got the cert [lah] ya
no [lah] she working in those like F&B jobs [lah]
ya
ya
that's why but then also
is I don't know [eh]
better in the long run if you marry now or bet~ better in the long run if you marry later
but then to me it's like
law legally binding law law [what] you know
ya I get what you mean
ya
[ah] then like a lot of cases of married people cheating
then I'm just like
pretty easily you know but then if divorce
right then
(mm)
is it
I thought we only need to go to the course like some
(um) relationship course or marriage preparation course
and then we get the cert and then we can (um)
get (uh) engaged and married [what]
[oh] okay that one also I don't know but normally [lah] normally is just you
both go for the
marriage preparation course you get the cert then you can get engaged then can get married the next day or something like that ya
ya (mm)
I mean that's
(uh) that's from my experience [lah] I don't know whether
not like I got married before [lah] but you know like
because I got an older cousin and that's how he got married
so I was also like
ya [oh] this is how it's supposed to be [ah] I don't know
me and ya you met him before or not no right
or have I talked to you about him before no right like long time right ya
(err) (uh) (um) almost three years already
to be honest I want to get married already you know because I feel like I'm also getting old
then I think like
right now is actually the best time for me to like have a baby
because (uh) first of all I see many people doing it and I'm so jealous [what]
sorry what
whatever [lah] you know ya ya so
have a baby now you know I think it'll be quite fun [lah] because I don't have to work and then
so ya it's just a waste of opportunity [lah] I feel
why
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] my god
[ah]
but (uh) I think it's okay [ah] cause you twenty five almost still young
ya
ya ya ya ya
like
I I'm quite glad that when I was twenty five I
[oh] okay let me see what ass but nevermind ya so I was still working like crazy [lah] then but I'm glad because I worked
like crazy last time
so now in COVID I'm quite relaxed
a lot of people are like you know [oh] I'm living paycheck to paycheck but then because I have savings because last time I work like crazy so I'm quite
okay [lah] like I can go with like one week not working things like that or one month sometimes depends ya
(um) I think it's good that you are actually working not now so
I think it's good that you are actually working a lot now
but also a bit crazy [lah] you
so os~ then how !huh!
[oh]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya
interesting that you mentioned that because I have the same exact thing
it's like okay but actually I I said I hate my family [kan] but then actually I'm quite okay with them
but the thing is I can't wait to move out also
so
girl [ah] ya ya ya my mum ya [lor] that one also is like
I ya I just
I want to get out of your house to go into another house
ya because I mean
you know like before we get a house if we could get to married
if we were to get married first you know
then I don't know man
(mm)
my boyfriend have bigger house so we probably gonna move there but I'm not sure how the family would feel about that [lah]
but so far I've been going over they quite okay [leh] it's more like okay it's actually (um) my family is more colder to him I think because he's a non-muslim
so I can't really imagine him living in this house
you know
ya
but then
see how [lah] but I'm I'm still hoping like what you said [lah] we both like have our own place already
and then like okay [lah] maybe like I don't mind like after married like stay one month in the in-laws house
you know like in
interim period [lah]
but then I don't want to live there for very long and especially if I'm pregnant right I don't want to live in there
in any in-laws house
I just want to live in like our own
little thing
but then they say if you want right you should B_T_O already
ya because my friend like
they B_T_O like for six years
then in between they got married so they she has to live in the
husband's
house [lah]
and the in-laws house
ya
(mm)
ya ya
because like
I feel
[oh] okay ya I understand
ya
that's interesting
no I was gonna say (um) last year
last yearish my grandma and then it seems like the house is very empty
so I think if I can bring another person in like it will be quite nice but then apparently my parents are not cool with him
so ya I'm I'm I'm dreading the thought that my sister will get married and then they will move in here
so but then she say [lah] like in now these days a bit difficult [lah] but then
her ideal goal is still to move out [lah] ya
but then (ugh)
like
why you don't like the the the partner [ah]
(mm)
ya the okay
[eh]
ask her to get out [ah] really ya ya ya okay [dah]
(ugh)
ya ya ya
[oh] my gosh that's interesting [eh]
would you get rid of your cats so that she can live in your house
ya ya
(mm) okay that's not so bad ya
ya that's why and they are always in #jurong# no offence
I don't know what's with it with you guys ya
ya
I don't even know that you shouldn't have told me
I always thought #jurong# was cool like the west side you know like [oh] cool the west side but then
I know north is crazy because of #yishun#
so that's all I know but then now you say like that then I a bit like okay #jurong# a bit dodgy
[a'ah]
but it's okay I will still think of nicely of #jurong#
you guys are just another country no just kidding
it's like you know like
!wah! that sound so far away I don't know why
ya
(mmhmm)
yes it's true
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya that's right
(mm)
(hmm) do you like that or not
okay
(mm)
[oh]
those are touch and run away kind ya
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
the what you do
what the
[ah] ya so what did you do when those things happened to you
watch group !wah! your parents also very ons [eh]
[ah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm) interesting
right now we don't go out so we don't get followed home
ya but I don't think I can be like you [lah]
like the last three times (uh) people someone follow me home I just confront them I don't care
you are not wrong I'm also very small but I think I'm just
(uh)
more like like I think too well of myself
ya
small you know like sometimes they tower over you also
but then I don't care like you come you want to fight with me [ah] want like ya
ya it's damn irritating I cannot stand it [ah] like what you say [ah]
but then if they got are like obviously in the same lift
empty [kan]
did he he immediately ran just to go inside the same door with me you know
and then aft~
[ah] ya then after that then I like walk over to the next door [ah]
ya then I then I walk then he was immediately like run after me to make sure that he don't lose sight of me
then I'm like what the fuck ya !oops! I cursed
ya [lah] ya [lah] so I'm just like [oh] I don't know if I can
stand it like you but then
most of the not most of the jobs that I want [lah] but then
like
I kind of want to see how it's like to be a factory worker and most of the factories are very far away from me
actually no [ah] #ang mo kio# also got industrial park [lah] but that one is different industry
but ya
I mean not easier [lah] it will be
(mm) ya
that's why
but town is not so bad
(um) ya
would you rather town or #tanjong pagar#
it's a bit far for me
(uh huh)
ya
I cannot [lah] I I just for me I feel I get
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
ya but I think like what you say right I think it's a bit too quiet for me also
(ugh)
so it's damn irritating
then I'm just like maybe I should just go somewhere else where it's a lot more quieter
but then
[ah] I don't know man
I guess everywhere got pros and cons [lah] pros and cons
(mm)
ya
I don't know [ah] I think I just
I don't know man
right now it's like everywhere is quite expensive also
ya
actually my plan [kan] like
I wanted to rent a place already you know
before this
before COVID [lah] so I plan like
this year I want to try moving out of my parent's house so I just want to rent somewhere
and then just live happily with my boyfriend
ya but ya something like that [lah] like live somewhere nearer to the work
place that I was working at and then just
you know like have my own place there
but then obviously like
because of my COVID like most of my savings of that for that plan like already gone so
so sad ya
(mmhmm)
but town is so expensive
nearer
correct
(mm)
obviously ya
interesting
ya [lah] ya [lah] such is life
my plan
[a'ah]
but I think he don't want [lah]
but then
the the thing is that he wants to go for a double degree or something like that which will take more time
so I'm not sure if I'm willing to wait that long [eh] like
I would hope that he would be okay with marrying me in between you know
a degree in the subject that he's interested in
then after that then he still need like what you said [lah] he still need a teaching degree
then I'm just like !wah! that's very long [eh] that's like almost like eight years that I have to wait and I don't know if I want to wait that long
you know
eight years is a really long time ya
so I'm not sure if I want to
do that [lah]
[a'ah]
I know right so that's why it doesn't look very bleak I mean it doesn't doesn't look very bright for me ya
so I don't know about that [lah]
but
hopefully he will change his ways I don't know because he got
study [jer] but then like during semester break or whatever he want to find job [ah] so it's not like he just
school and never earn income you know
so
ya
it sounds quite bad for me [lah] sometimes I wish I just have a nice (uh) rich boyfriend
so that you know all these things can like
be over with it
ya
ya so
what
my boyfriend what
race
(uh) you [lah]
(uh) #qian jin# is a

and then I said yes I know
and then I gave her the straight face and then she was a bit surprise
then I told her
I'm in on it
and then I said ya you mentioned the whole making a pond just to put your turtles in it
and then I did tell her I I wanted to have some chickens but you told me that chickens are not legal

but I see some people have some people have chicken you know
no you can have cats in H_D_B just as long as they don't they are not terrorizing our neighbours

I think that one is really now very much illegal compared to chicken
I I want a lovebird

so are you going to sleep after this
after this are you going to sleep
(hmm)
(hmm)
you know #hanis# never text me this week
ya I purposely never text her you know she also never text me [eh]
I'm not
what move
ya I think like if if she's going to text me then I'm going to
I'm going to tell her that
but she always gets away with it
don't want [lah]
too lazy to talk to her
!hais!
I I'm lazy to talk to her
ya
ya it's still the same you know how #rina# always use people to
I mean use status to make people stay
so apparently got one teacher she also wanted to leave but I heard from #sonya# that she made the teacher become a
senior teacher
I tell you soon everybody's going to be a senior teacher down there
ya anyway I'm going to tell you something you know #hanisah#
they have leadership this leadership program [lah] basically but like
(um) #sofia# and #rina# said that they are going to pay for her for the program you know
but it's bonded with the school and then I asked #hanisah# how long are you bonded with the school [lah] and then she says four years after graduation so she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three
now is twenty twenty right that she's going to graduate in twenty twenty three and then four years after that she's bonded
ya which is
wait wait how old are we now twenty five
thirty two so that mean at thirty two she can leave correct
ya so I ask her [ah] because they are because only because they are paying for it so I ask her [lah] the first thing I ask her is how much is the program that they are paying for you you know
and you know how much she tell me
four thousand
b~ if it's only four thousand dollar the I also can pay I can give her the money now and pay you know
that's what you want to bond for that long you know like three years of study then four years of bond seven years more in M_U you know seven years more in M_U and they're only paying that course for four thousand dollars
so so you tell me
you tell me
no don't you think so
like who would who would bond for seven years in a school only to be
only to know that the course is only [ah] ya the cost is only four thousand dollars if the course is like eighteen thousand [ah] like twenty two thousand I can understand [lah] but this is only four thousand I thought the cost cost like twenty two thousand something but it's only twenty four thousand
no it's just a a a like advance is is advanced diploma in leadership program that's it
four thousand dollars I also two months of my salary I can pay already you know
then you want you want seven you want to what
stay seven years for that four thousand dollars which is so stupid right then I ask her to go and
and then she signed a contract already [lah] anyway and then then she tell ya and then she tell me about it like like at for she was a proud about the whole thing about the whole thing and then she was telling me and after I question her about four thousand dollars and then she was like quiet
I mean it's true [what] like why don't you think through you know you just anyhow sign and then she I I argued with her [lah] I said like maybe you should go back and they talk talk I mean the contract you can discuss again with #sufian# and #rina# [what] like maybe the four years can bring forward you know like inclusive of the time of study
you know what I mean
I mean even like my sunflower right the cent~ like I got this one teacher who that she's not going to educare [lah] she switch career and she was doing this she went to seek to study by sunflowers being for her but like it include the bond says that it includes her year of study you know they that makes sense [what]
besides that after you graduate then you complete your bond which is like four years after that
which like a total of seven years meaning it's a total of seven years like why you so dumb and at least my friend the one that is in sunflower her course total is twenty six thousand you know
this one is this one is four thousand [eh]
you you know that kind of logic
you you get what I'm saying
ya so I've been I don't know [lah]
I don't know at first she didn't tell me [lah] today after that then I ask I ask her again that I was having lunch with her then I ask her again about it and then she suddenly then she like casually to me it's four thousand I literally look at her like
why
just why are you hearing you yourself I don't know [lah] is it
ya and then I then she say she will talk about it after she say [ah] who knows #rina# she say this you know who knows #rina# have something planned for me like dude
even if #rina# has something planned for you #rina# is planless herself
she just give it to you just for the sake of the it is not because you really earn it you know what I mean
ya that's the whole thing you know like it's so different [eh] in M_U and in sunflower like anybody can be a senior teacher there and like in sunflower you have to work like fifteen years that kind that look at miss #saba#
ya
no because of the boy you know that travis that the the one I told you about
and they never say anything all
I mean ya inform the parents [ah] but we don't want to show the C_C_T_V footage
ya because like like we we as much as possible we never want to show the parents the C_C_T_V [lah] what's going on
ya
ya but like what the hell it's like he was possessed you know
ya really I should have shown you yesterday
ya it's in my phone I have it my phone because I saw the incident happened and then I told jay directly I say you go and check the C_C_T_V you know from one fifty five to two o'clock you see what's going on in that five minutes you know I told her then she really go and see [lah] and she send that the entire whatsapp then everybody like [lah] and then like my because my my is chinese teacher she's very fierce like apparently she she's the only one that he so scared of she made him cry you know
ya you know if I go to this boy and scold him he will just cover his ears and then like walk around
that kind
ya but my my with my he don't dare
ya so that's that that's travis
ya but like the therapist is coming in next week to because we showed the therapist that C_C_T_V footage and then the therapist say she will come in next week to assess him and see how it goes
ya but the thing about this boy is he doesn't do that in front of other people so like when there's strangers he doesn't do this kind of aggressive shit you know
I mean I mean I like to say
bad stuff
I don't know [ah]
and okay okay ya
okay sorry

(um) [eh] but actually you know I was thinking [kan] actually
wait sorry I had to breathe but this kind of conversation right like you know okay if if you are in a production line [kan]
[kan] you should actually like invite
like random people have a conversation random conversation and then pick up ideas from there
and then it's actually quite a good idea
(err)
make a story out of it so technically they're actually if [lah] I don't know if they are using it but then if they're using your stories it's quite interesting [lah]
it's a good way to actually think out of blue because some times when we talk
we we come up with good ideas you know
or out of the world ideas
ya
ya okay
(hmm)
(mm)
C_P_F C_P_F
[ah]
[ah]
okay
(mm) ya [ah]
[ah] okay I
(err)
saying it to the people listening to this (err) we are currently students and if you have any (err)
part
[ah]
we come up with good topics but then the thing about us is we go out of topic as well
I was cutting you so
[oh] twenty seven more minutes
[eh] that's good that's good
but like ten minutes passed by quite
fast
twenty seven twenty seven is not a prime number because it can be divided by three and
nine
what what is a prime number prime number can only be divided by one and the number itself
I think that's the main one of the few takeaways that I have
and currently all my knowledge from J_C [eh]
just gone
statistics [eh]
normal distribution and then upper distribution I think last time I was quite good at it
I told cause I
(err) maybe bell curve also [lah]
no [lah] but actually is is is helpful for those that
(err) don't do well [eh] wait actually no it doesn't
it's helpful for those that actually
actually it doesn't help [hor]
you just fail
[oh] ya actually he's true [ah]
like if you fail
if you fail then bell curve push you to a further fail
but then if you imagine you are a
and then just so just nice that you actually scores sixty out of hundred because you improved by ten ten mark
then bell curve will pull you short again
but I'm trying to see I'm trying to see what's the
what's the rationale or what's the positive thing about this [eh]
no nobody can see your forehead
okay [ah] just saying that if you can see his forehead
his forehead is like
(um)
maybe five metres
overhead [eh] no overhead bridge is four point eight metres [oh] four point five [ah]
[oh] you want to take
class three ya (err)
okay [lah]
[ah] I'll okay because I
if I were to say okay
so I take it okay you try to read my lips [ah]
okay I took I took my license there okay I I because I can't say it because
that place let's call it (um)
[eh] I took my (err) I would say I took as school students so not private [lah]
so I I went through their instructors and everything I would say
(err)
for that particular school right
they actually group you
to a certain instructor which I think is good okay but then a bad
you know nice some like that it's just that
I don't think it's random grouping because from what I heard (err) they actually put it according to a certain category okay so you read my lips again
okay so they put it according to that category and then
but I would say the no [lah] not my age [lah]
maybe
maybe early thirties late twenties but
the only person that can I can only click with one person as a my instructor
and during that time I was like trying to save money so I just pick
I just pick the cheapest lesson [lah] so I cannot choose my instructors so it's always gonna be random among the group of instructors just that I get the group the person I always get right is always the bad instructor sometimes when I drive and
(mm) you think you are correct or not
you think
then I don't know I don't see the point you know
ya some more I I was so pissed [lah] but then
I think at that point I was just still
yes
so the first two times
(err) it was last year twenty fourth december (err) because I remember so twenty fourth december I took
(err) my test and then
(err) it was I think all good the person wanted to pass me but then just because
(err)
but because I didn't give way to bus so he had to put me as immediate failure
ya immediately failure so
even though twenty you must you if you get twenty points you fail
recently then october then I took my test
and then I heard #sharul# ya and then I heard #sharul# ya this year then I heard #sharul# pass then I was so scared I couldn't sleep that night

ya
ya
ya so
[oh] [oh]
[oh] ya ya ya true true true petrol in singapore nowadays very expensive [lah]
thailand
(um) ya so
I see I see
[ah] ya
[ah]
ya
adam needs more convincing to do [lah]
ya
(err) anyway
K
(hmm)
[oh] ya [hor] [eh] but then now that you say but then I I I just remember right that I saw one telegram that it says (err) (um)
have you heard of [ah] what chick chick shake shake tub
it's like chicken chicken and all
so one is for one dollar
we never go at there maybe we can go there [lor] check it out twelve dollar for twelve pieces !wah! #shiok# [sia]

[oh]
me ya
I I also don't know [lah] I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
so
hold a lot of shares [tau] so I think
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
ya (um)
(um)
(mm)
I see I see
but how much [ah] the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
(mm)
ya ya
new (um) way
so
so
right [kan]
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity [lah] because like you know (um)
[eh] not not U_N sorry it's the I_M_F international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward [lah] for
that's why I think (err)
ya possibly because (um) even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
(um) maybe there's one thing we can consider [lah]
so ya
ya so
ya
so (um)
(mm)
okay (um)

it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
[oh] okay okay
[oh]
[oh]
[oh]
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine [ah]
I I'm wondering (uh) honestly curious
[oh] interesting [eh] psychology
!wah!
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify [kan]
ya so may~ maybe [lah] it's the it's the same person [lah] loves animal right
a lot of careers ya
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
[oh] mother's gossip
(uh) maybe we should help [lah] we should help please tell
so (um) it's important [lah] to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized [lah] in
[ah] ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday [lah]

it's like within the
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say [lah] they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
[oh] ya ya how much is it [ah]

(err) with malay oral [lah]
then (err)
aside from that
ya I mean the the least I can do is just like be there [lah] support her and then give her advice
then
ya she she has she seems she seems prepared [ah]
ya towards the later half of the year [lah]
same with close to loofy's birthday is it
[ah]
ya
ya ya #nadia# tried to (err) take up (err) what
the A_D_M right the arts design and media in N_T_U
(err) from the looks of it [ah] I don't think she got in [lah]
ya
[ah] ya the

ya
ya
ya
(mm) she's not really interested into like the business kind [lah] I mean she can do like she encouraged the numbers she can like I think got good numbers [lah] graphs by by chart tax reform

close to that [lah] similar similar stuff

after after graduating [lah] from the university
I almost there [lah] I feel that already ya
ya
[orh]
that's nice that's nice
ya it's quite old right for someone his age to be doing
it's (err) respectable [lah] for the craft of
ya
(mm)
ya understandable [lah]
[oh] ya ya she she's I think five months
so
time right
so
I think my dad and mum pretty excited [ah]
ya
[oh] true true
near #sharmin's# birthday I think
nah who who who I mean
(mm) government [lah] they will know that is more than the allowed number [ah] so
ya it's going to be a small one [lah] only five of us only so
ya it's just one small group of us
ya
you want to try to curb the amount of
interaction
ya normal
(um)
[ah] ya her maternity leave only starts I think in two months time
to work as much because they know she's pregnant then the pandemic so
so that is which which I find it's pretty cool [lah] cause they really understands (uh) their employees
which is what we want to see in the workforce [ah] in the future we work
[ah] [ah] ya he's doing fine [lah] (um)
so most of the time he will be there then if it rains they won't they won't activate him but if it doesn't rain
he'll be activated most of the time [lah] because ya you would you would expect
the equipments to fail you during (err) everyday day to day operations ya
(mm)
ya ya ya my my dad [ah] cause my dad quit before the pandemic thing started so
he was really unemployed [lah] beforehand so anything he you wanted to find a job but he couldn't because people were downsizing ya
cause he's been doing delivery at the site [ah] to to make to at least support my sister because my younger sister ya it's the only one that schooling right he need to pay for her food and
for me I at least I can work right then I can pay for myself so so side issue
(mm)
ya school fee is quite expensive
(mm) I think M_O_E really does a good job [lah] in ensuring that (uh) local students don't pay a lot for the important
cause see ya twelve years the first twelve years (err) no first eight sixteen years of your life ya
until you at least get an O level [seh] ya
ya ya I did
ya four to five [ah]

when I was sec three
it is much more (err) not it's much more harder like much more thinking to do because it's a lot more roles like among us is
(err) you just come
mayor [lah] then like also same same thing like
there the town will like discuss on who is the
ya that's quite cool that's why but it's a it's a quite old game [ah]
but if we're in town of #salem# this one legit have to like a lot more things you have to do to be good at the game
not say I'm good at the game [lah] but like I understand how
people play the game so like
it is actually quite hard to master the game also
but it's not trending anymore
ya something like that [lah] but you have to survive [ah] basically their task is to survive ya [lah] like among us
ya not one impostor like
like mafia mafias like got your three people together
did you watch this (err) youtube

!wah! ya like if I really were to think about something like in depth quite hard [lah] cause I I I want like I wa~ I want mind reading even though I can read people's (err) (err)
even though I can read people no even though I can read people I mean you might not know whether it's hundred percent true maybe it's just eighty percent
correctness but you want it to be like hundred percent right so (mm) mind reading maybe maybe not
(err) printing money apparently I already say if I don't have my wish granted yup I want that (um) teleportation sounds good also

you ask me what (err) what I do that one and
the I forgot what's the other one
I also I also short term memory
[ah]
ya it's the smallest (err) smallest more specialised (err) what you call that
I I don't know if I I don't know but it's very specialized all I can say it's so specialized and there's only a handful of people doing it [lah] it's such a small community
(um) but the best part is ya I'm not prac~ I am not practising it [lah]
I don't want to practise it yup
I'm not practising as in you see now I'm doing so or being instead of doing radiation therapy
ya
so I mean because it's too mec~ mechanical like (um) I deal more with (uh) like all the machine machine instead of people
feel like I'm the I'm the cure for them
instead
here we're going to start the treatment then move here move there perform blah blah blah blah then it's just like that then okay bye take care remember just like that
in a in a way (err) the field [lah] I want to be is actually like (err) psychology kind become a psychiatrist ya but I heard
you will have to go (err) what you call that (err) undergo
undergo clinical hours yourself that means you have to go your own counselling sessions that means you have to be counselled for three hundred hours
something like that [lah] and ya you're not only you have to study but you have to clock in this clinical hours and you have to pay for them yourself
ya you have to pay so yes three
yes correct so three hundred of the hours you have to not only pay the school fees you have to come up with your own money to pay counsellors before you work as one
(uh huh) so that's what deterred me from what I wanna do [lah] unless I can print money right then I mean like

#mengheadache#
(err)
!chey!
(hmm)
like
it's very nice to see elderly people going around and walk
I think botanical garden is known as like we had in our adventures in #pulau ubin# or macritchie because it's really a trail walk
narrow and and like there's only one or two people can squeeze in you know one walkway
[ah] there's crazy monkey out there so be careful they were fighting and I almost like strangle around cause I was still scared
I was like grabbing her neck I didn't realise that just crazy

(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ears

(uh huh)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
(uh huh) (uh huh)
to whack [ah] (uh)
!oi!
ya
ya
it's crazy you know
it's crazy offended by animals and talking about animal I don't really like we'll never in my life going to feed the ostrich
the beak is like
really [ah]
I went I went ostrich farm
then
[ah]
they don't really like (um) sharp
you feel like painful or what
that must be a gentle ostrich K the one I went is a malaysia ostrich
and the baby like bathing the babies
but we don't really get the kangaroo to
come and
is it birds
I like the ducks
well ya man when are we gonna travel back
(uh huh)
nowhere nowhere travel
so that's why they got a cruise or either an airplane by
there's a
you can hop in to nowhere mainly just around the singapore
but there is a waste to do that so I rather do staycation which I'm still reconsidering whether it's worth it or not
staycay we've been doing that in J_B now we can't go there at all
I was
ya
for the living room gonna have [leh]
ya
don't have to go far
ya but but do you think that
once it's reopened do you think it's safe for singaporean to go
what's your thought
that's one
(mmhmm)
[oh]
that's gonna take a longest time
that's dangerous [ah]
now cause
[oh] my god that's crazy and there was like towards the last before it closes down
that's crazy
I hope that
[oh] what do you think what happen if you decided to stay rather than come back
but
you get on board and come back in time
twelve A_M [sia]
just crucial
ya
you know like how disruptive their businesses is having not singaporean coming for them like from their transportation taxis and what else [ah] food (err) shopping outlets whatever the business there is like damn affected of not us coming there
so when you come back I think I felt that where they will last to settle in but on the same time I felt that fight of crime might be higher
thirst and gone hunger for
months without good you know
food on the table or what you know and
ya so they might wanna do something a little bit more negative
you just waiting for chances
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
they have the
assertion
two weeks
(mm) higher
it's actually it's been like one month or two I didn't really keep track of what's happening about COVID
it's getting vary and
I don't know [lah] what else to track like when for me it's like when is this thing will be over
ya
the was [ah]
the worst pandemic
and I can't believe that that that stupid orange hair go and go and got himself [lah] he got COVID and then cured after few days the hell
hospitalised
ya
[kan]
[ah]
(uh huh)
same ya
phase two
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think the annoying part is like okay [ah] aside from business [lah] like how the work function now is
so (um)
thing should become a bit a bit more different or low expectation
okay like I know we can be a bit more creative about working on things but on the same time shouldn't expect much about how many gonna be anticipate on this cause it's the time that everyone gonna go be chao~ chaos
and you know like those especially the loose of job or even if they have job is like a better stay or stick around the job you know I'm gonna do properly
so people are no more playing around you know and and they will likely prioritise your commitment [ah] rather than other things
so ya I think certain thing you have to be a bit more flexible [lah]
both
ya so I don't mind like working
few days and four days at home or vice versa
I mean only some maybe that requires for you to be there physically
ya of course (err) because of your work function [ah] but other than that if there's not a need then I felt that work from home is the best way to go
ya
it's the worst thing what happen
ya but if you work in
semi government or what maybe a bit more strict
like if you
if you are really needed in the office you just have to come back in the office [oh]
it depends on your work already [mah]
ya
ya
(mm)
yup
ya
ya especially I think weddings [ah] weddings most affected [ah]
a batches
ya so we got our friend wed~ wedding coming up in november
(err) but eventually I think we they she have to be very selective [lah] who to invite you know you can't even like if invite those in couples or family those with kids no longer you just if you know the person one person and you just invite at one person [ah] that kind of thing [ah] but also she can't be very
restrict [lah] about two who would potentially can be invited
(um)
it's just (err) sad [lah] didn't get the chance to see that's all about it ya other than that of course we gonna wish everything is the best
cause it's who doesn't want to have like you know like at a dream wedding
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
yup
(mmhmm)
ya
(um) (hmm)
ya must come to terms [lah]
so I think in this pandemic is not a good time to get married
because it's chaos
really
ya man things are harder during pandemic what else was affected
the the the fact that I also like after I climb the stairs then afterwards I feel out of breath wearing the mask

[eh] usually takeaways really spicy I don't know why
[kan] ya ya ya true true true true
I don't know
the Seoul Garden hotpot
(err) I'm not sure I don't know how they cook it [ah]
and my name is #haziqah#
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is H_B_L
by
ya
work is okay [ah] (um) just scanning the I_C and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today [ah]
ya so two more days before friday !woohoo! and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your H_B_L
[oh] so you go back to school all the way
!wow! we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
[ah] the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to con~ be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
[oh] I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause [ah] number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but [eh] actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at N_T_U_C and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having [eh] a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's (uh) I don't think that it is (uh) economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like [oh] hello good morning like greet them and then (um) scan their I_C and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their I_C or the Q_R code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so (um) ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like [oh] my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues [ah] they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
[eh] I don't know [eh] I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
!wow!
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you ra~ you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like [eh] well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example [lor] then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check wi~ with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like !aww! you got a forty seven [oh] I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on (um) students (uh) to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
(um) and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to thr~ like thrive
and like you~ you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right someti~ three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to (um)
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics [lah] so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like [eh] you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like [oh] english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue [oh] and like
[oh] and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like [oh] like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like [eh] you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
(um) only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college J_C for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for M_I no M_I I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena [eh] novena innova innova J_C I_J_C and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to J_C rather than (err) poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into [ah] mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching (um) teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where [eh] you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly [what] that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like (um) india or
at any
any colonised (um) sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce (mmhmm) scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that [lah] that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
(uh) I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this (um) having that divide you know (uh) haiti versus the domino~ dorm~ dormi~ dormi~ domirican~ dormo~ dominican republic
#puerto rican#
!wow!
ya [lor] so
[oh] also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsu~ tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in #jakarta# per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know hi~ high rise water levels are rising
and their [ah] ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world [leh] even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are (um) there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around (um) say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them [what] at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ye~ ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or P_R but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that [lah] even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like [oh] it's graded and it's like shit how like that big transit~ I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a E_M one E_M two E_M three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like [oh] say like in primary school you don't have like [oh] you you have to spend extra year to just complete like P_S_L_E say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then (uh)
I'm tired
stop yawning
!wow! okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
#kaypoh# boy #kaypoh#
(mm)
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue !duh! is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds [ah] cause giraffe tongue is like very
no~ then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's li~ like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with #gingy# though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
(mm)
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
[oh] speaking of that right (uh) there's this tweet saying that (uh) what [ah]
(uh) the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just (uh) what do you call it [ah]
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
[eh] doesn't make sense [oh] is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like (um) south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it
ya
ya
[ah] (um)
like you know they call it the couple ring or something then they sell those pendants or whatever that you can engrave or
(err) that they have pendants phone ya ya ya mug will will be okay they have mugs there also if I know
ya
ya
ya
ya ya ya they have ya
or a tote bag
so my friends right with me know those big tote bags that ya
ya
ya
ya ya
correct correct ya
ya ya
you actually throw things
moving
ya
but if you see her house
it's all only the band band posters things that's on the wall
ya we can do on canva [what] canva you can hook
even the going away party I I want to be selfish I just want it to be us I know I'm I know I sound so selfish but
ya
ya
but inclusive of (err) house owner
ya
(um) like the five of us just a separate one [lah] I think she will appreciate that okay ya ya
(err) ya just more of a
ya it was supposed to be the ninth whatever
ya
ya for me I think it's more of
just [ah] #iskandar# I think they if you see like [ah] anything that is pertaining to family ya or the family like she won't really like
say out you know I think ya I think and that's that
ya
thing
ya
ya
actually that's come a long way man she is the first #nisa# I know
that hung out at like [ah] sarah porch and like we all hang out five of us or four of us
ya she she's come a long way man she just got pissed drunk #nisa#
pissed drunk it used to be like (err) you want some [ah] no no it's okay thank you now it's like [ah] where's the cigarette #yana# where's your cigarette
!aiyo! that girl
know that day like (err) the staycation [lah] with me [ah] it's my birthday [ah]
I I I just lay down on her lap and I just started bawling
like bawling
my emotions I'm like ya I I
no babe it's not just her I think if any of us is like no longer a part of the group or even if let's say some shit happens some drama happen and one person just decide to okay
you know evaporated that's we will feel [one] babe
which I doubt to to be honest I don't think that will happen [lah] I mean
ya [kan]
they even even
ya
ya
at that point of time I was I I understood I understood why sarah
got pissed off about what happened you know what happened right sort of
ish
ya
#tini#
no to #tini# to #tini# so
no so it's not that (um)
on that day
and I was like fuck like
this is not
at the same time yes
correct so so so
like he said a different thing so I couldn't and I just babe okay I can't take it anymore I told #tini#
pizza
so sarah
no she and I and I told #tini# #tini#
(um) this #tini# and then sarah went ballistic already [ah] cause you know she she on her side she knew what happened already also somehow I can't remember
no no she don't know no
no #tini# didn't want to talk [what]
it was very awkward
that's the thing I don't know I think when we came down I don't know maybe cause [oh] maybe cause in the taxi I told her babe actually right no one wants you there I say like it's it's really not a good time cause we want to hang out five of us
(um) and I told her like I feel like this is something that we should talk about so sarah made it clear that she felt like it wasn't in my place to [ah] she she said that
(err) bash thing
I I I don't think I have a single bone in me to do that to a friend and I'm not like that I am not rattle rattle no it's just at that point of time this was but I understand where you're coming from it could have been in better circumstances maybe you could [ah] tell it to us first before you know but at that point of time
I cannot force them to mould them and change how they think about me right correct correct so from like
talk about the the our depths of you know what we feel with with
that she both are being played so jas is just a fucking asshole just it
yes and even sarah ya ya correct
ya you you actually have a group of people who genuinely cares for you who will tell you as it is who will not
#nisa# did #nisa# did
[eh] #nisa# did and then I I put also [eh] #tini# we miss you [ah] we miss you then cut the cake for you I said that [what]
ya so that that was the whole thing and I I I don't babe I don't
I I will never do things like that
hurt
ya
ya right ya
so ya [lah]
then that that was what happened so hope that ya that that exactly we don't I don't come to you and like only only now one year later then we like you know
but ya so that that thing with sarah I felt that there was a little bit of a shift
I cannot just force someone to like trust or som~ ya ya no she trusts me she trusts me is just in terms of
ya which I I which I respect really I I cannot force her to
ya
ya actually normal
ya that's true
ya
of course
ya
ya
you know you talk about all these cliche romantic things like till till death do us part in sickness and in health and all this bullshit it's not bullshit really like it's not it just doesn't apply to a marriage or a boyfriend girlfriend and like
even even with #nisa# sometimes you know like [ah] I'm not comfortable [ah] talking about it like good then I'm like great #nisa# thank you like no I respect that
ya
it's an asian thing also [ah]

then she like he like look at me but I think he he suss me out okay okay this one like okay right then he like walk he walk also he like
trying to see what I'm doing there but then so that was the first time so the second time I I make sure to like I have some files in my hand and
so to make it look like a social work here like like a social worker I was there to do to do work to see all my clients right
so I'm like ya but like it's notorious then like my my boss like #salimah# [lah] I was saying that

#sundilah#
play sports in the H_D_B house to go to normal acad~
#sundilah#
privilege [ah]
wait and the constituency that he's at voted for him he's my constituency
ya
[ah] people's voice
but he was not the
yes correct correct ya and (err) like the the guy I think the secretary
this is who I'm voting
[oh] !wow! congratulations it's like
ya
!wow! #sham#
!wow! I'm so proud of you
!wow!
alright okay
okay
ya okay okay got it
yup
but it's also the whole heavy thing [lah] once again to have to drag in her luggage or or I don't know couldn't tweet
(hmm) send it to her
you name it [lah] they will print it on something and it's digital printing which means you don't need a like must order minimum hundred or what can even give her of our faces to wear on which day today I feel like a #sham# day
today ya ya correct correct
ya ya ya ya ya and when she lonely she can talk to the picture
[ah] guys I need some advice
ya ya okay
so ya I think I think vista print all this website got [ah] and I think this that would be the same website that also makes a photo book
you know what I do after awhile I throw it out I don't like clutter
[eh] I've had to throw all sorts of things in my life in order to like fit it into this house and also when I went overseas to work
much I don't have pictures of people from secondary school all bird fly high hard to catch friends like you hard to forget I don't I I never bothered to keep those things I feel like (um) if you want me you know where to find me [ah] then we can hang out
[ah] I don't I don't know ya so anyway photo book wasn't the best thing [lah] but I thought some pictures or or the other thing is we give her a bunch of pictures that are nicely printed and then we order the thing online say buy from amazon but it to be delivered to where she is [ah]
[ah]
like super glam shit and then we like then can pin the poster have like cool headline or what then write some funny copyrighting for venue and
date you know that kind of thing like date that when
ya ya I know I know I know ya ya ya ya ya and I think actually that's what she prefers too but I suspect when she she said that time that cause she wasn't even sure whether this is happening like whether they're gonna be able to secure the mortgage get the place there and be able to you know actually move [lah]
but then I suspect once it's confirmed there got #iskandar# is settled there is a flight date ticket
confirm she want to meet everybody and his brother so I suspect there will be a bigger thing
I don't know how big is big (err) when where how we're going to do it in groups of five as per the government guidelines
but
but for us I think I don't know is it just come over here and do our usual or is it want to have like a a lovely dinner outside somewhere
okay ya I'd like that
fuck so all these by the end of the month okay
ya I'm ya ya ya and she has this fear of
to do with the two of them yes yes
what are people thinking of me
yes she has
ya ya she's definitely discovered
they flocked to her [ah] all the little malay girls on the floor the little mod girls
they love her
ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
[ah] [ah] [ah]
cause that was the day that you found out I see okay got it
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
ya ya ya ya
fuck [lah] she's such an integral part of the group I'm gonna miss her like hell man
I've had it with you all yup ya ya ya ya ya ya
[ah] my understanding is that the the guy was playing the both of them and then sarah beef
with you was that you were talking about it to both sides
okay
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
ya ya ya ya
so all this was happening like at the same time while he's flirting with sarah he also like cuddling up with #tini# what the hell man
ya ya ya ya ya
yup
!alamak!
(uh huh)
wait this was the day we went to eat pizza
fish I didn't know the pizza had such undertones so when you brought up pizza thing I thought you had something to do with she coming but not feeling like eating but then is it she no need to contribute to the bill you know I thought it was that sort of like bill and who pays what drama fuck okay okay okay
yes
yup
yup
ya
so did sarah know that jas was doing this with #tini#
she didn't know either okay got it
[ah]
ya ya ya ya ya ya
so what was #tini# first reaction then when you said she went bitch mode
okay
[ah]
ya ya ya ya ya okay
then she come down for what
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
right
[ah] [ah] [ah]
okay
that's right
ya okay got it
yup
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya yup
that is not nice explain
like a party girl no
yup
ya that's the you cannot correct correct you can't mould other people's perceptions [lah] ya ya ya
[ah] that jas is playing that jas correct correct cause #tini# was like totally completely oblivious to it right she didn't know ya she didn't know sarah didn't know as well but #tini# felt like the person who was
losing her heart over him [ah] it sounds like it like like #tini# really was quite set on it being rather serious
ya
ya ya ya ya ya so it's a it's a big deal for and she must have been really hurt
(mm)
when there are friendly things you don't rec~ reciprocate ya
(mm)
ya ya ya ya I remember that
ya
okay
just even indulge in gossip you get what I mean ya ya I know you don't do that either
okay
ya ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
yes
ya ya ya ya you you have no control over this [lah] ya
yup
so probably just a bit more careful [lah] when how she speaks [lah]
yup yup yup yup yup yup
I mean one wishes it never happen in the first place but friendships will go up and down [lah] it's like that [lah] sometimes there are just little areas you don't go to finish ya ya I think it's it's it
it's the sort of thing that you think about when you are thinking about how valuable is this person to me what sort of a friend it is it's not just the happy moments that you will think about but it's also about the bad moments that you guys were able to patch up together and that I think really adds to the value of the friendship you know the amount of work you put into it
ya
yup
correct obviously there's a lot of censorship going on yes ya
friction
yup
yup
yup yup yup yup it's how you then deal with it together that matters
ya
ya ya ya
yes #nisa# likes to set boundaries you know I like I like I've learnt a lot about setting boundaries from how #nisa# does it I'm afraid I'm not comfortable with this so I'm not going to do it ya and and it's
it it comes as a surprise to people that I use it on I don't know if it's cause maybe when I say it I don't see it as nicely or sweetly as #nisa# but I've noticed a lot of people like eyebrows raised when I draw this kind of boundaries
I I really think that's missing [ah] in schools [ah] how to politely draw line you know
[ah] [ah] correct and it can be done very politely no one's trying to hurt your feelings here you know
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
there was definitely silence after I said that like it hung in the room for awhile
three seconds then (err) then continue [lah] but I was
truly unapologetic cause it was too late at night and my brain was just ya not having it like I don't even have the capacity to have it even if I wanted to you know I don't have the capacity sorry it's too late
(err)
[oh] okay okay okay
[oh] okay so there is a possibility he might come is it [oh] okay cool
[ah] [eh] I can't talk now I'm sorry I'm doing the recording [ah]
[oh] [oh] ya dude we were just talking about you
or maybe he has left okay
okay so I don't know do you want like tackle the questions that we had okay we are halfway through so it's not too bad (um) but ya
it's taking a bit longer than expected cause I think it's cause the antibiotics are making my mouth like damn dry so next time I do this [sia] I need water need what what
god I hate this medication so much
!huh! natural things
no cause it's it it's means it put in effort if somebody just walks up to me and give it to me now I will gladly drink it I will so gladly drink it I just can't be asked even get up go to the toilet cause it hurts so I'm not gonna go and no I don't think so
I don't think so
did not reply to message until next day five o'clock like hello ya hi no not today I'm not coming today I got I got migraine
!huh! I don't know why the soldiers didn't cook in the tank [sia]
like steamboat [ah] [oh] inside the tank got aircon
singa~ singapore
as long as I got my aircon
okay ya so I saw all that but then I think later on in the day I saw one facebook video of like tank it was quite surreal the tank go past but the the guy whose job it is to kill people with this tank is just waving very happily I'm like !wow! this isn't what I'm paying my soldiers for you know who ask you to wave
[ah] okay but can't see it [ah]
ya ya ya ya ya
[oh] that's cool
I was working that night (mm) (mm)
(err)
ya I don't know why cause ya it was interesting it was just so uneventful
(err) if you could
[oh] god I completely forgot all the questions I don't know what they want
memorable meal
you know I can't even think of one
okay maybe got one where my boss brings us to this like restaurant in #bali# it's called mosaic and it was super fucking posh and not just that but it was it took indonesian
and then wove it all into a menu that was that told a story [ah] from start to end and then at each point for each dish
that's such a great way to make it like another dimension you know to add on that's cool
off the top of your head
okay
[oh]
[ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah] [oh] my god then you just take the whole thing [ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
don't break don't break
yup

#tampines# ya got
so that's the end station in mind
ya zoo is #ang mo kio# [lah] ya ya ya
ya that used to be my commute !wah! and another way that I used to commute was how [ah] [oh] no this one is when I go home time I take from the zoo but then I stop somewhere along thomson road upper thomson there then I take a bus down I walk there I come down to braddell braddell view then I walk home [ah]
it was a nice walk home
today is
to get a response so I guess it hasn't been three weeks but I'm also a bit sad
accordingly [lah] cause I will be putting in a lot more work (um) then the other concern is also when I went online when I tried to look for like you know services like this [kan]
I want to lie in bed and watch T_V
so I guess not having it is something we've been saying recently [ah] not having it
I I haven't heard it you started using it
not having it
no mood [ah]
then it doesn't help that my stupid boils keep happening
and I'm so incapacitated
okay so that was memorable meal
that took awhile
okay cool
ya also I provided an update about my current job hunt tight situation
[oh] (um)
I I don't remember one
[oh] if people didn't have to work what would they do right
okay so this is
[ah] actually it is I like this things
like I I if I really had money right then I didn't have to worry about food then I would I don't know then maybe I might be asked to cook cause I know I can buy whatever ingredient I want for example you know

his name is ryan and he works at the ant museum at #katong# for little while he was the favourite of all the mothers
(mm) (mm)
so confidently
ya he had a very good (err) speaking persona unlike unlike his other there's one other colleague girl I think was quite good
but there was know there was one guy that I was like like making serious enquiries [lah] about how much actually is it gonna cost me to come up with my own anterrium and all these and he was
a bit like don't really answer the question and will roam the point a bit before getting into it be like [oh] okay
of course
but of course
you think he knows

ya I think it's no more it was extended for awhile but I'm very sure COVID would have closed it [lah] it's too small and too (um)
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
[oh] okay okay okay then get into it like damn obsessively and do terrariums that are like artistic
I think those books ruin a lot of young women you know
I don't know they were fun !haiya! I definitely went through a period of them I even use to shoplift them these romance novels ya man but then you know what I do or not will take out and then put the ones I took the last time

so a lot of brown people step forward [lah] as supposed to chinese people little things like that you know
and it didn't occur to me even that I had that I didn't have this privileges
that wasn't my point my point was one guy towards the back of the room who obviously grow up with a lot of privileges crying [ah] sobbing like a baby cause that exercise got to him to the point where he just felt like
had it right but no [lah] the the it's just the way he cried it it really reminded me of what you were saying about the younger people in R_I who see the world a bit differently but then they don't understand why everything cannot be equal you know whereas for us
so then maybe that was a shock to our system compared to them who was already born with a world where you cannot expect anything will happen at any time ya maybe for them it's a different way of looking at things I don't know

(err)
like
my name is #hazifah#
fifteen</P1>
ya
so
sure (um) H_B_L doesn't really suck you know
home based learning it's to me it's flexible but I get tired really easily cause I just get very side tracked
by food and everything else that's at home it's hard I mean you are out quite often so ya I always end up sleeping when you come home you know
ya
so how is work
ya
I mean we gotta live with it for now that ya don't have a choice we have to like I mean phase two is in on nineteen june
sixteen I think
[oh] ya
I think I think I will still be at home until this whole corona thing ends
[ah] this week is my last week so next week [ah]
ya next week sec two's and sec one's are having their last week of H_B_L as well and then a~ a~ the week after that we completely normal
!wow!
ya if me I will just stay home I mean that's what I do quite often I come home right after school cause I don't really find the need to go out with this corona thing especially with the mask definitely not going out
I mean at least your place has aircon you know I'm in like a classroom with fans and it's so sweaty like if after [ah] physical education right (uh) we we'll take off our mask during physical education but then we're all like one two metres apart or something like that and then
(um) when we walk back to class we have to wear back our mask and like we're really sweaty and it's like really uncomfortable then we have to sit in the class and do our class work and stuff
ya but no contact no sharing of equipments and completely like I'm here right I'm like it's like one or two metres apart I think two
we don't play sports we just exercise so they will show like videos of (uh) people exercising and then we'll just join I mean that's so far I had my first lesson [ah] my first physical education lesson was to do exercise to (um)
like follow what like there's this youtube thing that they on and then we like follow what they do basically like your squats your lunges and all those things and basically on your own kind of thing [ah] so ya sort of boring
(mmhmm) it's kind of boring but you gotta live with it and like participate cause it's school you know
like keep I kept eating it in class cause I was like hungry and I was trying to I was trying really hard to stay awake in class and and (um) it was low-key hard but after like eating one or two right I think it got like at the (uh) edge of my lips
so it started to like stain (uh) the~ sort of quote on quote stain on my cloth mask and then (uh) ya it end up becoming really smelly
ya
ya and then the and then the taste is like a bit sourish not really sour but a bit off not exactly super sweet kinda taste then ya but I still ate it cause I was really hungry LOL
ya it stink and then it stink for the whole week because I only wash my cloth once a week
(mmhmm)
ya so not to mention how it's more environmentally friendly but one thing I don't like about the disposable mask right it hurts my ears like the tip of my ears here right where it holds your thing it hurts for me like I can wear it I wore it my friend gave me a disposable one and I kept it in the ziploc bag that we have to bring for physical education like every time we have that lesson
so I tried wearing it in class cause my nose was really wet and I was really sweaty cause I just came back from (um) P_E and then I wore the I wore the disposable one and my ears was like hurting I think cause I was fidgeting with it a lot and also cause it's really big on me I think I need the baby ones
ya all my friends like they wear the adult size and they're all like fit's perfectly fine like even the elastic it's like nicely fitting it's not pulling too hard or what but for me I'm just like it's like what's the point of wearing it's so loose
ya and then the new gover~ the new mask that the government gave right recently is so thick like really thick and it's so uncomfortable and like when you talk right it's so muffled like it's worse than the first one
sticks to your face
like if you sweat right it sticks to your face
(hmm) I mean if you don't go out often you wear disposable mask okay [lah] you can reuse the mask every once in awhile depends how long you wear it
rich people things
I mean maybe they reuse the mask and like for maybe like two three maybe four times or like a whole week you know
same
ya I know I do that everyday and then the first day I went back right and then (uh) I I had to fold in my mask I fold in you fold out right I fold in and then (um) my friend was apparently she was indirecting me she was like cause at the side or at my jaw there right it it like comes out it flips out so it looks like fish
I mean she didn't say that [lah] but she didn't really told my friend and then (uh) ya and she indirect me I know it was me but like I just like (mm) whatever [lah]
honestly school kinda suck I I really don't I don't exactly like school cause I just don't wanna see my friends okay it's not all my friends basically just the girls except one girl and I wanna see my guy friends cause like damn they the bomb they like my family
(mmhmm)
I know right (mm) I don't know I just feel girls can get very toxic I feel my only quote on quote girl friend is my sister
shade on you
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but like they come there are like times where they can get really toxic where like like you say [ah] like out of jealousy or like whatever something like that like and so the other time I pass my math right for the first time i~ in secondary school so I pass my math
and then they all looking at their marks and then they will start comparing and stuff right and then they looked at my marks and they were like (uh) they were like (uh) smart [lor] something like that [lah] they will say something and then they'll be like smart [lor] or like good for you [lor] and then I'm just like (mm) okay mean
she didn't understand you could have asked the teacher
(mmhmm)
it's hard [lah] because ya we're competing against at the end of the day when it comes to O and N's we are competing each other so it's hard but at the same time it's also how to how like the maturity level is not saying that I am mature I I can be very immature but like
i~ it like talking about this right like maybe they don't talk about this kinda things but maybe it's their only way they see it to like you know okay I don't know what I'm saying but (um)
(um) I'm just tryna say the maturity level that's all
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
eight
eight to three ei~ eight to two something
(mmhmm)
(mm)
!wow! I study geography yet I only learn about climate change
(mm) ya
I mean actually (um) what you said about the singapore not having (uh) the other thing about speech blah blah thing [ah] (um) there's this thing where I learn in I think in english or something we had this thing where we can speak to the government about things
it's just not really open I guess I think you have to like make an appointment and then and then they will then I think you have to be there and then they will have this they have a conversation about it and then ya and also back to the education thing
they make us think about what we wanna do very early and it's really to me I find it really hard because what if I end up losing interest in that thing what if I don't wanna pursue it anymore can I just change into something else or the thing is it takes like a whole you might have to go back like if you wanna take
(um) engineering or something and then you lose interest in that and then you then you get interested in business you have to like take you have to go back to poly after you finish your engineering or something like that and then you have to go to poly and do your your (um) business
it's like very hard to choose what you wanna do and if you wanna stay there forever
(mmhmm)
maybe you can use your architecture skills to like you say you want to help people right maybe you can like I don't know build homes for those in need or (um) you know like help those organisation that that need architectures to like build houses or like whatever that is needed
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
haiti where that
wait is haiti a country
how do I not know that
[oh] (uh) the
nevermind I was thinking a certain TikTok saying so it's like this girl is like a maid and she's something like
she's like a mixed and then she mix the two names together and then she ya okay I'm done
funny
it's hard I mean the world is all fighting to be better to be like better than the other country and ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) for sure
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
cause like
ya
(mmhmm)
ya ya getting neglected is hard
at least to me it's being neglected (um) okay maybe that's how I see it I don't know about them but I mean all they do is talk about work and it's tiring ya it's like tiring to listen to it like everyday even though you sit down at the table just to have a nice meal and even if I'm there right
all they do is talk about work and like when I tell them to give it a break right they will like they will be like (uh) who give you the allowance and stuff like that and it's like !wah! I just wanted to have a nice family lunch but you just gotta bring up about work and like
that's all they do this all they talk about like if I go into their room at like at night right before they sleep they're always talking about work and this morning when mama was awake she was on the comp then she was trying to find ways to like like do (um) amazon stuff
and I mean I get it [lah] like you awake your mind is fresh and you wanna get some information about it inside whatever [lah] but like when it comes to family dinner or family lunch they just cannot stop talking about and it's so hard
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya and now that makes money plus people I think money weighs more than people
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but the good thing is that we have (err) government subsidies for hospital I think do we I don't know but there are like cool advantages of being singaporean at the same time it's also really hard to be one because of all the work
that's that is (um) on us put on us I mean even as a student I feel like there's a lot to do cause you know we got so many subjects at hand it feels like work not for my own kind of thing
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
streams
you know they stop you know they have (uh) my school is spelt as one H one O one U one G one A one N not gonna lie this year sec one is just kind of bad I think we got my school got trend twice I think by sec ones
and it's like bad and [oh] my god I'm sorry to say I really don't like the sec ones they are hella annoying okay maybe I was annoying but at least I wasn't like chaotic I wasn't out of hand kinda student I was still like
I was still like [sia] I was just really loud in my cohort okay maybe in just N_A stream I was just really loud I was known to be really loud
ya I was really a big mouth but like at the same time (um) then when it came to sec two I really tone down like I really like you couldn't really hear me anymore
it's not I washed it okay I wash it every once in awhile when it gets dirty
I mean it's dirty you eat on it you eat all your what you eat [ah] you eat your sensations at least I don't eat on my one
cause
it's my baby it's not wrong it's like my child it's like my cat but I don't bring my cat everywhere cause he doesn't really like to be around me twenty four seven so
ya
[ah] my eye's getting itchy
low-key think there's something inside [ah]
same
making me yawn
ya we got this it's fun though to do this
(mmhmm)
ya even though we have to like lock the room door and put please do not enter we are recording okay that's my that's my (um)
ya that is on me because like our last recording (um) #harith# was there and you know it's like noisy
I mean he likes to be in our room cause it's cooling cause his room is really warm cause now he has his bird right if I open the window right the bird just keep looking at the window and then if you like then I have to close it and be like what do you want ya I'll close it and he will like he'll look at the window then he will look away it's like ya don't ever open it
or not I'll beat your ass and the bird's really cute has really weird name though
there's nothing to be scared about I know she will just bite you but if it's bites you right it's (um) playful kind of bite it's to get to know you bite I had to deal with that for like the first few days he was here I mean he hasn't been here for very long but my index finger on my right hand right there's like the place where you bend
there's like a drop here that's where he continuously kept biting that and it's like really painful now cause he used the end of his beak to bite compared to sometimes when like cause his beak is curved right then your hand will like nicely fit so that's how he but then you will like his tongue will start moving it's like really weird but it's it's not really obvious but he's quite friendly one we just cannot make sudden movements he gets really scared sometimes
ya then you don't want to traumatise him
it's a bit like a giraffe's tongue it's not long though but it's similar to a giraffe's tongue somewhat similar
ya I'm tryna say it's like a giraffe tongue but like (uh) divide by like one million of it's size that's how small a a birds tongue is is like cute but yet when you first see it is like kinda weird after awhile you just really get used to it
he made a hole on my phone case I wanna cry
I gave him the old phone case he walk away [sia] and then no the thing is he likes the bright coloured one but he doesn't like the black one and then #harith# tried to put his phone case and then he went forward but with my phone case right the purple one he keeps coming forward but with the black one he's like nope I'm out
iphone is flat
he does
okay maybe he doesn't he just kinda goes forward and then he's like nah that's not that's not nice then he walks away then he comes back to my phone case and I'm just like stop it please ya
ya man that's you you cannot you you don't seem to bond with them I even if it's not yours can still born with it but you just refused to
you just it's just that some cats right you need more time to bond
you don't if like if have those like like honey for example
he isn't exactly bonded with you at most like if he sleeps on the bed right and then you need to you wanna lie down on the bed too he doesn't mind you just being there even with he's okay if she just sleep and then he's behind he's like okay sure
but like with me right he is K at least I feel very bonded with him cause you know I feed him every day and then I stroke him and like I I spend always carry him to me I spend a lot of time with him I feel like I've bonded with him it's that special bond that you feel when you have like your own pet
I mean you don't necessarily have to get own pete but if you do get hamsters so our house can be a mini zoo (oo) I'm really hoping honey and and swain gets to know like gets to like know bonded
and so that they can
no so that I can let honey go as in ha~ when yesterday I let honey sit in the room right cause I was doing math (uh) I was doing my math class at the end of the day as well at about one forty one plus
one forty-ish so I was having lesson so I let honey in then I on the aircon then I was listening to class and then swain was in the cage and then honey I brought I took #harith# chair and brought it closer to honey I put honey on
no closer to swain I put honey on the chair and then I push the chair closer to swain's cage so honey was just really looking at swain for like a good what half an hour forty five minutes and then after a while [ah] I took honey and I cut his claw and then (um) and then #harith# took out swain
and then I held honey and then honey tried to interact with swain by smelling him but of course swain was like no I'm scared and then he run
and then after that ya so that was the end of yesterday's bonding and then today's bonding they sort of came closer a lot faster but at the same time honey was really scared okay not really
K at first when honey got scared when swain started like trying to smell him or like or like if the paw touch his body or whatever right he start to flinch and #harith# thought it was me but not me I'm not retarded
but ya honey flinched and then honey was like (um) and then after a while he started to be honey started to like (uh) get
really he got really uncomfortable after I kept trying to like put his paw on swain I did take his paw and kind of pat swain but then when swain turn around he flinched
I think honey is more terrified of swain than swain being terrified of honey
but then isn't jerry a ha~ mouse
true
but it's quite cute though and then when mama came right swain was really scared cause I think mama was standing even if I stand right swain get scared
so I think cause mama was standing so swain was a bit scared to like move towards honey also cause they were warming up honey just came into the room
bro #harith# room is so hot like it's really warm and humid and has like [oh] my god
I (um) (um) the dream you had (um) I
they want to be friends
or maybe they're friends
but maybe they wanna be friends but like
but then but then you know tom tom maybe jerry doesn't know how to interact so he just keeps like ya you know
ya deep thoughts deep thoughts
(mmhmm)
I think I think spongebob and tom and jerry have very deep meaning because family guy and like simpsons they have a more direct meaning
but the thing is spongebob and tom and jerry they're very simple but if you look at like many more different perspective right like there's different meanings but
with simpsons and and family guy and those si~ similar shows right they don't you don't really look at exactly different perspectives because they have like voices they have like constantly talking and it's a more complex quote on quote complex
talking compared to spongebob spongebob cause it's like kids talking get what I'm tryna say
[oh] my god
it's like it's like
it's like if you have talking right you can understand it so maybe it has a somewhat direct meaning maybe what you're you're what you are listening to is that's what it actually means but whereas you look at tom and jerry and and
you look at tom and jerry and what's the other show spongebob cause spongebob from the way their conversations are right is like very very simple
(mmhmm) true
(mmhmm)

why what did she say
is it really a bre~ is it really even even a break up
ya [lah] because honestly he like how to say say (uh) he says like back then like [oh] we're not together you know like we're just friends
but they act like they are together but the whole point of a relationship is the act [lah] not the just the label so basically he he was together actually because he like spend all the time with her
like they eat together then hang out together it's basically like dating [lah] even though he doesn't want to say that it's dating but the fact that it actually is what it is isn't even if he denies the the label and doesn't want to put the name on it
it is what it is you know
to what
when when was this
they will just they will just we'll we'll you and me will be third and fourth wheels [eh] no the thing is right they say they say they are not dating but they totally act like they are dating remember they do all those cringey things in front of us
!haiya! you know I don't know [lah]
like you know when when friends in like when two people in your friend group go date each other then they break up that just sucks [lah] it's like
it's just annoying I think it's just like why you all got to date each other can you just find somebody else outside your friend group
but that's what I want I think like if I want to find I'll just find someone out of my friend group cause like it's so annoying right like there's some some like friend groups will fracture because of a break up of relationship inside their friend group

sunday I'm supposed to supposed to go meet adela and #menaz#
I can't be bothered [lah]
no (uh) the part with adela I'm just like
(uh) you know
what do you mean
no adela wants to meet us because she just broke up
she has but I (uh) I don't know I think she wants a guy guy's opinion I don't know
what is against her
cause she's cause she's being stupid that's why
it's not it's not the fact no I feel like it's just it's not her it's not just like girls it's it's her okay
it's like
she does okay she has a lot of problems
!wow!
the [ah] I already told you [what] that time feel a bit lazy to say
no like she has such a
she has such she's such a bad unhealthy view on relationships
like she so she's so disgusting how she treats she expects a guy her boyfriend to treat her like she she like keep saying like [oh] I I want a boyfriend so that he can buy me free food
[eh] you know all these all these movement by girls like all men are trash all men are trash kill all men you know what girls are actually trash also
no [ah] you're not [lah]
that's why I don't say all girls are trash [ah] like the the the the the phrase
but you know girls are equally trash also like I when I hear adela talk about how sh~ what her what her ideal guy is like damn disgusting [sial]
like she keep saying about
(um) she keep telling telling us like [oh] I want a boyfriend so he can buy me free food like so she can buy he can buy for me (err) clothes and I can take his clothes
it's like it's so materialistic and it's so disg~ like you know like she's like using the guy to spend on her
I think she's (um)
teachers and I think she's a middle class like okay
as a student in singapore you're basically poor that's what you are but she lives in a maisonette
and her father drives audi A five I think
ya but
I but you know that's the thing like okay your parents may be rich but you are not rich you know what I mean
unless like your f~ they constantly give you money and like
ya that's still their parents money like once you're
like once you're how to say you want to marry or something or you move out the house
like are they really going to keep giving you money
she's stable [lah]
because she has that's exactly that's what I'm saying we keep saying men are trash girls are also trash okay
exactly and then that's what girls always say no [lah] (uh) whe~ when the girl's the exception they say (uh) no [lah] she's just the exception exception like
like [eh] enough
black lives matter
no she's not
no she too dense to think about it
sometimes no [lah] she doesn't
shut up
okay she's not attitude problem but she's just very bimbo to associates
and and then it's okay when back in secondary school when you're still a very young girl
but now that you are twenty two or twenty one is become has become very
like
just grow up you know what I mean like
you're supposed to be like matured already and
think about other people and like not have this kind of views but she's the same old adela from secondary school
(uh) it's just I think it's just
mostly down to herself
because if you you can't blame your your partne~ your your ex for
behaving a certain way also [what] like the only reason why you don't develop because you don't want to
mature yourself and like grow up you know I mean
how I know tinder instagram I don't know
what else man
nowadays nowadays is all
it's slide sliding to the arms
what
ya you see #afiq# now he wishes if he he doesn't have a boyfriend (uh) girlfriend

the materials
[ah] I check after

that's why so maybe she wants to talk about it I don't know
[a'ah] maybe
no [lah] no [lah] I don't think so also [lah] but I don't think I don't think so [lah] like yo~ I didn't think you I didn't even think she wanted to talk about it until you you mentioned about the filming
who's asking to meet you also
[oh] what was I going to say [ah] [oh] ya she wanted to invite #syakif# also #syakif# and #irfan# to come

what
you're not what you're not you're just jealous of us
you wish you had you wish your group was this hype

you're just jealous bro okay I'm not the
I I might I might end up (um) going
I just because they are like very on so I just might end up just going eas~ east coast park with them and cycle with them
cause the rest all useless
no they're supposed no they're supposed to help me ya like okay then they're like no it no it's not it's not okay cause I need to know
when there are free like if you tell me a date like you know how how like if I if I suggest something then let's say like
everybody say okay then the one person who didn't reply suddenly say [oh] I cannot on this day then why you never tell me in the first place
who says like whatever you can just message me it's like
there's like no no no
then (err) that's why I just like just leave it [lah] never
I never go plan [lah] I just like [ah] whatever [lah] you all don't want to go then I also don't want to go (uh) I go with somebody else
you know did #syazwana# [what]
okay [lah] I don't know I don't even [oh] [ah] actually you know I don't even I don't even like
really like vibe with them like you know like vibe vibe with them
but at this at this rate I'm just like whatever I'll just like do it [lah]
whatever it is I'll just try
[oh] I might no~ not you know I'll just like
basically what I'm saying right now is also just to fill up the
right whatever I'm saying right now is just to fill up the conversation so so sometimes I'll just say bullshit but you know it's not actually
just trying to fill up the conve~ the one hour
why does it feel why does it feel so much harder to like talk about
ya
or we can sing another thing we can sing okay [lah] sing [oh] no it's not singlish [what] if we sing
we are
okay then
are you kidding me
are you kidding me she has five bikes from who from where
[oh] my god dude I will go with #faz# and you
and #afiq# okay forget about #amar# okay if #amar# don't want to go
why
what
but he's been working so much
this is just one time and it's not even that expensive dude
no but the the thing is if he wants to rent that that tricycle thing it's way more expensive than renting a bike you know so it makes no sense
a double bike is way more expensive than a single bike okay it's not even like dou~ because it's double bike it's two times it's not
okay you can just ride on your own so I don't think that's the case
and and also and also
also he
when I talk about the food then he want to go
so what it just doesn't add up
are they all adult size
where is her bike where she live
how we supposed to bring #jurong# #jurong# west bikes all five of them to E_C_P
west coast has (uh) is there any does it have a good cycling
because I know E_C_P [one] is very good
are you mad
I I don't I don't mind [lah] but I haven't exercised in so long I think I can pass away
I scared like one as I I ju~ just one the like the chances of
one out of the five of us probably will have like
!hey! guys I cannot already
you know [ah] west coast wes~ west coast east coast is
it's going to take a whole day you know
(um)
I want I want I want I want I want I want to go I want to go
okay then I just ask #afiq#
that
but does
does #fazirah# want #amar# to come
okay so so if anything just four of us [ah]
!huh! really [ah]
really
I don't want I don't want
I know but
is not !huh!
how do I put it
I wouldn't be comfortable
like like like okay I'm sure he's a he's a nice dude and stuff but
not like I don't not like him just that
it'll be more awkward and I'll have to like
ya
okay [lah]
you all somebody has to plan it's always like
it's always like when somebody says something like I want to go here then everybody is like [oh] ya ya okay I ons I ons everybody ons then nobody plan
it's not my bike so #faz# has to plan it
ya
I don't know member of parliament general election
was it I don't know I anyhow only
M_P_G_E I don't know what's that
ya I'm not sure I'm in a group yet
mine mine when I message the person she said
(uh) I'll be added to the group
on
monday
I think
I'm not sure
maybe
but I already got my location
ya
[oh] I got my dates on elev~ eighth and and eighth of july and eleventh
ya you got what
you got nine and ten [ah]
wait isn't voting day just one day
I don't know actually
pioneer some people will vote on the ninth and tenth
so what do they do I if I setup on the eighth who's going to setup what on ninth
that's election officials that's li~ that's not us we are doing setting up only
by because I know because my sister is
(err) election my sister-in-law is a election official
that means she'll be probably be there manning the polling booths [lah] the voting booths
ya she told me cause she N_E_A she al~ she also does the
does the safe~ she does the safety distancing ambassador thing like she goes around
like hawker centres making sure people practise safe social distancing
[eh] hello
of course [lah]
(err) no
I don't know got
if you go hawker centres they have as in like in groups of five cannot mix with another group of five okay for example
because got no safety distancing ambassadors there and everybody's an idiot
ya exactly they say groups of five go out then after that they go more than group of five groups of five they get corona then
serves them right
is it
I think ya the last five minutes right we try to speak malay
cause I scared got not enough malay
it's now forty nine thirty three for me what's yours
forty nine forty now
okay same
[eh] I feel really good about liverpool [ah] about man city beating liverpool
cause liverpool suck [ah]
they won already they won already
but man city beat them yesterday
no it's just a
no it's ju~ they won the the match
you understand but they didn't win the league
no okay a league how you win the league how you win the league
is that
you will
there's like thirty plus teams in the league right
so
you have your home and away matches
so basically (uh) you will fight every team at home so means your stadium and then you will go to their stadium and fight them again
so a win means three points
you your team earns three points
a draw means one point
and a lost is zero points
so basically
you have like sixty plus matches
in the league right
because it's just thirty times two [what]
so
you try to
collect the most points
(err) then the most points win [lah] win the league
so it reaches a point where hello
okay so they it liverpool reached the point in the
in the season where they
where they mathematically (uh) mathematically no other team can beat them on points
so that means they reached high enough far enough that
even if the second place team wins all the the rest of their remaining matches their points their point tally cannot go above
liverpool's
(err) point tally
so that's why they won the league
ya so they they want to win the league early [lah] so so to speak
it's it's fair [lah] as in like they were good that means they won it already that means they were they were good [lah]
ya it's fair
no how is that not fair how is that not fair
it's fair
ya
but so so liverpool already won the league
and then
(err) but you still have the remaining matches [what]
to be played
to be played
you cannot cut the league short because
even though first place has been decided second third fourth fifth sixth all the way to thirty has not been decided
[eh] wait I'm not sure how many teams there are I think is twenty four [oh] my god not thirty [ah] forget [ah] forget how many matches there are but you get what I mean
so [oh] my god wait it's not even thirty I think it's like sixteen or eighteen
can't be that many teams in a league
okay wait I think it's like
nineteen teams [ah] or some for~ or forty te~ or twenty teams [ah] twenty plus teams [lah] not thirty plus
so is twenty plus teams okay so
it was like so like you cannot stop the league at when the first place when the first place has been decided [what]
cause you need to find out who can come second third fourth fifth all the way to twenty plus all the way to the last right
and then la~ the the three last teams will get relegated
they go down a league
they go to a lower division league
it means you don't compete in the premier league anymore
and then
the one in the lower division league their top
three
if I'm not wrong top three their top top three teams will go up to premier league
ya
so
tha~ that's how a season works
how's it so hard to understand
okay (uh) right now it's like fifty four
(err)
(mm) (uh)
[oh]
okay what is sentence in malay
[ah]
ya then
(um)
like it's like compartmentalized already my brain like if I speak
like formal malay like no english words will accidentally go in but if I speak like
slang malay like accidentally english words you just go inside
like unconsciously
I think I know what you speak malay I speak english
is or or we can can we even do that
is it is it alright like
but they said
(err) speak in full sentences
of malay
as in you are speaking full sentences
what do you mean by you make a lot of some
you know what forget it let's just stop speaking ma~ speaking in malay anymore
but that was not bad [lah] !huh!
my malay not bad [what] just now
but it's still proper [what]
what do you mean it makes sense
[eh] should we stop now
okay you just continue your continue your thing
they're always hiring dude
like almost all the time
as a what as a keeper
don't want [lah]
[ah] are we going to stop the recording now
okay let me check the instructions see what
you keep talking
to just fill up the the the conversation [lah]
I think we can just end it [lah] [ah]
okay press the red button okay ya on the count of one on one okay like just now okay three two one
okay
okay so what did you do today
hello
hello
okay
okay
okay
(um) so if it turns red is it audible or not
[oh] okay okay
okay I understand
okay I get you
here we go
so we have to finish at ten thirty nine

and it turns out to be some insurance company
ya they they're basically trying to sell insurance
ya exactly and I didn't know that I thought it was just some fitness like workout healthy health program something like that
he probably doesn't know ya that's why
so they called me just now to have a meeting
like

then I just I just went like I just attended the meeting [ah] and then after that they like the the
the membership the program itself is like it's quite interesting you need to like you only have to clock in ten thousand steps a day like for five days out of seven days a week and then you get like cashback you get like vouchers and stuff like that which I thought was pretty cool
but then after that they started asking me about my savings
like they started to ask me like (err) are you are you a a thrifty spender like how do you save your monthly allowance like when do you receive your allowance when they kind of thing and then
I was like [oh] this one confirm want to sell insurance right and then I just like [oh] then I just answered their questions and then after that ya they asked me if I was interested in a savings (err) savings plan with them

when you deposit money [lah] whatever you know you get the interest returns right like how many percentage per annum that kind of thing
so they are trying to like like coerce you [ah] okay like you know like it's so
like for example P_O_S_B's (um) per annum is I think zero point zero five or something like that but then they're offering three to four percent
which is actually a lot [lah] and it's like when they showed me the like they they generated the (err) returns and like the the sum assured and stuff like that and then I saw the paper and everything and then like [eh] can earn big bucks [sia] actually from this but it's not an investment it's just a savings plan
but ya ya they give you interest
ya [lah] that's why I don't want
but then

you know her [kan] ya you know her she tried cooking
no and then you know her mum was like hospitalised for a week
serious
because
sebagai orang islam kan kita semua terrorist tu semua you know</H1>
ya even though I hate doing laundry so heavy but ya and then like (uh) you know in malaysia the the women's army actually wears hijab
ya
which I don't want to do [lah] I mean I don't know about you but just walking ten minutes in hijab is enough to make me sweat and imagine having to exercise in hijab !wah! I did that in year one because okay in my school we have this (um) thing where all year ones have to do sports it's called sports for life
so (err) I was in what was it called squash [oh] my god I love squash it's like tennis but you just hit the ball against the wall and you can actually go blind for it ya but then the thing is [kan] (um)
I I was wearing I was already wearing a hijab [lah] in year one and then dude the warm up exercise consist of us running around doing push-ups squats and all that
I felt like dying it was so hot cause like not only was I wearing a hijab so not only was my head and my neck covered up but I also had to wear the sleeve and then so inside I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and then outside I was wearing the sports for life uniform and then I was wearing socks and all that !wah! dude it was like
it !wah! I felt like I was dying in the desert [sia] serious
that was how hot it was and there was only two fans in the court and then I wasn't even there was so many of us so I wasn't even anywhere near the fan I don't even know how I survived that I should have just joined yoga or something
no [lah] cause actually the reason why I joined sports [kan] was cause (uh) it was super cool to me like can you imagine playing tennis or whatever against the wall you don't have to worry about looking at other people in the eyes but then (uh) I found out that usually squash like in pairs [kan]
you have to be careful cause you can actually hit your partner with the racket and then like (um) you have to wear the face face gear or something cause sometimes (um) the ball will hit against you like when it bounce against the wall [kan]
then like m~ (uh) then my my coach was like scaring us about how this player he didn't pay attention to where the ball was going then it hit him in the eye then he turned blind then I was like shit why did I even join this no that and
one of my crush was actually in squash
ya so so like when I found out that he was in squash I was like [oh] my god we can play squash together so I joined [lah] but then we ended up being in different groups
so
and now he's with an older lady
so
[kan] [kan] I mean I don't remember but I think his new girlfriend is quite hot I guess so I guess I can see why he wanted to be with her but still like dude (ugh)
[oh] my god you know speaking of men I have one month like by the end of this month to find a guy
because
you remember #diana#
he is I think he's four to five years older than us he is working at this (um) I_T company so (um) usually he'll be at #tuas# checkpoint cause (uh) his company is collaborating with the checkpoint for this new facial scanner
thing
ya so but but her boyfriend is a bit her boyfriend is like you know #ahmad# remember #ahmad#
[kan]
on that very friday and it wasn't even that he started early [tau] he started at like eleven plus and then he was supposed to submit by (err) four o'clock or was it five o'clock and you know when he promised to meet her
no two o'clock
so she's she was waiting for him no wait he was supposed to meet her at twelve o'clock but then she was waiting for him from twelve until two
[kan] like okay
I respect everyone's beliefs
I have friends who are atheist I have friends who are non-believers I have friends who are buddhist my family has christians and taoist and all that like my family is a mash of like different religions
[oh] ya
okay so (uh) it was last week I think when I met her and then she she tried she and her boyfriend tried to set me up with her boyfriend's friend he's not handsome
I got I got

ya I'll I'll just send it to you tonight or something once I find it !wah! I need to delete a lot of pictures from my phone but but anyways
you know me (uh) but the the thing is [kan] so ya [lah] but I have a bit of a high standard when it comes to guys than their looks it's not just the personality you know and and the thing is do you know how he like so (um) I told #diana# and her boyfriend that (uh) I'm not interested in him like cause I once I saw the picture I was like
[oh] hell no bitch I'm sorry
so I said just give my tele cause I don't post my pictures or anything over there [pe]
so ya you know what was the first message he sent me
hey there golden child
[kan] so so I sent him this message [lah] like (um) my first and my first and last message to him I said hi (um) you can call me D (uh) ya (err) I don't even know why our friends like to set us up but I already told them that (err) we don't really we're I'm not really interested in you like as more than as friends [lah] so (um) you don't have to pay attention to them or anything and (um)
like
ya
I don't want to cause

but I can't hold that off forever
[oh] my god what should I do do you have any suggestion I need to find a guy I need I need someone to help me
[oh] should I just pretend to be a lesbian but no that's not believable
I tried that once actually people actually believed it
ya
but that's cause they don't really know me that well
actually you know (um) in poly [kan] back in poly I was asked out a couple of times by girls
ya apparently I give off a lesbian vibe
and then there was this girl who was
so into me she actually stalked me home serious serious I was so scared so everytime I want to go home my friends have to send me home cause she she would like take picture then she was like[eh] [oh] my god we are in the train and and and I don't even know where she live at but I know it's nowhere near me
and you know what's the worst part
[kan]
and you know what's the weirdest part
[eh] hi we are on the same train again this morning like
#bruh# where did you even come from
ya I told her like [oh] (um) (um) I mean indirectly [lah] cause she was my quite close friends
ya
#chi hao#
but she never really got the hint
so until that project [ah] that project was when she got angry with me cause (um) I told her cause during the entire period she didn't do anything
ya
and then I was like [oh] okay we weren't even friends like she was in my course but she was from a different class
ya so I was like [oh]
okay girl I have seen but never talk to before and then [oh] my god there was another girl actually (um) so there's this there's this module called #gen ed# general education do you have it
and then [kan] we were roommates so like (um) okay this is going to get a bit explicit
(mm)
dude you know first day [kan] she just started stripping in front of me then she said [oh] I'm going to shower you can you can you can watch if you want
then I was like
so she met this uni guy over there and he look like her boyfriend
so she spend most of the time with him in his room
ya so (um)
ya at first
and then she said
end game
was he cute though
okay never mind
okay [ah]
[oh] my god I really want to see how he looks like
[oh] my gosh you know [kan] speaking of guys do you remember #ateeb#
he's still texting me now
ya okay
so the story of #ateeb# is a long one started back in sec one so in sec one (um) he confessed to me cause we were in the same clique
#ateeb# me jonathan #zi qing# and justin
there was this K-pop song that uses one four three means ya ya
ya so I wasn't interested in #ateeb# at all so (err) I told him like [oh] sorry man like you are a great friend and all but I don't think I can see you as anything more than a friend and then he he started spamming me so I just muted him like I felt bad for blocking him and we were in the same class and same clique
he spam
#zi qing# cause at that time #zi qing# was my best friend
cause like
ya he was spamming everyone and then (uh) afterwards I okay don't tell anyone okay
but I actually
had a crush on justin
no no serious I and and I don't know [lah] was I so excited when whenever I text him [lah]
and then he even asked me out but then apparently he like #zi qing#
so (um) at that time I had a crush on a senior then the senior made fun of me then I (um) #tala# found out you know you remember #tala#
ya so #tala# (uh) #tala# heard about it then #tala# was like [eh] D how can you go and confess to someone else when you are dating #ateeb#
and then but but apparently a lot of people really believe that I was dating #ateeb# dude that was the reason why none of my crushes accepted me because they thought I was dating #ateeb# and I was like two-timing
he (um) he saw me with my one of my friend her name is phyllis then he said [eh] phyllis damn cute [sia] can you intro me to her then I was like (um) I don't mind [lah] but as long as she accepts you then then and only then will I intro you to her
so (err) I ask
him to give me a his best picture then
ya so he sent me a picture (uh) if I can find the picture I'll send it to you then I showed it to her I showed it to all my friends like asking like [eh] if anyone's interested in this guy he's super rich
he's he's super rich yeah that's the only good part about him
ya and then after that (mm) (err) phyllis was like everyone actually they said that [oh] he looks quite cute from afar until they zoomed into his picture and his face then they're like
[oh] actually on second thought maybe not it was harsh but it was true I mean like would you date #ateeb#
you know what happened he found her account on tinder like she wasn't using it at that time [lah] cause she was dating someone else but then (um) afterwards
she she saw him and was like [eh] I know this guy so she just cause like she remembered him as my friend so she just match with him [ah]
then he started spamming her asking her to date him begging her to date him then she was like no no no no and she keep on saying no then after that she she got annoyed [lah] so she blocked him on tinder you know what did he did
no he went to my friends list he found her account he added her he D_M her and then she she thought that at that time (um) phyllis and I were in the same clique so she thought that I was the one who gave him her I_G account
then because of that right she got angry with me !wah! he he ruined a lot of potential for me man then after that he he spam her I_G her her D_Ms [ah] begging her to date him and all that then she block him also then afterwards (um) we weren't friends anymore like phyllis and me cause of him [lah]
and then he and then we just stopped talking and then in year two he texted me again like (um) it was a snapchat then I was like you know snap streaks were like super popular right then so I was like okay [ah] never mind it's just for snap streaks only [what] so I was like streaking with him
then like what makes you think that any girl would want you you know he he confessed to #huda# also
ya but #huda# rejected him also
dude I know I'm desperate but I'm not that desperate as to like know accept your money and then like date you you are not even sugar daddy material man
he was the one who led himself on
so in
S_P [kan] maritime is like one end
no I I saw because they have a uniform [pe]
so I saw the uniform from afar then I I I was so scared cause like for a few days [kan] I keep on seeing like students from his school all of a sudden keep on coming to my school so I thought it was him then then (err) everytime I want to go anyway my friends will accompany me
ya and then he was in america like the ship was going around [pe] then his last stop was at america so he had to get back to singapore himself
then at that time it was already like C_B period like cause we end on february fourteen then it was already like
anyone ya anyone who came back
had to be quarantined [pe] so he was quarantined at a ho~ hotel
I already told you all my friends don't even like you you are not even their type no no matter how rich you are your personality and your looks aren't worth it bro
(uh) ya but I I didn't [lah] cause it was so funny to see what he was texting
he found my email
dude I don't even know how he found my email
that was years ago
ya
but that was what seven years ago
I thought I thought like seven years ago the emails would have been deleted already
so I just ignore then he emailed me like
he emailed me like on tuesday
I haven't open the email actually [oh] my gosh but ya
[kan] and then like (um) so I only told #diana# about this cause I never really get in touch with anyone else
I don't know man I mean [oh] my gosh I don't want to choose between #ateeb# or #rudy# that's so weird no no no no no [oh] my god I need a guy I need someone to pretend to be my boyfriend but all my friends are busy
he's always been like that actually
ya but then during secondary school [kan] after I rejected him again he you remember crystal
ya so (err) what went on was that (err) #ateeb# #ateeb# confessed to her a lot of times then she always said yes yes yes but but everyone knew that she was only saying yes cause she was playing around with him
she didn't even like him
I had a crush on justin at that time also
then like couple [kan]
ya and then like with rayson I always talk anime with him [oh] my god I missed it and then at that at that time [kan] I really thought that I had a chance with justin [tau] then I found out he moved on from #zi# #zi qing# to #zi ning#
and then he was super into #zi ning# at that time then I was like [oh] so all this time you treated me like a girlfriend cause she wasn't there and ya so I'm just a rebound again
and then
ya I got friendzone by him a lot of time
K end
(mmhmm)
[ah] ya ya ya I remember her
(mmhmm)
[oh] really
ya you put baking soda inside cookies
(mm) I'm not so sure I think you can do some (uh) admin job duties I know in my workplace (uh) sometimes we have (um) we need we get orders from customers for #bentos# or for events so maybe you can try to get that kind of position maybe I can let my boss know whether he is willing to (uh) hire someone for the time being especially during this period [lah]
no I don't think there'll be algebra inside so I think I will let him know okay
(mm) I think like
there's a lot of issues that I see like with malay #hijabis# not (uh) not getting jobs being discriminated because I saw like this classmate of mine in polytechnic
recently she did this (um) poll [lah] (uh) asking whether like have any of us malay #hijabis# ever face discrimination and I saw that majority of her respondents had receive discrimination but for me I'm thankful that so far I didn't face any sort of discrimination when applying for jobs or for university
I'm thankful that I didn't face that kind of discrimination but at the same time I feel like quite upset [lah] like this is happening to some of my friends who have the qualifications they already have they already met all the criteria they have the skills they have good grades for school but
why is it that they are not getting the job just because they are wearing hijab I think a hijab is just just a piece of clothing it's like you know you're wearing a T-shirt it's just a piece of clothing why why is it that they don't allow muslim ladies to wear hijabs I don't get it
what
[oh]
(mm)
!wah!
ya
and I also have like my cousin she is working as a nurse and you know that in the healthcare industry (uh) for muslim ladies they are not allowed to wear the hijab when they are doing their jobs but then I don't know I find it kind of weird does the hijab (err) restrict them in doing any sort of jobs
I don't know I mean when when you wear a hijab maybe they are worried [oh] let's say what if the medicine or anything like
and I think in social media it has been blowing up [ah] but I think to know a still they are not allowed to wear which I find it kind of funny because I know that in malaysia they allow their nurses to wear and then I was like thinking if malaysia can wear how come singapore cannot wear I don't know it's kind of weird
really
maybe you should have joined should have considered yoga like even though it is like there's still some warm-ups you have to do but at least you don't sweat that as much and you still feel a little bit uncomfortable-ness but still okay [lah] [ha]
!aww!
it's not fated man
what
there's better men out there so don't worry about him
why
ya
(err) what what what does that guy do is he working or studying or

he was like !wah! !wah! !wah! someone like you [ah] then I was like (err) I don't know I felt kind of weird that time I don't know because like I don't know I just don't feel comfortable with guys I think during that time I also have my own personal issue so like the last thing I would want is to have a relationship when I'm going through like personal struggles so
the way I kind of broke contact with him was a bit harsh [lah] because I remember at that time we had another block visit then after that he was like messaging me late at night I think it was around eleven plus so I told him [oh] (err) I want to go and pray first [lah] then he was like okay after you pray text me [ah] then after that I ignore him already

ten years ago (err) probably say like (err) do you have a
bike license now you know but I still don't have [lah] instead I have a house

[oh] ya ya ya ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
what you did [lah] [ah]

okay that's good [lor] so the next question
just ask [lah] [oh] ask the petty [one]
this is very easy for me cause
because (uh) ya so
[oh] ya so
so you know me pettiness I think I think I will hate someone if he is or she is like my ex's new girlfriend

I think he's the petty [one]
ya ya ya
(hmm)

I mean you can just say hi [what] but then the #wan see# girl just came to me [oh] [oh] allie
so allie #wan# (err) #wan see# was like telling me like [eh] [ah] ya she don't like you [eh] then I was like !huh! why [sia]
ya [eh] you know why it's because
so I thought that was very petty of her
she didn't know me
and to for her to go out of her way not to say hi to me it's super petty [lah]
yes she blatantly like ignored me
but it's not faking [lor] it's just immature [mah]
[ah] ya ya ya ya
(mm)

master three new skills [eh]
I think I wouldn't want a new skill more of the skill that I already have
a lot of languages instantly
ya
!yay!
ya you can converse with anybody
and then the second [one] would be to be able to play any instruments that I want
keyboard can [ah]
third [one] I don't know [leh] I think
I think I want to be able to fix anything like mechanically

that's why
ya [lor]
[ah]
hopefully they will accept your conversation [hor]
[ah]
(mmhmm)
diving [ah] is okay
(mm) okay okay

no [lah] can [what]
ya it's a skill ya singing is a skill [seh]
it's not you don't really need like talent
ya there's this
[ah] there's this video [kan]
ya and then it his singing improved
I think so [ah]
!huh!
[ah] that's why
yes
you do not have to have talent you just have to have ya the determination

ya ya definitely
why not
la~ la~ la~
okay so
ya that's very good [lor]
look girl got the red
it's only twenty six minutes
sixty minutes
!wow! actor [ah]
actor
(hmm) thinking of my favourite
(err)
I don't know why like on top of my head is johnny depp for some reason because he's very versatile
ya
ya but then I don't want to go through the abuse
ya that's true that's true that's true
but I just said why [what] thus
because he's such a versatile actor but if it was a young actor maybe I want to be number five
so handsome
[oh] I'm a sixteen year old boy
ya
#elek elek#
is it his singing career
#booboos# like what
[oh] but ya ya he's still teenager
[oh]
all so just jealous of him [lor] he's very good [sia]
yes
but to me it's just like okay [lah]
yes
no that that video makes me think like yes he is still a kid
[oh] I didn't know that people were like bullying him
ya encouragement [ah] yes if I were him I wouldn't care [lah] of what people say like [ah] whatever I want to sing
normal yes
!wow! why am I not surprised
(mm) ya
[oh] ya I heard about that
ya yes
!wow! awesome [sia] better than mine [sia]
ya
!wow!
ya so petty
ya
ya
that's great
!wow! I'll be young again but then I'll have like my life set out already
like dance rap but then if I were to wake up as me in their body I think cannot
that's so
[a'ah]
!wow!
!huh! work
at all
not go work but (um) [ah]
I don't know [leh] I feel like we will like
go back to how we were
ya we would have to like make our own food you know farm or whatever right it's still kind of like work
but maybe it means
[oh] like a depression [ah]
!wah! man I don't know man
ya I think will be like if you don't need money to survive right do you have other means
it's like a dystopian game
if it were me I will just sleep
but if you don't have to go to work
so be anything [lah] whatever people need [lah]
[ah] you give me food and I'll give you a hug how about that
okay what is it must listen first if kiss can kiss on the cheek
but please I hungry if not I just kill you [lah]
but that's an interesting question though I can't imagine [ah] cause it's too far far fetched already
but you realise or not like apocalypse themed movies like singapore don't do that imagine in singapore context we do that I don't know how it's going to be
[ah] that's true [lah]
ya
but apocalypse in singapore I don't know [sial]
how is it going to be
of course not [lah] it's like gradual
ya
ya ya ya
but I feel like if ever [lah] got apocalypse in singapore I think all the races will finally get together and will not think about actually being coloured
ya like
come on sis
extinct
ya ya ya ya
what's the question again
I think
I mean based on what I see in the news and all that I think (err) global warming
would ya ei~ either we drown or we will run out of food like there's no more resources left that's how ya we become barren [lah]
which is like most likely but imagination wise I don't know [leh]
[oh] because of the pandemic now
ya ya ya ya
that's my legs
spread [ah]
[oh]
ya
ya we already cut [oh] !wow!
no
bridge
(um) break down
!wow! how convenient [sia]
[ah]
swordfish
ya
!wow!
so like trump
[ah]
we'll be the last to die
our import export don't have already how
lose [oh] okay obvious at each country or ya because it's like humans were extinct rhino hope right ya [lah] so no choice [lah] actually depressing
lose weight
ya
!yay!
I feel like we'll extinct it will be because of a flu like we will sneeze too much until we get dehydrated and die
hopefully not [lah] [eh] now already COVID it's so scary
(err) work [ah]
[eh]
but something you already hate right like something
(oo) everyday activity
that is torture yes
that's torture that's too much
is it
(oo) that's like work [seh] babe
[oh] this is a game
ya [lah]
I think eating for eight hours is a torture also that's like why would you do that but
exercise normally already torture
exhaustion
[sial] [lah] chores for eight hours
ya ya ya
therapeutic
okay then maybe not
I want to say sleeping but then
I cannot torture myself [lor]
so many things
why I rather die
!ee! that's sick
hello
I know I want to be able to make someone have diarrhoea
if I don't like the person it's okay no need to say anything just like diarrhoea
ya they won't they won't think it's me also
ya and then you can ha~ it can happen anytime you want
see the ghosts because I'm like
claus like can make them do much for me
ya [lah] but I'm also depressed so I feel like I can [lah]
that's true [lah] hi
I'll just make I'll just make them a K-pop group [ah] then okay go around and stray kids
ya I think that's the wo~ side effect of his power [ah]
ya I think ghosts more than people
but then why you say that you want to see ghosts is it
ya but your super power
ya
most of them are quite bullshit [lah] but the one the real ones like
[oh]
ya ya my friend like that also but the fake ones I like because
they quite consistent but
is like why why must you do this all the time like
it's a guy [ah]
[kan] like I find it very hard to believe [ah]
like
no he's very old I think that time when I was dating him
ya four years five years I don't know
yes
it's quite unusual also
ya
[oh] ya ya ya
ya I can make all the guys be more
ya
[ah] yes
yes

I think she had to
ya I get (ugh)
so he she cannot say any rumour
[a'ah] [sia] but it's in the fifties
men
I don't like him from the get go already I didn't like him
ya
okay

ya I would save a lot of money [seh] if my rent was free but then by living with your parents is your rent is free [what] right
it's true what else
damn
for a one room flat or whatever
!wow! ya they should do that (mm)
ya
[oh] we made it babe
I feel like food should be free [lah]
no there's there's there's confirm like ration [lah]
maybe not in for singaporeans [ah] maybe
ya that's true [oh] my god but
okay good luck for your interview
okay !yay!
okay can
!hey! you aunty
I'm doing okay
you you then the pain all you can feel it
you were alone in the hospital
sister are you a single mother
alright it doesn't matter [lah] the ma~ what mattered is the baby is there ya if the baby so what happened
[oh] really [ah] so you only dream like just the you giving birth process only [lah]
[oh] so you didn't but then you say the next day you got dream some more
!aww!
could you feel like the maternity love already
[ah] like a responsibility [ah]
then when you wake up from it like what do you feel
so so now you want to have a baby in your life
I don't know I feel like it's very weird cause I don't get this kind of a dream but like somehow you get this kind of dream is like I feel like it's a sign but I also don't know [lah] what is a sign
[ah] ya ya
whether you are responsible enough like yet [lah]
okay cool sis so anyway (um)
you know [ah] later I'm going to go (err) have a job interview
then this job interview I'm having [ah] is asking me [ah] all type of weird questions [one]
come with our own answers so that later at the interview I will know how to answer the person [lah] better
okay so the one of the questions the like interviewer asking is (um)
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would be inside
ya [lor]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh]
(err) but then your diary would it be like rage or like would it be like reflecting
reflec~
[ah] so okay imagine yourself at eighteen
raging
ya ya ya
ya I remember you telling me about your I_T_E friends they're like quite toxic right
what would the okay then if there's a time capsule from ten years ago [ah] what what would you probably be saying to yourself
[oh] [ah]
which you are kind of okay okay or not not at all
ya ya so long ago also
me [ah] I think [ah] ten years ago I was sixteen right
[oh]
ya I was already outside mixing with the outside people so probably ya and I think
I don't think I was also depressed or lost or anything I was just very like exploring life at that point of time because
ya like from julie I met so many people and then also I met #hakim# or #risahd# which is nothing to do with julie meeting him at sixteen was a blessing [sia] like if I didn't meet him right
activities are very P_G [lah] so it's very good as compared to like if let's say I was mixing with the same kids still it's not really good right because like they drink and everything
and then like I might have boyfriends but with #hakim# also we were just friends so it was really good and then he will bring #ahmad# along so we go gig we go (um)
so I think if I were sixteen probably what I would say to myself and I broke up wait I haven't met #amin# yet so
probably I will say to my sixteen year old self like
hello girl girl [ah]
[eh] you how are you still you still got boyfriend or you no boyfriend I hope whoever your boyfriend is you happy [lah] okay
(err) are you still longboarding (err) probably all that [lah] probably asking how is she doing in life like me now
and if I think most probably my sixteen year old would just want to know whether I'm happy like ya even then I think happiness was just my aim li~ it didn't it didn't matter like
what I was doing in life ya it just mattered like I was peaceful and was happy that's all
so ya if I will say to if I read that then I will probably tell her or him like
I doing good yo I'm doing super good
ya I got this shit [ah] I mean it took me some time but twenty six is the year yo twenty twenty I got my shit together
okay okay so
the other question they will ask me [ha] is the
(um)
!walao! [eh] got so many questions you know they ask
[oh] ya ya ya what is the pettiest reason you would dislike someone
okay
but that's so like normal though
okay [lah] okay [lah] ya ya but it's also very human nature I feel
ya very petty
what what other things wou~ would you be petty about
[oh]
[a'ah] [ah]
but does this apply only to like your is it friends or contacts guys or like what or people in general
guys [ah] right ya
cause if girls like you know it's nothing personal right it's like you
ya ya ya
but with guys it's a bit more like deeper also it's like rude hello you're a man okay I give you my time
[oh] ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya ya she's just making your life difficult
(uh huh) (uh huh)
!walao! [eh] why she like that [one]
like how dare you block my way you want to fight is it !huh! you want to fight
me [ah] pettiest reason [ah]
(err) pettiest for m~ reason for me to [oh] my god
even if I dislike someone I don't think the reason would be petty like you know me like the reason has to be so strong for me to like not like the person
okay [lah] petty reasons like just not say hate but it's just like !aiya! like dislike a bit [ah] [ah] it's like our dearest H_R [lor]
[ah] like like she never do anything like outright to like harm us but
like it I guess the pettiness is coming from like the way she talks like the way she talk like it's it comes off as like
if [ah] like at work there's this engineer he's not the same department as us
so [ah] sometimes I will fall asleep so who's fault is that it's my fault right not supposed to fall asleep but [ah]
y~ ya that's true okay but then again it is [lah] correct [lah] it's our fault we shouldn't sleep at work I know that like it is a co~ like common sense thing
but ya but then ya [lah] it becomes petty because [ah] whenever I see him now I don't like him only because everytime I fall asleep at work
I will get traumatised and think of him [ah] like [ah] no no no later that guy will come and scream at me
ya
what other reason could we be petty about like not liking someone like it's not like hate like not hate [lah] right just like annoyed
can
[oh] is it like what
[oh] ya ya ya ya I think me too also I think everyone [lah] right
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] [ah] [oh] [oh] [oh]
[oh] because you were julie
[oh] cause so she thought that whole thing was messed up [lah]
ya because she didn't know like the true story and everything
ya ya correct correct that's judging it off
ya ya ya [oh] you mean she said hi to everyone except you
[oh] I think she's one of those girls that's like if I don't like you I'm not going to fake it like ya that's it [lor]
ya [lah] ya [lah] for me like I think the pettiest not pettiest [lah] this [one] is not so petty I don't know whether it's petty or it's (um)
okay petty reasons people might not like me in the past [ah] right it's just like
like some people like th~ make up story about me last time like the name the nickname don't want to say here
then another person will just take that nickname and be like [oh] is it okay [lah] then I also don't like her now even though they don't even know me know then like
what I do [sia] I don't know I just come [sia] so it's like
and then it's just because of the nic~ nickname I had last time which was wrongly like portrayed by someone else
so I thought that was very petty I think another reason why (err) [ah] like I got it was also a petty reason why like a girl didn't like me last time in class [ah] was because
the guy that she liked in class like me and then after that (err) her guy best friend also like me then then she don't like me but then you know what's the worst part is that she is like
best friends with me in class [one] not
ya ya like and then like
ya then eventually I found out that [eh] you know [ah] she she say [ah] like she got say to me before
why why all these guys li~ like me [lah] [ah] she said her tits not even that big my tits are bigger
that is just shows that I have small tits and guys still like don't you think it's something to do character rather than your (err) physics ya exactly
okay so far it's okay
[eh] but then [ah] she took the worst vengeance on me possible you know
one year later she entered the same C_C_A as my boyfriend at that point of time I didn't know that they were the same then they went overseas for the C_C_A to #bangkok# I think
then my boyfriend came back right then he confessed to me he sort of cheated on me he touched this girl he touched this girl then
he touched this so he touched this girl then after that he tell me he touched this girl because (um) she said that she's a lesbian so he touched her boob to like prove her that she's not
you you stupid or what she's not lesbian I know [lah] she's my classmate then lulu like always go around with like the different key went like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she like which I didn't even like you know or you care about I didn't work with them like they were just friends but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend [ah] like you
go around with like the different he even like got mad at me because I went out with guys that she liked which I didn't even like know or even care about I didn't go out with them like they were just friends
but ya then I was like crying to my ex-boyfriend [lah] like you
especially because she knows you are my boyfriend
!wah! I like never felt even more betrayed at that point of time
that such a person exist that can be so
so ya [lah] but like afterwards I don't feel anything for her [lah] I feel more sorry for her that she had to go to that length to get man's attention
ya like going to that length of like ya I've never been touched by a boy before like girl I know you did you know something with my ex-classmate
that was an interesting time like like if I see her now like I won't be I won't hate her [lah] but it's more of like a bit disgusted
what she did back then but ya also like like just hope that she's changed now [lah] it's just more of like
mind blown by it like !walao! [eh] like I could never [sia] go through that trouble for man ya [lor]
so ya petty things [ah] !huh! that people so it's not really I petty with people people was petty with me [one] but it's okay this is life I already got used to it
now they petty with me I'm unbothered [one]
alright okay this [one] is if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
(mmhmm)
[oh] (mm) (mm)
ya ya
[oh] my god that's so cool but you can already play no cannot [eh]
[a'ah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
(err) can play a lot of things [siol] can play the piano keyboard ya still got one more
it could be anything in the world like even if you're not going to use it as often but it's just like (uh) so it's just a random skill like [oh] you so you can do that then you're like ya [lor] I can
[oh] that's great [sia] like you don't need to call people for shit anymore
and save money also
and then I'm like die [lah] ending and then you're like no I can do it then I'm like [oh] she got the spirit
I love how mine got the random red like when I'm very excited
!walao! [eh] confirm can [one] [lah] it's just one line don't be petty [lah] we're just talked about being petty okay so
ya okay for me right
obviously the first skill I will take is cooking [ah]
then it's not just convenient for myself but it's convenient for like my loved one like if I want to cook for my friends my family so I think it's a very useful [ah] skill
second skill (um)
so random [ah] but I would pick up sea sea diving [eh]
(mm) so fun [sia]
like in general I've (uh) I've always been intrigued by the se~ sea
like that's why when #shai# like her videos ya #tioman# I always feel like !wah! best [sia] [ah] like I want to
but even before I know that she was inside I already had friends who already went inside so I've already gotten like that kind of aspiration where [oh] it's very doable you just go #tioman#
ya but so far [eh] you know can touch the co~ okay okay cannot touch the coral but you can see [kan] everything so th~ so first is the cooking so I can be master chef for my family and friends then second is sea dive so that I can be relaxed in the water
if I could pick up
ya ya
[a'ah] [a'ah] ya
correct
so it can be done you just have to learn
alright [sia] then like that you do not have to have talent you just have to have correct and then eventually that can be talent also
hard work correct and that eventually that can be talent also
that's even like more hard work talent [seh] because you were not born with it you worked for
okay like that I will take the singing [lah]
but then I won't be singer [lah] like I won't have that much free time
I'll just be me and my friends like guys I can sing out some karaoke ya [lor]
okay good to know I feel like I'm getting to know you better as a person through these questions [ah]
ya [lor] ya [lor]
how do you think (oo)
[ah]
(hmm)
light effect
alright (um) !wah! if you get a chance to wake up as an actor okay I need to prompt if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day
which actor would you become and why
ya [lor]
I know right
okay this [one] is the actor is the very everybody will know [one]
(oo)
correct correct even though his true personality is so reserved and mysterious but he can in his
he really manages to (err) exercise different parts of his like personality through like movies
ya [lah] ya [lah] you skip that part [lah]
no you you now if you wake up as him now he's already over the mishap people the whole world know him already so the
so you must say this so you must explain
(mm) where is it okay which actor one day which actor you want to become and why
!alamak! you kills
(oo)
okay his singing career and also I think he made maybe a few #booboos# but then again [kan] he's young
ya like we at that age also we said a lot of stupid things we are cringey
but then I'm like you all shut up [lah] you all young
ya it's not enough to ruin what he has already done so far at umbrella academy [sia]
ya and makes him human ya
he's still eighteen
ya
going to paint history
he is even more powerful [sia] season two
ya
he's so weird he's creepy like okay you all tota~ you all no~ not cultured guys ya okay so for me if I had to choose one actor to wake up as
I would definitely choose joseph gordon levitt
people will know him as tom (err) from the five hundred days of summer
it's because why is because I think he is honestly such a brilliant person like
he is doing his own like company for the past several years where
he's so amazing [lah] like he gives platform for like in~ like independent like artists all over the world to showcase their work from like
so he doesn't use like existing like people who is already rich no he wants to give everyone a shot and like ya it's called hits record
he was sharing [ah] and then everybody will send their entry [ah] so he really picks up tendon from anything and anywhere and I find that so inspiring and in fact I think he's been sprang to me even since that friendship just assemble I like how work he has been from the start you life
[ah] he will share it [ah] and then everybody will send their entry [ah] so
he really picks up talent from anything and anywhere and I find it so inspiring
and in fact I think he's been inspiring to me even since that five hundred days of summer I like how vogue he has been from the start of time
like don~ even about his character like everything about him right to me is the equivalent of the most unproblematic
man on earth and I know he's married [lah] but he even then he's so low key about his marriage and
you can tell he's not just also married like a woman just because she's hot but he's married her for her intellect and kindness and everything
so I would love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does fo~ and everything
so I'd love to wake up as joseph gordon levitt to just be in his mind and see what he does for (err) everyday
okay [eh] no but then I would also choose johnny depp but if I were to choose johnny depp it will be more for his
I learnt about johnny depp's (err) wife not wife [ah] they never married [ah] vanessa #paradis# I fucking loved her I was so obsessed with her
and I love his kids and everything so I would probably wake up as him to just
ho~ he okay another person okay sorry this [one] is also this [one] is also actually quite epic [ah] if I could wake up as her right is also really amazing
angelina jolie
cause she's also another like inspiration but like girl version [lah] actually I love zooey deschanel but I think angelina jolie has a bigger impact on the world [lah] she's like
and then on top of that she's a humanitarian like the devoted humanitarian and like
on top of that she's angelina jolie like even if she didn't do all that humanitarian stuff right she's already awesome because people will love her as an entrepreneur
but she has all of that even more so it makes her even more like humane [ah] even more kind and imagine your ex-husband is brad pitt like the fish
so I would love to wake up as her and just also as~ see what she does in a day [ah] like I think she's so inspiring [sia] like she's a mum to like
all types of kids like you know from vietnam to africa then they all really consider her as a mum she allows her kids to (err) explore religion and see what is beneficial to them and
ya she's connected with like different parts of the countries like of the world the third world that even we have never
she's even connected more with muslim countries so like ya I would love to be her [sia] for a day I think she's so inspiring like even though people love to villainies her because of the whole brad pitt and jennifer aniston thing but I feel like
that's so little compared to what she's done correct
ya at that moment I know it must have gone down so real but then again that's like twenty almost ten to twenty years ago
and then like with jennifer with because with angelina she was already like wanting to have babies and like settle down whatsoever [lah]
but whatever it is ya [lah] like cheating cannot be justified [lah] right it is still wrong but
I still feel like brad pitt and (uh) angelina as a couple still made like more good than it was bad like not just it wasn't just for them but it was like for the whole world
even because of angelina jolie brad pitt also became more hu~ humanitarian and did stuff so like ya I really love her as a person
like she's a gemini so I was like [sia] [lah] a true gemini [sia] this girl like she
she will be like she will seduce the the host and everything then make them criticism like [sia] that's like me but like back then [lah] when I was reckless [lah] so
I really love her so much because she also still has this really like you know vulnerable side of her
so ya jennifer ya and angelina jolie and then the actor joseph gordon levitt !wow!
ya [oh] my god you imagine if you can wake up as a K-pop artist though
imagine if you wake up as your (uh) stray kids or like B_X_B
what do you mean
ya because yo~ ya you have to be super disciplined
if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
ya s~ ya like don~ ya if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
caveman [ah]
ya
okay okay imagine so so you
ya if humans don't have to work to survive what would you I think I don't know what about the thing
until I die
[oh] maybe okay like so meaning transaction there still has to be transaction or something but it's not money anymore
so people has it you could be entertainment like you need this give me three dances
ya what is your capability what can you do [ah] can you give me a massage
but I've already got three hugs from the girl before can you give me something more than a hug
(err) I can't
(err) no no no no okay okay okay take all the food you want
no [lah] it's our opinion [mah]
we're not talking about the government we're talking about the opinion
okay [lah] obviously I appreciate like whatever is on channel five #suria# like they they definitely gave their best but I'm just saying
[oh] my god imagine
it would be so epic [sia]
I think it'll be so funny because
like it's not meant to be funny but because you know like charac~ in singapore characters in general can be so
!walao! [eh]
ya [lor] ya [lor] actually the races do get together when we are against like a specific
but then ya [lah] for but then the ones that was be standing at the answer end was like no ya where [ah]
ya what's next what's next
how do you think humans you will become extinct let's take this question in a sense that is we obviously know how [lah] right cause of islamic so
take that we imagine like imagine that's not the P_O_V [lah] so it's just purely in our imaginations [ah]
[ah] how do you think humans will become extinct use your wildest imagination
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) correct
[eh] my god I can imagine [sia] my [one] is the zombie
then after that (err) getting comfortable
then she becomes the first zombie then she bite her the husband she bite the child
no [eh] but then [ah] you know the singapore and J_B is like connected by that that
thing right I don't know I think our coun~ our government will
okay says my imagination right is the fast type but they are allergic to water so they cannot swim to singapore
will train each other how to kill a zombie in case they will come everybody will be prepared it's not just the army but it's like everyone
but ya we got army for that so our army will be taking care from the inside the borders and kill all the zombies before they can come
so this is why like singapore becomes like the safest place to be at because we are the smallest
malaysia will spread to indon indon will spread to like the portuguese and then to thailand and then to eventually U_S_A [lor]
so I think I give them one year or maybe one month [lah] then eve~ the whole world will die except for singapore
maybe singapore eventually [lah] when si~ but singapore will be the last [lah] to die I will give us
ya I will give us the hero
so we will start the rationalising like crazy [lor] so we were all lose weight very drastically
[oh] okay obviously at each country [oh] ya because this [one] humans were extinct right no hope [what] so no choice [lah] everybody will die eventually depressing
alright
ya because of a pandemic [seh]
(err)
ya
(mm) ya [lor]
(uh) anyway
what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
[oh] my god [eh] wait wait wait but is activity [eh]
but then it ya it has to be an an eight hour straight work we're already doing eight hours so it's just like (err) maybe a normal activity you do but imagine you have to do it for eight hours damn
it doesn't have to be something you hate so it's just like everyday activity it would be torture if you had to do it eight hours
ya like okay so we're on to this the third round ya
next okay next
ya
eat damn slow [lah] like one rice at a time cannot already I think ya exercising definitely [lah] like [sia] I imagine like running running for eight hours
everything what other thing maybe is the (err)
but that [one] is like quite thera~ therapeutic [sia] sometimes too ya
ya honestly sleeping but then sleeping you know eight hours
ya
sleeping is always eight hours also you don't [lor] I'm willing to torture myself for eight hours if it's sleep
what other things that we do like everyday activities [sia]
pee imagine like someone force you to pee for eight hours
pee some more pee some more I can did I try
produce more lube liquid
how how many more minutes
I think around twelve minutes
(uh) (uh)
if you
if you had if you have any unusual superpower what would what would it be
what
!walao! [eh]
and it's not like it's not as such a major thing that will ya change the rest of your life
it will just inconvenience them for like one day so it's like a good good
ya [lor] then we just like then we just like diarrhoea
then he like (ugh) okay nevermind you
ya it is the most innocent
like revenge but it is a useful [one]
how did you think that at the tip of your mind it must mean you have had thoughts right
would you want the unusual power to be like see the ghosts
but even then he was so depressed for like so many years of his life he was so like schizophrenic
but this [one] even more [sia] you cannot sleep in peace [eh] you sleeping there [lah] then like then got hi
then another [one] hi the patient will like (uh) shut up
you all want to talk to me can I'm going to control you
please entertain me now
ya he was very schzo~ that's why he became like a drinking drug addict he wanted to run away from all the ghosts so irritating [sia] like everyday every second you have to listen to them talk
so many exactly
and some are nice and some are ya and they're not visually looking nice
alright okay so
ya [lor] who know you got the dark secret but ya [lah] I think seeing ghosts is more of like a curse than it is a blessing [ah]
but I mean there are people out there who can see third eyes so I hope they have it fixed in their life
ya ya ya
you mean like there's friends who will fake it
ya [lah]
but it's too dramatic [ah]
girl or boy
ya ya ya
how old is he again [ah] one year older [eh] or your age
[oh]
twenty six [eh] twenty eight
[oh] nineteen eighty nine that's quite old
see how is he doing our you know (uh) it's the same (uh) the popular do example in boring know holiday get social media guitar but the girl number but marching to jackie either look ya ya time right my checks you know okay so for me my unusual super
is he how is he doing now do you know
aunt allyson has [eh] is damn
ya [eh] it's damn strong [sia] babe you can literally manipulate the whole world
but it is I mean it it ya but it can be quite messed up if she was villain
luckily she's not a villain babe if she's a villain she can get everything her way
ya [lah] so that's why I said unless she use that power only
and not to make someone like or someone whatever situation worse [ah]
I would love that power
okay you're now going to be mature I feel like we can't do that because
then we plant the seeds for them so that's why we even with the robber that I said just now right like let's say he was going to rob someone
I could have said okay you're now going to be a good person starting tomorrow to me it doesn't feel authentic from him
so that's why it it has to be like okay from today on you going to reflect on yourself wo~ why you're doing this and you're going to question the
purpose of life [ah] so just plant a seed and then see where they take ya I think for allison
I mean it's not her fault [lah] [kan] because like with that power nobody knows how to really use it [what] and she had to go through her downs for her to like [oh] shit to ya learn that
I can't use it but then again [eh] honestly I know her ex-husband hated her cause she used that for her daughter right
the what she asked for her daughter was kind of a small thing [what] it was like a
I heard rumour that you don't want to read the book anymore
everytime they reshow that scene I'm like so graphic
I always thought she died [seh] for good right
but the it's like she's just what the fish [sia]
[oh] wo~ and then he's said [oh] why didn't you use this earlier so to what get you like clothes !wow!
ya and you are the one who preaches about being the change the movement and then like
and then you are the same person who's like so did you use it on me like
ya
ya
I feel like allison is compromising a lot [sia] she's so nice like nah
seeing the way ray treated her I'm like at least luther is genuine [sia] and
he loves her as she is he so cute when they're so awkward
alright
okay so maybe last question
what is the one thing you wish was free
[oh] my god
(mm) that's why
okay [ah]
[oh] my god you're so right
ya [lor] stay here forever [lah]
but that's the thing right
ya but you stay at your own house [mah]
okay maybe maybe not rent maybe is buying a house because rent right if it's free how to say [ah] it is still like monthly right so if you buy a house it's free like
no one in singapore is going to buy a house it's like automatic when you're twenty one a house is registered to your name
like okay at twenty one you are all
(err) entitled to a
then it moves to okay twenty five okay if (err) twenty five you are now entitled to a four room flat
but ya bro that was a that was a good idea what else what else could be free I think
damn cannot [lah] [seh]
then will be like
yes why do we have to pay for something that will be with us for ya
ya [lah] I get that like the factories did all these and they have to be paid but I mean I don't know
do you really have to pay like
condoms okay [lah]

what do you mean what you mean person interview a political up all right
[oh] right right right right okay [eh] I get to know you more [lah] [seh] babe from here

(mm)
shui~ pen
your off life actually your off
ya
okay [ah] #chao#
bye
and this is #wafaidil#
pretty good you know and it's (uh) it's been an eventful weekend I've been spending a lot of family bonding time with my family (uh) spending I just spend today at the beach in #sentosa# and
and cause we had a lot of free time and considering it's gonna be another stressful week of work or study (err) this coming week
we just wanted to spend this last day of the weekend you know just playing around the sand throwing each other into the sea spending quality family time
what about you #hady# what have you done for this weekend
(um) personally I wouldn't say that it's insignificant [lah] I'm just gonna say that
there's a little room to improve cause as of now
unless innovation is kicked in and newer ways are produced
we can't really get any better cause it's already it already seemed flawless [ah]
and now it's just depends on like what are the different types of features being added to the newer phones and how important are these features and how frequent are they being used in our daily lives how does it improve the quality of life I would say that is one criteria that big brands such as apple should instill [lah] looking for newer features that can improve the daily quality of their customers
(um) one question I would like to ask you would be
do you think a phone should cost around
a thousand cause the new iphones I've seen when walking past those apple stores
were actually around a thousand [ah] for the iphone eleven max pro what do you think of the price tag and do you think it's worth it
(um) in terms of the mask in this hot weather we can't really do anything to
minimise its effect on us [ah] cause we always have to ensure that we have our mask on on public transport in our offices when we conversing with our perhaps colleagues and friends and
there's no way around it [ah] it's always (err) prioritizing our own safety over such comforts like [ah] fighting off against the heat [ah] and but what I would suggest
for you to keep up with this heat is to always drink a lot of water
okay my
(um) me personally I've been living with having to wear spectacles ever since I was a kid [lah] and
me as being someone very (err)
very (err)
I would say
fair on what I spend my money on
I feel that spectacles should be free [ah] cause I didn't ask to be born with (err) bad eyesight and
this is some this is a necessity to ask to contribute to the workforce so I think that it should be free for us to
you know see properly do better jobs at what we do
and yeah
that is something I could agree on [ah] for you know countries like switzerland providing [eh] countries like sweden sorry
countries like sweden providing free healthcare for their (um) their people and hopefully one day countries like singapore can also (err) adopt that (err) value of (err) taking care of their people's health [lah]
and providing certain free services for like cer~ I would say certain be better cause
(err) we do not we don't want to put our country in debt cause of the supplies needed for this medical you know and
I would like to ask you another question #hady# (um)
it may be seem out of context but (um) if you could have one superpower what would it be
(mm) after much consideration of like
[ah] me personally being someone who cares about my self image and what other think about me
I think I'd go with mind reading you know cause
is like you know whenever you go through your festive seasons you do your house visiting I just want to read the minds of the aunties inside the household and just like
think [ah] do they have a good image of me do they secretly have a secret hatred towards me cause I eat too much at their house
ya then you know it's a certain sentimental reasons just to
I just want I just want to read how people think about me and like
what they go through in life
how much better of a person I can cheat I can be towards them
to stop treating them badly understand their situation deeper detail cause I'll be reading their mind [lah] through through their eyes [lah] basically seeing their lives through their eyes
and you know that mind reading ability might come to might be useful for me during like exams cause sometimes you know you run run you run into hard [eh] hard questions which
you kind of overlooked when you were studying and you didn't know how to do so
why not mind read the smartest student who is just a few chairs away from you right
and get that higher mark [ah] and hopefully and through that
enter good uni you know
(err) back to you #hady#
you can just listen from afar right
(hmm)
ya yes of course you know (err)
throughout the our daily life you always think about a bit sometimes weird stuff that just passes by our mind and we don't want to (err) give off a wrong image to the person reading our mind [lah] cause
we show what we want to show to people we don't want to show them what we don't want to show
cause we know it's not right but it's still being processed in our brain so ya [lah]
[ah]
where you see something once
(um) this is useful cause when you're studying and you have to flip through so many pages from your textbook
and having this photo memory you can instantly pick it up
so as you as you're when you're doing your exam
this image will straightaway just pop up in your brain and you can copy word for word giving them the model answer
the second skill I would have to say would be (hmm) I've always been a big fan of gordon ramsay so probably cooking [ah] cause
(err) food is like such a wonder to this work there's so much unique taste there so much unique
(err) ingredients to be explored
ya unique fusions so me myself being able to learn how to cook really like
drives me [lah] to try out different things different you know different cuisines and learn them cook them in my [ah]
at at my convenience with my own mix ya
as for the third skill I would say right
is
being able to
make friends with anyone
(err) I feel that being social is quite important in my life cause like
(err)
I'm (err) I always have to interact with people in school in work
in in my own household (err) and (um)
somewhat lacking in the social department [lah] cause
(err) it always seem like I just don't mix well with people and
(err)
we just (uh) interested in different things [lah]
so that's just me and my (err) life relations [lah]
you know
(hmm) me being a mobile phone kind of person whenever I do turn on the T_V to watch
it would have to be either action
or stuff that is animated [lah] cause the movies like with actions or animations
are deeper appreciated if you view them on the bigger screen cause you view details that you would miss out on a small frame of a phone so with this big frame you notice every single detail every single [ah] intricate detail of like
explosions (um) (err) hidden features like like
somewhat of sudden appearance
(um) if
my favourite action movie would have to be the expendables [ah] cause
(err)
nearly all my favourite actors [ah] actors and actresses are in there my idol
(err) there's also
(err) people like
(err) rocky [ah]
[ah] he's always I've I recalled seeing him when whenever I was a child my parents would play his movie [ah]
ya I totally agree with you on your last point but I also
I would like to disagree with you about the romance [ah]
for me personally I feel that romance plots are always the same it's always the hero save the damsel
and then they just fall in love and get a happy ending
which is always being overplayed overplayed overplayed cause people want that idealistic ending and I feel like movie movie director should make a more
(um) diverse type of ending for example one of the lovers dies coming to the ending or like
[ah] the lover finds another lover you know to create different emotions [lah] of
in a love [lah]
honestly I would always go for my celebrity crush [ah]
mister johnny depp he has a very (err) mysterious unpredictable vibe towards him with his smoldering looks
you know he he just a hottie [ah] I would say
(err) but recently I've been hearing that he's been abused
by his (err) former wife [eh] [ah] by amber heard
it's kind of sad [lah] I just wish him the best [ah]
you
(hmm) so you're telling me you would rather be ryan gosling over johnny depp
who in the past has know been known for
you know dating a lot of beautiful girls over
this newcomer ryan gosling
or perhaps (oo) because of sentimental reasons you say cause he relates to you
similar [ah] I relate to (um) my johnny depp cause you know
well
on that note
I can agree with you cause I've always been scared of ants and as you know ants always come in pax
and that has always been one of my fears growing up or being bitten by multiple ants so
when you say a hundred otter sized horses
an otter is not that small but that would be scary cause I would be overwhelmed whereas if I had to fight an
horse sized otter
I mean a horse is pretty big but
it's not an like an elephant big
so
ya I think I can I could somewhat stand a chance more more
to the
compared to the small otters [ah] [eh] small horses [ah]
knowing me right
I think that
if I were to put stuff inside time capsule
it would be
green tea [ah]
cause I've been drinking that ever since primary school [ah]
and then such a you know a singaporean drink
every single day auntie
one green tea [ah] and it's always so cheap you know it's like one one twenty one ten
ya and [ah] another item I would say is probably
(hmm)
probably a note to myself from the past (err) you know [lah]
when you're in the future you're in the past
you always want to know [lah] like what's your future self
(err) you you always want to ask yourself how you're doing [ah] basically a reality check from the past [ah]
and the third item I would put in there would be something that could last long
or gain in value like perhaps
for his rolex you know
put it in a time capsule you know so for fifteen years for example
it has not been touched that rolex has been inside that box
who knows what the value could be by then you know it might be more it might be less but hopefully it would be more [lah] cause
[ah] as for you #hady# what would you put inside
you could say we have
you could say we have pretty similar taste [ah] putting a note together
take [ah]
you want me [ah] one what do you have another question you would like to ask me
if if I had three wishes [ah]
honestly
me being me
I probably wish for a hundred billion dollars [ah] people say money can't buy happiness
but not for me [ah]
how does that not make you happy
and I could also own
(um) like big houses by the ocean
and give them one to each of my siblings
for their families
so
I don't see why money can't buy happiness you know
these sentimental reasons are like
these big purchases can like improve our quality of life so
deeper appreciation for each other you know
as for the second wish right
[ah] I would honestly
wish for an air conditioned shirt
so that when cause singapore's weather is so hot nowadays
literally the moment you step out
you start sweating
so an air conditioned shirt
would be so useful in our day and time [ah]
of course (err)
you just keep your whole body cold you'll be more energetic
(err) ya you can just run about your day without having to be drenched in sweat having to worry about smelling bad
you know
quite a useful item to wish for to be honest
and as for my third wish I would
probably ask for
for me to hold my own concert [lah]
(um) me being me I've heard myself sing in the toilet a few times and
you could say I can hit them notes [ah] and
(uh) I've always idolized this K pop stars ever since I was young so I inspired to have my own concert with
people rushing over to see me perform
so ya those are pretty much
the three things [ah] that
I would wish for [ah]
okay
that's me with me that's me with the questions done how about you #hady#
what would you wish for
(um) those are very good wishes [ah] your first wish makes me (err) seems like a very stingy person and selfish [ah] cause
you'd wish for people to gain an access to an unlimited amount of money right
and whereas I prioritize myself [ah]
and as for your second wish I
really hope you could amend that [ah] cause who would want to be the owner of such a
buy in team and with no history
so no point supporting and being an owner of a team that has no backbone [ah] so if you could
I would suggest you (err) be the owner of liverpool instead [ah]
fair enough [ah]
[oh] that is very easy
that is very easy
for me
personally
I will eat #nasi lemak#
cause
(uh) actually no I will take back my I will take back my answer
the remainder of my life [ah]
probably #nasi ayam penyet# [ah]
it literally has all components I need [ah]
it has vegetables you know sometimes they put cabbage under the
fried chicken
they always give like slices of potatoes
[ah] there's always cucumber which is good
(err) of course [lah] the primary part [ah]
of course [lah] the
(um) primary part
of the dish of #nasi ayam penyet# which is the fried chicken
which is a great source of protein you know
and
pretty balanced meal for me to continue being happy and with my body [ah]
ya
so
if I could eat one dish
so #hady# if you could eat one dish what will you eat
(hmm)
quite quite a good reason sentimental I've went for the well balanced route you've went to
your mum's cooking which is
what what we eat daily
day to day like right now but
okay I would like to ask you one question
if you could
what is your ideal job
that you wish you be doing in the future
ya you can choose any job you want
I would want to be a
(err) I would want to run my own radio like (um)
have you heard of the malay podcast called
okay let's go
yes that's something that I have
really been look look up to [lah] cause these three guys are
literally talking about the issues in singapore
without restrictions
they literally just
talk without boundaries cause
they have no limitations they speak on real problems
highlighting what
highlighting ya highlighting the problems
what could be done to (um)
(err) prevent such things from happening again
and they just a wonderful bunch [ah] they very humorous
and
that [ah] that just quit their nine to five jobs and just
[ah] started a podcast which became singapore number one podcast is just
!wow!
if only I could do that with two other people
with someone budgeting us
(um) another job that I would be
probably the law law sector [ah]
(err)
giving people that deserve judgement
the fair judgment [ah]
that give him the proper (um)
punishment
they can be bought off [ah]
(err) you know there's always speculations that
judges are very biased nowadays for like
the N_U_S cases
you know
just cause they have a four point O
G_P_A they get excused from molestation
record people showering like
does that even makes sense [ah]
just cause they have a potential bright future
they can do all these nonsense I don't think so
then
ya I would try to be I would try to prioritize [lah]
justice [ah] over anything
and for my third job [ah]
honestly I would want something social [lah]
so perhaps
(err)
a singaporean tour guide
I've always been you know
pretty excited on meeting new walks of life in singapore
and you know just conversing
knowing what they like about singapore what they don't like
we have to know [lah] cause we we be pretty egoistic if we don't
want to know what they don't like us
maybe we can improve from there
and you know we can learn what unique about singapore
and in
meeting new people has always been a
(err) (err) a hobby of mine which I like [ah] cause you know
you have more friends
you learn more cause you're you've open up to more people
and different people act differently [ah] so
you would probably learn you know how
how people act
and adjust yourself accordingly [lah] if the people #macam#
you can learn
how to deal
back to you #hady#
(hmm)
for me personally
from what I've seen [ah]
[eh]
sorry sorry sorry I would like to take that back
I would like to say that good looks are more important than a fit body [ah] cause
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls cause I malay
(err) I've seen a lot of malay girls fall for guys simply for their looks
they could be as skinny as a board
and they would get
you know
(um)
(um)
good looks over that one [ah]
cause they also keep in mind that they want
they want to have like a good face so that
you don't get bored of them [ah] easily
apart from their good personality
there's also the complimentary of a good face
that's what they say [ah] how about you #hady# what you think
there there's no point if you have good looks
out of the two options I would if only I could slot in the choice of personality (oo) then that's what I would choose [lah] primarily ya stick to good looks [lah]
okay (err) passing back to me I would like to ask you a question
why do you think the number one leading death cause for young people in singapore is suicide
why do you think so
it's all happening very fast and sometimes we don't have the time to like to comprehend and adjust to it [ah] so ya all these build up pressure would be
kind [ah] (um) kind [ah] does a heavy toll on us [ah]
ya and it's it's sad to say that personally I feel that in asian household
they just avoided [ah] like what you said it's like a taboo in our household
it is it is rarely talk about cause ya when our parents were growing up
they never really consider themselves they always thought of the consequences for example so what if their jobs were stressful
is better than being jobless
(err) raising awareness [lah] I would say (err) to this type of issue [ah] back to you #hady#
[oh]
(hmm) ya I agree with your statement
this that that change must be must happen we have to strive for more supportive family it's about supportive background you know
ya (err) okay time to turn (err) time to turn to happier pastures [ah] from this depressing (err) fix (err)
what would like to ask you right
about some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
some things you appreciate about being a singaporean
ya
(um)
as a singaporean something that I can be proud of and appreciative is
our public transport [lah]
I would say we have the best public transport cause
our buses nowadays are very clean very fast and
with the introduction of (err) electrical buses
very green [ah]
I would say we've been making an effort to reduce carbon monoxide (err) you know
to play our part in keeping singapore green country
and ya something that I'm proud of being singaporean is I think an effective and also green public transport
yes of course #hady# we talked about certain questions and
ya okay [ah] I'm okay still
(um) like a lot of it [sia] like
and then all like very close by like you know like one place like so so close I don't understand how they make money [ah] but
maybe it's a good industry now [ah] cause you know
(err) I think people are vain
ya ya I heard also I have friends [lah] like !walao! [eh] like you know like so vain the hair grow a bit a bit only must cut confirm must cut confirm
I don't know [sia] like it's a I don't know [ah] like you know you it's like a fade don't know what fade fade haircut don't know what [lah] like you know I think it's like a more like a very trendy thing [ah] like
power [ah] like that power
[ah]
normal [ah] reservist #bo# #pian# [ah] but then that time during the circuit breaker [ah]
you know I cannot afford [ah] you know being like all these freelance all this no money [what] #bo# #pian# [ah] I cut at home [sia]
!walao! [eh] if not [ah] you stay at home you you do nothing you eat you never exercise [ah] #jialat# [ah] but I still go out cycle [ah] I mean the government
put the rule you can cycle can cycle [mah] like you know
but keep a distance [lah]
I try to cycle around my neighbourhood [lah] know just keep myself fit exercise
like if not [ah] !wah!
yes yes yes !wah! that one
[eh] no [ah] [sia] actually

counting of the days
like thirty I think what we
every night confirm from like what nine o'clock until three four A_M talk talk talk don't know whatever we talk rubbish
#jialat# [sia] but it was fun [ah] anyway at least we don't feel separated [ah]
ya but at least at least we don't feel separated [ah] like you know it's weird [ah] it's damn weird cause you don't physically see your friends [hor]
still okay [ah] at least you see you still see them [lah] you know you don't you don't you don't keep a distance [ah] like you know hide yourself know is good also for your mental health [ah] you know

ya true
[oh] beat a
okay [lah] but at least you guys went tour already [sia] U_S
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
musically very strong [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah] that's good
those dark waves
with little cost [ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours [eh] is also to me an opener [ah] it's still fun [ah] it's still fun [ah] I mean as following tour [ah] so
yes
ya [lah]
but then again also I think it's not also about touring [ah] I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring [ah] you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe [ah] then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
ya so
(mm) (mm)
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
that's why
scared [sia]
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person [ah]
but [ah] #lal# recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs [ah] one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas [lah] lyric lyric wise would be #dol# [lah] cause his lyrics are actually very good
#hakim# fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
[ah] skate punk like a lot of
#hakim# is very #propagandhi#
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part [ah]
confirm blast [kan]
[oh] [oh] #farhan# [eh]
but but
[ah] ya
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel [lah] you can also hear that is double [ah] like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
right
I don't know [ah] is their style [ah]
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song [ah] that kind of vibe [ah] but then
[ah] ya ya
ya relevant bands [ah]
they they they they suck life [ah] or they suck [ah] actually personally I don't listen to them already [ah] like rarely listen to them
penny wise will still be that sound [ah] cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
(err) still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album [what]
last year [ah] not bad [lah] but still the same sound [ah]
I like penny wise but I still prefer
ya [ah] professor professor [sia] vocalist professor [siol] U_C_L_A [sia]
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene [ah] they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like (err) surfers and skateboarders [mah]
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets [ah] but they are very intelligent people [ah]
tony hawk pro skater [eh]
no I don't like him [ah]
but cannot [ah]
but okay [lah] see how [lah] missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause #wan# G got a new bass
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
[ah] I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape [one] then he just need to redo the everything [ah] so he give to #hakim# #hakim#
#maggot# #maggot# [ah] #maggot# setting up for him [ah] then he gonna after that we jam [ah]
composer
all of us [ah] together but #wan# G is the one that do everything [lah] so
yes (err) so we input ideas [lah] [ah] like but but #wan# G will will #wan# G will do first [lah] at home then after that after he do
I don't know he [ah] to me it's okay [lah]
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something [lah] and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said [eh]
(err) better [ah]
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound [eh] I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
do it fast [ah] cause we delay too long already [ah] [ah] so we we we say never mind [lah] we we we told #hakim# next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you [ah] but because we already comfortable [eh] and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff [lah]
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like [ah] [ah] recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
[ah] bass man [ah] it I think is
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky [ah] I think I think he's damn lucky [ah] like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
good sounds for the band [lah]
so far his recordings are actually good [ah] his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good [ah] for me [lah] personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient #yadi# is [lah]
cause must commit correct must commit
cause #hakim# is very hardworking that is his his income [pe] his livelihood [pe]
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands [lah] but from what
[sia]
no no no he he got another reggae band
(err)
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer [ah] ya ya ya #rizal#
so I think recorded there also
(err) even stoned revivals [ah] remix sound that song [oh] no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it (err) make it into malay also (err) I think #goodil# [eh]
ya [lah] but how they do it right is like (err) (err)
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia #esam# #esam# australia #esam# will record
(err) we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here [ah]
ya but it also depends on him [what] he I don't know but
don't know [ah] but
I I don't know [ah] but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay [lah] I think #zad# also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good [ah]
youtube #siao# he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out [ah] into it [ah]
yes correct
but then see [lah] maybe maybe in future [lah] maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest [ah] but one thing about #zad# I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good [sia] cause he feels #paiseh# [lah] want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use [lah] I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks [lah] cause it's a wear and tear
[ah]
that's why
of course
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable [what] it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay [lah] I mean I understand
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
[ah] we don't mind we don't mind we don't mind cause end of the day we are all friends like you know
I even I even told him [lah] if he's not recovered then missy shoot want to record then you need help to set up the mic and whatever [lah] run everything if [ah] confirm
after he recover he will take a while before he can really carry heavy stuff cause that one is a heavy impact injury [lah] so then
at least you know before to record we come here [lah] we help you to shift the whatever [lah] amp
ya shift the mic [lah] whatever then you just tell us what to do then we help you run then everything goes on cause we we willing to help cause we know you have the potential [sia]
you're the
go to in a way go to guy you know
(err) cause of what you produce [ah]
so we'll see [lah]
don't know [lah]
I know he he some more him being very anxious guy
(err) so he needs to get out
he confirm don't want
he confirm don't want
ya [lah]
no the thing is the no the P_C_N walk that time the plan right #zad# was okay #zad# wanted to do it he injured [what]
[ah]
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental [ah] mental [ah] it's it is more of mental
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend [what] then then we just walk [ah] so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to #punggol# end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk [ah]
[ah] but #azil# also said never mind [ah] we take it slow [ah] don't don't
don't force yourself [lah] you know then to give up also now is like wasted [sia] ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself [ah]
twenty minutes half an hour after that #aisyah# like okay [ah] then we all like come [lah] let's go [ah] #hafiz# waiting
[ah] [ah]
so we had to walk for one plus click [ah]
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
so that was the slowest walk to #punggol# (err) settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
[ah]
#siao#
[ah] [ah]
[oh] there the park connector [ah]
go to coastal
east coast
it's wrong coastal the coastal #tanah merah# coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
ya so ya [lah] but don't know [ah] but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard [ah]
so ya [lah] but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
whatever we can cut we cut [ah] no [lah] but
#yio chu kang# #sengkang# cannot [ah] must go that way no actually right
[oh] cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the #buangkok# is the nearest to reach [ah] but that one is also quite a stretch [ah]
[ah] [ah] but but is like you walk walk [eh] park connector park connector then you see [eh] #sengkang# already
the other end then you go in front another bridge [oh] that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of #sengkang#
then you go to #punggol# so that from #punggol# the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay [ah] this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just #sumang#
so that #sumang# is the end the beginning of that #sumang# is like the end middle of #punggol# [lah] that #sumang#
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
so there's another route [ah] so there's another route to walk
but we see [lah] we try again [ah]
we see next time maybe end of the year [lah] okay [lah] K K K
okay
hi what's up #anna#
ya so long [ah] now COVID nineteen very hard to meet [sia]
why you laugh
!aiya! now I working at #bedok# polyclinic [ah] I do the registration the patient then a lot a lot of patients [ah] so
ya that's my job [lor] then I like
(err) work (err) from monday to friday [lah] ya

what do I do what do I do if I miss my number then I say
I already put your basket already why yo~ you sit down later you will be served then he say
no no no is my english very bad that you don't understand why is the
counter fourteen is empty why is nobody there is it
!alamak! then you know my my senior was like
keep silent then I keep quiet I keep quiet because she~ she's my senior [mah] so I keep quiet [lah] okay I keep quiet
then after that he say hello why nobody answering my question then me and my
me and my friend was like (err) then we just went back to the our back (uh)
ya ya we straight up ignored him because like we don't want to
how to say like make it more I don't know how to say the tension like you know
like build up the tension or what [kan] so we just
so we just waited until like someone call him the another counter to call him and serve him [lah]
[ah] actually confront him because I was almost on my like
like you know then I'm like [ah] ya [lah] that's what happened [ah] that's one of it [ah]
(mm)
ya they think they think they old they
they we they think we need to serve them and everything but actually there's more (uh) actually [oh] my god
will think that [oh] I wait for (mm)
hello [ah] (um) sorry I wait for one hour (um)
it is one hour the waiting time because it's a lot of patients not just you
correct right ya so ya some of them don't understand you know
ya [lah] which is which is expected [lah] but that's like one of the few incidents [lah] it's it's normal you know but like as someone who is a youngster
like to see a lot of (err) older people everyday
less younger people of the same age it's a bit like and they see you as a
kid [ah] then I can get my ways sometimes they're like that so sometimes we have to stand our ground [lah] ya so you know
singaporeans like very #kiasu# and very like you know
[ha] they !wah! new iphone new iphone [ah] they can what
so like I'm quite interested in like how you handle the like
your workplace ya like are they okay they're they're okay right
quite chill [lah] all okay [lah] okay [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya
smooth [ah] smooth [ah] #gucci# [ah] #gucci#
I don't know I I've been thinking about it cause like
me my course my course is (mm) media production and design [kan]
if I'm wrong [lah] so
(mm) like designer
like magazine magazine you know [lah] whatever [lah] ya so anything advertising really so
like publicity or whatever it's just that I need to find which also
like which company that I want to go to because I think I
I you know a lot of people now want experience you know so
I don't know I've been thinking about it [lah] like
like just stop like just stop and then like
basically our progress
of like (uh) (err) gaining skills like I don't know how to say like
to intern like ya
got got intern but my intern is
was in the healthcare side at S_G_H so it is related to my course
for their events so like it's relevant but the
setting of work or the target audience is not really like
not not that it's not cup of tea it's a good experience
I want to be more fun more young but
at there I'm just stuck with the older audience again and it's more about
what works what works ya I but I
okay [lah] I do give them quite good things but I'm limited by the fact that it's
the target audience is older so some colour I can't use they'll be more sensitive some font size ya because
if and I feel like a lot of info is inside (err) like a hospital [kan] nothing there already
there's bound to be a lot of info [lah] words so having a lot of bigger fonts
extravagant you know [seh] I think so so I feel like if I were to be
at somewhere that is more
for for employers also to even hire people now because they lack of you know money to even you know have manpower so right now I don't think it's a very good time to find jobs that
damn sad [ah] [ha] we never graduate
exactly
exactly
ya
yes correct correct
can we do you know like because it's not even a good time to think about career at the moment because like your career right now
(err) they they're all [lah] whatever (uh) whatever (um) like you say food business you you study
cause cause you know a lot of people don't dine can't dine that much all takeaway so it's harder [lah] basically ya so right now
ya [lah] like moving forward like right now I don't know what to do [lah] I feel like I don't now how to say I feel like we shouldn't
(err) to be so fixated with
do not think so far because I feel like if you think so far you don't think that these kind of things will happen I feel like you should just plan at the things that is
ya [lah] [kan] so so I I
[oh] my god yes [oh] my god yes yes I feel like I've lost my youth
fun things to do but we can't actually do it because our like I don't know going concert or (uh) like
[oh]
you can say relationships are affected in the sense like that I feel lonely I feel lonely
want to see but the like last time the how to say the level of interaction that we have last time and now is so different it affects us
mentally [lah] ya and I've been seeing all those tweets and everything people are really sad and everything I think largely
is a factor because people don't get to meet people I think that's the most important thing [lah] like you know like entertainment wise
[oh] ya correct correct correct
ya
ya
ya
correct correct correct are you an extrovert
(mm)
(mm)
how how how
[oh]
can who say cannot ya I changed also I changed also from extroverted now I'm okay I'm actually no I'm always actually when I took the test
but now is more now since last time I'm am~ ambivert [kan] but now is more introverted
(mm)
the thing is ya ya
yes correct correct correct
correct
ya but it has become draining [ah] but ya sometimes ya it gets draining
correct correct ya correct correct
can relate [lah] like you have a lot of friends but you just want to hang out with just five of them [lah] like that like you just don't want to hang out with them you know
I think it affects us [ah] like if we ever like once the COVID nineteen is done or whatever I think it will be hard to adapt back to how we were you know
ya ya
ya [lah]
(mm) I'm just I don't know I feel like okay
so since (uh) we talk about this COVID nineteen thing [eh] I feel like I don't know I'm recently very like
upset about the worldly issue that has been going going like black man and everything right
ya ya me too
correct correct what might happen ya I ya but like (err)
there's a lot of like bombings also (um) in #gaza# and everything so it just makes makes how to say [ah] it's more we get
ya we we don't see it you know
like I feel like now singaporeans sta~ sta~ start to realise how privileged they are because like we don't have such problems we do have problems
but I'm also quite glad that
I don't know because we have the general election thing and everything so I feel like I think
to talk about sensitive issue minorities and everything so I feel like I hope that
once once the COVID is over or what there will be more (err) faster I don't know
basically be more open to such issues instead of [oh] being
close minded that kind of thing just because the government doesn't talk about it but now I realise [oh] actually
!wow! we are like ya [sia] we think we think singaporeans we're like smart and everything but no [seh] I think
I think I realise that a lot of us like as a nation we lack empathy to
ya to such matters [ah]
yes correct
older generation ye~ ya
mindset ya
ya
yes correct correct correct
especially like you said the older generation they don't agree a lot to our
younger people people's view or or take on on how it should be or what because they think they're like
older and everything but I think it's because they're too ingrained like their traditional values is too
ya al~
I I I I'm quite
I'm quite glad [ah] like you know cause like
(err) I like I have faith [lah]
for like this
will be a better country for the people [lah] not just for economic
like it has a certain
image that it wants to capture like how it's very
green eco green very luxurious expensive but
we have a lot of
what is it called
flaws [ah]

ya [lah] then I once I bought the stick I practise almost everyday
I flunk my grades literally
because I practise every day I stay back at school ya I prioritise that (uh) because I
everytime I try to shoot [kan] the ball will always roll on the floor
it's al~ there's a there's a boy and a girl but we don't mix the trainings [ah] unless the stupid teacher wants [ah]
but that's (err) that's another story [lah] but like
ya so I train train train train train
and then I I think my teacher noticed or something like that
then I think that's why I became the floorball captain or some shit like that
ya because I trained on my own timing that kind of thing
and I actually got better I actually got better
ya but I failed my grades [lor] but
it's okay [lah] I got to be the captain [lah] so once I did
I
I don't know felt nice but I felt unrecognised
so apparentl~ okay for me I find I'm ugly [ah]
I'm ugly back then [ah] honestly [ah] among the girls and most of the pretty girls already
know how to play floorball
so people expected that they would be one of the ones that will get the position [lah]
so when I got it because I was really an outcast
not they don't dislike me but I felt
a certain of like acceptance
no acceptance because because me and my friend one side only
to do all thing but once I got to be the captain or announced as the captain
they started like asking me like to join them and everything but I also ask my friend
who were outcasted to join me [ah] that's how the the team bond [ah]
ya but then my secondary school like quite dramatic also [ah] I'm sure your [one] also dramatic right
[oh]
[oh] okay
you you involved
[oh]
I'm okay with you
[oh]
okay I'm quite
quite surprising [seh] to find out that your most drama life was in poly
class drama okay I think
(mm)
that's good [lah] because for me I'm involved in it because of the people I know
the floorball drama is I'm not involved in it but it's just that you know
there's a lot of rumours about very petty [lah] just about girls being pretty then
they date date they date date date date and everything
yes so
so I'm not involved in in it anyway it's just like that kind of thing but I also do
stay away [lah] from them but then if you want to get the team together you kind of have to
kind of get on their good side so that they can listen to you that kind of thing so
but it went well [lah] because we're the most bonded
team [ah] because we didn't like the seniors the seniors very stuck up
they think they're good and everything but we got the most achievements
so we're like [leh] we're a better batch
ya we were the junior team
and we brought a lot of medals [ah]
ya so
secondary school was fun and everything then I like failed math then I'm like
okay so what's next so
so I go and do D_S_C_A then after that [oh] I [oh] design don't need math
(uh) my science also but it was a D seven I think it's a pass but my math was the one [ah]
but then I was I chose a design school so it didn't matter that much I guess
my language was okay
so now [ah] that's how I got into ford R~ R_P [lor]
ya
that's what I was thinking cause
(uh) I heard a lot about R_P R_P like drama R_P
(uh huh) floorball specifically
so actually I was quite burnt out being the captain and
(err) I don't know just very tiring so for me to go there
and continue it and imagine like it's far it's far then training
that's man I was like
time for a switch up let's go volunteering
in smart asia [lah]
cause [ah] my friend also [lah] cause her friend is in
is the vice president but [eh] president so she asked me to join the team
and I also wanted to do something
volunteering because I wanted to add on also to my to my
life skill and resume or som~ something like that [lah] so
I damn burnt out by sports it's I'm bored of it [lah] basically
how to say [ah] I actually I love sport
but it took a toll on me because
I had to buy the equipment and and and I'm not so well off too at that point of time to buy
ya it's like a burden [ah] for my parents to keep buying me shoes and all so I
think
I could come back to it if I want to because
after my secondary school right I actually join external club
ya I actually joined [eh] few seasons and all but the trainings were right after school and like
so that made me like !wah! another commitment
but it was already after (um)
[oh] haven't it was O-level I forgot then I quit then I quit then I quit then I quit then after that
they asked to come back again that's why I was like no I no to the club
it's (um) I just feel like I have the passion for it but
it's not what I want to do in the end so
maybe not my passion [ah] but you get what I mean I don't know me as a person I like to try everything and I want to do
good in everything and that's me [lah] but that's the thing [lah] I can't focus on one thing [lah]
right now it's not I think it's becoming popular
so
it's becoming popular because we're good at it I think now ya we're good at it we came in
the asia games we came in third or second that's not bad [ah] honestly
but national wise (um) don't know yet [lah] but I think not bad [lah]
not bad I think not bad [ah] honestly not bad [ah]
ya but if you if you were in it I think you will know the there's competition to watch
same like other C_C_A [lah]
so ya [lah] I decided to do the volunteering thing then of course I met you [lah] that's how I met you [lah]
like
I don't know I was so nervous actually because like
it was such a weird
C_C_A like
it's not weird [lah] it's like
it didn't feel like everybody was there for the same thing
it's like do you get what I mean I don't know how to say like some just join because this is the most #chillest#
kind of C_C_A kind of thing but some join okay of course I want to help and everything
then
and then like
ya I didn't know you that much [ah] I think the only time I actually got to know you was during the camp
the smart asia camps right
ya
I thought I thought you I don't know [eh] I was kind of scared of you [lah]
I feel like you like a
legit legit legit legit but actually you're very friendly
not like not like you look [lah] but then you
have the vibes but you're quite smiley [lah] so
ya but then I also
not I also don't mind also
talk talk to other people so it's okay but then actually
didn't expect then
ya [lah] actually quite fun [ah] actually
smart asia was the most #randomest#
thing ever
quite a lot right
[kan] in fact
flower actually everything actually almost all
(err) you did the flowers for the mother's day
for the whose idea was the ignite [one]
there it's more than one idea we just added added added added added right
ya we we sh~ that's that's the best idea [sia] I don't know why [sia]
I feel like end up right
we'll always be the last ones to stay back and last ones to do the thing cause we're the organisers of the thing
correct correct
yes correct correct
but we're trying to
the worst I feel like the worst is the camp
because we didn't make our camp remember we made the dance night last minute
because nobody actually wanted to go it's only like five people seven people
then like !wah! damn sad [eh]
because I feel like
I don't know like I said I think
people were there for different reasons not particularly to commit to it [ah]
they just want to have a C_C_A so like
[oh] there's actually point incentives to do let's join this [one] instead and get
point system or something like that
so ya [lah] I think it was fun [lah]
but it was like really the C_C_A really feels like a like a amongst us kind of
C_C_A like we're the cause we're a part of the EXCO [mah] then we're just like
let's okay let guys (um) we plan plan plan plan guys what do you think great great
it's just us deciding among each other you know that kind of thing ya
ya then I don't know
if you would rate your okay nevermind let me think properly
which is the best
experience of
tertiary education
no no no not okay education which stage
is the most [ah] ya ya ya which stage is the most exciting to you
(mm) [meh]
okay [lah]
happiest unproblematic yes
okay okay okay yes yes yes
okay
[oh] okay
yes [oh] my god
(mmhmm)
okay
okay
[oh] there's such thing [ah] okay I didn't know [leh]
(oo)
I was quite popular in various gorgeous for being like the top housekeeper like I don't know why but like our sports the there is like even and rope skipping sector where it
!wow! got vision this is a sport
(mm)
[oh] my god you so pro [seh]
while skipping
!wow! pro [seh]
(mm)
!wow!
(uh huh) (uh huh) (uh huh)
ya that's why (mm)
okay
!wow!
but
it's with music [ah] usually the competition
[oh] my gosh
ya
(oo)
[oh]
wait so so
[oh] okay
ya ya ya ya ya
(uh huh)
[seh] [lah] [oh]
(oo) okay
is it not your passion also
for fun [lah] (mm)
I cau~ I also only started dancing
ya but not good
I like free styling but I don't know they keep
every s~ I know can do K-pop [ah] you know
I free style a lot but but at first I look stupid [lah]
ya I don't know why I found myself good at it later I show you [lah] the video
but don't judge don't judge me [ah] I I no training but like
ya so now so meaning
ya ya
okay
[oh]
it's like contemp~ but fast and sync
[ah] you like the synchro~ synchro~ kind [lah]
[ah]
okay
(mm)
(mm)
it's so
[oh]
[oh] not bad [ah]
okay okay
if win win [lah] you lose ya
forte kind of thing
okay
[oh] okay
(mm)
[oh] so there's
[oh] shit
!aiyo!
(mm) okay
not supportive [ah]
[oh] shoo~
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
but you got you work a lot of you work yo~ [ah] ya [lah]
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
!aiya!
okay
but you made it though
ya ya
(mm)
that's quite interesting flow of experiences
primary sch~
not really
(mm)
you did [ah]
my G_P_A [eh] my G_P_A also same
[eh] I kind of want to but I don't know what course
but the thing is I also don't know there is there is but the design is very specific
your what going to design very emotional design graphic graphic design
video video so I don't know what I exactly want
ya it can be also content design
or data I don't know [lah] a lot of stuff [lah] they want specialist specialist
I actually want to be a creative director
ya meaning
if there's a project visually I'm I I'm in charge
so let's say it's a photoshoot let's say it's a photoshoot
if I'm the creative director
the props is me the concept is me
that kind of thing [ah] so you can if you're a graphic designer
you can the it's more production
but if you start from designer also can because you already have the visually your own
own kind of taste and everything then you can put the element inside
production okay for example I'm trying to think of
a concept yes okay let's say creative creative creative director (um)
I'm the creative director of M_T_V
so the show the art direction of the show the concept of the show
is up to me
can can be
can be small can be big ya can be small can be big (um)
it can be magazine creative director so can apply for a lot of stuff
so
but creative director is you need a lot of you need to know your shit [lah] basically
you need to like you worked with so many people you know so you need to be out a lot of
ya that kind of thing also can but just anything that makes it I don't know I feel like right now
I'm not stuck to one just just try everything see what I like the most
but I'm quite I like media it's just that media is
but I like I want to make my own films
cause in films you can make your own design also [what] technically
I have but it's only for personal videos [ah]
not not like a thing thing [kan] but I can do a lot it's just
you need nowadays you need to be different
like stand out I think so it's hard to have a brand basically to make a brand
but it's okay [lah] should can [lah] basically but anyway I'm just saying like
!wow! I didn't know that you had that (err) roller coaster of jumping on
a lot of interests and it's very different from each other
ya cause I'm just like
[oh] that's how you get got into culinary I wa~ I'm quite like surprised
I can't believe that like what really everyone
ya wha~ what what would you do if it's not
actually you can [seh] I don't know I think you can [eh] no but you can [eh]
but still your design not bad
I think it's not bad it's just that you needed to develop it
but yo~ (mm)
develop which one ya cannot decide which is actually same problem problem with me I also don't know what to focus on
but then they say it's good to be good at everything
that kind of thing
master of none
okay I want to work as a
the end of the day but then not just grades you know but nowadays it's not really about grades so
you know what I mean
that's why
ya but I think nowadays
I don't know how to say adaptability
maybe I'm just being biased but adaptability I think [ah] poly student will adapt better than a J_C student
which is unfair actually
like they say they say get experience get experience we have experience
[oh] sorry [ah] you don't have you don't have a university cert you don't have a J_C cert so sorry [ah] sorry
then the other person will be like [oh] (uh) you're accepted then I'll be like !huh! why I wasn't accepted
[oh] the it's not the standard and everything and I'm like [oh] and they have a higher pay
just because you know unfair quite unfair quite unfair [ah]
quite unfair [ah]
the world is unfair but it's fine you know what they you know you know a great person once said
like is unfair so that it is fair to everyone
you know who who said that me
no [lah] no [lah] I I made it made it up myself
I think it has to be unfair for everyone so it will be unfair for all so it's like
correct correct
which is why I feel like
it's not fair to judge someone
(uh) like by how much they work
cause like they always say this
(uh) if you work hard enough you will get it actually not true [eh] it's all about chances and opportunities and connections
and that's I feel like the reality of it is true is
it will never be it I don't know [ah] but it will never be measured by how much you work
is it will always be measured by
it will be controlled by someone who has
the upper hand
that controls how much we work and all cause we will
like how to say you'll never escape
you will always be working under somebody
ya that's why like robot robot ro~ robotic
ya but like ya I feel like I don't think
I feel like being rich here I I could be a
that's like the same as me being a evil person
you know what I mean if I'm not fair [lah] if I'm not fair
labour it's like there's so many chains under
I think humans are the reason why
we don't do well we just
ya
correct
so it be forever like a cycle so humans humans eat other humans [lah] to survive
where it should be like
I got your back cause I'm a human also I wish people like
a bit more
section
no like more like basically understanding each other instead of
just
(uh) just see it as it is
like it's a bad thing [oh] it's a bad thing but there's more to a bad thing the bad thing could be like
[oh] the person didn't mean it it's by the own circumstances that made it like that you know I mean so
yes correct correct yes
ya
like I've always thought about it like
being good and being bad like
if you have the
capacity to be bad then you have the capacity to be good
if you have the capacity to be good you have the capacity to be bad
so not everyone is good not everyone is bad everyone is just human
[kan] you can't compare to anyone else because we don't know
we don't know everything [ah] basically
ya correct ya so we cannot like judge
but then judge is in our nature [what]
you know like I want my dream house to be so so huge like I want it to be like the size of
like one
golf club
wait can you imagine like it it will be so nice if like (uh)
so like
you can grow your own plant
ya
singapore very hot
all these can make money
ya and then after that you just drive in your golf
like you know the go cart is it called go cart
buggy
ya buggy do you know it's called buggy K ya
ya so ya it's so nice like can you imagine like the size of it
no the the land
then like
ya exactly so like
you cannot have what you want to have inside your imagination
so
like if you think about like
golf club
!wow!
who say I want to buy in singapore
ya ya I don't know
maybe you wanna go like
because like like singapore is like so home and dearly
and then like if you were to like have a house maybe it can just be like a sta~ staycation house is staycation is it called staycation
vacation house
but then
ya
(uh huh)
J_B
(uh huh)
then
[oh] ya ya ya
very modern
because it's like made out of wood like it's very rare like you know like only like places in indonesia have
I think #pulau ubin# is a concrete

hello my name is #hady#
hello #faidil# (um) how have you been
so ya I haven't been out too much lately but I hope it will change in the next few days
okay so I have (um) the first question for you my first question is (um) just the other day I was walking outside (um) an apple store at white sands shopping mall
and I was looking inside and I saw they were selling this new phone [ah] that apple just released I think probably about a month or two ago retailing about maybe eight hundred nine hundred dollars plus
and I went into the store and I took a look at the phones and I was just comparing it with the old models and I didn't actually notice much of a significant difference in the looks and I read up on the performance not that much of a difference and I was just asking myself (um) I was wondering why would people fork out such huge amount of money for phone that is so insignificant in its performance or visuals compared to its (um)
previous models I just wanted to know your thoughts on that
(um) for me I would one hundred percent say with certainty that I do not think that phones in general should be retailing at four digits like one thousand dollars personally
I like to think that anything above five hundred dollars really is more of a luxury rather than the necessity
and I personally think that there are way more quality phones that you can get the super underrated for less than five hundred dollars and I think it's quite sad to see a company like apple maybe take advantage of maybe hardcore users by simply releasing phones that
are way out of the average person's price range and
I feel like it's obviously a bit sad to see from where it came from from the past years and you know these phones that come in at four digits are not really much to brag about in terms of any innovation that it possesses compared to maybe an iphone that came out two to three years ago and I'll be personally disappointed if I was a fan of apple and see with what they come up with
and I just think that since phones are such a necessity in our daily lives I feel like a one should strive
to aim for a balanced price range versus a top quality performance of a iphone
so ya I mean
so ya that's my opinion
(um) my second question for you is the past few days the weather in singapore has been really hot
and with (err) the importance of us wearing mask outside with COVID going on how have you been coping with the blazing weather so far
[ah] ya for sure I agree
it's crazy to see what the weather is like nowadays you think that living in singapore for twenty years you get adjusted to the humid weather but it seems that everyday it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and obviously we can attribute it to
whatever you know the climate or climate change or you know but I do agree that I think the only way that we can you know try to battle this weather is to stay hydrated keep drinking lots of water and try to get to cool places as often as you can don't stay out in the heat for your own sake
(um) ya and please don't forget to wear your mask cause for the wellbeing of the people around us
and my next question for you is what is one thing that you wish was free
(um) ya (um) that I totally agree with you
I can empathise with with having friends who (um) don't have great vision and seeing them fork out a few hundred dollars on something that they need
which is the spectacles and obviously is not going to be easy for everyone to afford you know cause
obviously spectacles are very expensive although it is a necessity and if I had one thing that I wish was free I would say something along similar lines I'd say I wish that healthcare was free
cause it's as a person who has been to hospital trips a few times and I've seen the amount of money that not just me but maybe the people around me have to fork out
just to pay their hospital bills and obviously in singapore is I'm very thankful that the government helps us a lot in subsidies but obviously healthcare is also important in singapore first first class
hospitals here and first class treatment and I guess can't take for granted the subsidies that the government gives but
my parents have to fork out some cash and my parent's siblings have to fork out some cash (um) just to be able to afford and you know help chip in
so in an ideal world if I could ask for one thing to be free I would say free healthcare for everybody regardless of who they are what their salaries status is
(mm) yes
(um) that's a good question something that I've thought about since I was a young kid as well I'm sure everybody has thought of it and been asked at some point if I could have one superpower it I guess I have to go with (um) the superpower of invisibility
and I think it would be pretty obvious why (um) I think it be pretty cool to be running around and nobody sees where or who you are
I can just board the plane and get past custom without anybody seeing me you know can travel anywhere I want
so ya I I think I'll be a pretty good criminal if I had the invisibility superpower you know it's just I think it'll be pretty fun to say the least
nobody can see us and obviously I hope for it to be
(um) temporary rather than permanent cause I still want to see my parents
I don't want to be invisible without them seeing me that'll be that'll be pretty bad I'd say what about you
I mean ya that's that sounds great to be honest (um) mind reading (um) I'm sure everybody has wanted to do it
(um)
we can have any planted tube inside our brain you know where we can access one another but I guess for my own personal reasons I wouldn't want people reading my mind you know
I'm sure you agree
(um) ya of course my next question to you is if you can instantly master three skills
what would be the three skills and why
[ah] ya before I say the three skills I master I (um) I agree with your last point about being able to
(um) be friends with everybody cause as an introvert
I often see myself having maybe a bit of trouble maybe a bit of shyness trying to
interact with the people around me although at the same time it makes me treasure
whatever friends I have now more than anything I have in the world
and right now the three skills that I'd master
the third skill that I would like to master is probably
(hmm)
I think I would say
being able to master just learning anything as quickly as possible and obviously it sounds more vague I mean I'd say anything cause obviously in life you will come across a lot of challenges and a lot of new experiences and
I think it would be great if I could just learn anything at hand just instantaneously cause
obviously I don't want to fall behind and you know let's say I enter the workforce and and (um) you know there's something new to be learned or something new to be
to be found out then I guess I would like to be able to learn it as quickly as possible
just for the for my own benefit
and moving on my next question to you is
do you watch T_V and if so what genre of T_V do you watch
from ya I mean ya actions sounds great (um) I I also want to ask you what what kind of movies or shows do you watch regarding that topic
maybe
dwayne the rock johnson maybe
(um) ya that I mean I mean I'm not personally I'm not a big fan of action myself I think I would rather access my emotions cause my favourite
genre of T_V
or movies I'd say is definitely romance cause I'm a bit of a softie myself so I like to cry
some of my favourite shows or movies of romance I'd say for T_V shows I would go with master of none starring #aziz ansari#
it's really great it really got me in my feelings
for movies there's a lot but I name my top three I'd say number three I would say maybe (um) five hundreds days of summer
starring (um) zoey deschanel number two maybe I'd say her starring joaquin phoenix and number one I'd say lala land starring emma stone and ryan gosling
obviously any movie starring the rock and kevin hart
those are absolute blockbuster movies and they always live up to their names
(um) ya and
regarding the questions about T_V I'd say in this generation maybe T_V is not quite the medium where we watch movies nowadays I think most of us would want to watch it on our phones
or maybe on a tablet where it's easier to access I mean obviously it's a shame to see T_V dying out but
ya this is the new medium and most of us have already adjusted to it
I I agree I personally myself for romance movies I
my favourite movie itself indeed it's not the ending is not the cliche of
other like other romantic movies in fact the ending it's not cliche itself was the reason why I was crying so much cause it was so unexpected
so ya I mean it's hard to pick out something that is so good and and maybe a genre that is so saturated with just plain jane movies that we seen over and over again
and so now my next question to you is along the lines of T_V and movies if you could become an actor or an actress who would it be
(um) ya johnny depp is indeed a fantastic actor who doesn't love pirates of the carribean right well personally I would say if I could become an actor I would
want to become ryan gosling
obviously cause he is in my favourite movie lala land acting with my favourite actress emma stone
so you know if I could take his place that will be pretty sweet and I mean the guy has acted in quite a lot of great movies like nice guys and and I guess his sense of humor and how he says it in a dead in a deadpan way
I kind of see his resemblance or my resemblance in him so ya I I like him
I mean I mean to be honest if one day I woke up as johnny depp (um) I won't be complaining to be honest but ya I guess johnny depp and ryan gosling personally really not
the same type of actor maybe
or maybe play the same type of movies
I mean you have your own opinions and I have my own taste [ah] so ya and to be honest I don't really care about who johnny depp dates to be honest
I I more of a fan of the movies that ryan plays so ya
I mean it'd be pretty sweet to wake up one day as a as a famous actor in hollywood
(um) my next question to you is
would you rather fight one
horse sized otter or one hundred otter sized horses personally I think I would rather fight just one horse sized otter cause
I think I don't think I can handle one hundred of something
and very small but you know it comes in pax so
I think I might get overwhelmed pretty quickly but
it's just a hypothetical and I just want to know what you think
thank you for agreeing with me and my next question to you is on the more sentimental a nostalgic note if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago what would have been inside that time capsule
if what else would I put inside I probably put in a few of my
xbox three sixty (um) console disc inside cause I have very fond memories of me playing games on my console when I got back from home
from primary school games like tiger woods V_G_A tour maybe or maybe like
(um)
FIFA O nine or FIFA ten
where I would just everyday go home and play it carefreely
so
(um) ya [lah] (um)
just
I can't I can't really think of what else [lah] to put inside but
if I knew I'd agree with #faidil# as well
I would put in a note to myself I think it's like it's like what you said [lah] (um) I just
I just write to myself and
and just talk to myself about how life how great life was ten years ago
I I really wish I could go back in time [ah]
so ya that's what I would find inside my time capsule
do you have a question for me
okay sure I I will ask you the question (um) my next question is
if you had three wishes maybe for yourself for your family or you know you just for the whole world what will you wish for
that sounds like a pretty decent innovation
I I would definitely hope that
wishes
you live a cruel world and it's hard live without money so I just give an infinite amount of cash to
basically every single billion person in the world
you know just drop them a stack of cash so that they can
live a better life
my second wish would be (um) being the crazy football fan that I am I really wish I could own
chelsea football football club and cause I I really love football and I really love the club so it would be pretty cool to own the club [lah] cause I think that I can run the club better than its current owner and I think I have some pretty good ideas and on who to buy and
you know I can just give myself unlimited free tickets to watch the games so it's I think it's a pretty good package you know if I could ask for it and my third wish would be
(um) if I had a third wish I would just (um) in a cliche kind of answer I would wish for everybody to just have eternal happiness cause
it's hard to see your own friends or your own family be down sometimes
and even yourself so it's like it's
I mean obviously everybody goes through rough times but
it would be nice to see everybody live very happily (um) for until whenever
you know so ya that would be my three wishes I've heard yours
selfish
and my next question to you is
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life
what would it be
(um) if I could have one dish for the rest of my life
I mean I I take it as my meal for the rest of my life but
ya
I think
it's more of a sentimental dish rather than a dish of
you know something more extravagent like you know maybe a steak
maybe #wagyu# beef maybe
but no I would think my own mum's dish
is it a job that like any job I can choose
I would choose
I would take two jobs one job I would want to become an actor
in hollywood cause that's something that I always wanted to do
cause there's a lot of people I admire in the industry
(um)
I really like the work that they do and you know how they always (um)
the first people when the news breaks so
the first people to report on something new happens
I feel like the thrill of the job
is something that I can never get bored of
(um) (um)
there's always something satisfactory that I can look forward everyday
what about you
(um) !wow! (um) those three jobs sound great
and you know I will move on to the next question now
the next question is
good looks or a fake body
what would you prefer
I think would say that
a girl's personality is number one right
that's that's just what I think [lah] obviously everybody has their own preferences but if
I think if given a choice I would give a girl I would get a girl with a banging personality
over someone with a face like a a ten [lah] what about you
(um) ya of course personality is always number one
and obviously we cannot judge a person by what they look like judge a book by its cover you know
so ya
(um) !wow! (um) first of all
I
that is a surprising statistic personally
and and I just think that maybe it's maybe it's a taboo for them to talk about it and maybe they are not as open to it as us and obviously suicide is just
is is a is a horrible way to end someone's their their own life and I I hope that anybody who goes through maybe a a depressive phase you know you know troubled times I really hope that they
would seek (um) a therapist or someone who is an expert to to help them cause it's it's always sad when you know someone who's taken their lives or just
it's just a waste of a life [ah] and what's your thoughts
(um) ya for sure (um) I feel like
(um) the awareness itself about mental health is very important (um) obviously in the past few years I think it's been way better now nowadays and as someone who knows somebody else who's who has anxiety who who has gone through depressive phase and knows about it I know about them I I myself am guilty of disregarding their feelings and just telling them to you know
get on with it you know and I as having been there and done that obviously I am very guilty and I feel bad about them cause cause and thankfully obviously they did not they did not end their own lives cause you know they manage to seek help but I guess I guess everybody
why you know has has been there when it comes to disregarding someone's else feelings and I think it's something that as a community I think we all can improve on
how about you #faidil#
[oh] should should I go first ya (um) first of all I'd say there's a lot that I am thankful for to be born in singapore (um) first of all
I'm very thankful that my parents have been able to live a stable life being here (um) I myself have been able to been raised up in a good community in a good place living in a H_D_B block
and (um) and seeing what my parents have to work for just to be able to afford to send them to school to send them for their hospital meetings all and seeing the cost of it itself I'm very thankful that the government helps to cover and
I know my dad has never said it but I'm quite sure he is very thankful as well
and I I just hope that
me and the people around me will be able to work hard and just live a stable life in singapore
how about you #faidil#
(um) I also like to give a shoutout to all the nurses who work during the COVID (um) period we are also very thankful that they putting the hours everyday cause it's been a it's been crazy times for singapore for the whole world and it just I like to give my appreciation I'm sure my friend #faidil# feels the same way and with that I #faidil# thank you for talking to me today I'm sure we talk about a lot of stuff a lot of different stuff today did you have a good time

(mm) [oh] ya all these are all affected
(mm)
and to see but the
how to sit and apple
ya
mentally physically
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but also depends on each person [lah] because like some people are like you know they're the extroverts and
introverts but then the introverts will like appreciate this point of time because of like they all just have to like constantly stay home and not have to like meet other people
bad for us mostly to the extroverted side that [one] can affect us like a lot
(err) yes but I feel like I've changed honestly I mean I told people that I'm an extrovert but then like the other time I took the test like I've changed
I mean I'm still an extrovert but some factors changed so I mean I don't know if like it's possible for our personality to change like that
I don't know I feel like cannot wait so from what
you're still extroverted right
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
like I feel I feel like as we age [ah] and then we find ourselves to like keep
we find to keep to ourselves more not as much as we did like last time when we were younger
ya sometimes it gets draining so we need like time for ourselves like for awhile maybe one or two days then after that we can go out again
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) ya I understand
(mm) (hmm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but right now I feel like we are slowly getting back to how we were last time though
like crowds are not so crowded but people are coming out more roads are getting slightly busier and stuff like that so I think
it's quite of a slow moving but we are still going back to our way [lah] but it's just slow
(mm) (mm) (mm) [oh] my god ya
everytime I see such videos I feel very blessed to be in singapore honestly but then like you know cannot put my guard down also cause we don't know what might happen anywhere
(mm)
(mm) our blessings
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
ya ya ya
(mm) (mm) (mm)
so we have some parties who are willing to talk about the minorities right (mm) (mm) (mm)
a change [lah]
progress
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
close minded [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think I uses an enormous
such matters
but I feel like when I go online I mean when I go online I see like people are quite vogue [ah] about all these matters but then come to con~ come to think of it social media is most likely just like the youngsters
my our generation but then like still singapore is mostly made up of the older generation also who are still stuck in this kind of like mindset
so and then it's they make up most of the people in singapore I mean
overall then still singapore is still considered quite close minded and traditional [lah] due to some of their thinking those are their thinking
but then like you know I see social media all then like all the youngsters all that [one] is like
they quite okay quite woke but then like you know it's still just a small what percentage of singaporeans ya
(mm) (mm)
thinking
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
but I'm glad that some of the percentage of the votings for the elections was also
made up of younger generations so that [one] actually like kind of assured me
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
what
[ah] flaws
(uh huh)

mindset

anyway tell me about yourself like like how you from
from secondary school from primary school until poly like we met in poly correct
we met in poly and then I mean I didn't think we had a chance to get to know each other also
like we mostly met for like
ya for our tasks and things to do not at our own timing so like I think we can take this chance to like you know
any~ anywhere you can start [ah] anywhere you can recall
!wah! sis you know my my memory sucks [lah] so

(uh huh)
then
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but in school you use the school stick [ah]
but for competitions do they provide sticks or
[oh] so in the end you still bought [lah]
class fund
[oh] edusa~ [eh] [ah]
edusave [eh]
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
so you prioritise the (uh)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
so your for your school floorball was it an all girls or mixed
[oh] there's two floorball teams
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so you improved a lot [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
why though
looking be scared probably isn't it
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
did they like dislike you
hatred [ah] [oh] acceptance from that
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
to join you [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
for me I I tend to like you know get myself into like
this kind of things [lah] like if I see your personality is like something that would bring drama to my life I'll be like
okay I'll just like you know distance myself from you
so like for me drama is like really I don't really face dramas [ah]
ya like even okay the most I've ever had drama in my life was
poly but I it's not me it's like people in the class I wasn't involved at all the people was in the class
and then like they were talking about it I mean I hear people talk about it but I'm just like
okay you know like whatever let go I'm the type to like if you don't do shit to me then I'm okay with you ya
as long no matter what people say about you [ah] so as long as you treat me right then I'm okay [lah] so like I mean
that's how I feel like I came with like a non~ no drama life ya
it's not even me drama is like my class drama you know that kind of thing
and then the class drama and then they all talk about it that's why I can got to know about it [what]
if people don't talk about it I don't think I will even know about it
(mm)
the floorball is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think that's what happens when you put a lot of girls in one place
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
get through with it
(uh huh) [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so you guys were sort of like the junior team is it
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] math was the only one you failed
but
[oh] okay
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
so neat
so did you like ever thought of like continuing your floorball things in poly
really I never hear [sia]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] okay
life skill
I feel like sports is like you have to have a passion for it [lah] if not it's like really tiring for you
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] floorball
that is going to affect your grade more [sia]
exams
[oh] my god O-level
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but I feel like sports also especially floorball in singapore it's not really a (um)
really
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
really
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I mean it doesn't as someone who's not very involved in sports I I never hear like
I mean person as someone who's not very involved in sports I mean I never hear like
floorball before [lah] in singapore [ah] like a popular way
weird why
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
[ah] [oh] ya
[oh] ya we had the camp
!huh!
really
vibes [ah]
(mm) (mm)
but I think we achieved quite
a lot [lah] from our time there
which one the flower
I don't remember [sia]
(mm) ya ya ya
I think for me I think I've a lot of ideas in my head [ah] but I think executing part [ah]
that [one] is not for me [ah]
that's true
(mm)
I feel like also like we all as organisers we have other commitments also
and then like it's not necessary we're not full on committed to this role of ours
and then I think that's one of our flaw [lah]
why [ah]
[oh] [oh] why though [ah]
why [ah]
[oh] [ah] ya ya ya
ya [sia] !haiya!
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
tertiary is what secondary [ah]
[oh] primary secondary or poly [ah]
for me I think okay the most time I enjoyed will be
primary school but then the thing is like primary school whi~ I was like really young so I didn't have any like
secondary school wasn't really good for me poly also
poly was #aite# but I wouldn't say it's very good also
ya so I don't think my education was a kind of a fun time for me [lah]
so I would choose the primary school [lah] cause like it's the most
unproblematic ya
anyway let me tell you all about my school life
so for primary school right I was from #ahmad ibrahim# at #yishun#
so it was like a kind of fun thing because like you know like if you no money or what just go staff room
and then like but I was
in #ahmad ibrahim# for just three years like primary one to primary three
and then after that (uh) I moved to #serangoon# so I had to transfer myself so I went to #pei hwa# at #sengkang#
so that was when I had like
so [eh] no #pei hwa# was secondary school sorry I went to anchorgreen primary at #sengkang#
so that was where [oh] wait I haven't with you yet so I'm at #ahmad ibrahim# right I joined
(err) skipping rope skipping
and ya it's a rope skipping C_C_A C_C_A and I was unexpectedly amazing at it
like I was quite popular in primary school just for being like the top rope skipper
like I don't know why but like our sports day there is like even a rope skipping sector for it
like is like you either rope skip the fastest or like you like
run while skipping that kind and like
is and I always win first no matter what level is that
and like I don't know why like I found my talent there [ah] and then we joined like skipping competitions like
even though I was in primary three only I already knew how to like you know the double double skip that [one] and then like
as someone who's like super short is like quite unexpected for me to be good in this kind of sport [lah]
and then considering I did it although it was just three years I
thought I would grow but I never
but rope skipping is
jumping [eh] so I most of the time jumping but I don't know why I never grow [lah]
but anyway I managed to join in my three years there I managed to join one competition
which I don't really remember what how we did cause it was like really super long time but I remember like rope skipping in front of a lot of people
and then like
I was with like the seniors and shit and then like everyone was kind of tall there but I don't remember seeing locals it's most of the time like foreigners
but I think I did
I think I did quite a good position at the
the time for the fastest skipper [ah] that [one]
I think I got I think I did quite for that but I really don't remember how it went [ah]
[ah] I think so
I think so but I really forget [sia] I forget I just remember skipping super fast I was like
and then after that (err) okay that's all then seco~ my primary school C_C_A was
(err) skipping [lah] then after that I went to anchorgreen #sengkang#
and then that's at #sengkang# and then there I joined dance
dance ya join and dance but I did chinese dance but surprisingly until now I still cannot do a split
[ah]
[ah] no we have three types of dances all
[ah] we have like modern dance we have chinese I don't know why but I was put into the chinese dance ya
and then there's like those S_Y~ S_Y_F things and stuff and so unexpectedly I didn't expect myself to be an okay dancer also so from primary school I got
an interest in dancing [lah] so that's when I like find out myself about dancing and stuff
so ya primary school was one of the most memorable ones [one] I would say
like no problems at all no dramas and shit and like everyone's just like
vibing so
[ah] ya [lah] those [lah] ya just for fun
really
from what like
just like interest (uh huh)
personally I feel free styling is like
hard [sia] for me
(mm) (mm)
because it's up to you also [what] right ya
okay
[ah]
(err) for me I don't know [eh] I feel like those
type of things you know there's like contemporary and shit for me I don't understand [eh] this kind of dance like I don't
see it being nice it's just like people moving around the body is not I mean it's like ya I mean it's like
[ah]
(uh) I think I don't know [ah] I mean if like one person do on her own [ah] I don't really enjoy it
but if like many people synchro~ that kind then it's okay [ah]
but for me I don't understand contemporary and urban urban [lah] like
I don't understand the nice to it [lah] hip hop that's like that's like nice [ah] I feel like that's nice ya
but like contemporary I don't understand personally I don't understand
I don't appreciate ya
okay so after primary school secondary school secondary school I joined ODEC
outdoor adventure club
so from there I gained a lot of experiences like I went rock climbing dragon boating
and then I joined like competitions where you know like those triathlon kind of thing where you cycle and then you run and th~ then
then after that I got rock climbing kayaking dragon boating
[oh] I even joined a ka~ kayaking (uh) competition
and ya in
#polys# [ah] I mean T_P organised it
but it was secondary school (err) but the girls managed to got third I think
and the guys I think got second so it was quite a
it's quite (err) like an achievement for us [ah]
because we didn't expect to win at all and it was just like a side thing for our C_C_A
like you know it's not our kayaking C_C_A it's like outdoor ya outdoor adventure club C_C_A not
kayaking so it's not our forte kind of thing ya then after that (err) then we got
kayaking and stuff [oh] there was rock climbing as well
so there's like a level one cert level two cert and stuff so we got a level one and then we got like
so normally when we did
C_C_A is normally with N_C_C
so sometimes when N_C_C do things we'll also do things [ah] like those like
(err) camps and shit and stuff is normally with N_C_C [eh] so like ODEC also mostly was boys
so and then like sec four us as the seniors there's only three girls
and everyone was guys and considering with N_C_C so everyone was guys
and there's only three girls so it was like I mean
for me I feel it was okay [lah] cause we managed to like I mean
the girls and I we have like those we're not very feminine also
so we're like ya so we're okay
so everything was like unproblematic but like
(err) secondary school I didn't really enjoy because my teachers weren't very ni~ good
teachers [ah] I would say ya they're they're not very good at teaching and I don't see like kindness in them also only some
but then like my form teachers and stuff like [meh] so I don't
ya so I don~ didn't really enjoy secondary school and then came to poly the somehow I
got into culinary then after that
[oh] ya I work at Starbucks before but I so like ya I learn
I learn I learnt like latte art from there and stuff but then like surprising unfortunately
this course the coffee part is like only one part ya
so most of the thing was like in kitchen and shit which I don't really enjoy so I ended up not really enjoying this course [lah]
and like then ya somehow then after that like although like we did like kitchen practices and stuff but
kitchen really stressful [lah] the the environment the stres~ the environment very stressful and then there was like wine tasting
it's kind of it's kind of cool but [meh] not my cup of tea
and then somehow I
got through it so here I am now as a tuition centre admin
but I feel like I got most experiences from like my primary school or secondary school [lah]
poly like not really [eh] maybe just like smart asia but
that was fun but
nothing much for me [lah] ya
(mm) actually I did [ah] but I feel like my G_P_A
I feel like my G_P_A not good enough
(mm) there's no design [meh]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay (mm) okay okay okay okay
I didn't know (uh) re~ (uh) media is like so enhanced like so many things
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
what's for you though what's the one that you are good in
creative director what's that
(mm)
[oh] like you the posters and stuff [lah]
[ah]
[oh] [oh] cool cool cool
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
is up to you
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
then you should like work for like those (mm) shops maybe like online shops you can work as their like
like social media kind of thing [what] no [meh]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) then you should open a YouTube channel
why
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true you need to like stand out and stuff
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya I also just realised that [sia]
culinary was really just because of the coffee part [lah] really
actually [ah] if I'm not culinary I don't know what other course I would choose though I really cannot I really don't know [eh] honestly
I mean for you media media I don't see myself in media also but maybe I can do it like
I mean for me I'm someone like can adapt
right I mean that time my pos~ I design the poster also right
I don't know [sia]
ya I feel like I mean I'm that's why I say that can adapt to any like any places [lah] [hor]
that's what I'd say
ya true
cannot decide [ah]
ya I think that's what everyone's problem now [ah] they don't know what's their main
pro
ya you know jack of all trades
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya
but I feel like that's what everyone says [eh] like (err) experiences over grades but then now I feel like if you have a poly student who's
like (uh) signing up for this job and you have a uni student but signing up for this job the uni student is always going to get it instead of the poly you know
ya can adapt better but I think they will hire the pol~ the uni [one] honestly
so I don't know [lah] so I don't kn~ when everyone says
ya
your grade not good enough
ya exactly
ya so we're caught up
so
!wow!
I thought it was a legit quote LOL
I think that's kind of partly true though
but one thing I'd say is like on your quote is like (err) capitalism like how like how celebrities do very minimal
to get like a lot of amount of money and there are people out there who are working super hard but they are still earning
like the bare bare minimum
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) ya that's true
ya
and it's sad
ya
ya life in a nutshell or what it's so sad
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya like people cannot see you enjoy things
I mean like there's always bound to have someone who will be unhappy with your achievements
and stuff like that so ya
ya
ya !huh!
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) ya
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but I think that's what makes up a person [ah] a person will not have only good sides in him there are bound to have ugly sides in a person also
but then just some people has more ugly sides than good sides in them
(mm) (mm)
[ah] we just don't know what happen behind closed doors
that's true
!wow! ambitious
that's more ambitious than a private property
(err) ya ya ya

(err) to what is it
[oh] sorry like a lot of things going on in my mind
a lot a lot of things going inside the room
okay
okay so okay I let me restart
good family
[ah] ya so like their parents actually like put aside or keep this savings of theirs
like (uh) for them so at a certain age then (uh) it will be (uh) released to them or something like that
ya so it's like
so so for example right now they work right they work hard already they earn like so much already
then at (uh) one point of time
you would they would get this money
but then this money is either is up to them [lah] what what they want to use it as
so
(uh)
so
ya [lah] they
(um)
they they have plans they already planned the~ what they want to do with that money
[oh] that one I don't did I ask them
ya I don't know [lah] they say like at a certain age I think they also don't know I think I don't know
so like ya

ya
ya so so he already plan out [lah] like what he want to do with the money it's either he
(uh) buy a like a big house or he start on his own business
not most [lah] I mean like a few I mean like (uh) I have this few friends only so like
most of them okay I just say most of them like (um) plan to do like a business
or like maybe like go like overseas or something like (um) like their business is like
to
(err) overseas [lah] so like
it's just that they need
the the time to like get their money and then right that's it
it's like how our parents wait for their C_P_F
but this one is like even
ya and you don't have to wait for that age
to get it ya you know
I think like
like when you reach like adult like mature mature adult age [ah] then they will like receive the money or something like that when like the parents know that
[oh] they can
they are mature enough to handle the money [lah]
ya that they don't even think
ya they don't even think of like what job they want to do after like N_S or like you know they they like [oh] nevermind [lah] just we (uh) see how it goes
I'm like we see how it goes
I see where I go
like ya it's like you never know like they like [oh] okay [lah] see [lah] I think I think my father (um)
the the the friend
(um) (uh) son got a business so they thought of like you know just (uh) taking me in and work for them then (um) like everything is like already there the choice are there so they just need to choose
them I'm like !wah! so pampered [one] ya
so ya I think this peo~ (uh) I mean like most of these people
they'll they will like mostly do this kind of like investment or what [lah]
ya
see their background [lah]
ya
exactly
then like they don't have to like really stress or like put pressure
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
exactly
(mm)
just nice
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
degree degree
actually right
okay continue nevermind
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm) different
it's like it's like let's say like if you
in diploma right
then you have to work like extra to reach
to reach (um) the degree pay
ya then for degree
will just like that
then
degree itself is already like
sufficient you know
I mean
I don't know actually diploma is quite sufficient already
just that whether
(um)
ya because like I feel like because (uh) I have this (uh) conversation [lah] with my (um)
senior
like he's doing teaching
so he's not (um) under (err) not really under M_O_E
[ah] private or something like that but he go to schools [lah] to conduct
the classes so like
then with that time that money that you earned you actually can like do a lot with it
so like like he do a lot of like (um) he just keep on doing like (uh) freelancing and like volunteering work and like just like
to
increase his (err) rapport or something like that
you get (um) what is that
[ah]
ya then after that he just like sign up for this one thing then that that thing that requires like degree
recommendations also [lah] and all so like he said like ya actually you just need to hustle on that I mean if you want a easy way but
the the going through process is like hard
[ah] then you take degree [lah] I mean like degree also now
like I feel like
[ah]
I mean it's good [lah] I mean it's good it's definitely good for like future because like even like when you are at work age or what right if you want to do something
it's like
(uh) like a bonus point [ah] [oh] okay okay this this person got a you know
like experience in this you know
ya that's why I was like thinking then like (hmm) but then of course (um) I want to do degree [lah] but
see [lah] how it goes
[oh] my god
(uh) as at that time I check
it was for one year [eh] for one year degree is around two five
two five se~
two five thousand
[ah] if for that one year
for that one year
ya because (um) half of the year
it's (um) overseas
(uh) labrador la~ labrador
la~ labrador park
I don't know (uh) (uh) I know what's the it's at (uh) australia [eh] U_K U_K
laberer~ I don't I I don't know what's that
ya then like
but it's like so crammed [lah] like they say that there's no time then you have to do like
thesis and essays and such like that and then it's like not not like a few hundreds you know it's like thousands of words
ya I mean like ya [lah] of course [lah] but this one is like you have to do like
singapore one set then at the overseas one set and you just imagine that
then like !wah! but really like hustling [ah] then that's not
the only one then they have to rush for their
pro~
project works ya project works then like their alter~ on come [eh] accommodations over there
ya I mean it's paid [lah] it's paid but like our expenses and some of other things you need to use your own money
so like !wah!
so that's why people like sometimes use bank loan and stuff like that
which is like scary [lah]
ya
then what when you want then after that imagine after your degree you have to pay back
there's that
exactly then
thirty plus [lah] late thirties
la~
means that the older you get the the older you get your
the older you get
okay
I mean like when you want to give birth the older you get
the harder it is I mean like the guy
this one about mental you know and emotional [ah]
emotional and mental (um)
don't know because of what maybe because of health issues because you're getting older or what
then
[eh] you can't continue continue [eh] continue the tradition or the the the
ya
I mean like both their different
(uh) pros and cons (um) a different
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
I mean it's okay if like the girl is like younger
ya
(mm) it's okay [lah]
[ah] [lah] [ah] [lah]
I mean it has been like that for the longest time [lah] ya
!wah! then that one I like really have to #chiong# you know I mean like
ya it doesn't matter like age doesn't matter [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya slack off
ya
(mm)
because of how you take the things [lah] [ah] how you like actually
(uh) handle the situation
ya like more more like career men~ minded
ya
the pride ya
ya ya
ya
ya
maybe it's a trend also where people hire more females
they are more towards the towards towards the career path
ya I mean like before before this generation already like
towards the career path [lah]
where be like the economy and such right so
(mm) (mmhmm) (mm) ya
ya
true [lah]
(mm)
I'll be like
[ah] that's the thing
as in like [ah] saving plan
but it's also like hard [lah] I mean like how if that if you get like one
ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then how [seh] like that
(mm) ya (mm)
some like (uh) my friend
(err)
and be [eh]
two point five ya two point five then after that
[ah] got commission so let's say if like she
(uh) managed to like (err) sell something or this (um) particular plan or what [eh] to another company or what to an event
then she will get a commission of like another what one K plus or two
just imagine then !wah! she bring home how many already then like
then during this circuit breaker
like she still get her pay
but then (um) they give her more
she need to do extra
so usually like okay because like okay
the numbers of like (uh) workers also will cut down [what]
then after that the one that is being (uh) cut off
have have already have the thing to do so that that thing that the commission that the person has to do is brought forward to my friend
so she had to do double job in a way
ya so imagine like with her pay
okay [lah] her pay got (uh) drop [lah] dropped by a few percent only like not much
they've wasn't too which is cheaper
[ah]
I mean like if she get to sell (um) that's what the the pay pay the standard pay
(mmhmm)
so she have her own [one] and (uh) the friend commission
[oh] you mean (uh) the commission extra
yes
ya ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
like that [ah]
ya it's it's it's not it's not they combined the workload
so it's like macam if if combined also like if she managed to sell one thing
then she will get commission that one thing then if
if she go to the next list if she get to sell that next list then she will get another commission that kind
get what I mean
[ah]
so like now now she bring home like around okay
around three plus three plus four
(err) because like the (err) company really like cut into half
so so they have like two they they only have two (um)
two groups two groups of managing something
so now that one group
(uh) that two group is being cut into half and then they combine these two groups in a way
so it's like
because their their workload is doubled [ah] so of course their pay also in a way
doubled [ah]
amazing [eh]
like you like your leave you cannot just
then it like you really need to
ya but then she know ya that's why
but then she knows that
she need (um) income right so she stayed for a bit that's why the commission come in but then she say [lah] she say to the boss that
[oh] (um) you know (um) my my family is my first priority so if anything happen like if you need me
like last minute and I already have
(uh) a family thing or what
I will
I will not take up the work I will take up I will still stick to my (uh) family ya
they having this (uh) conversation and like this (um) argument and it's like about this thing [ah] then she said I'm so sorry I mean like
but then they know that they can't lose her
cause once they lose her then
no one would do that [ah] exactly
so they like try to like
what is that called accommodate [lah]
so like okay [lah]
then then in the end I don't know what happened but then she's still (uh) working there
but she said that she won't be (err) staying [lah] I mean like when when the COVID
thing gets better then like the pay don't get better then maybe like she'll go to another company or something like that but then again
the pay is already like
you know I mean I I won't I won't be
complaining ya
ya I mean if I would get that much pay and
I mean I already got the chance to like say (um) stay I never be like cut off then I really got like
then my pay in a way like increased because of the commissions
then like why why would I want to like complain even though that work is hard [ah]
ya
your what is that called
yes
getting better at this
ya a lot a lot
so
ya
that's why I think a lot of like people now want to like work really hard
and like have a stable life
will ha~ not have a
to go through like this (uh)
this like like what
we go through in a way but we don't know [lah] in in time to come like how it is like
a fellow let's say the future
ya exactly
but ya [lah] just that
I feel that now (uh) people work extra hard so at least they have something
to keep like in their that box
their treasure box
dead dea~
their death box ya
so like really you really don't don't touch even like
even if got emergency also I don't I think they will try not to touch that money
I mean like unless
if the emergency is really emergency
[ah]
because because I know (err) I think (err) my my relative [eh]
so (uh) this saving [eh] that they have [eh] is for like emergency for like maybe
okay
urgent emergency
ya
[eh] yo~ don't be surprised I had my relative that got married at my age she going
she's the one like that you know
ya her her wedding supposed to be in two years
but that simple simple also need money [what]
then after that okay she have savings she have already have savings but then it's not enough
for that one year
weird okay
okay and they do not not together know like husband and wife
they do two separate wedding
so like the guy's side in a way I think is stable is okay
amazing but still like it's like [lah] I mean like
then then the mum on that day itself the mum was like telling us like
[ah] then after that into the point where sh~ (uh) where the mum have to step in the mum like
but she already
know that that thing will happen so she and the husband actually put aside and the father is actually very strict
then okay then that's a
that's why the father didn't know [lah] so of course the mum need to like (mm) twist here and there you know to make things like better
ya so like ya [ah] then the mum was like saying !hais! [ah] then this one also I have to like (hmm)
whole thing [lah]
so like if if the mum never help that wedding didn't happen actually
ya exactly I mean like you you I mean like throughout your life already like
burden already you know and then you have to (err) burden someone unless if your mum like your parents really want to fork out
like you know or help out [ah]
[ah] that is okay I mean it's like you know
ya it's like a gift [lah] a gift
ya
(mm) then okay [lah] ya
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya I think it's
even my brother want to get married like want to make small small then she like
because like you know (uh) so we can invite more people like like her friends then he like stress
(uh) I think combine because the girl's family is a small family
because and she live in (um)
she has a family in malaysia and singapore so she she technically a P_R
ya because she stays there
only she come here to work and also to meet the families here [lah]
and she have a family in singapore [lah] because I think the father or the mother is a singaporean
like not big so like so of course she said that she will only invite like those
like close one [ah] like the family in singapore [lah]
then that that that means right he really want to have a intimate wedding so with his side of place
then my mum like [oh] this is too squeezy then then later if I invite my friend like you know like mum's thinking like you want like you would want the friends to like
to share the happiness with the friends
then like he say but then who's getting married
he said ya then he like try to accommodate [lah] then my mum
try to understand also
but okay [lah] I mean like
different people different [lah] [ah]
ya like they they they know that okay (uh) this wedding
(uh) I want to do this for my child know I want to contribute (err) this part of the wedding you know for my child you know that kind of thing
[ah] renovation because like they are like getting older so like there are things that needs to be changed or what [kan]
like my this (err) aunty set like (err)
this big amount [lah]
ya but
(mm)
ya that's the thing
like some people join what this (err) what is that called
so after less interview of time
ya (uh) I mean no as in like every month if you like you pay
[ah] at a certain age then you can get the money the whole sum of money
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
but (err) the but (uh) it's hundred fifty times twenty five
times the months [lah]
[orh]
(mm)
I think they have different different like
(mmhmm)
ya
but if sometimes like people know just have to go to another way
just to like
ya like like not not say illegal [lah] I mean like ille~ like legal
but it's riskier
(uh) I don't know
ya
ya I mean if you think that it's okay okay [ah]
ya
(mm)
(mm) ya
but this cannot be shared with you
(um) children [ah] if you if you have children
like this saving things you should not (err) I mean like
maybe
ya
until like they reach a certain age or what ya because it's scary because like they can you never know what will you know what they would what you expect them to do like
ya
the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no [lah] I watched until the end [lah] [eh] no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last epi~ episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya [lah] because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious [what]
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
(mm)
[oh] is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
(mmhmm)
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
the what they ask for is system set the standard [ah] the standard ya no the standard [lah] because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes [what]
locked can you please lock the door
like the story line [lah]
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that

I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven [eh]
ya I don't know [ah] that [one] also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor
that was good
(mmhmm)
ya the other day right I went to the clinic at #choa chu kang#
but then at the same time because the doctor was very nice so I ask him [lah] like if he deal with
which contains like vitamin A or something [ah] I forgot what he said current sixty plus
but then the thing is I googled right N_S_C website they handle (err) severe cases
(mmhmm) cystic acne
[oh] that [one] I don't know
ya
so they re~ ref~ referred her
but how's the payment like [ah] N_S_C I'm on I'm on tight budget [seh]
but they they only accept cash [ah] they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
you should yach~
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
the exfoliator we~

I think I lost like [oh] up to four
one and the half months
around there [lah] but at that point of time it wasn't important to me [what] cause like
what I wanted wasn't weight loss

wrong timing
that point of time I was in poly [what]
so I was very weak I of~ I was often weak
(mm)
no first year I didn't skip yet okay
first year I was still like af~
three pointer G_P_A
my last G_P_A was no my last G_P_A was two point five
no as in during school before I like
self drop out self claim drop out
ya
half a year I thought that I dropped out you know until like half a year later I talk to him about it then he say !ee! no that you didn't
ya I thought I dropped out
cause the the way the my mentor said to me was
like you don't have to come anymore I was like as if I dropped out [ah] but he did~ she didn't tell me that my dad called them to just pull me out of the course
whatever [lah]
mummy but it's okay I have no regrets honestly
ya you [ah] never text me
(um)
how did you know
[oh] !oops!
sorry
so (um)
what do you want to know
(uh)
okay
!whoa! !oi!
(hmm) right
okay so
we went to walk around #bugis#
but
ya then (um)
then cause I saw innisfree right then I had to buy my facial wash so I was like [eh] can we go innisfree then he was like okay can can then cause when we were talking (um) we were chatting on telegram
he we kept finding like that we kept finding out that we had a lot of
similar stuff and
not common interest it's like
we do some
similar stuff then we also buy similar stuff
all of that
stuff
so we were like creeped out
so he asked me
what
so what kind of facial wash do you buy then I say
the #bija# one then he was like
!alamak! we have to stop buying doing the same stuff then I was like
I already bought it first so
yes
ya cute cute don't even didn't even work out
[ah]
when was it it was like in
I think july okay wait we went out like second july I remember the date
ya then I mean I'm not gonna blame his friend's death [lah] but like it went downhill from there
so cannot really say much
then
I'm not
as cheerful as you were you know
like
I give him space to like mourn his friend's death and stuff but
at some point it's
just too much I guess
when I'm
but you know how I am right
[eh] are you okay like are we okay that kind of stuff but like at this
I understand and I don't want to push him too much but like
[meh]
there was no closure honestly
he ghosted me
no it's okay
then he ghost me I'm like bro
ya
kind of like told me some stuff that make me like feel better a little bit but he didn't he just like blue tick me and went away so I don't know what to do I mean I am getting over him [ah] but
I mean
but he's such a good guy though
no I'm not
full of crank
honestly I think so
but
no I don't want
if he is
I will just say that (um)
friends
thumbs up and a heart
friend zone
input
ya it's a difficult situation
that's why okay that's why when I you know me I always confront stuff [pe] I feel like
that should like at least show him that I care about him what but I actually do care about him is just that
at some point I feel like
trying too hard I guess
cause I okay I I I like check up on him like every two days then he will always reply like he will always give late replies but like at least he reply
(hmm)
no cause okay the thing is when we started first started talking right he always reply me very fast maybe cause it's C_B period [ah] but [eh]
fast replies (mm)
so but
all this pain
not worth it I guess
you see we just been talking for what two three months
I don't think I don't
ego
you know
unless unless like what
then he will chase me and
no
(mm)
now also I'm not looking also
men are trash
why are we made to be straight when #allah# create men like this
okay philosophy
ya I do
how about you did you get some boy action
kind of
okay
(oo)
[oh] and [oh] no
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay got it
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
wait
is it also in the instagram account I follow him
the third one
[ah]
how many instagram account you have [sia]
[oh] my god
[oh] okay okay
is he white
men
at all
I like how this time around you are okay
about all of these
(um) I got one
more news I mean
ya
but then like after I stop
talking to the guy I went out with a date with
on a date with
(um)
but it's not on whatsapp
it was on wechat when we first talk to each other then he's like I really want to talk to you then I was like bro
!huh!
so
I don't think they will get send back [ah] cause he supposed to be three years there this is his first year
so
no I didn't
wechat no blue tick
I deleted the chat
but
now I feel like I want to reply him cause okay it's not cause I have
I don't know probably happy that you got back together then why he why do you want to talk to me again like
why
I mean the thing is I can still talk to him as a friend but like overseas friend but I mean I won't I won't fall in love with him again bro
but
it's like I just want to know why you want to talk to me okay whatever the hell you done
but like at the same time I don't want to tell him to let him feel like I have been thinking about him
and like I have been what debating but I don't think men think until that kind of part you know cause men are like simple
when they overthink it's about it's not about this
overthink about something else
games
(um)
[oh] you think about sex
no one think about feelings
stupid
(mm)
ya just like (um) why question mark

what do
december will be like what one year since we met
he doesn't
I don't need long I don't need a long time to know him to know how he is
but the other guy yes cause I don't understand him
cause okay the thing is right if you if I confront you about something and then he straightaway was like [oh] I'm not perfect boyfriend material blah blah blah blah like he starts off
the
de~ debate quotation mark debate
with that sentence in particular that means we are in a talking stage right
and then he

up to the sink to cut the vegetables
my back hurts I cried bro I thought it would I wouldn't recover
I cried
ya I really I really cried
it wasn't
I only had like two days break and then like those two days break right the pain was still there
then after that I have to do it again
so it's just like building on then when I finally didn't go didn't put in my shifts cause school was starting [kan] then
the the pain went away I was like wait [oh] okay
so I cried for nothing
how the heck
it's pain no cannot I don't want
ya
like I have this trick where you lie down flat on the ground with no pillow on your head then it's just like straight straight then it will hurt but it will flatten out your back cause of gravity
so
ya but I don't know didn't really work but
the yoga pose
[oh]
later can
but my back not pain anymore
#inshaallah#
retail
but I don't think that is that
(um)
as painful as that cause
knife
I got cut myself you know
the auntie literally was like [eh] be careful that one sharp [ah] you don't touch
I literally didn't even touch it I was just
it was just like
(um)
I didn't really put force you know it was just like a
a tap or something my palm tap the knife the blade
and then I get a damn cut
and there was so much blood and the auntie scold me
the auntie was like
no I didn't
I didn't
I didn't hold
but ya
it was painful
but I'm not scared of cuts [lah] but it's just like
subway subway
the place is really toxic the workplace is very toxic
I can don't tell you that it is toxic
wait what did you friend what did your friends didn't say
ya they do
okay it's not like reuse the bread [lah] it's like
they will just keep it in the bread (um)
what's that
the place where they store the bread
and then the next day breakfast if people order then we will use that
but but I mean cause we toast it right
we toast it before we serve so
it's
right
I mean
if it's mouldy we will not
sell the bread [lah]
but like for vegetable I can say that (um) cause I cut vegetables right
[ah] you know bell peppers
the top and the bottom actually have to cut it off but then (um) cause they say like sometimes cause (uh) not enough or something
we will cut that too
then we include it in the box in the container then we serve
customer that
the only thing I take is like lettuce and cucumber carrot but cucumber we cut ourselves lettuce no they come in bags vacuum packed
so I guess lettuce is fresh but
and the rest is also fresh [lah] cause
we always get
every time every time is production day
always we always have to order directly
the vegetables
so I guess it's quite fresh [lah] not bad
(uh) it's a small restaurant thai to go but
[eh] that one right the pay #masyaallah#
I mean the thing is right we only take orders serve customer (uh) maybe sometimes wash dishes and then we have to make sure that delivery orders are
like they order through online right so we we have we will get emails about the orders so you have to print the order give to the kitchen and the delivery rider
that's all it's not that it's not that (um)
complicated
why
[orh]
I mean I mess up a lot of times
so
like
but the way they key in the order is cool it's like
all on the computer
you know like how
restaurant key in orders is like there's a kiosk at the front right no it's inside the office
it's not even a kiosk it's a computer
it's not like that
ours is a computer
then the money all okay maybe it's just not a established restaurant [ah] but
it's cool
bro eight dollars per hour and like
the work is not even that stressful I can just sit there and do my shit know
cause so far away
it's at okay it's like now it's (uh) you know #kembangan# station
but I mean I can text her [oh] I can text her back and be like can I work
(mm)
I think you have to go interview
but I'm
I can go and work
but
(um) there's a straight bus from your house eight five four
I will I will also take eight five four but you have to walk a bit [ah]
ya
we get free lunch and dinner if you work that's why I like working there and the pay is way more than like
Subway
is
ya
I should have bargained bro
can like at least seven dollars [lah] [sia]
my back hurts from nothing for six fifty only but then
I guess six fifty is easy money
cause subway
I don't know how it was easy money [ah] cause every month I can get four hundred but they minus for C_P_F also gang ten percent only
so
but that one is if I work like almost
almost everyday I work [sia]
four hundred
(mm)
if not it's like what one hundred two hundred
(mm)
that one the the (um)
four hours
and that one can get really
thirty six dollars
already
no cause we have quite a lot of admin also
I think [ah] I'm not sure how good they they grow or like did they even grow cause C_B right
kind of hard
but
this everyone else is guy except for you
that's why it's a little bit scary for me
but they won't do anything
I hope
I mean
a mouse
you're a mouse
I mean
[oh]
no
then I'm not scared
ya I know
I was scared too
they were adults and when I was working that time I was like seventeen
and then like
bro sometimes they
wait the
okay so got
a few times I work closing so I have to make sure that
then the kitchen obviously the cooks will handle it right but then
I already put
the dishes like the customers ate from
at the back
so they have to wash it what but then never then I'm like
got rats
will come cockroaches will come
so I went to on the kitchen lights
it was like damn dark
outside
cause it was at night like nine P_M and it but my father was outside [ah] cause he was waiting for me he pick me up always
if I work at night
so ya
then when I mop I on B_T_S songs
so ya
that time I always did closing [ah] then my father always pick me up
ya
I'm the manager
ya
cause it's a small restaurant
then got C_C_T_V everywhere
you take money people can see
then we have to ensure the float is like fifty hundred but (um) different cash or whatever then if the kitchen want to buy more eggs or whatever they need to tell me then I give the money then they have to give me the receipt then I have to keep in the float
it's actually not that hard
this sounds wrong this sounds like
stupid but I like to handle money
cash in [eh]
bro
[eh] but giordano okay or not

but I don't know where to work
if only they take in
youngsters
okay we are not really youngsters we're like
youth please
youth
I want to work in a library
no one will talk to you
no human interaction
shoot daggers
and but if you work
I know
twenty one
cause when you work in library you are under cisco
cisco is a police
and
I don't know I never check
cause library don't really
ask for workers (mm)
you should apply
you want to go
and ask
there and be like can I apply
okay
that's a long time
but you can only work one week then after that school starts again
on second week of october
mine is sixteen
I don't know they never say anything
honestly okay the thing is right C_B started way before school started
but they are still unprepared
and I hated that
no brain
you already know this is happening but you still didn't prepare and then
always got last minute changes then the students also panic [ah] [sia]
the one that's doing the work is the student not you you just don't want the
telling us [oh] you need to do this that that but the one that is doing the work is us
(mmhmm)
(mm)
one of my lecturers also like that
like okay cause
ya science
(um)
so it's more theory based
but the thing is she reads off the slides
in her lecture videos
and it's so annoying cause when she gives us test
or (uh) quizzes
even though it's open book you cannot find it in the notes
so how am I supposed to answer the questions
then later we fail you'll be like
then if she go through
isn't this in the notes
why don't you try reading your notes and referring back to your question and find the answer to your question even if you know the answer already there is no answer in the notes
ya but
do you know the feeling where like after you have done you are done with everything then you read again then you understand
that that always happen to me
but I'm not smart actually
I'm not
I just know my shit

director's list
you don't know what director's list
it's like (um) high achiever
high achievers award it's like you're recognized by the director which is like you don't know the director
I don't know how to explain to it director's list is literally like
you know bursary but higher end
like very it's a higher kind of bursary higher level of bursary
but once you get dean list need to maintain

the or something
I think so
ya
they don't

but I know he's chinese
ya that one [ah] cause of that
but then after that they still continue talking
but like
I think got wrong with them anyways
(mm)
she never tell one thing
but I'm in her
close friends though I don't think she open open about it
are you angry
[oh] ya
one eight seven
I don't want to like rush myself so I was just like okay never mind just take direct bus
one eight seven [kan] normally is the single deck right so
like there's no space right even if like the seat is very crowded
but this one I got like the double deck one
cause you always Grab here is it or you don't really have a purpose to come to #jurong#
(uh huh)
side [lah]
(mmhmm)
so what you just have to take the train and then you take a bus or you still like you have to switch buses
some more peak hours right I cannot [sia] like there was once I worked at at like I think
like it was just tiring I was just more tired I dreaded going to school I don't mind being in school but then like I just dreaded being in sch~ like going to school
like my makeup gets smudged at the mask and all that
(mm)
(mmhmm)
honestly yeah I can understand
what's your plan I mean like (err) I don~ there was like I wanted to ask you about something like I had plans
the other day
but (uh) I forgot
to I mean like I had pla~ I wanted to do plans with you but then I forgot about it then after that I remembered
(err) like a few months ago and then like COVID happened and then I feel like it just took
way longer for me to like text you about it
it's okay
yeah
(mmhmm)
yeah like (uh) I also was supposed to travel a lot this year
then like
then like (err) I was supposed to like travel for a few countries and stuff but then like
I I just didn't have I mean because of COVID it didn't happen and also like
like
I was supposed to go I think like (um)
you know the good vibes fest at (um) #genting#
yeah I was supposed to go there and I mean and I mean it was like my first
(mmhmm)
yeah Ramly burger at the side of the road [oh] my god I miss that you know it's always like
eat at night
(mmhmm)
[oh] yeah like that's really sad it's like those like side
of the road thingy right I had
a maid like who like lives in like she we still keep in contact with her after like
you know after she left malay~ (um) indonesia
but
yeah I mean like my we sent her some money [lah] like me and my
(mm)
I have an uncle that lives there like I remember like (um) during
because for them it's like
so like they couldn't leave they just like stayed there
like it was like still not stable at all you know I mean it was like the same here [lah] we couldn't like leave anything
I mean we could not like leave the house or anything for them it's just like
they can't do anything I mean they from what I know it's like theirs more strict
but everybody still tries to get out
which is really bad you know what I heard though like there are people who
yeah
(mm)
like honestly indonesians are not fazed by the
by like any sort of ghost
(hmm)
but like okay [lah] I mean like it's still a big change in the life right
what do you mean you're not you don't you're not in school like I mean don't you have like
you don't need you no you don't need to go to campus is it
(mm)
how is the exam going to be conducted do you have to go to campus this time
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
like
in the classroom then it's like just like everybody has to social distance
[oh]
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean like
it's hard to be motivated at a time like this right then like most of my classes now since I'm like self studying and then like and stuff like that like it's not
physical so it's always just like online
so it's like like you said [lah] it's like same goes to you I guess it's like really hard to focus and then it's just like for me I work best with one to one
but like technically this is one to one but not like directly in front of me so it's like a bit
hard to focus but I think I'm okay it's like
since it's september [eh] september now right it's like
end of next month which is like like the exams is end of next month which is like super fast in my opinion
G_C_S_E is I think is in England it's G_C_E here
yeah so but like they did
make amendments [lah] for the topics I guess cause is like
for example like the sec four topics right like some of them are redacted
removed and stuff because it's like they we don't have the time to like
they didn't have the time to like properly like teach us stuff
then like I know my P_O_A paper they are removing a big
big question from like
I think supposedly a topic that was supposed to be like taught this year
actually I can do I mean like I'm not very good with numbers in general but like
I could do math better than I do P_O_A like I
back then like I was so bad at it but like I'm just giving myself a shot cause
it's like I'm just trying to work for my future at this point
but
yeah I mean like
even if with the topics being redacted and stuff like
I think the bell curve is going to be higher which kind of is going to suck so
(mmhmm)
yeah that's like my second time taking it so it like really sucks I mean like
I hope they understand the whole situation and also like maybe in future like
next year when they're like you know the intake for like tertiary education I hope there will be more lenient on it because it's like we
everybody is having a bad year this year I feel
but I mean
I understand what you feel [lah] like I also cannot like focus at home because like I have like four siblings and I have a naggy mother if I'm being honest
so it's like
you know I can never focus but then again like I'm better on my own
no matter the place like it doesn't have to be at home or anything
(mm)
only time will tell how we'll be like as marks you know in future
hopefully we're still friends by then
what were you doing yesterday
like
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yeah I mean like same goe~ I mean like I met
(err) #rifky# in the morning because like
and then I tried eating like that night itself I tried eating it again and it's still so much so like
#rifky# (err) I called #rifky# in the morning I said like !hey! do you want food
they were just doing their roundings [ah] but I didn't expect them to be like there that hour
but yeah I mean it was nothing
then after that like afterwards I just like stayed at home I didn't really do much
like
late at night [lah]
like it was so it's super nice it's like (um)
very innovative in my opinion
it's nice
(mmhmm)
I mean I've been there a few times and then like generally I feel like nothing there is
and yeah I mean like I recommend you to eat it but then it is a very big portion so that's one thing
and yeah I mean like I went to arab street like technically it was a sunday that I went there right
I kind of just don't really like going to these places in general in like
but it's okay [lah] I mean like I still like the atmosphere there [lah] it's just that it was like very hot and there were so many people so I got a bit like fussy
[oh] I ate with my family because it's like my it was my sister's birthday
then after that my sister like just requested that she wanted to eat there because like
ever since we tried there once like it became like our favorite place to eat
(mmhmm)
yeah that's what I feel also like
they from my experience right whenever like we go there like I think
(um) but yeah [lah] but I I think after COVID like they kind of cut down on it and stuff
but
[ah] you get it [lah]
you know [ah] there's this place I like to eat also it's called (um) indobowl
okay so like asides from indonesian food right they actually have this twist on like
[ah] Indomie then after that they have like for example like
side dishes and then they just infuse it together
it's a really nice concept honestly and it's really nice and the price is not so bad you know not as expensive as (um)
like (um) malayan council I mean like
a meal can go up to like eight to fifteen dollars for one it's not bad really
yeah basically then there's this [ah] I mean they have this platter thingy which I believe is
about forty dollars but it's meant to be shared but I tell you it's super nice and I don't know
I've always had good experiences with it I went there once and I kept going a few times it was just like not it's like the price point also not so bad you know
yeah actually same [lah] the other time when I was like you know because before COVID I had a job and then like
you know I could like treat myself to these kind of things like once a month at least
but now like ever since COVID I also have no money
and like
yeah so I've been trying to apply for jobs you know but I've been very access unsuccessful about it
what about you
the thing about that is they advertise it to make it sound really like attractive you know then okay to be fair like I tried to
(uh) applied for a lot also then like some a lot also never get back to me then some of them like
like is it worth like doing something like that I mean like as much as I'm desperate for a job also I'm just like is it still worth it
(mm)
they will say like [oh] we'll get back to you if we need you so~ something like that in my opinion I feel like
because the waiting is very dreadful you know so I rather you just text me and say like you~ I didn't get the job like
and like in the meantime at least I know
whether I should be applying for more jobs or I should like you know stop finding because like knowing I'll have the job or something
and yeah [lah] I mean like it's just
frustrating [lah] and then like you know these agents also sometimes they just
(mmhmm)
yeah I agree with that I mean like
I mean like I've worked a few jobs and stuff and then like you know so far I've been successful at getting it so like
this really hurts my heart that I've been so I've been rejected so many times
but and also like in a time like this you know like
everybody needs something but at the same time I understand why it's hard to hire people but at the same
time everybody's also broke so like
I don't know [lah] hopefully we'll get a job soon [lah] hopefully
actually [ah] I also under like over ove~ underestimated the fact that you know like COVID
just like outside people right and then after that there are people like singaporeans that got it then suddenly like
there was a spike and all that and it got (mm) like I was thinking to myself like okay this like whole [ah]
thing is not gonna die it's not going to
like go away any time soon
I al~ like I also did a lot of online shopping I also did a lot like
Grab delivery and stuff because then I mean like Grab
I ordered Grab cause like
I was just so lazy to cook like it was so hard to be productive during circuit breaker
then all I did was just like
order food and order a lot of things online so I thought like maybe after circuit breaker I'll also get a job but
I didn't know it was still going to be hard
yeah
(hmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
then it's like they
like they prioritize so much about being like you know like
they prioritise so much about their free speech and then you know their rights as like you know doing this and that
but it's more of just like
you know you're like okay yeah you have your rights but at the same time like
look at the situation [lah] like you not using your mask and stuff like that like okay you want to die that's your problem but then don't
be hard on other people you know there are like people who are like you know auto immune you know which are more prone to the virus and stuff like that and
if it hits them it will be like ten times harder on them as well like you know average person
so yeah I mean
then like the other time also like I was watching the news
like cause like
(err) they were (err) the leading
doctor or scientist of
the whole like COVID situation in
(um) the U_S right they were I think explaining to donald trump saying that
[oh] if you leave if you like you know stay out in the hot or the sun it will like you know
kill the bacteria of like the COVID faster
so like on surface you know like technically it can be passed through surfaces right but if it's a hot or if you sanitize it and stuff it will like die
like I don't know whether like how he read it or something but he was saying like
[oh] maybe (uh) we can look into like injecting ourselves with sanitizers with bleach and stuff like there were actua~ like you know
hoping to not get the (uh) virus then I'm like thinking to myself just like how are you
how is it possible that you even entered politics you know
like from what I heard right
like when he was making the speech
the doctor was just like staring at him sayin~ like you know thinking like you know just like
why did I get myself into this into this
yeah
and then like it was really bad to the point that you know like mayors of different states
had to like
even tweet it out and say like you know
I can't believe I need to say this but please do not
drink detergent or like don't drink sanitizers or cleaning products
I don't know [ah] cause I feel like
the people like he's so I guess business forward
to the point that he was like more focused on
like the economy and stuff like
that I mean I get it [lah] like the economy is like important and stuff but then like
you can't have an economy if you don't have people right
so is like I think he was briefed and I watched this TikTok somewhere that he was briefed
about the whole COVID situation
(um) way like in like january like before he was
like before it wa~ like it it wouldn't really like stepped into
(um) the U_S (err) the U_S or like the just the western world in general
then like
he only took action like during may
you know then [ah] before that like I was watching like patriot act or something right then he was
there was this like whole like cause like the
it started spreading through like beef
industries and stuff like that because like
they didn't (err) they didn't let
the (uh) the workers like not
like you know social distance and stuff like that and then they were like
and then like
there's this like act I forgot like what
it's called but it's like
you
can mass produce stuff
in times of like crisis or war for example like when there's a war the act
then like the (mm)
president can (uh) enable this act so that you know they can mass produce like maybe like
metals and stuff like
war planes and stuff like that so I don't know why but it mass him
enabled that for the beef industry
and then like I don't know why he decided to do it for you know then he was saying like cause
(um)
most of the things are like you know li~ like they are running out of food of something like that
something like that and plus like the cows
because of COVID like
they're all like
unattended because of the thingy but like the thing is like he put an act on that and not on like
for example like masks and like medical supplies because like
(uh) most medical supplies were from China and stuff and then the~ they were like you know
there wasn't a shipment at that point of time but then in the U_S have their own manufacturers but the thing is that
I don't know why it wasn't
acted on that and then for a moment there wasn't enough like
supplies for the medical team back in the U_S
and then also like with the whole like drinking bleach thing like it's a common sense [kan] apparently common sense isn't not
who
I don't know dinosaur
[oh] okay that is so stupid
what's his name
yeah [lah] I mean like you put in effort also right so it's like then like
for them like to not
but yeah I mean like how's your time I mean li~ like how how long have you been on OkCupid
yeah I mean I used to be on OkCupid also and then I received like the
funniest things I also I don't feel like I'm so picky also [lah] but then like yeah those like
#yo# and boring one like okay [lah] maybe I close one eye if you are good looking but like
you I don't know I mean like you want to like capture somebody's attention [lah] like
okay (err) there was [ah]
this person said
(uh) what did the okay cause like
(um) what did (err) what did the drummer name his daughters
yeah
so like you know my name is anna right so it's like
hin~ (uh) the answer is anna one anna two
anna one two three four
(mm)
(hmm)
yeah I mean like I I mean like I don't know how he
like got it maybe like it's a typical joke but then like it only works for people with the name anna I mean like how often do you know
of a girl named anna right
then also like I don't know that got me started talking
to him you know he was like really interesting and stuff but like I think it didn't really move on from there because like you know dating apps
you don't really move on that far
literally I was on all like I was on Tinder Bumble OkCupid because I was so bored during circuit breaker
[oh] okay so Bumble right
basically right for example like
okay as like
ass~ like for example if I (uh) if a guy like I swipe right to either like guys or girls
and for example like
if it's a guy the guy cannot text first
if you are the first one to swipe then like you haven't like
matched yet right then you don't have to start the conversation but if you are the one who swipes later and
you get the match right you have to be the one who starts a conversation and there's a time limit for you
like for example like there's
(uh) I mean (err) for you to text then the second you text
the person has twenty four hours to respond then from then there's just no timer
it's a very interesting concept actually
create a like you know an intro or like you know they are the ones that have like
start a conversation but this time it's like the
it's a reverse role so it forces you to want to text people
which is interesting [lah] but honestly I find like Bumble has like more good looking guys
I feel like not the typical like you know
I don't know cause like not a lot of people use Bumble compared to OkCupid and Tinder
yeah [lah] like
[dah]
[dah] [dah] like COVID [eh] so I don't know how many foreigners are still left in singapore
yeah I tried K Fry but okay honestly
maybe I had my expectations too high or something or maybe
I have like an like an idea of how it tastes in my head
it was a bit disappointing [eh]
but maybe I mean like maybe you'll enjoy maybe I'll enjoy it but maybe I just wouldn't put
like it's just not as nice as I thought it would be
but [ah] there's this thing called like a rice ball or something they mix it with like
sushi and like [eh] not sushi sorry (um)
like rice seaweed and like different stuff that one was nice but then like
would I go there for the chicken again I'm not sure
but like
the vibes is nice if I'm being honest and it's
okay [lah] for malaysia standard it's slightly pricey
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
no
you caught me at salted egg
I want to try the Din Tai Fung
(um)
and just like you know go shopping and stuff
so bad you know I want to see family enjoy the cheap food
then sometimes I like to like you know just make a little trip to J_B like at night
and then like you know just
have fun [lah] you know cause like
I have friends now who
have motorcycles
I sneak out I just like take my passport and I just go but like
it's fun it's fun
yeah I love pepper lunch okay I accidentally tried it in singapore before cause like
yeah but didn't did like the last time I think the last time I went to K_L didn't like we see each other by accident
it was like at K_L_C_C or something right
(mm)
yeah it was so funny I remember I waved at you and then my family all just like turned around just like
(oo) who is that why do you have friends I'm like no
I mean it was fun (uh) I mean like (err) I think at the point of time I was at
a wedding near K_L_C_C right but then like
we just didn't have the social battery to like you know like
just have like (uh)
to communicate with like our other (uh) relatives cause this is like a bit of like extended family it's like my dad's
but yeah cool [lah] then after Starbucks we like went to the Apple store
like then my unc~ (uh) my cousin bought like a macbook there which is like cheaper you know apparently
yeah then after that like just nice [lah] like he just bought everything there cause he was like starting school also
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
yeah I think I get you I mean okay honestly I'm not like the biggest fan of like
my family members you know I really miss it too
yeah no my aunt's (um) cousin
like from her other side then like we
(err) an indian muslim guy and the food was so good like
and yeah I kind of miss it like you know like it's also like free food right
I love it
[ah]
yeah yeah yeah for me it's like
I don't know
yes [oh] my god like
I mean it's it's stated in the name already you know it has to be there
okay but I remember some (um) the other time like I had an aunt
okay [lah] I mean like for (mm) for me for for you like you want to do anything like
very big family then like I always need to finish like my visiting and stuff like that
there's such thing
like your focuses are wrong [seh] but
you know people want to like you know
wedding would really spoil that I don't know how that works
(mm)
that's what I thought also like at first cause like
I think about it [eh] it's like
you know but at the end of the day like I mean like
have a reception afterwards then like have a bigger honeymoon right it's always better
(mm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
for me like
cause like I come my parents (uh) my grandparents are originally like from like malacca
I don't know for for me I guess a tradition
like the tradition I would want to omit out is just it being very big and with people I don't know
or like but at the end of the day it's just like I'm I mean like it's
to make it like stand out okay [lah] maybe I'm a bit narcissistic also I just want it to be like that wedding that people will never forget you know and I want ice cream
(hmm)
I~ I'm just not a fan of that maybe at most like you know
see see at least got like hot~ (err) got aircond then you know
yeah I don't know I'm like everytime I go like weddings or something I'm always like in my head like
planning my own wedding like okay how is this going to pan out and stuff
(oo) !ee!
is it the one with eddie murphy
is it
(mm)
it's okay man like I~ I've been thinking about my like future since I was like
since I was like you know really young too like eleven you know like I have a name from my
yeah I mean I have (err) I have names for like maybe my future children then like (uh) (um)
my first child I plan it to I plan for it to be like luna #malika#
I haven't thought of like a guy's name but pretty sure I like the name #maliki#
and I don't know I like the name like
#ayla# like A Y L A you know because I feel like
[ah] it's such a nice name you know it's like a unique but like not so hard to pronounce name
I feel especially with the fact that you know you you're just at home alone and then you don't really think much
it happens you know like for me is like I already picture what kind of house I want to have and stuff like where I want it to be located and stuff
like you know like in a singaporean like you know setting [lah] obviously like
but as much as I want to have like a
five storey bungalow something like
I'm pretty sure it's possible here but also like I I need to hustle way too much I mean way too hard to get there
(mmhmm)
sometimes I think about it also like
isn't it like for me like I think if it's like better for me to just my migrate because it's like
you know having everything but then I think again like all my family is here
then after with the whole COVID situation like so many like governments just like you know all the problems just came up
as much as I feel like it's a bad thing that but it's so [ah] it's also like a good thing that I feel like you know like the problems are being addressed but yeah mean like
for now at least I feel like
(mm) I'll just stay here
for the time being if not then
I'm [oh] I mean I'll just pack up and leave
yeah I mean (um)
I mean I don't understand [ah] for me is like I've always wanted to go overseas also and study but like
and competivene~ competito~ compet~
like you know it's just very competitive like in within the asian culture
go europe or something you know with like a whole different language like I want to learn som~ a new language and stuff but then I thought about it [lah] like
cause I did early childhood before and then like
to be in the environment with like your culture and stuff will like
it's better [lah] cause like the child will grow up like you know understanding it better so like for me if I'm like let's just say I move to europe
my it's going to be hard for my child to learn like
basically like three languages like for example like if I don't speak the language
like of that european country let's just say it's Spain right then like my child have to learn to like
learn malay learn it's like english and also like
spanish and also like learn the culture there then they won't have like any ties to like
singapore cause like you know they never grew up in singapore which is like a bit sad [lah] cause it's like you know it is my culture and then I want to bring it down also so
I guess like
staying in singapore is always like the best option and plus like you know being a singaporeans there's always like benefits
with like the whole like healthcare and stuff like you know
like housing healthcare
as much as it's expensive it's still like beneficial
(mmhmm)
yeah [oh] my same [lah] cause like I my eng~ my mum's malay is like super good like apparently she got like A one or something back in
secondary school and then she became a malay teacher once and then she was saying [ah] like
[oh] my god like none of my children can speak malay and she was like especially you you know
and then like my mum was saying [lah] like
(um) wha~ [ah] my mum was saying saying like [ah] like
in future she wants to take care of my children and for the main purpose is because
for sure cannot help them with their malay
(mmhmm)
sw~
(mm)
[oh]
would not be able to do as well
because it's like
I'm not very good at it but it's like you know I like the whole
idea that we still do it then like it kind of just like it surprised me that a lot of my friends like don't
like you know they don't know how to do it
and then like sometimes also like sometimes they tell me like you know they don't even celebrate like the first day or like they don't celebrate at all then I'm like
even though like growing up like you know
the fact that I know that there are malay people in this day and age like who don't do it just makes me so sad
yeah when the last time we meet [ah]
[oh] yeah yeah yeah then it was like damn rushing cause like we came there at nine then but then it close at nine thirty
yeah so long and then some more don't have the [ah] pearls that I want like seriously
yeah yeah yeah

yeah I don't know what what what is like trending now what's what do you think a good business actually now
but it's their used items right

[oh] my god we should open the cafe together
yes yes
(mmhmm)
(hmm)

full business like
like
yeah yeah and all
so like I think that's a good idea because like you never know whether your business will flourish and be successful so
[a'ah]
yeah
yet
true
one
one thing for your
is that we should open
I think the west people will appreciate it
ya that's why we should like [oh] my god you know what you should do we should
also sell bubble tea at same time that's what will make us have money gain money yes
[oh]
same same
yeah but I've never tried [lah]

(hmm)
yeah
I know right the break off yeah the break after it's all done so fun like you can do so many things I just hope that
we are we will be out of phase two
that's the thing
yeah
but not bad [leh] like the
and now there's only one thousand I think one point
three four K active cases
active cases
from total is like fifty seven K you know
cause like fifty something K
yeah that's crazy
so like
[ah] yeah true [lah] but
it's hard for them to like contain it cause so many people
then like not a lot of people also want to get tested
(mm)
[oh] yeah
is
the foreign yeah the foreign workers sporting !duh! cause
the their place place of living is so cramped so it's easier for them to get sick
yeah putting (err)
that's why they can't escape from their yeah
yeah which is good
yeah
(mm)
you got any other game
what game
hi I'm okay
(mmhmm)
[orh]
all the way
[oh] !wow!
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) ya
[oh] !wow!
(mm)
like nobody cares anymore so I don't know whether you experience the same thing or not
(hmm)
(err)
and then they they said (err) depends [ah] ma'am depends I said !huh!
circuit breaker ya [orh]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) on that day itself [ah] [orh] okay okay
(mm) (mm)
ya and some more the driver is just earning a living thing [seh] it's like they are just I I mean they are just doing their job [lah] basically I mean I don't think
because from what I heard from my friends also like the driver they don't check what is inside the content you know like they just take it's like for example like okay like (uh) mcdonald's then okay ya (err) like customer number one two three four and then they just say [ah] ya I am customer one two three four they just take and go they don't check you know what I mean
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but this is part and parcel of food delivery business !huh!
their reasoning was because
they are already a food stall they are not earning much and they're also paying grab so in the end the their their earnings is very little so we hope that the customer can understand
so I'm like !huh!
(mm) (mm)
[oh] my god really
is it because of circuit breaker
(mm) (mm) true [lah]
(uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
!huh!
(mm) (mm)
thanks [eh]
[ah] maybe [lah] (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
so #ang moh# [lah] you know and then
ya but it's quite serious [lah] because I don't know
[ah]
(mm) [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
[orh]
[oh]
(mm) (mm) okay okay
(mm) [orh]
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
[oh] my god crazy and it's scary because you really don't know how you can get it
(mm) aedes correct ya
(mm)
most likely it is [lah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
unhealthy food I mean maybe can eat [lah] once in a while but then exercise and drink lots and lots and lots of water so like my that I was talking about that case so you know what was his how he cure from dengue
(mm) correct correct
every other day sure got some story [one]
in the news both (mm) (mm) local and global news hearing the news everyday can be very exhausting [sia] I don't know I don't know about you but
I feel tired sometimes I feel like tired and scared and like [oh] my god like when is it ending like everyone keep saying that maybe twenty twenty is the year that the world is going to end because like so many things like you read about what happened in like lebanon that day and then like you know in the U_S the situation is getting out of hand it's
I don't know and then some more they got elections and then like some a lot of other countries are also having elections
crazy (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
!huh! [oh] my god
so scary
[oh] my god
(mm) (mm) fifty five
I think their hospitals exhausted their beds already
ya
ya [lah] that's true [lah] (mm) (mm) it's a bit more controlled [lah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) true true
ya I think they managed to clear out the dormitories already which is good so hopefully the workers can get back to work
you know (mm) (mm)
so somehow or rather this I don't know mosquitoes breed there
natural garden [ah]
ya definitely definitely
(mm) (mm)
ya that's true
(mm) (mm)
ya [lah] I mean I the the the thing about this pandemic I feel like people start to realise what they took for granted all this while you know what I mean I mean regardless of whether it was your health or whether it was your family time whether it is your work you know like I mean everyone is like (err) quite a number of people are still working from home
like you realise that [oh] my god like working from home is not easy that's
one but two you get to spend more time with your family and three you realize that you know like leading a busy lifestyle is not exactly a good thing like you start to slow down and all that so you know that you know like slowing down is a good thing you know like people you know [lah] I'm sure you know of people who are like you know they're always busy you know they're like they're traveling
somewhere they are going here they're going there they're going to you know taking photos for their instagram blah blah blah and then you realize after all that like when this pandemic happen then people have to self quarantine like you say
they have to sel~ self isolate you know
then like you know don't go out blah blah blah like you realise that
actually all these things are not needed you can just lead a simple lifestyle and you can still be happy and life still goes on you know what I mean like it's not the end of the world if you don't go like you don't go for that weekend getaway or you don't you know post that instagram photo blah blah blah and all that like
is all that is not important [seh]
(mm) (mm)
I can't imagine how the businesses can survive man really like ev~ every other day don't you realise like a restaurant is going to close a business is closing down blah blah blah like !walao! like
I cannot imagine like I I mean I cannot imagine being a business owner right now because like so many things to think about like the rental is one and then there's your set your staff salary your products you know how like so many things
hopefully but like I don't know like so many budgets and reserves already use and
singaporeans being singaporeans they are like complaining about (um) you know using this reserves for
for all the in~ I mean all these schemes [lah] like you said so
(mm) (mm) ya [lor] that's why funny [ah]
(mm) (mm) almost half a year [lah]
(mm) (mm)
ya that's on transport food ya
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah] correct
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
you know if you are working from home they encourage you to do home workout they encourage you to take time off you know blah blah go for a walk blah blah blah like don't
don't stay home too too much because I think
you really can go crazy like you can lose your mind honestly ya mental health is like a very important thing nowadays
(mm) (mm)
something that I don't know like
ya [lah]
correct correct correct or just do virtual [lor] everything nowadays virtual virtual event
but everything [lah] everything is now virtual [lah] like but it's quite actually interesting [lah] like virtual seminar webinar so quite I mean
ya that's true (mm) (mm)
endless [seh] like non stop like I've been watching so many movies on netflix and it's like endless like non stop like
recently it was funny because they uploaded all the local singapore movies and also
T_V shows so like imagine like recently they had like growing up you know money no enough
like you say [lah] they want singapore singaporeans in general to stay home more often so why not introduce the classics right I mean who doesn't love like watching the good old days of singapore
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
!wah!
funny ya
ya [lah] sometimes no choice is the best choice [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) physical is no longer really needed [lah] [ha]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] but really technology is so amazing like you can really do so much you know what I mean like take photos video call like zoom look at zoom like zoom was a company that nobody knew about like
pre pre COVID pre pandemic now everybody uses zoom
you know what I mean like it's crazy like it it became like overnight like I think their business went through the roof
ya and everybody is video calling I mean as much as they can because
normal I guess you know
(mm) (mm) ya
[ah] !wow! amazing (mm) (mm)
because I think everyone think like because everyone keep saying twenty twenty is pretty much cancelled right like events whatever so I guess they weren't expecting much for N_D_P also so the fact that they managed to actually pull it off is quite impressive
ya [lah] (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) cancelled [kan] [oh] postpone [ah] okay okay
for the event
so I don't know hopefully I mean I don't know [lah] I guess I mean pretty much twenty twenty is cancelled like we said like events
is you know cancel postpone
[oh] ya I think I saw that
(mm) (mm)
nature is healing [ah] mother nature is smiling finally after so long
ya I'm sure like air is much cleaner also because like there's no air there's no cars on the road there's no planes in the sky you know there's not much pollution and most of the factories are closed
blessing in disguise ya
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya they don't need to that you you really don't need all that like it all these are like frivolous things you know like we really don't need much to survive actually
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) less is more
(mm) (mm)
correct and the good thing no and like I mean the good thing is that people are saving more also right I mean like among all the money amount of money that you're not using you're you're saving [what] you know
(mm) (mm)
ya at least at least I mean all that amount of money that you don't use save it [lah] you know for something else for something bigger you know
ya
they sell [lah] [oh] okay (mm) (mm) hobby [eh]
(mm) (mm) ya that's true
ya [lah] must be positive [lah] because I mean it is hard to be positive during this pandemic I'm
somehow you have to work towards not feeling that way at all you know what I mean ya easier said than done [lah] of course but can be done it can be done ya
there's no solution to it you know what I mean
true
standard [ah]
(mm) (mm)
I mean it's complaining is part of life [lah] you know what I mean but like if you complain everyday and then but you still do the same thing then what good can it really do
(mm) (mm) true very true
I feel like there's more hate rather than you you read more negative things than positive things right about people about the news about everything so you kind of have to look for the good in the bad in that sense you know what I mean like
it's like I mean this pandemic ya like there's a lot of people being affected and all that but then I mean the good I mean I guess you have to look for the positive side of it you know you are still alive you know
you still have a job and
ya exactly
completely [kan] (uh) (uh)
ya
(mm) (mm)
it's like a must it's like you know it's
you will be fined three hundred dollars is it
if you don't wear
ya so I guess it's like you know you kind of scare people by that but like some other countries I see [eh]
I don't know maybe countries
countries are like depends on you you know it's like a self thing like (mm)
(mm) (mm)
[oh] last night my friend
video called me until until so late
my two guy friends one of them
(uh) no the the guy the one in N_S the girlfriend

the ambience the ambience is no it doesn't it's outdoor
night it's dinner
(mm)
ya so that's our dinner plan then second
sec~ (uh) plan B is
me and the not birthday guy
we go there and set (uh) we go Marina Barrage
yes we go Marina Barrage (uh)
we set up like a small
glamping something like that
ya but this one we
ya but now we do our own
this is Marina Barrage got anyone do tentage [meh] I never see before
no people just sit down and hang around there
ya
because there were other people [lah] that's the best we could find actually
obviously [lah] everyone will aim for that spot got shade [what]
it's two P_M onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus [ah] this is our plan B
(um)
but I say that will be very suspicious
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya [lah] like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
(uh) on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
[eh] or is it more than two I don't know [lah] but
long enough [lah]
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor [ah] then I said okay then another if if let's say
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot [ah]
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
but
then I'm like he cannot [lah]
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
but but
okay I'm okay no okay [oh] wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late [oh] yes I remember the deciding factor
yeah
weekday cannot [lah] he N_S [what]
then
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
it's not really
I know got #Shah Rukh Khan#
you've been with me at Hong Kong
what I say just now
no then like [oh] yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
say he don't want to go for class [ah] he skip that week's class
yeah
then I but I told her [lah] (uh) whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class [lah] it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
if he
#Tampines# [ah]
I think [ah]
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back #Tampines# he don't like to go back that house
no [lah] but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near #Tampines# hub there
so
no
near #Tampines# hub
yeah
yeah but ya [lah] he he likes
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
attraction in #Sentosa#
yeah
six last [eh] entry [eh] something like that
ya [lah] which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
(err) it's very he
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay [jer]
yeah
I give my opinions but you know (uh) eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend [lah] cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
food [lah] estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock [ah] I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
all N_S guys yes I must add that all N_S guys
so it's like
and it was during the N_S time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them [ah]
I was telling them (uh) I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah
[eh] but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
can~ can~ Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
(uh) they sell their specialty is what [ah]
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing [lah] okay
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay [lah] just go with the flow if cannot then cannot [lah]
we can just like
but like
very light food [lah]
cannot eat cannot eat I okay [jer]
(um)
(hmm)
(uh) [eh] (mm)
that that that that's a
that's a good
then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan [lah]
(um)
then we talk about like other things [lah]
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
yeah
that's what she say [ah]
I do a lot of things so
I'm like (uh) I think FaceTime better [ah] but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
#Arshad#
one big group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah [lah] you know
those people
no those people [lah]
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
[oh] the thing is (uh) out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
yeah yeah
then
ya then ya [lah]
so but then we
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going U_S_S this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
then I'm like no [ah] don't let me be the deciding factor [ah]
(mm) ya true so
now now I'm just like okay go ahead [lah]
it's okay
then I say [lah] anyway
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to U_S_S and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
(uh) I mean !huh! I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy U_S_S [lah] but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with #Humaira# and marissa
yeah I realised that (uh) I enjoy going out with
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends [lah] I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also [what]
ya you see like like #Ria#
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
(mm)
it's okay [lah]
I mean yeah they go see they are going U_S_S they are asking about the price haven't buy the ticket
sunday
yeah
yeah I know [ah]
so sad [leh] is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell [what]
no it's because I went there prominent [lah]
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
(err) towards the end towards the end ya [lah] third year
okay [lah] (uh)
I sorry [ah] but ya [lah] that's the difference between you and me [lah] I enjoy [pe]
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me
yeah
(uh) red one not blue
dangling I want to tho
hhmm
waste money [sia] go in take photo
ya [lah] the vintage car
[oh] yes
[oh] ya I remember eating that with #Humaira#
I remember you were pregnant [lah] last time when you go with me
crazy
I know
no it wasn't
it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part [lah]
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride [lah] so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop [what]
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
(uh)
I got somemore drawing to do
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
what was her email [ah]
need to find her email
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] anyway
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about (uh) how
we were saying [lah] we know we know the process of how he met her right
so found her Instagram
and then
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line [lah] I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya he knows what he wants [ah] that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya (err) also because he knows himself better [lah] learnt from mistakes
he will take action
!huh!
I think a bit [lah] he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it [lah]
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling [lah]
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
(mm)
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what [eh] what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you (uh) it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny

I learned halfway through in my life when I was in school
I learned not to put so much pressure on myself and some things I cannot control
what I mean
school's supposed to be fun don't have to cry over surprise test
I'm talking to you right now
yeah maybe when he's big enough like me next time you can story

(uh) doing the practical right so at the back with the
drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
off the damn switch [lah] why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
the sharp edges
yes
so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly

(hmm)
my class is not but I am so
I've never made any teacher cry okay
it's not me
three
and my primary school I was in a class that made a teacher cry also
I think my class all very
!huh!
yeah
my primary school
my my primary school one time only [ah]
that teacher I think maybe she having a bad day or she's like damn tired already
she's probably just damn tired sick of our attitude
it's not attitude it's just (um)
you know [lah] primary school right like to talk talk talk talk talk talk a lot
yeah
who say
then
you can ask her later personally
you you have to have a strong mental strength you have to have mental strength [lah]
period
I would rather I would rather teach like secondary school
can just off is it
that time we eat the dinner at Chatime
yeah and then you wanted to buy your le~ first then you wait for so long
the brown sugar pearls right because its closing already [ah] I think that's why
two more weeks before intern
then what about you
(hmm)
I don't know [seh] I'm scared that I just hope that it will have that graduation ceremony [lah] if not we will be like the this year batch right they graduate through Zoom or M_S Teams [ah]
yeah I know right will you miss school !duh!
but I'm glad it's all over already [lah] no the holiday where they enjoy
so what have you been doing ever since the holiday
yeah I see
[ah] for this semester
then get I get to poly this aviation course
but now a bit sad [lah] because COVID then aviation sector like
#rabak# [lah]
why
but okay [lah] we see how maybe I can go in maybe not I don't hope so much but I just hope the only hope I want is to be a stewardess [lah] I don't mind actually which airline as long as I get to as long as I get the dream job I'm working
what's your plan to do what's your plan tomorrow
yeah I watched that before I think that was in twenty sixteen or something around that year then I want to watch it again [lah] because its so nice yeah you should watch that
[ha] [ha] yes
yeah then [ah] do you want to watch a movie next week or something
train to #busan#
okay
what about you
[eh] you told me that [ah] she is going to stop working right
okay then how is your intern you got any updates
so you won't be alone [lah]
okay [lah] that's good [lah]
!chey! I thought you say like got maybe at least one more person with you at the same location so at least you won't be bored or you know
some more your house is at #tung lok kiew# right
and you are not familiar with place
its
it's still considered as internship [lah] because I'll be working with #changi# airport it just that I won't be getting salary [lah]
I think there will there's like another four people they'll be doing it with me yeah but then still sad [lah] because I got no salary then I have to find a the part time job to support myself
yeah I have one friend my classmate [lah] she also choose the same internship so I just hope that we'll be working together cause I don't want to work alone work alone
but they still get they still get paid like high salary [ah] like yesterday I asked my friend she said her salary will be eight hundred dollars and I'm like !wah! so lucky
yeah but for me it's too late for me to reject my internship [lah] because all the position close already so I'll have nowhere to go so I'll just have to accept that internship
yeah hopefully I can cope [lah] between the project and the job
no who enjoy [seh]
why
for long [ah]
what !aiyo!
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like the participation level for us very low and then we get you know sometimes get downgraded because of that so its like unfair
physical class
yeah but !wah! this semester my grades okay [lah] decent only [lah] its not the grade that I expected
so how (err) how was
okay [lah] but it's quite hard [lah] to you know ask your friends or your faci then like through online cause no issue in the physical cause you ask your faci then he straight away come to you know like can get instant answer right but this one you need to write message or you call them sometimes so they busy doing things then they will reply like very late
so it's like
yeah correct [lah] better you by say then all your classmates listen right
okay so what's your plan after you graduate from poly
[oh]
same [lah] I also thinking like I want to go in uni but not sure what course should I take cause now COVID so I thinking of like taking something to back up me [lah] you know aviation may not be stable like even after COVID (err) finish
so maybe I'm thinking like taking up (err) finance or H_R course cause like this I want to take a course that is like universal [lah] that accepted everywhere every industry so I feel like it will be safe for me
!wah!
I see like !wah! nowadays a lot of people do auction on Facebook
yeah
not sure I think some of them are brand new
yeah maybe then
now also people sell clothes [oh] now especially COVID they sell the mask you know they make themselves yeah
everywhere you can see that
so
what what do you want to sell like food or you know like retail stuff
[oh] muslim friendly cloths
yeah I also have plans to open up the cafe
yeah we should be partners
meal some
okay I actually have (err) thoughts [lah] like okay maybe this cafe is the small cafe I want to make it
you know of course like (err) nowadays students like to study outside like at Starbucks or you know those small cafe so I'm like inspired by that so I want to make a cafe that is cosy for them to study
but that cafe will have (err) it will start like serving you know just drinks or desserts drinks and desserts very small small [one] [lah] then you have like a space for them to study to relax you know have free wifi
for students to enjoy or even like adults [lah] those working adults they want to do their work there also can and then slowly you can introducing mains you know like appetisers mains and then maybe slowly expand to become a full cafe full a full
how to say that
like
open up like
yeah true [lah]
yeah so maybe by that time you know when it's successful then you can open a new outlets at other places
like (err) it will be inconvenience for them [lah] you know especially those who have who don't have their
who don't have their own transport [lah] like car or motor then they wanted to take public transport you know some places very hard [lah] even if you take a bus or M_R_T you still need to walk like fifteen minutes away you know
yeah yeah yeah
but I feel I feel like (err) cafes in the west is like
quite boring [ah]
like I said
[oh]
yeah we should sell like those viral food and drinks to attract people
[oh] is it
I've never tried #dalgona# coffee before
yes
have you tried do it yourself
how does it feels like
[oh] yeah yeah sure I okay [lah] I mean I always see other people I always see other people drink but then like I feel like I'm the one that haven't drink it yet
(err) I think so should have [ah]
okay okay we shall do it

food or drinks [ah]

my school no cheers [eh] because our school outside the M_R_T connected [mah] so connected already got seven eleven so I think right no point for them to do seven eleven or cheers inside the school

okay [lor] then !aiya! nevermind [lah] we just wait a bit more should be can [one] okay [lah] let's wait for our food now
[oh] it's okay (um) #jurong# and woodlands not very near also [what]
[oh] what bus was it [ah]
(mm)
not bad I don't think I ever took one eight seven before [sia]
like the only bus I will take
to go #jurong# is [eh]
I don't know honestly I don't know
(um) yeah I mean I go to school like I study in #jurong# right okay technically not #jurong# [lah] #clementi#
but usually like I take M_R_T and bus
but then there isn't like a direct bus to my school so that kind of sucks yeah
[ah] yeah correct I take the train from #marsiling#
to #clementi# then I take one eight four
yeah it's pretty tiring honestly everytime I sit I get so annoyed because like there's so many people on the bus and they're all just squeezing to get a seat (ugh)
yeah especially like before COVID right at least now with COVID everyone like social distance and the bus isn't so crowded right but like
honestly like I also now everytime I went to school
I'm kind of glad now that it's not so crowded but I do hate the fact that COVID exists
I feel like [oh] it's just so tiring you take more energy trying to breathe then like
walking around or running around
yeah honestly like our friendship is damn low maintenance [ah] like we took
we haven't been out with each other in like what a year
like honestly the last time we went out that was memorable was us going to LANY
and that was fun I'm quite upset that this year there's no more concerts
(um)
all because of COVID is really damn irritating especially when it comes to like
school [oh] yeah you know I was supposed to go on a holiday in june to New Zealand
like dude that's one of the best countries
ever [eh] like honestly but we couldn't even go and the thing is
!hey! loser
(mm)
[oh] my god I miss malaysia Ramly burger
yeah like the vibes at night is just different like last time [ah] when me and my dad
when we went there when me and my whole family used to go J_B right then my dad will always go to this one particular guy his name was like #azan# or something
we can't even go there and the thing is we don't even know if he still has a business which is so sad
some people like they their only form of income is like all these businesses
but honestly if you think about it right if I stay in malaysia I'll be having so much fun right now
because like malaysia is so big you can already travel from #jurong# #jurong# [eh]
#johor bahru# to K_L and where can we go in singapore #jurong# to #tampines#
like what the heck so boring
I thought like the best part of living in malaysia would be because like you can go from one place to another
but that's not the case
(mm)
what
what so the police like
(hmm)
yeah honestly indonesians have the funniest humour from what I see on Twitter they always say like
when usually people have the worst humour like if somebody go to their house and scare them they would like laugh and stuff right
cause the COVID situation is not so bad but I still miss school
like (ugh) it's so hard to focus in class you know because it's all online
but I have one exam coming this thursday and I'm so scared cause I have barely studied
yeah I was thinking that exams would be online which would suck
you must go to campus but you have like a lot of precautions to follow you must like
key in your temperature like on the school website [lah] then like you must at the entrance you must show like this specific lanyard thing that you must have to enter the campus and all then [ah]
so it's like one class per classroom then the exam is there
exam like seriousness of an exam so it's very hard for me to focus like I had an exam a few
like two weeks ago
I don't know just not used to it you know like wearing a mask and then it's just so uncomfortable
for me [ah] yeah because
I don't know my course don't really have a lot to do with like online stuff or like
so honestly I cannot imagine having the exam on laptop cause I think that would be super stressful but
I don't know I guess you have to experience to know how is your O level preparation going
I I don't know if I read the article correctly I never really read [lah] I just saw the headlines it's like [eh] G_C_S_E extended
[oh] right that's true [oh] I forgot okay anyway
[ah] fun fact I dropped P_O_A in sec three
cause I sucked at P_O_A I was so bad at it
and the thing is it's ironic cause you know how they say malays can't do math right
yeah but then I did well for maths but I can't do well for P_O_A which is damn funny honestly
actually that's true I wonder is like because all my friends right they say they are more motivated at home
and your school life is hard because you are in the same place [what] at least last time like
so hopefully the bell curve isn't higher only everyone is faces situation as you like the [oh] I cannot study I'm stress kind of thing
but I don't know I wouldn't want to go through O levels ever again
I always tell myself like [oh] I'm going to be better I really hope so
and like
yeah
!hais! I just want COVID to be over it has caused so many problems
hopefully
[oh] well yesterday [ah] like I said I always stay at home right so basically yesterday I was staying at home but mostly I was studying
(um)
since I'm so used to H_B_L right I stopped writing physical notes
and like honestly I find that it helps me to be more productive
so in a way I think
it did help me overall like
realise what studying methods help me more
so that's basically what I did yesterday how about you
(mm)
[a'ah]
(um) malayan council [eh] what you eat there
honestly I don't know I haven't gone to like arab street in so long and I just like
I miss the atmosphere that it was before COVID you know
first time we ever went we were like so surprised by the prices like
malayan council legit like damn expensive but I think like
price of the food and the taste of the food and the quality it's all matches up quite well [lah] it's just that
I don't know I just feel like it's a food that you eat every once in a while you know
no I've never tried before what does it (um) what does it [eh] what does it sell
!wow! that one sounds nice [eh] honestly I love Indomie
Indomie is so good must be you can't go wrong with Maggi so basically like indobowl just sells like
let's just say how to say high quality indomie is it
but I think like recently I went there like
well honestly
like I keep using this app called fast jobs and I like tried to find all these different different
(um) positions and the thing is they always say like [oh] urgent hiring
you say that it's urgent you say that you need people but why do you like not get back to people I don't understand
I think I applied for over like what twenty jobs already and like most didn't get back to me
honestly my last few
like jobs that I've applied for was like Starbucks Coffee Bean like to be honest
if I do get the job I get better at it you know that kind of thing how about you what kind of jobs did you apply for
they never properly advertise what will be in need for the job
I myself don't like it also
like job postings and all but it's like okay
look through every single one I apply for like ten
why do you post the job if like you're not going to get back to people you know I know you're busy and all but the least you can do is like
(mm)
it's like I applied for Bath and Body Works recently
then they said like we'll get back to you in a week if you're shortlisted
why if I'm shortlisted what if I don't get the job can you at least tell me also because like
but then it's just like really just waiting and waiting and waiting and obviously you don't want to like
make things harder for yourself by applying for other jobs or waiting for another job to get back to you
so I understand your frustration [lah] like do I apply for this
but like what if the other job accepts me then I cannot take this job
and then it will just make their lives harder
but they don't even think about us they don't even tell us
like honestly I would prefer getting a you're rejected letter rather than just like nothing at all you know
I rather like also know why I didn't get the job that kind of thing it would be nice to know
so that like you can improve yourself and stuff like that but
I don't know how the working world works cause I'm only eighteen but I guess we'll see in the future
hopefully honestly like during this like you know like circuit breaker period
I honestly ordered a lot of things online because like honestly I thought about it I thought like
okay once COVID ends I can je~ get a job and my holidays start it will be so easy for me to like
pay back all the money that I wasted during the holidays
but no I got it all wrong I thought COVID
COVID is still here and it's like
so it's like all these new clothes that I wear for what honestly
(mm) (mm)
yeah honestly like when the virus started in china I was like damn that is disgusting
I was thinking that [oh] they already contained it [what] like it was from #wuhan# and like they already closed up #wuhan# and everything and I thought that it wouldn't like suddenly
like everything happened so fast like we were just living our life as per normal
like of course it won't hit singapore
how to say ungrateful for their position they are the biggest coun~ they are like
one of the biggest country in the world but like
their management is so bad like look at their president it's a stupid idiot named donald trump
(mm)
(hmm)
you will look up your president [what] right
because technically like so many people voted him in to the office and all and like
and it's like
the mayors even have to step in just to (uh) make up for his mistakes like he should know that as a president
he has a lot of power and like everything he says will be taken seriously right everybody no matter how dumb or stupid like they are
it's just like normal to listen to your president [what] because they are like the head like in power and all so yeah
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
there are still people who are saying that they will vote him for the next election when he has already
proven so many times that he is inadequate for the country
like why you so dumb (ugh) anyway let's stop talking about this stupid idiot
[eh] guess who texted me
this guy from like okay okay so
so like you know I'm super bored during school and all
so then like I started using OkCupid
then like I talked to a bunch of guys [lah] because I think I'm quite pretty
then like this guy
he's not very honestly he's like (err) tall
then like okay [lah] like good looking not bad not bad you know
then he damn funny [sia] then he ask me like stupid stupid malay jokes okay okay wait let me tell you one malay joke
yeah it's stupid right but like he was one of the first few matches that like make me laugh you know
he's like eighteen years old which is my age honestly actually I don't really date guys my age [ah]
so like yeah honestly we clicked
not bad [sia] so far like I don't know I'm quite
interested
(err) [oh] his name is #bukhari#
and like honestly that's a super like old school name like honestly I feel like my
but like I don't know he's not bad and he's tall okay [ah] not like
(uh) yeah I'm thinking about #hudy# who is one six three C_M that stupid idiot of a boy
honestly like I'm so upset that he kind of ghosted me
okay I wouldn't say that we were vibing but at least like I was talking to him and he was talking to me and it's just
actually
one day and a few hours honestly if I
think I swipe a lot already [sia] and I think like my taste
not so picky so like I got like
then like honestly most of them are quite interesting but like most of them just say
hi
yo
like boring [seh] like can you be more interesting please
drummer name his daughters
I don't know
[eh] that's quite funny [eh] I like how he made a joke with your name inside
you know that kind of thing yeah
facts honestly but (um)
so they like put in more effort to like talk to everybody and stuff
[eh] wait wait wait wait how is Bumble
[oh]
swipe then if it works out on each other then match
why got like twenty four hour expiry date all so funny [eh]
yeah honestly and I'm so sad about malaysia extending their M_C_O thing
I know we talked about it just now but you just reminded me cause I don't know how many foreigners there are
and I really just want to go to malaysia I want to eat my korean barbeque
three to one conversion rate
[ah] [seh] I just miss going there [lah] I remember like everytime we go K_L we will try this place called dolly #dim sum# have you tried before
but they have the salted egg yolk #dim sum# and it's like
it's perfect I swear
(mm)
[oh] my god I love pepper lunch so much and I miss pepper lunch
yeah it was damn funny right it was like I think I texted you like we were texting right saying that we were also at the same place or something [oh] no
like I was on the fourth floor you were like on the third floor at Starbucks [kan]
why I yeah you talking about wedding reminds me
like honestly I just miss the wedding food and the atmosphere it's so fun like cause you know I'm in a mixed family right
so usually our wedding is like for the
[ah] like my mum
[ah] side she loves taking like she loves the indian culture
so it's like yeah we're not mixed per say
but like because like our ancestors like got some
some blood and all so like we also like proclaim [lah] but actually we're not mixed
full malay like you
I was so lucky that like my aunt she managed to get married this year
in february like right before like COVID became a worser disaster
(mmhmm)
yeah honestly you know like I saw this one guy you know a son of a peach on Instagram
(mm)
right honestly I didn't know it was a thing but apparently it is [eh]
(mm) (mm)
I think
you know how like malay families always say like [oh] it's for your image for our reputation as a family that's not how you should see it [pe] in the end
like you're marrying someone is like your happiness so everything should go the way that you want it to go you know
I also like in the future like when I get married my mom and dad will be like cool to like break the traditional stereotype and let me do what like I am happy with [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(hmm)
actually that's true actually that would be goals [ah] like
then like in the future they ended up having the wedding at the same place at the same day and that thing cause they plan together [kan]
I
think no got anne hathaway I remember got anne hathaway (mm) but it was a good movie [ah] then I always think about it like
wedding book but I find it like a bit tacky [lah] like imagine if like somebody find then they will judge me you know like she's like eighteen and she has a wedding book
yeah honestly like
to me when I think about the future I always want like to be special you know like
okay you compare like (uh) prices of cars in singapore to prices of cars in U_S
you can get a car in U_S for like what
like forty thousand and then in singapore the same car will cost like hundred thousand something with C
C_O_E
so it's like I don't know [ah] like you think about it you can have all these dreams and aspirations but like
so much to think about in the future and I'm honestly very stressed
like I remember I went to Australia and I was in sec one then after that we went to where is it gold coast
then we got to pass by like this
(err) university university of queensland
then like from then I told myself like [oh] I'm going to work really hard to like get into a local like an overseas uni
so lonely because now we're so used to like the big family gathering
so it's like really a lot of to think about I just hope that like
in the future you now is now is with like global warming and all
like I'm just scared that like
is there even any world to live for
yeah that's true that's why like I'm always grateful that I live in
singapore but I don't know it's really just a lot to think about in the future and like what is important to you
I don't how I'm going to teach that child malay
you know I'll still want my children to learn and all cause I feel like it's important
later become like you know the swastika language is it
like is it swastika
I forgot what not swasti~ [ah] swahili
or something yeah honestly right that language has become obsolete
[oh] sanskrit sanskrit
al like it's really gone
like nobody even speaks it anymore nobody knows how to write it and that kind of thing so like
so it's like yeah thinking about that kind of scary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya okay
so
(um) not mine hers
it's about a situation
so basically she she is confused if the guy that she's talking to right now is just a friend or someone that she is she is willing to pursue
until they die
okay you talk talk talk to me okay talk to me
so okay so what happened is this fella send him a photo okay so let me just talk to you okay cause I scared they will like not accept us if we talk to them so okay so number one
please accept me
portrait malay portrait of you
!oi! if he send you a portrait
it's sus it's very suspicious
any human being that were to do something that is out of the norm
that is going way
bro has he ever met you before
at that point of time no so we we shall stick to no okay so
ultimate red flags a normal person will say hi
not send you a bloody picture
you've never met him before how why is he investing so much time sus sus that is sus
have you ever ask him have you done this to another girl before
a lame ass will do that I'm sorry straight up
(um) cancel the recording
exactly let's be real if
okay we had we had a very bad history where we were at (uh) one of our lowest point of our lives where we we we don't really (um)
check and (um) keep ourself in check in in terms of morals but that is in the past you've used guys before okay so don't act as if you don't even
feel like it's very weird for you to do something without even knowing them fully
you see a damn guy you like their attention but you don't want them what the hell do you do go above and beyond because you don't give a shit about the feelings correct
why is this fella going above and beyond when he doesn't even know you that is red flag because that means you don't even you go with
head first
without thinking about the qualities and stuff like that
has he ever dated before
the fact that you're not mature enough to understand that relationships can go downhill quickly and you still
desperately want to go into a a a a a
not you the fella the fella the fact that you've already
the fact that he was already in a relationship before yet he still not cautious
to be in a relationship in his future relationship that explains a lot where is the maturity
I take my time also but I I
you have to put that shit aside bro
why you talking about him okay K K K K
then make friends
have fun
!wah! ya I can vouch for that
ya actually you're not interested
(mm)
am I right to even assume if this is how he's behaving right now
if
and if if this is like a (uh) continuous pattern
where if you all fight M_I_A you want to settle with that kind of guy
correct so do you want to make the same mistake
babe
correct so
baby girl
but
listen first stop first he's the first guy that you've ever asked out to ask to go out and then secondly
bullshit
I ask you simple
pressure
but that's the thing I feel like if you've used people before you should already have that confidence
understand what I'm saying to be smart about it I'm your friend but I'm hitting on you
no you know that that's that's how life is what okay so life is don't judge me I I'm right so if you think I'm wrong keep your opinions to yourself I'm kidding no as in
this doesn't match he takes his time knowing someone he sends a portrait to someone doesn't make sense
if you take your bloody ass time you already invest so much and and he
you know the games [lah] bro
can okay no no no no no
this is one of the major mistakes that most of my friends make
you date someone you know nothing about them once you start dating them when you already
you but you're you correct is good that you're not dating them but you never you're not even getting to know them
no getting to know them in terms of how do you deal with relationship not about the family and stuff like that
because that don't mean shit some people out from like fucked up families but they still know how to handle relationships and how to prioritise that and also
ya that's why I tell you be a friend once you be a friend the person is vulnerable enough you are not
you are the piece of shit in the no you
denial
stop the recording
understand or not
ya understand you just that
do you hear the crickets
taking it slow
that's why you just all out flirt
a lot of flirt
please [lah] muslim or not as in if you are or not the the
no correct no I'm not saying in terms of flirt when you're with him touch here all these that's the fucking boundary but if if you are texting show that you like
understand show that you like
say just say listen if that that's what I'm saying people
tend to think that if you are my friend I treat you differently
how the fuck do even become your friend then no listen listen no you listen
when you talk to him like a friend that is when you get to be your most vulnerable self
that is a playful thing correct
but at the same time it will bond you guys together because he has affirmation that [eh] she loves my company
that means I'm I'm I'm secured enough to just bring it one step forward so you're not even doing that you dumb-ass you're not even texting him
that you send a portrait ya it's weird
[ah] see [lah] all the bullshit all come out
cannot cannot cannot they say cannot be distracted [mah] so you pull out your memory cannot cannot nevermind it's okay
exactly why are you talking as if you are his girlfriend
what that is how you talk when you're want to see how is that
what
what you talking about
correct because I don't want to fuck you that's why you no no don't don't later they will disqualify us listen this what I'm telling you
you just like what I say use your flirting skills when he say that kind of stuff
when he say that kind of stuff that is when you should tell him
it's a joke right if you say I'm just his friend but you know deep down you've ulterior motive correct so
you say that shit when you are in a freaking relationship you sound like a married woman
who the hell says that
to what to your thoughts [ah] denial
even if you're in a relationship you wouldn't fucking say that you will say that I think we should plan a day that is special for us and just go out cause I know you've been very busy
you don't just say I know you're busy [lah] so it's fine K stop [oh] shit that means she doesn't want to talk to me
you know what I'm saying that that is the flaw in you and you want say like I have I have I got you want I pull out the receipt or not don't need to pull out keep it in your damn pocket
laugh laugh some more
(um)
and then sorry it's just me farting
then then do some other shit [lah] bro like
ya ya you have to
question him why did you send me the portrait when you don't know me then after that question him do you do this to other girls before that how did you meet your first girlfriend
who else have you send this shit to we might not know for
for a fact he just play these games and those those previous girls reject him
we might not know sorry any guy who does that immediate rejection for me
no you have no self-worth if you do that you have no self-worth
shut the hell up men who are too nice manipulative
are you kidding me bro I have been manipulated that's why
!huh! okay K K I agree I was shaking my head just now
what you mean
in what sense is this a joke like he's he's like playful to you that that is what you mean by that's bullshit shut the fuck up go and stop stop being so fucking blinded really really
twenty twenty
expensive [what]
still can get blind
being a blind ass bitch
ya [lah] if never take care [lor]
ya ridi~ ridiculous unless you like sixty and then want to die soon [lah]
I want to see the world clearly before I die so I take my last breath make sure my eye open
stupid joy I kidding joy if you are listening to this I don't mean what I say
okay going back
so don't be an idiot
[ah] sorry [lah] it's fucking sus [lah] it's sus very sus very very sus
ya no because to me is like you want to live in denial
if you don't like him I don't mind but you already ask him out
and not even ya like I said if ten years down the road you ask your boyfriend can I meet him your boyfriend ask how did you met meet him he sent me a bloody portrait he knows for sure this fella was head over heels for you he's not going to get you near him
no [lah] for what drink tea
don't be a fucking idiot you're a fucking idiot
maybe maybe that's why that's why he keep saying that like [oh] that's why we [ah] got gap got gap if you are fucking twenty three you're twenty three right if you're twenty three you have that kind of mindset who raised you
you are just
correct so why why must you say that that means you are not working hard enough for you to fulfil yourself in terms of confidence
what is it is it that you are a if he get you then what the he climb up the tier is it which is disgusting [what] right
like a a tro~ are you a trophy which okay I'm not saying that
then why does he speak like that
how is the previous girl let's be what is the previous girlfriend like how is she
the previous girlfriend
so how many years and when was it
eighteen nineteen is
no it's not young it's not young what are you talking about it's like
a relationship okay a question okay so how did he got with the girl how did he get with the girl
some app what app
muslim
sus
what the fuck [oh] my god
I've I've use it before ya so I have a strong judgement
Muzmatch is muslim
he use he use muslim one [ah]
okay a lot of vulnerable people
so
the fact that he
we're going to go out on dates and if I were to speak to you it's official
like there's no such grey fucking area of
(hmm) I'm the friend but I ask him out he's the first ever guy that asked me out so no but it's real so
that that's why to me you've went out with a girl
you've been cheated on you went on the app [lah] correct right
and then after that now you behave in this very desperate manner maybe because to me so many other guys don't fucking do that but obviously
him he's weird
okay so the girl is what religious also
how why and why
how can you be friends with a friend that dated you and send you a bloody portrait
who's #amin# which guy
okay ya what's up with him
which is still sus to me
right now it's fine listen it's fine because you're single
it's not fine once you have a boyfriend
you are giving yourself a lot of bullshit
but you're single so it's fine
can
can but
is there drama now with you and #amin#
okay so he got say that he's over you and he's not dating another person or did he give like some vague answer
why
so you friendzone him
so what do you like him
no back then
babe you fucking weird
you fucking weird because once you have a guy these are not your friends anymore you are just making yourself lose friendship serious
serious
then you won't lose him but you will lose other guys that you've dated before I would never let my guy
get close to any motherfuckers any girls that ever fucking went out with him
okay I'm not possessive [ah] listen [ah] okay I have my boundaries but it's just weird
let me ask you now
which is weirder bro
if you have a boyfriend
now I ask you he say okay I go out with a girl I've dated before with another girl that is there
how would you feel exactly my point you cannot be very oblivious about this thing you're going to lose friendship you are already losing it bro
you have to pick your battle choose one what the fuck
because this is my criteria to my my boyfriend
correct obviously you can say but think about the long run you're going to lose them either ways
so no that's why no that's why to me is
to me right if my I I just I give this
I'm very liberal it doesn't sound like throughout this recording but okay
when my partner were to tell me [oh] I'm talking to this fella (um)
and then after I say okay (um)
how did you meet her
and then after that [oh] through Instagram
this girl is trying to get to know me immediate no because to me
you can what is friends is if got fate make it
(uh) fate [eh] that you and this girl fucking one out of how many billion people in the entire world but you
physically met that that fella you all had conversations you all click she was there at your lowest when she was there at your lowest she gave you time
give you motivation to bring you up when you were a piece of motherfucking shit
#platonically# as friends
I cannot touch because that person was there for you I'm eternally grateful
you can hang but I must also be introduced and that that fella also then that's the part where where once I'm in I give the green light I meet the girl and I need to see for myself
if she has any ulterior motive because let's be real anybody that we date were
people who are possible candidates right why didn't I I date you
you are playing with fire you let your partner date hang with a girl that they dated before
you are just going to lose lose what if one day you argue with your partner then after that he go and text the girl
and then after that the girl say ya for what also you want to talk to her it's just going to add it's fucking toxic unless you become friends with the the
no no such thing as date sorry for me is bullshit because you all she didn't give you any benefit let's be real people are selfish and you know your own motives if you don't like that girl that girl probably likes you why must she even give hope to that fella
to that girl even if she date already [what] then her boyfriend don't give her the self-respect [meh] to like just cut off guys that she date before right
so the thing is you need to be and [ah] if you want to talk about F (uh) [ah] friends friends I got a lot of friends #lan jiao# [lah] must be one of them must be your date [meh]
like you don't have any workmates [meh] you don't you're not motivated in life
no you are single so it's fine but you already setting yourself
for hell basically because no [lah] it's bullshit [lah] if your partner do that to you I I mean you can take it [meh]
no because you don't give a shit
which is even more weird because but is weird because then what if you're giving him hope and
if okay a guy that I
correct and the fact that he still wants to stay when you give nos no purpose at all
so doesn't fucking prove anything like you don't give him money you don't give him time you don't give him knowledge
you make him laugh for fuck
correct correct you make him laugh you make him laugh and for fuck that just makes him even more attracted and loves your company which makes your boyfriend feel a bit what the fuck
why are you making other guys laugh especially the guy that pursued you before
so same thing if if if my guy
I'm not gonna lie I I'm I was insecure but now I don't give a fucking shit because a lot of girls
texted him like I really had to go through that shit especially when my my relationship back then was was private
I had to go through that shit and I learnt that actually
if my the
you shouldn't get angry at people who date your boyfriend you should get angry at your boyfriend for not knowing how to act if you act this way you think your boyfriend will be
the way that he get to know you is probably the same way that these motherfuckers did
he's not gonna be and this is bullshit [eh] if let's say you went out with this fella and with
sya~ a~ #syafiq# the one that you never date what #amin# #syafiq# okay so #amin# is the one you date before
so if you went out with #amin# and #syafiq# okay if your boyfriend were to say nevermind at the end of the day she comes back home to me
let's not be fucking stupid humans will interfere with your relationship humans can just say any fucking shit I've met so many guys that desperately wants my hot girlfriend relationship to fucking break
so they pretend to be that guy friend that is close to that girl and then he's not not for you [ah] [eh] just break up [ah]
then after they get close date which is I know motive girls guys I don't
hate on anyone but if you are stupid on your actions that's the part where I have to call that bullshit [eh] like bro what the fuck you doing you know and I'm not saying that you are stupid obviously you're not is the guy the guy is stupid because
[eh] I got talk to her before I got date her before [oh] now she talking to that guy [ah]
sad or it's weird sorry it's weird
to him for him
(mm) [ah] you (mm) [ah] (mm) (mm)
because you are you trying to say that [oh] he's just a friend which is not like if if your partner ya you say that your partner do the same thing you're not gonna accept it
and then you want to ya [lah] me
that's why I'm telling you this this this fella is not a friend so you have to this #syafiq# [eh] no #akim# guy #akim# #akim# you need to just
play your game well just say [lor] like
flirt to text not to sext
to make it quick to because you don't have any balls to be like can we just date cause I know you like me no desperate motherfucker would send me a portrait so [ah] shit I still cannot get it out of my system
that's weird as fuck so like he
you straight up ask him you got send any other girl portraits or not
if you're not if he say like you sound like you're jealous shut the fuck up weird fuck you are the one who's fucking weird so you tell me now do you send any girl's portrait
and is not sense of controlling it's because you know
how humans manipulate and the things that they do sometimes if a guy were to slap your face they come back they apologise give you ten thousand ring you will say okay the effort is there
people go through that shit so I don't want you to be [eh] he send me that gift is a good gesture I can also say I send you fucking ten apples good gesture you eat that shit is rotten [what] right
so you need to understand I know I have three bo~ I have three boys in my house
all of them are motherfuckers back then I know all the fucking tricks that are up their sleeve it's so easy to
here's the thing
when you get close to a guy they start to become vulnerable the real side of them come out so when the real side of them come out that's easy for them to be like K #chao#
you know what I'm saying so if you like if you start to feel like you're agitated and you like him and you start to miss him
make it happen when you guys are dating so that when the red flag comes you are not in a relationship for you to just like if you are in a relationship you cannot let go [what]
but if you're dating you can let go right so
so many of my friends are ya officially dating this guy
and that is fine because we are dating [mah] officially you're officially dating so
ya some people date two to three people ya that is using [ah] but
some people that date their their their partner officially it it it gives
how to say [ah] people will lie to impress you so you need to be smart [lah] for me for me is like
at least have the sense of (um) intelligence when you talk to me because if you if you're trying to say that (uh) you are insecure or whatnot sorry go to a fucking therapist I cannot fix that
[eh] [eh] (uh) no if I were you
for me to find out more red flags
so
!wah!
still not exact
ya just ask all the fucking shit as if you are you are interested in him
if there's this intense heat where he feels like okay maybe she's the one [ah] like I like her morals and stuff like that and she shows some some interest to me I think I should date her
so then when once he say that and you say okay
pattern all come out
weird bro portrait the fuck
it's weird
it's weird bro
imagine [eh] if you didn't you don't get with him
you get with your boyfriend that is way more fucking secure
he will shit on this motherfucker bro
obviously you want a guy that chase after you but not a guy who doesn't fucking know you
what what if he does this behind your back don't know that girl fucking pretty send her portrait while he's with you
it's weird [what] it's fucking weird bro
I'm not trying to (uh) anyhow to do [ah] but
through the Muzmatch also
just catch up is it
this was how old
[oh] so his relationship was like three years [ah]
with the first girl
#kiwek# okay [lah]
then he got single then he dated that girl
(uh huh)
I need to know the timeline so initially she said that she wants this this this this they went out how many times
correct have to ask all that babe because
this will all boils down to who he is as a person so ya okay continue
no [lah] with the insecurities bullshit
to marry is it
but that's not the important thing
correct so number one if she were to ask you need to ask how many times did you guys did you guys went out so she already so if she state it before she went out that I want this type of guy
[oh] so she state it when
okay okay then
correct (um) so she went out with that guy not telling him the expectations
(um)
but whenever they go out she got say she what she like what she don't like
which is to me that is the right way to be in a relationship so if he's complaining
fucking buck up [ah] bro like if if that girl don't if she wants to be treated as a proper muslim I don't want to be in a in a dark setting cause anything can happen I cannot see shit I don't want to be in this (uh) this setting we're just together
then if you like her do whatever it takes it shows you as a person
that basic that's basic I should not applaud him for that
ya basic babe no you know why
no because you not from Muzmatch [mah]
right so Muzmatch I have a friend
then (um)
I know her standards like you need to ask ya like I like that she go go out on a date also
but fucking wary of
(um) (uh) asking parents for for take that is the norm of how a muslim
especially a daughter
so I shouldn't applaud you for that because
you put yourself in Muzmatch [what] you should know the criteria [what] as a man also you should lead your family one day then you have this kind of thing then after that want to complain you cannot complain [what] because if you don't get the girl then shut up [lah] so
deep bro because then you're just wasting your damn time
get to know him give him the benefit of the doubt
modern kind of girl where they are open-minded [tau] you have so many religious girls that are like you know very strict about shit
so the primary school girl still has the criteria right
so how is it different than (uh) if you know that she's religious how is it different
right so so ya exactly so this is the dumbest shit that people do they date first then they become friends no
for me is I'm going to use my skills to flirt and be your friend
for you to spit out every fucking shit even you're vulnerable side because when you tell me about your vulnerability then I start to understand that
(um) (uh) how do you cope with that vulnerability so if you say like I'm actually
find the red flags I I I think I'm I'm saying this because a lot of negative shit happened in my life that I just know
what are red flags and what is not
cause of the hierarchy and the how the family view me
you don't hear me saying like [oh] fuck I'm a malay I cannot [eh] shut the fuck up I can date ten fucking arabs guy arab guy once I'm up there when I'm the same level as them because that is what I want to pursue you want to get
this kind of fella you fucking fight for it you don't
at and and and even if you are fucking ugly but the the determination is fucking attractive
so like like I said all these acts of
is very scary to me scary
sending sending portrait then M_I_A like you big fuck
it's weird too it's weird to me it's weird [lah] unless you good boy but you good boy also it's fucking lame [what] like
if if you put yourself out in the media
then I understand
like ya so if let's say you are youtuber or whatnot then people send stuff
I mean obviously you are gorgeous but you have to understand that
lame dudes I don't want to call him lame but I'm always right so let me just say that
did you know what I'm saying
[ah] so before he send you the portrait you all talk before
in real life or
message shut the fuck up then shut the fuck up then there's so many people I talk through message also and I don't give a shit that was the those are the least kind of people that I give a fuck about because I
I never go out with them you have to understand if you text a serial killer
don't know what they are serial killer until you go out with them correct
why are you putting yourself in a fucking position
shut the fuck up you already like him
this is what I want my friend to do to me also if I'm fucking blinded as fuck
legit legit portrait is already how many times I have to say I think ten thousand times in this recording [ah]
they need to type [ah] their to
[ah] transcript !huh! portrait copy paste copy paste
you like the company
but you won't love you won't correct because let's be real
for me before this also I impress all of the guys that I want to go out with
you cannot leave the mentality is that I'm a guy so I cannot whack back
#chao# if you're not leaving me also you don't have any self-worth the fact that I'm so into personal growth
is because that is the truth in life
in jail [eh] say once I get past my O levels I will marry (uh) and I'll once I become a millionaire I will pursue you and I will chase after you and I'll marry you men will go to that extend even me
let's be real if the person is worth it so he give you a portrait when he doesn't even fucking know you that's weird
that is what I used to [what] that's a fucking pattern [what] you know nobody changes overnight
you send a portrait you got the girl so easy that's why I tell you to play the game
like him you can like him look at his red flags once he blow you off then you know how to cut
don't waste your time you are a I mean I don't want to say you lower your standards [ah] but you deserve so much more
to be in this posi~ position with a guy that send you a portrait
[oh] whatever I'm hearing I'm sorry I'm I'm okay one thing is I'm very protective of my friends number two
I can just see shit
clearly
just now cannot [lah] because not twenty twenty vision [mah] put braces [mah] my eyes
they lie people lie
then you will know if you're fucking mature or not
[oh] maybe that's why you have a job that won't allow you to fucking (um) pursue a better goal
if my brother that's a dropout can fucking earn (uh) like maybe because
how to say [ah] when you've already tasted a higher standard of living you just want to work for it
one day I can assume about him benefit of the doubt is maybe he he has never tasted a better life of living maybe he don't have that knowledge he's not blessed with that knowledge so
that's why you as a you you you say you are a friend right bless him with that knowledge see what he will do with it
but at the same time like
don't settle down for what you're not satisfied with serious for me a guy I need to be like fucking like a monkey
for me to legit be like pursuing you if you make me no sorry
if if it's more of like I want to get to I really want to get to know this guy he has everything like
how to say [ah] for me
I'm not there yet so I don't even
I didn't even want to date because I don't want to settle for less so for me it's like looks
(uh) dressing and morals
then after that once I really really really really like you because everything is fine then I will just pursue chemistry
chemistry is there
if if he really likes me then
okay I think I should give him a bit more attention I really really like him but at the same time
I don't pursue guys who are fifty fifty about me because
you can like people keep saying like [oh] you like
I think people like to see me as like confident like she can get that guy nope is I just don't waste time with people that I know I cannot get
like must have to realistic like not like there's so many people much more good looking than me and there's so much
(um) like I have a lot to work on but
then if it's not enough then I make myself enough
you know that kind of thing so people that that rush into relationship are sus
sus send portrait sus
cause he's fucking fat !wah! fuck you #chibai# want to fucking look look look shut the fuck up [ah] want to look at my boyfriend for what
#buto# I cannot because but then that was when I was insecure but now when I realise that
my boyfriend has to reassure me I feel lame
because to me is I fucking sound psychotic but but that is what
people do
so if you as a man behave like a desperate fucker I cannot I cannot
if you chase after a girl as if you have no self send portrait if my boyfriend fucking do that I'll smack the shit out of him obviously you can send portraits to me if
this is weird babe nobody fucking do that nobody fucking do that I'm scared if
insecurities will come up
not you you obviously don't but if if
no what if your insecurities come out he play with it
you you can be vulnerable but at the same time just say like
[oh] anytime if I want to cut you off which is good [lah] I think you have l~ low low tolerance also for bullshit I'm hoping [ah]
(mm) (mm)
correct so
in a man
and then
fuck it fuck [ah]
which is
correct correct
he did all the work what work need to work [meh]
ya isn't that good
!huh!
but then
[ah] that's fine
correct
correct you have to understand there's
I have so many hot ass
fucking girlfriends
that get with a fucking ugly guy because he's charismatic
insecure
correct insecure
I'm also charismatic how many people that I use
so many worse is you date a guy that is ugly and cheated on you might as well date a good looking guy
right so that's why to me is like
but I'm not okay I'm just throwing the worst of the worst so that you know how to react quick with fear
obviously that that that I think that's how life should be that you date someone that is
the looks
people say that looks don't matter suck my dick [lah] !huh! looks and also (um)
not status looks and (um) body language
when that is okay then after that your your
(uh) no no looks and confidence so
confidence might also play with the look so if you're actually fucking ugly but you have a lot of confidence because you have a lot of skills that people look up to
you're already fucking good looking already that is looks to me not just physical then after that is the the charismatic so
(mm) test
you gonna die
ya it's pandemic all over again
if this you choose this fella is the one that you're gonna marry and this fe~ (uh) and if you have to you have to teach a man how to work on his own
fuck that shit
and a man who's very very independent on on the on the on the partner (uh) (uh) toxic
you depend on the partner to change toxic
you can obviously
advise but it's what he do
so many people can rise up but it's how much they want it
don't don't need to date men
when you're in the grey area don't need to
motherfucker you just fucking told me you ask him out that's a fucking date for fucking sure bro he's not your friend
but you reciprocate
(uh)
this guy has other hot girlfriends at that point of time he was single okay so he was single until I was the first girl that he dated so he's good looking so a
he was dating a lot of girls
but he don't like anyone of them so if you're single you're free to be a fucking cunt [what] right so when
he see that girl as an opportunity to get to know other hot chicks so
when she D_M him and saying that [oh] you're so cute
he's like a before me he was a fucking flirt cause he's single but he try to play off like I'm just a friend [what] but I know you're fucking flirt you know
before that I was I never use people before because of him I used people because of what happened then after that (um)
when you get close to the girl the girl obviously like like him but then he with
and he was friendzoning her because she got other hot chicks hot friends
and then that is to me is like then okay [lor] then I'm not that mad at the fact that you still keep in contact but at the end of the day
once he was a bit more serious with me he cut contact with that girl because he knows that I'm not happy but I told him I'm fucking liberal
going to allow you to meet her face to face and and it just gives
what like you reciprocate like it's more nicer to hear that [oh]
my boyfriend is the first guy that I asked out but then you should not
put so much weight into your your decisions people make mistakes if he's not the one you shouldn't be like [eh] he's the first guy I asked
okay
okay okay okay okay contradicting [ah] okay
good [lah] then then
you sure okay if you feel like you in denial right really make believe

[orh]
but you think he okay or not
serious [ah]
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza [lah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever [lah]
[oh]
okay
[oh] forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
[oh] that's good deal man
[eh] can you share the link with me
(mm)
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
!alah!
[oh] okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
[oh] and fly kite
[oh]
can you please buy a good kite
I don't know
[oh] but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had shel~ not shelter [lah] that had shade
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
what time you intend to go [ah] that's the point
(mm)
actually that day
(mm)
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know !fuh!
okay actually to me [lah] is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like #Razi# did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places [ah] then what happen [ah]
[oh] he will [ah] okay okay (um) because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
[oh] okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
gone
but ya that's very nice [lah] of the girlfriend
(mm)
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
Marina Bay (uh) Marina Marina Bay [lah] [kan]
Barrage if you got no car you go #Sentosa#
[oh] because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay [lah]
[oh] okay then Marina Barrage makes sense [lah]
yes yes yes
(mm)
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have #meriahness# if there is
I mean !aiya! for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
ya ya actually it's true [lah] I I mean no I personally don't like #Sentosa#
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for #Sentosa#
earlier [lah]
[oh] it's a weekend [ah]
[ah]
okay
[oh] ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
[orh]
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before [lah] in Singapore
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
[ah] okay
[ah]
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
the birthday boy is gonna be from
#Tampines#
not the other side of the Singapore right
[ah]
[ah] okay
wait where she stay again
near my house
[ah] near my friend's place okay okay okay
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
[oh] my god
anyway motor is convenient [ah]
but I think
[oh] really
so early [ah] it's indoor [what]
[oh] you (mm) okay [lah] I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay [lah]
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
(uh) I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow [lah] !huh!
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people [lah] so I always leave it to other people
[oh] ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like [ah]
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better [ah]
food
okay all growing N_S boys
ya but to me (mm) okay [lah] for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
[oh] okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
(mm) then what she say
[oh] my god
(uh) then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
(uh) #mee# tom yum (mm) one of them
no because now
[ah]
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
the s~ you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
okay you have to go with the flow if mar~ if for whatever reason [lah] [eh] let's say
(um)
yes
ya you can't be bothered not like you're gonna eat much anyway
but
which you will probably be bringing because if you are after our lesson of going to Marina Barrage that day I
regret not bring water bottle
yeah I didn't bring water bottle that time [what]
and still not enough
I think once we
yeah and you need to have wet weather programme [ah]
[oh] it's very sudden
like what
you guys are his world too
yeah
yeah so it's nice that as a girlfriend she put in effort to do that
for what
are you serious
ya [lah]
so that you can focus on your work [ah]
you don't have any other friends [meh]
you have right
yeah
[oh] you got further subset of your
(mm)
I know I know you know I know I know already [lah]
[a'ah]
but they don't
okay the subsets don't overlap [ah]
ya [lah]
[orh]
okay okay I know I know
and the same person I don't like too okay
!wah! I should make friends with this friend of yours [lah]
[ah] ya [lah]
no but I think he's like that because he sees what she do also [lah]
hypocrite he feels I think this is the long hair guy right that you don't like right ya ya ya
if I don't like you [ah] it will show on my face so you better don't see my face
yeah
it's okay [lah] no loss to him
yeah
yeah
so is no to him is no loss [lah] so that's why he's like that
do you do they know that you meet each other
[oh] they know [ah] so
[ah] okay
yeah and I know why you don't wanna go
yeah
[oh] confirm [ah]
it's confirmed
(mm)
did they did somebody P_M you directly
!alamak!
(uh huh)
yeah you told me that
(mm)
now
it's okay
it's okay
[orh]
[orh]
you told me right is that the one
right the indian muslim one and the that one right ya
okay [lah]
(hmm) (hmm)
I don't know I don't I don't miss U_S_S in any way
ya I definitely won't be one of them
[oh] Marissa #Shu# you never go before [ah]
I think if you go with #Shu# also it'll be fun
you enjoy or you don't enjoy
[oh]
ya [lah]
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say [ah]
[oh] but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant [lah] but okay [lah] I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
(mm)
but they make you feel included [lah]
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that #Shiqah# #Ad# #Razi# group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean #Aidil# they all but I rarely get to meet him [lah] but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends [sia] [oh] and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
[ah]
but I think two person is much more better [leh] I feel [lah]
don't know [lah] I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
!aiya! but they going week weekend [ah]
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
I don't know how you can recognise such faces [seh]
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
[ah] no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for U_S_S
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary [ah]
try [ah]
cannot [ah]
because at the end of the day I go to U_S_S to take photo
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
I went there share I went with who [ah] I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
early part [eh]
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
[oh] crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay [what]
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared [sia]
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
yes
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
how
what
[oh] my god okay
[oh]
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
[oh] so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
opinion
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
because if he doesn't hide
[ah] he will say
a bit [meh]
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be #Aidil# [lah] up till now
actually actually is true [eh]
and then his mum will be left
!aww!
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
[oh] I don't tell her so that (uh) she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who [ah]
[ah] I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
path you wanna take [ah] I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
I remember
#Kartini# will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then [ah] whether is it T_P_J_C or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already [lah] this one
then (uh) I remember [lah] the one in my pri~ secondary school is this
(um) very strict indian discipline guy you know
we were like
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
[oh] ya we we I tell you we are nerds [what] we can spend in library from nine [eh] nine A_M in the morning until nine P_M at night
no ten A_M in the morning until nine P_M at night
(um) was I like that for secondary school
I don't think so [eh]
no I'm busy for C_C_A but I think on weekends when I have no C_C_A
weekends when I have
yeah that's why nobody see me
yeah
no every week I study okay wait this the thing about me okay
people people try to what they call it [ah]
crash study crash
crash [lah] they try to crash everything into their mind after that ya that's I was thinking
yeah
(uh) so so for me I cannot so every week I actually have a revision for myself
we will go for lunch break
and then go back to library study
and then after that you take a tea break
at five O'clock tea break or dinner and then after that the best part is
yeah consistency cause I cannot take stress
I cannot take stress
when I found out that last minute I had test right in primary school did I tell you
I called her because they got surprise test
yeah
so it was during I can't remember which level [ah] in primary school and then the funny thing is
I found out that later on after the (uh) after our recess got test right then I call
my mum ask (uh) hello then I say
then I keep quiet then my mum hello
I didn't study that's the part I'm super stressed
I cannot take surprises
ya I cannot
I
[oh]
surprise
cannot [lah] [sia] I will be stressed
okay [lah]
that's
yeah I only learn that at my later part of my age [ah]
I realised I
[eh] don't tell this to #Farid# [ah] cause
he will laugh his pants off if he hears his mum is such a
yeah yeah yeah it must be like after after school days [lah]
after
if not he will use it against me
you know I don't like it when people use it against me
ya man I remember you normally
[oh] my god
A for commitment
but apparently it wasn't A for your final results
ya ya ya
if only they grade effort [ah]
drill
bit
[ah] ya
[oh] shit
are you serious
switch
hospital
ya that I know even though I didn't do O level D_N_T I took O level I take I took sec two O D_N_T okay
shaved plastic shave
yes
[oh] my gosh
this one laughed
[oh] ya actually it's true [ah] a drill is quite safe [ah]
you ask her it it #kiap# the thing right it's supposed to be
ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya I know I know I know
I did my D_N_T in sec two
I did something it was something I can bring back but of course I threw it away already I guess
!wah! that's a nice phone is that #Ada's# phone
no no I think it's Samsung
ya so I was a geek [lah] we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay (uh)
[oh] in the morning when you come then you ask each other [eh]
geography [lah] geography maths science okay
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got C_C_A
then upper sec I was a debater !huh!
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level [ah]
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
[ah]
S_Y_F [ah] because I think I had a solo part in that in that S_Y_F
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
(uh) yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
[oh] sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
(uh) arts (uh) sports and
(uh) I don't know geek [lah] I would categorise (uh) debate as geek [lah] I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood [lah] it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek [lah] okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool [lah] debater [oh] I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
my secondary school to go to J_C for one of the course
why [eh] I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game (um) minefield
[eh] that one is I tell you [ah]
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject [lah]
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch [oh]
like how curious a a kid is [oh] why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the bar~ ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the [oh] so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I [oh] the only reason why I went for that course was because [ah] [ah] ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
(uh) who (err) so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late (uh) we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up [lah] basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
[ah]
[eh] come on [lah] I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
he [hor] we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say [eh] you know [ah]
actually the head prefect saw my face already [ah] just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl [ah]
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class [lah]
[eh] so and so so and so saw my face already know !wah! if he see that I disappear already [ah] sure he will mark me [one]
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school [lah] [sia]
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
!walao! [eh] this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention [lah]
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually (uh) supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take M_C for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself [lah]
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no [lah] of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
[oh]
[a'ah]
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
[oh] my god
[oh] but the discipline master doesn't know you personally [ah]
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so pai~ pai~ #pai kia# [ah]
all cannot make it [sia]
P_M_Sing [ah]
!huh!
[eh] actually primary school classes are the worst to manage [ah]
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths [ah] okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that [one] especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school

a lot [ah] how many K_G
how many kilo you lost

but
what you wanted wasn't weight loss then what you wanted
really now did you get your G_P_A already
is that ris~
[oh]
then you thought you dropped out
ya I don't know why I've no idea [lah] so that's why you have any place doesn't matter where
I mean we are going there [lah] but you have a rec~ recommendation where
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
I think don't know maybe my parents they they plan they wanted to buy something
(mm) or any of the malls around there [lah]
ya
how to say that frustrating like you said [lah] take out handphone take take the Q_R
(mm)
[oh]
that time (mm) ya
ya [lah] that one is
[ah] mothers' day [tau] I think not the only one I think can see a lot of people got complain on that same
(mm)
that one I not too sure [lah] but you know they earn also not much
ya
(err) I think her mum [lah] her mum surely will will
(uh) [oh]
ya [lah] if you pay then I think cannot [lah] I think at least if you say
they refund or actually even didn't refund they say okay nevermind next time you order from us maybe we give you discount or that kind of thing
twenty to thirty bicycles everybody is starting to cycle
since now they cannot travel they cannot go
more people
maybe I mean okay definitely cannot be full [lah] I think if they full also it'll be
safe dist~ safe distancing but they must be ya fifty I think makes sense I think so ya [lor] but if ya [lah] okay [lah] if you okay
famous
basic
three dollars [lah] then
you go to hawker centre coffeeshop is usually like that [lah] but you go to restaurant then then you won't get that kind of portion
(mm) (mm)
I think the rain was
[oh]
you stay there ya [lah] will damage all the property [lah]
they just guess maybe
ya
confirm [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
[orh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] but (mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] the highest
I think the highest after in the
past ten years maybe something like that [lah]
name of the mosquito the aedes mosquito that one there's
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
the fever also they say it's it's just normal fever because unless certain people the complication the the thing they worried about I think is when you get high fever
ya so how to prevent
ya
ya in one day they have ya so that's why I think that's why the top three now is
I think still U_S I think and brazil and then india ya [lah] but
population a lot so ya so it is so one day one day sixty thousand like
singapore is I think fifty plus
fifty five thousand but different since january so for them to get sixty in one day
I think it's hard to believe
singapore at least now I think ya I see the number not
that high [lah] okay compared to maybe three four weeks ago think everyday
like what four
five hundred or even more now I think like average daily like hundred plus
ya I know ya
(uh) (uh) maybe ya
ya I think so
ya [lah] but when this thing happened I think everybody's learning
not only the construction [lah] I think when the
so ya [lah] you can see that actually
ya [lah] some more these like these foreign workers all that think all these people ya [lah] if you don't without them I think ya maybe still in singapore life can go on but maybe not the same maybe instead of we complain
[kan] nowadays (mm)
(mm)
true ya (mm)
ya once in awhile [jer] [lah]
work from home
I think most places like still like eighty seventy to eighty percent still work from home can see when you
ya [lor] but hopefully the government will help them out
ya
ya but okay [lah] ya [lah] okay [lah] if you still I don't know about your office but I think most office
most of the most of the business
true
ya
two to three hundred on transport food
(mmhmm)
whenever you on the fan [lah] you on your laptop cause usually
ya
hopefully in future if they do that and then at least people got more what you call that work life balance
ya true but ya [lah] but funny
[a'ah]
ya I mean like once in a while
ya I think this one all is
it's a way for them to to maybe (err) get people to stay home more
ya but not
activities at home like I think a lot of courses also like ya [lah] like I also I'm taking part time course but now e-learning some more online you don't even meet you don't even meet your
ya
ya
okay
ya [lah]
but all the all the
all the government is doing is is is trying to I think promote you know make people stay at home more
even the N_D_P [kan] they do everything at around your what you call that
(mmhmm)
ya
postpone postpone next year
ya millions of people [lah]
okay [lah] but better [lah] like you said just now
take a take a break like everything even that time when the circuit breaker like you can see like a lot of if you see news
(err) can see some animals on the road
ya
I think maybe also good good for all these you know nature
all the all the I think I saw
less polluted
cause nobody go there right
ya
ya so actually for for nature I think this COVID nineteen thing was a good thing [lah] it's not all bad
ya even even other countries also I saw like they they (err) those india and china those populated countries who have like (err) haze or fog all year round ya because of the COVID nineteen
(mm) you don't need to to shop or you don't need to travel I mean in in basically
ya so even if
you don't travel doesn't don't mean that that day you stress or what you know that that year you don't get to travel you stress yourself out still you you are you alive [what] you are not dead
it's like the end of the world is like ya hopefully
another I think ya another good thing after this thing after this (err) COVID nineteen also then you can see a lot of people discover new things about themselves suddenly got a lot of people can bake [lah] ya suddenly ya cause I got
has
ya [lah]
(mm) ya right
right
so I think ya
true ya true
ya [lah] once in awhile you complain but that doesn't mean that everything is bad because everything if everything is bad then maybe you have to look
at yourself ya
ya
ya (mm) (mm)
ya that's what I mean [lah] ya
other countries other countries they locked down like
not bad [what] like you morning or maybe they just that time I think they restrict like you you got I_C number card you can go only this day this day but still you can go you know
(mm)
I think I think so I think first time then after that
ya
(mm)
!woohoo!
let's go hello
(mmhmm)
okay but one question are you gonna answer it too
no
okay let's go
(mmhmm)
(oo)
I think that's a question where did you get them from
just random ya (um) I think if I were to follow my dreams what am I risking I think I will risk family time
family time is
crucial right
a bit of both
he's just a guy that always ask us to do what we wanna do
how do I do
(oo)
ya
that's a good superpower
(oo)
saves time
ya
!wow!
I've never thought of that
unusual
(oo)
then I think
(uh) first few pictures would be my grandparents and then my parents nothing much cause I don't
think there will be a lot of things in the time capsule
ten years ago (oo)
right
!wow!
!wow! ya that's a tough
like a period of time you know everybody has a tough period during secondary school especially sec one cause like dude
we did not alter our skirts did you remember we talk about this we did not alter
skirts we we don't know
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
I think that is peer pressure
[kan]
I think if I don't have like much friends last time
yes
cause you have like certain clans I don't know whether it it it happens in your school
since we're talking about school but like my school has a lot of clans
like the pretty one one side and then the C_C_A people are one side so
I don't belong in any groups so that's a hard part sometimes I don't even eat just sit down in class just just
(oo)
[oh] you call it monitor in your school
class chair
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
they have different ya
(mmhmm)
I was that girl
I was that girl
no I [oh] ya I forgot we had the I forgot we had the blazer on
ya but for my school we call it (um) have to
we don't just have prefect we have like a two (uh) different roles
so there's like a student council and student leader
student leader is student leader you just do like basic (um) just make sure all the class are good and everything but student council which I was in we do a lot with discipline master
ya so for student (um) leader
if I'm not wrong we only had they only had (um) the badge but for mine I have the badge I have the tie the blazer
so ya coming from
and we are good with (uh) literature so we really have to do good in both
ya
so ya
(mmhmm)
of course
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
like a stable right
ya
ya and that's why secondary school was the toughest
primary school was okay I would say
but secondary school like the pressure is on everything have to do good or else you have to repeat (um) sec four
except for school show cause like for our
time we had to go sec five
had to
ya had to but then
ya
(mm)
in school
(oo)
yes
something else
!wow!
the best
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya
yes I think that's my most memorable one
that's my answer
chicken wrap
ya bubble tea then they had to close and then they changed to like a random mini cafe with like that was after I graduate so
ya but that's for me but for you
the two dollars
ya
[kan]
I just remembered it's behind the drink stall
(oo) ya
ya
fragrant
(oo)
ya
the #ramen# the japanese #ramen# that's my number one
[ah] that's good #ramen# there's the
end stall that's why
but ya
that's the best one so two top two is
two dollar chicken wrap and also #kimchi# #ramen#
the beef
#ramen#
ya
ya
anything that is not generic to you you're like no I know you
I mean
as long as halal
okay
so for the bad podcast
(oo)
we're sticking to that [oh] my god ya
ya
sensitive
ya
perspectives
(mmhmm)
well we're talking about bullies remember just now we're talking about
(um) bullies in secondary school
well I was labelled as a boy
ya
okay cause
C_C_A was number one for me
I did all the C_C_A that are good sports to I have multiple
usually do sports and music I was in band and then I moved to volleyball netball softball
that's primary school itself
it's all that's
so that's that ya
(oo) don't get me started on secondary school but I_T_E was much lower but like for
secondary school I did let me run through
[ah]
secondary school I my number one yes my number one all time is N_P_C_C
(um) which if nobody knows what it means national police cadet corps
(uh) and then I also did aside for
volleyball netball floorball same [what] like primary school and then I also did tchoukball
tchoukball it's a I don't know whether a lot of people heard or not yes
tchoukball
bounce back to you you're supposed to not catch it it's the opponent who supposed to catch it to save the points
a side of rugby during I_T_E did everything
ya but like labels itself ya I was labelled as a boy
my voice
ya
the the topic is about bullies
but like ya bullies (uh) I remember one time
cause it's hard
I think I was in like secondary two or sec one
like early secondary school days
and then she just looked at me and I remember her face I remember her name until now
I'm just saying
P_D_P_A but I remember her name until now I remember her face I saw her before actually okay but we're not gonna talk about that
but like (um) she like looked at me she's younger by the way
she's like I think it was sec three or something like that ya she's a junior
she just came then she looked me she was like
(um)
just wanna ask are you a boy before this
so for me at that point you know at that age we're like !huh! what did I do wrong
and she starts yes
so I just stared at her you know anyway we're at the drinks stall so the uncle heard everything
okay
this is not the first time she did to me
I still have hours in school and I'm trying to like
forget what she said
but ya so people start posting my pictures online
and say about like how I act
I mean
ya
ya
council you're the thing you're popular but
that I say it you know so it's pretty tough to make friends
cause my own friends
like
kill me from the back
ya
so I learn everything
from the start about how
ya
come back to school the next day and see the same people and C_C_A
like you stay in school more hours than you are at work generally
people at work don't care about you
there's nothing about ya
people are there to maybe get money
you know different reasons but for school it's just school people don't have other reasons
so that's a hard part
label with
!wow!
[orh]
!wow!
one wish
I would say
whatever people say about me I tend to believe it's true
like you're a boy you are you are like you act so rough
you are this you are that or you
are that friend
as people like to say you know I mean
I will go through it you know
ya
ya
I think I never think of what you
want to think of it's cause I tried to stand up for myself but then again cause of confidence I tend to be like
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
I've been talking
[oh]
have to work for the money it's what you're saying
(oo)
ya
(mmhmm)
like you have no
eight to five job to go to right (oo)
what are humans catered to do
travel I think
but (oo)
just think about the human traffic here and there
and there's no limit like I think work is what limit you
you're like okay [ah] I only have like a week okay I want to plan everything right
cause I have to go back to work the next day I think that's what we are meant to be doing
but if we have no work
that's like a life of a retired person
I would say
they do whatever they wanna do use the money
(uh) plan their day but there's no rush which is a good thing
cause there is no time limit for it anything that you wanna do
cause we are not
(um) you don't have any commitment to something
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
I've been there before
ya should I say the one I've been there before or should I create something
again
cause #bali# [eh] #bali# balling okay
it's a mini paradise
if you want like a bigger paradise people would say it's maldives
and stuff like that but I actually wanted to go dubai
I am an expensive girl
no I want to go dubai for sure cause my number one bucket list since like young
is to go dubai and go skydiving in the palm #jumeirah#
ya
ya
yes
that's why I want to go there
like scared
level seven is already like now I live in level seven
it's already too high for me I used to live at level two
all the way but this one is level seven
(oo)
you know what I've known you for quite awhile thirteen is too much for me
the floor [kan] it's not like the straight
so your house it's already scary for me I don't know about skydiving but I wanna try
you're being no you're going with me
yes
screw secondary school
screw bullies
[a'ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
ya let's go
for free
it's free
but what
ya that's all I think I will go
imagine being a traveller
like working as a traveller
how risky not how cool how risky
it's up to the producer [tau]
that's risky
okay
(mmhmm)
in specific
(mmhmm)
generally
drama
it's you I
I'm not a movie person I cannot commit to any episodes actually
but if I have to choose romance is me
ya romance is me
I like romance
[oh] you know what a good movie that I never get bored of even like after ten years twelve years
ya
no really
no joke ya
I'm like a
hardcore fans of white chicks I heard they coming out the second one but
they say twenty twenty [kan]
twenty twenty hasn't been that great
but you know
anyway ya your turn
since you've been asking me
your genre
(mm)
that's the thing I don't like to watch
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
we're not alone
of course
ya
you know I love that ya
(mm)
but something that really shook you up
[oh] ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
money
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
but generally in life
I like to think that
anything can exist
as long as you prove me like
the opposite then I still believe it exists
you know what I mean
that's why as long as it prove to me
that whatever my thought is it's wrong
it doesn't exist then sure
but for now I believe in anything
anything
ya
apocalypse
how
[ah]
ya
infected
(um)
!wow!
everything is it's a circle of life you know how we started is how we end
overthinking ya
ya let's not talk about that part but (um) how would we end humankind
there's COVID pandemic thing already making people killing people I would say cause it's in india the stats are getting higher and higher
numbers are going down and stuff like that but
it's not gonna go down to zero we're not like vietnam or something was it vietnam
like the the first country that went zero
all I know is like ya taiwan taiwan that's the one ya
but like how long could that last
and how long could this (um) virus itself
exist so I think humankind human itself
would be extinct due like a virus
cause it's gonna start killing yourself like softly !wow!
it's gonna kill us slowly
ya it is actually
gonna kill us slowly cause we are finding for
a cure
you know but I have
I have faith
cause if cancer can have its cure any virus can have its cure you know
a little stress
[oh] ya ya
(oo) fun fact we only know twenty percent if I'm not wrong twenty percent of what's in the ocean can you imagine eighty percent left
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
and find ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
it's not mandatory
ya although even (uh) during the haze period it wasn't mandatory it wasn't right
I think also adding on to like how
human would end and stuff
climate change
(um) whatever we put into the world is what is being given back so when we put like a lot of (um) like
a lot of burning and everything generally
it's gonna brings back to us cause we're like we are breathing the same air as what we burn ya so ya even the icebergs are melting
so
even the bears are
killing themselves cause they know they couldn't survive in
right so
a lot of things could lead up to that
there's a lot of what ifs
yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
is
(hmm)
if only I have like a good platform cause I feel like every
every individual has its voice
that's cause we don't have a platform I wouldn't say the platform is famous being famous cause people with fame
has a lot of power
so ya
instagram ya that's it but if I can have
influence over at least a hundred people
I would have a platform where the people my age are not even aware of this like they
everything so lightly
you know
it doesn't find us now so
so I think
it's to create a platform where (um)
one should know
whatever they do whatever they think of
matters now
cause it's what like even the
government in any country has said
like the young people are the voice of the future
so we have to do something about it now
instead of just following through
you know
(mmhmm)
for the rest of my life
!wow!
(um)
okay
shoot
meat
steak !wow!
everything
ya
boil
(oo) [oh] ya
ya
I think
[a'ah] [eh]
okay
karma
ya
what goes around comes around
we always tend to think the best of yourself
[oh]
[oh] karma
typical straightforward that everybody does it don't lie and say you never done it before
it's when you could help someone but you did not just cause you're
too lazy or too tired
you're just like
ya so
so I think that's my answer
it's it's the time I didn't invest on someone when I had the time
when I had the choice I would say
the choice to put my time invest my time in helping someone and I did not
I think ya
yours
ya
understanding you
what you give to your parents
I wouldn't say disobedience though
ya
ya
[oh] you're talking like a part
I wasn't thinking about I was thinking of opening the lid at the same time
ya
ya
that's a good one
cause I always think to
to like with parents there's a thin line between respecting and being like I wouldn't say rude but like somewhat disrespectful
but I think with your son you're doing good
ya you're doing good right
ya
ya
actually understanding though
people get tired
so I think my dish
is reasonable
the time is reasonable
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow!
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(oo)
[oh] we're talking about
good body or body or good looks right
we're not talking about generally like physically
for boys right we're not talking about with pairs
of course
so I think I would prefer
good body
ya good body
if like you're not healthy reflects bad on your looks
I would say cause looks
what's the point
what's the point ya
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya
it only helps during parent teacher meeting [jer]
ya
you know health is wealth
ya
!wow!
ya
good one what did I do that I'm not doing now
what am I supposed to do
find like
something to munch
just cause I want to keep my mouth busy
when I'm supposed to keep my body busy
yes
really hard but ya
like it's just cause I'm small
I've never ever hit like
fifty five
but after I know you
no I'm blaming the fact that I'm happy
like whatever is on the scale doesn't matter cause previously I was like a
exercise freak
no I wasn't
I wasn't
ya so I had to make it like a certain number every month
like I have to stay that number
I have to be fit
ya
cause I feel like being fit is what makes me happy
I feel
but after
being in like work
not that I'm not neglecting my body but it's like I feel like happier already
like eating it makes me happy not like stress eating stress eating is different but it's ya but like previously I was like an exercise freak I have to exercise every single day
fives times a day no like five times a week not five times a day that's too much
like in a day I have to exercise three hours more than three hours
in the gym for that long
so
after that I stop
and I feel like it wasn't a need anymore
cause I was just forcing myself to do it and stay like a number below fifty
below fifty K_G is what I always go for
but that wasn't happy
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
prove the fact that you're healthy
there's different ways
some people will find like (um) the way you eat or
the number of hours you exercise or
just from walking
people would define it as five minute walk and you're okay building the same that means you're healthy depends
but so far
good body
it doesn't matter to me just health
just health ya
for your partner when you look like that
if the answer is opposite
my answer is obvious [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
!wow!
!wow!
are you talking about me
cause that's how I feel
ya of course
(mm)
ya but any I feel like I want the money
or a house
ya or house
for me it's hard to choose one
there's only one right
ya so money or house
ya
ya just
money is cause I don't want ya
if I don't want to be materialistic but like somehow
people say like money can't buy happiness
but it helps a lot
of course and you know it helps a lot
at times ya at times over like buying something for yourself doesn't make you necessary happy
but just giving it to people is
self amazing ya
ya
easier ya
(mmhmm)
ya
it makes everything easier
so that's what I would wish for
ya
a house
(mmhmm)
ya
like a space is what you need
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
ya
I think you just wanted space for so long
just your own privacy cause privacy matters you know like somehow
not saying that you don't want to be around family but like
privacy
is what we need at this age
cause we've been through like go to work and it's too much
you just want to be home and you want to be lazy
just to recharge
ya
think of it that way
always think what you don't have
cause if you always feel like you're content
you're not gonna progress and progress is like a big thing
so ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
patience
ya
ya
both
for the thirteen just now I would say like the confidence
ya (err)
no thanks to david #moyes# we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back (um) bit our hand back
and you associated with all of them
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya [ah] the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about #thiago# he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in #barcelona# central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
I can't believe [sia]
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham [a'ah]
when did they ever not lost okay [ah] to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean [ah] but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
#arteta#
plus minus [ah] plus minus [ah]
he knows his a level above everybody else [ah] no but but K you know there's this two theories of
(err) two types of players football theory [eh] two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers [kan]
[ah] the likes of
#guardiola#
and #pochettino# and #martinez# and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis #van gaal# [ah] #ajax# school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis #van gaal# is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but (err) no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective [ah] okay (err)
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent [ah]
he does basically [ah]
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen [ah] in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis #van gaal# school of control
wait then then I have the flip side [ah] the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually #merino# takes everything that is strong about louis #van gaal# and finds the witnesses so like louis #van gaal# takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using #merino# flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing [ah]
bionic #inter milan# game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but #inter milan# won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is (err)
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's #mourinho#
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin [ah]
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick #zambia lonso#
(err) (err) schools that kind of control #zavi iniesta# chaos player
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so (err) he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why #van gaal# and #cryuff# although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
#cryuff# emphasise more on individual creativity #van gaal# is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what #mourinho# exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre [ah] #mourinho# he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
opposites outside of the spectrum for one #klopp#
he
#klopp# denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
ya ya ya swan
(mm)

ya it's like in other words it's like my
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids [ah] and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences [eh]
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing [lah] that's the justification [ah] so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world [ah] mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of T_V people
it's not a sleazy casting call [ah]
(mm) (mm)
kevin spacey serious

better for him to keep his mouth shut rather than act moral
(mm)
(mm) (mm)

it might not know it but actually you are seeking validation from [ah]
the speed reservation people you don't think ya then your feed I was thinking to into myself that you're feeding of
pressurising you to look good in this way use this shade of colour that shade of colour and you are happily buying makeup and you're saying that you are in control of yourself and
are not independent thinkers that they are subconsciously being steered in this direction by the media by by societal pressure by the expectation to look something in a certain way

(mm) (mm)
okay okay
me and my wife for the past I would say one
ya me and wife ya [lah]
[ah] past one week [eh] not so past one one and a half months two months [ah] past two months
Netflix binging I've I've cleared so many shows just by watching
four five episodes a night on a weekday and I just basically every weeknight I clear four or five episodes so I started off with
when we started listing
use of my time ya ya unfortunately ya
you watch again superb show [lah] then
correct
yes
what
better call saul correct
I think season two you still have not [ah] coming to six
he's inherently not a bad person he wants to be a good person he just can't help himself [ah] [ah] to take shortcuts and corners like that but the transition from
being jimmy to
saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am [kan] (uh) we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
morally ambiguous [ah] but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging [tau] when you put yourself in and ask yourself
[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] [ah] it's a psychological phenomenon [ah] it's not a physical disability actually
ya in a fire self-immolation
okay [a'ah] [a'ah]
sheer willpower [ah] [a'ah]
(mm) ya
[a'ah] [a'ah] but
you should [lah] [sial] dude
have you watch prison break
a whole season or all four all four seasons
followed by the movie
no
what is his name will
he didn't die ya he declared himself gay but he
okay
what why why should that be to you you should be to woman okay but (err) there's four seasons of prison break followed by a movie
after you watch okay after you watch after you watch the movie then you follow season five
there's a season five and that's the final season
[ah] so it's a four seasons
movie then season five (err)
that [one] on the way their their in the works
okay season fourteen end up somewhere around two thousand twelve or thousand thirteen
[ah] then the movie then two thousand seventeen they came out with with
season five
[a'ah]
which is and is is coming soon
I started on watching this thing called peaky blinders
peaky blinders is short [ah] it's only four seasons of six episodes each very short
what iPhone is that doesn't look different from previous iPhone
okay
okay
safe entry
camera [ah]
I scan one
I keep the browser open
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
really
okay
(mmhmm)
which is which yours
why double tap when you can just press the camera app
cause it's you double tap then you still have to press the thing right
ya
[oh] you go it goes in a clockwise
[ah]
(mm)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so where is
(oo)
ya ya ya ya ya ya
as long as
[a'ah]
what's vending machine cafe
I think so
why
one corner
wait
[oh] hawker centre
[a'ah] [a'ah] correct
(mmhmm)
so it's not the
[a'ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah] alright okay so
you know how we started on F_M sixteen
then after that
[ah] it was very
simple the flow was simple and everything right
so they will bring you through a phase where you have to go for a club interview
okay
and then there are more trainings and delegations of jobs that you have to do
so (uh)
set of tactics to use and #gegenpress# #tiki-taka# all pre~ all pre-default
okay but then
(mm) so there's more tactical freedom [lah] in that sense
pre-default four four two four two three four five one whatever [lah] so there's a lot of different different different types of tactics to choose and play with but then [ah]
four two three one
so there is no restrictions on that however
[kan]
(uh)
(mm)
(mm)
yes
but is your central midfielder place like could deep deep lying box to box everything [kan] this guy is more for box to box player but he move towards the wings
and not towards the front or the end or the goal
[ah]
so
(mm)
I have yet to check spanish league
belgian I think belgian league don't have then (err)
all those minor minor small small leagues [lah]
I haven't check got I haven't really properly explored the game [lah] yesterday [lah] I mean
I tried a few clubs [ah] yesterday like (err) #dortmund#
then I switch over to (uh) chelsea then I switch over again to #zagreb# then switch over now I'm back at #dortmund#
cause you know
players and formation wise is really very very different from what we are used to [lah]
was four years [orh]
that's four years difference you know
[siol]
sixteen will be come out fifteen [pe] [ah]
(uh)
by right they should be launching in september october [lah] but cause of the COVID nineteen situation
clubs are still going on there are transfers and whatnots so (err)
F_M twenty is free on epic games
it's not a trial it's a full game for free
[ah] so if you don't want to wait for twenty one then just download for twenty first [ah]
at the end of day it's free [pe] if you don't like it you can just go and spend money and buy the twenty one [pe]
okay so then
Acer
Acer nitro five
it's a inbuilt graphic card that
still can be able to run F_M sixteen so I feel like it should be fine [ah]
there there might be but but I don't think cause the simulation games do not run
I don't think there'll be much of a issue when it comes to graphic cards and and whatnot [lah] cause F_M graphic is very very minimal
should be no issue [ah]
it's quite big [ah]
okay
I think should be no issue already [lah] cause most of the player both of the game is data to data data to data
no cause
I
how I see if what you say is true touch is for
H_D very very detailed
outliers
so means he doesn't mix with any of the social groups so he feel left out
[ah]
so they add a psychological concept to the game [tau]
so then your core players [kan] the core backroom where it comprises of most of your senior players
your highly influential players and everything [kan]
these people can shape your entire backroom just just like that
so if this player not happy with you they cause ruckus
[ah]
so it's
a more psychological concept in that game [ah]
no cause
okay you see [eh] it doesn't mean that influential person in one club is an influential person in another club
cause your influential players is players that been there the longest [tau]
[ah]
[ah] then from there he'll become a senior influential member
it's like my #dortmund# case is
#hummels# was from #bayern# [pe]
cause one thing is
he's a foreigner
ya so he's the only english playing the entire team
[ah] you'll feel complete outlied cause
you cannot fit into any social group that easily
cause of the language barriers and whatnot
(mm)
(mmhmm)
he will
it depends on how well he adapt into their club [lah]
doesn't have his friends he cannot be influential player there cause he still new [pe] even though he's old
then after that you cannot win games no matter how good your tactic is
your tactic may beat #barcelona# five NIL and everything but then if your players are not cohesive enough as a unit you cannot go and play apa
I mean that's what happened during #barcelona# eight two defeat to #bayern# #munich#
the dressing room wasn't cohesive enough
there's a lot of fighting in between
creates a huge factor in
your performance as a team [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
no no no no no no
cause you already technically purchase for it already
(mm)
but then let's say you have (uh) F_M twenty on your steam account okay
your F_M twenty steam or your steam can be
crossover to your steam (uh) epic games account
you can you can try [ah] I mean the downloads speed may be quite slow [lah] cause
it's quite a big game [lah] but I connected straight to my LAN cable so it was quite fast for me [lah]
[ah] seriously
[oh] K K K K
okay [ah] then those things do not need high internet speed everything
[ah] then I don't think that [one] can run [lah]
[ah]
internal cleaning [tau]
there's a few things that affect your inter~ your computer speed [lah] so dust is one thing
and then after that (uh) the make and model if it's outdated then
I have no idea about sixty thirty gig
just be prepared for the worst [lah] I mean
so it's very
it's quite intensive [lah] [ah] [ha]
[eh] [eh]
ya in a sense [ah]
[oh] okay
look the thing is I only found out about the social group thing today
so before I met you I was I was looking through the game again [lah] to familiarise myself with what the hell is going on [kan] so
in this version was the medical centre
[ah] so you can jump into the medical centre to see your injured players
I don't know why they think that would be a good addition to your
hide players to icloud so then you go to medical centre you can see which players injured then can see how long they injured for
then maybe there is
interactions and whatnot [lah] I haven't really jump into medical centre yet [lah] you can explore it later [ah]
I mean honestly if we've bought the game during circuit breaker [eh] !whoa! that would be damn good
[oh] you just press play play play play for ages [siol]
[oh] ya there is a singapore league inside [ah] ya
[ah] you
I mean this is a unprecess~ precedented situation [pe]
they do go home
and the game realised that actually they went off for holiday and they cannot come back due to borders being closed
then there's an issue you have to settle [lah] I mean [ah] like like there's one club
in F_M twenty you can try to manage bolton wanderers
lead one club
okay the issue with that club is they on the verge of bankruptcy
okay so you start the game
without the full squad
okay so most of your players that you start with are semi-pro
so slowly you have to sign them to a professional contract then you have to
bring up players from youth intake everything so you really start the game with
zero money
minimum wages
half your squad missing [ah]
[ah]
all the north [ah]
even the north south are not semi-pro [tau]
they are pro you know
fall from grace [ah] I mean
financial difficulty
okay
remember the portmore's incident
okay so this is portmore times ten
the portmore they were able to sell off [ah] their assets and everything to keep the club afloat at the same time
they sold off a lot the high players away
and replace them with [ah] cheaper options so there wasn't so bad on their end [lah] cause they got rid of the budget first
but bolton wanderers is when they were relegated with championship they still kept most of the star players okay so then they paid
[ah] crazy wages to keep them alive and then they pay pay pay pay
but then they realised cause of financial difficulty their club will bankrupt they had to deduct the points
so you end up still going down [pe]
(mm)
it depends [lah] cause
unless you
liquidate the club [ah]
unless you dissolve the club [ah]
no
I buy over your club
so once you pump in assets your club
once your club is maintained at the state whereby
you're neither bankrupt you're neither rich you're just in between just nice to survive for the club right
whether your club is churning a loss or profit it doesn't matter to them as long as you're financially stable to keep your club afloat
cause as as you go relegated [kan] cause of the financial fair play rules (uh) you're only allowed a certain amount of money in your club
so the more you get relegated after a while you be quite stable cause the amount of money you have is let's say you have two K
okay in order for you to play a premier league you need maybe ten K so
so not enough money you relegate down to league one which needs three K not enough money you relegate down to league two then two K two K [pe] just nice your club will stay afloat
okay with small wages
and then play as what they are then there is no issue [ah]
unless
you been relegated down and you job's board to make very very bad decision along the way
then you still keep going down [ah] until you meet a league where
it fits your
financial [ah]
or
the board give up
liquidate the club
so they face financial difficulties they were in #serie# [ah]
okay #serie# A
[ah]
[ha]
third corruption
okay so what did club did was [ah] they had to stay afloat cause they do not have enough money to
[ah] to stay afloat [lah] so (uh) what #juventus# did was #juventus# pump in money for them
to keep them afloat but it wasn't enough so
instead of dropping
so I give you money I give you money I give you money we build a new club from scratch using the same name
[ah] then after that
you start off at the basic league then you climb up again [ah]
then whether your players from your old club want to stay in the new club
that's a whole different thing [ah]
but it is possible [ah] like clubs like
wimbledon A_F_C wimbledon [ah] that is a new club by itself
cause they split from M_K dons then they come out themselves
so
they are history of clubs going around like this [ah] where they disappeared they dissolve the club and they come out with a new club with the same name
english clubs wise there were a few but they are now in the you know
the bottom bottom leagues [lah] I mean you can go through wikipedia and they will tell you about this [lah]
there are a few clubs with history that
go around like this [ah] (err) one particular example I know is M_K dons [ah]
M_K dons and wimbledon but the one is more of a split decision
so then [ah]
english
I mean you think about it in singapore we have our S league
okay then we have our delta league
climb up the league as you progress along
okay then hopefully you're good enough with financial stability to go into S league but then
I mean
look look at our situation
you used to [lah] still am [lah] so it's a difference
definitely [ah] I mean look at your size
ya [lah] it's cause
no [lah] maybe and also cause
like one point of time where you stop playing for awhile [pe]
ya [lah] so then you you stop for how long after that
you do not have regular trainings you do not have regular exercise so
everything change [lah]
I
ya like
what my cousin did was during futsal [kan] before the pandemic situation [ah] then they said no slide tackle that was the rule no slide tackle
okay so imagine the players charging towards you [eh] running with the ball and everything
idea [kan]
you have to be innovative
you're bending the rules while stay in the rules referee couldn't say anything cause he wasn't sliding
his body was on the floor but he wasn't sliding
so they have to let it go
it was a tackle
if
I mean it's been six years right since you last played right so maybe you
how long has it been since you actually watch football
that still two years ago at least [tau]
no [lah] I mean
at the end of the day
solid [sia]
I forgot which year that was [lah] (err)
was it two thousand fifteen or two thousand ten [ah] around there [lah]
okay
there was one time where the when
those running for election they have to sit in front of of the camera
and give a speech as to why you should vote their party okay so [ah] every other party [kan]
so for the respective channels like channel five channel eight #suria# and the #vasantham# channel so (uh) every other channel they set down a member of
that race to talk in that language but for the P_A_P
all across all four channels #lee hsien loong# face
talking all four languages
nobody dubbed over him [ah]
it was a thirty minutes speech
ya I mean
no [lah] I mean okay you see [eh] for their generation right
only for okay actually
for our generation [eh] for our generation [ah] at the most [ah]
our first language is usually english
quite solid
okay it's
so these are the kids where
their gen~ the english is a very first language mother tongue is their second language for our elders it's the other way
so obviously you only remember your first language [pe] cause that's the first language you're most fluent with
english [ah] cause
that's the language that we are used to
from but you said in [ah]
probably [ah] babe
I don't think it's depending on [ah] your mother tongue whether your mother tongue is your core language or english is your core language what I think is the language you're most proficient in [lah]
language that you use most often cause let's say [kan]
[ah] so that means
no
no that means you need when you grow you only remember english [ah] okay I mean
look at the americans they don't have a second language they only have one language [pe] english is their only language so when they grow they only remember english [pe]
so maybe let's say maybe they learn french or what along the way
then they cannot speak their french language cause they only remember that english language as a core subject
this a sub~ this is the language they use everyday
I mean at the end of day also
he will do [one]
okay but
I mean
eleven or eight eleven or eight [ah] screw it I go eight I go eleven first is eleven then I turn if wrong I just go down [pe] it's better than coming up [kan] the stairs [kan] okay eleven let's go
so the lift brought me up to eleven I open the door
[ah] thank god
I can tell [lah] I mean
is outside of house
ya there is a there's a [ah]
a cycle to work to look forward to [lah] everyday [lah] but now is just
I mean
you know how the you know how the market is now right you know I regret now is I did not extend my service longer
I really regret not extending my service longer even though I had to suffer inside [lah]
mean with the multiple sailings that I have to go for but at least it's there is a routine for me to follow
and at least I get paid
I get good pay you know but
!haiya!
it's a shame [ah]
no cause I know you tried to warn me but as I look forward in the schedule right
the schedule was really
!whoa!
singapore airlines send out their flights to nowhere [kan]
(mm) so you're burning a lot of fuels fuels cost money
cause
you're dishing out a lot of money but you're not getting back any money
I mean for ship wise it's different [pe] everyday you have to use your vessel
(mm)
no [ah]
it's still quite low [lah] but it's not
that low also [lah] I mean
car oil and (uh) jet fuel jet fuel is bloody expensive
so and they use how much cars use how much
you see that there's a huge difference [ah]
from how many litres to how many of litres [ah] so
no [lah] that [one]
it really depends on current situation [ah] I mean
as of now damn slow [ah]
to pick up [ah]
honestly this situation is worst when corona [ah] worst than SARS [pe]
so it's
no now cause now is cause of the trade war okay they fighting over the trade war
U_S wants to be a superpower but china is really
rapidly coming up and they cannot stop
and recently recently U_S government
ban the U_S postal service from sending masks to every household in america
[ah] so then the
this this lady was saying !wah! this a very useful mask still can breathe I can be compliant but not be compliant
they are the first to die they are the first to die hello [ah] [seh] they are first to die
I mean the citizens are doing same thing [lah] so I
think logically [lah] I mean the reason what america are thinking like this also cause
the education in the system in the first place isn't good to begin with
alright so today we're gonna do twenty random questions
twenty random questions with #aria#

that's the real life like this
that's what that's what happening outside and
you know we tend to forget that
we're not we're not the only one we're not
and we're not just the earth doesn't just come by of singapore you know there's other places but we're not sure of how they living the life
and how this these things gonna actually happening in other countries we don't see it in singapore
you know probably like
(um) serial killers there are some in singapore but it we never know how gore can it be how how how other people could like you know be be that crazy to do something like beyond humanity
(mmhmm)
(um) I wouldn't say I remember

you know
black magic usually like from malaysia
like they will kill each other for it or or maybe like family

you know how like could be and it turned everything upside down
you know
(mmhmm)

anything
speaking of existence
(um)
how do you think human will become extinct

right
but I feel you know what I feel
I feel like you know how scientists are coming up with
there are animals coming from the ocean and the biggest like animals that you've never seen
right right right exactly it's deep down in the ocean still more living under there
and and the fact that whatever they found out now
is already scary and it's already big enough to actually conquer like to scare humans
you know and how humans now are brave enough to actually go
above beyond the ocean that they they can you know they like diving deeper and deep just to find out cause of their curiosity and then I think
at the same time with the virus like you said
you never know what's the next virus
like five years ago or like two years ago we never imagine we have to go out with a mask
SARS
what time is that yes
but you don't have to wear like a mask like a it's not mandatory ya
it wasn't it wasn't
(mmhmm)
true we're not taking care of our own earth
(mmhmm)
true
right the icebergs are melting the world are rising
right
so like let's say you know that the world is not doing well
okay what do you think in your power or your might your energy
what would you have done what would you do what would you be doing for that
for the country even though like you don't have much we're just normal people
we don't have much either but what would you do to actually you know
at least just humanity in whatever is happening
what would you do
right
like
influential that's that's it
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
as long as it doesn't affect our daily food
what we have to care about it
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay speaking of which if you have
(um)
one meal
or one dish they would eat for the rest of your life
you know let's say the world is not doing good anymore and all like okay we have enough for everybody first one could be but we only supplying this amount of food this type of food for you
for the rest of your life
ya for the rest of your life
I cannot
either meat or spaghetti
ya like
steak
ya steak
you know
we can cook like
we can fry it we can like
boil it
ya
can boil it
make it into a soup or something
you know it could be bland but it still feels like at least I'm eating something you know
you know
[kan]
that's a sad meal
that's what we have to eat for the rest of our lives
okay
okay now speaking of food right speaking of food
let's say I bring you over to a restaurant
named karma
a restaurant named karma
so by restaurant named karma right
karma is retribution is it retribution
you get what you do
comes around
so if if if I were to bring you to that restaurant
and what do you think you'll be served there's no food just to tell you karma you'll be served on what you have done so what do you think you'll be served
(mmhmm)
ya
but why
I was rushing for for work
you know like for example that's
you know it could be something like that could be something petty like that but at the same time we could be like
(um)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya
what if people judge me
I'm always thinking like that
(mmhmm)
when you had the time
ya ya
right
I think
I think for me
myself would be (um) maybe (um) answering back to my parents
you know
cause I was at the I'm a very stubborn person if I think
I need to answer back like no matter who I would answer back you know and then if (um) I think there was a time where things wasn't going so well
so there was a time where I feel like I need to answer you back
cause you're not getting you're understanding me ya
so I think
the the dish that will be served for me would be (um)
ya it would be maybe like a mouth or something a tongue
probably cause I wasn't understanding of their situation either you know I wasn't trying to be
the kid who try to understand I was trying to be like you got to understand me cause I'm growing up
you're adult you know what I mean
ya so it it could be like if related to entering that probably a tongue or a mouth lip
you know
probably I mean
it's gonna be served to you
it's gonna be served to you so I don't know
it's a good one ya
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
I hope so even with my son I feel like if I were to go to this this this restaurant
probably my son I mean like the days where I purposely sleep in cause I don't want to cook you know I'm just like
ya
okay okay
okay I have a question
okay this is a question for you where I think everybody thinks about it everybody (um) ponder about it it's a dilemma
the question sounds like
would you prefer good looks or a fit body
when we look down (uh)
we don't want a show off our fats we're only wearing black all the time
you know but it could be you're fit you know you you you be wearing good clothes good body shape just nice you know
(um) perfect
you could be walking here and there the whole day and you're like okay it's not so tired but you'll be like having acne all over the place
you know you probably have scars
fit body or good looks
ya fit bodies ya
I mean you are with good looks good looks mean you have like a
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
why would you this is a
(mmhmm)
ya
ya me too I mean
right
(mmhmm)
right
anyway I have a child right so
it's like
if I have good looks and I'm unfit
you know I can't be I have to be on par with his energy or I have to be more cause
yet I have to stay from morning before he wakes up and up to the time he's asleep
you know I have to stay throughout the day I can't be like I'm tired and he's not well taken care of
you mean
ya people would be like [oh] my god pretty mum you know
ya but
but that's it you know what if you're not there for your child's carnival or like you can't run errands
yup
very true very matured
speaking of which since you choose fit right
ya what is it
okay
no
no it's like since you choose fit body so what do you do to keep what what you do to keep your body fit ya
ya
who cares
ya
ya
right
keep the body busy
but I know
I know you you have a high metabolism
right so I don't think I don't know whether it's true for you to actually like lose weight you won't really gain a lot of weight
no
(mm)
are you blaming on me
ya
right but you should be happy when you are losing your weight
was it was there actually (uh) a way for you to distress is that the way for you to actually
(mmhmm)
is it you were doing sports was that why your criteria you had to
like on a certain weight
eating certain things
true
I felt that too
(mmhmm)
it's bad
what
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
right
but I think as long as whatever weight you are I mean now
on a healthy weight even though let's say you're sixty or seventy but you're healthy you know you are you are not falling sick all the time you're not visiting the doctor all the time
you're not always like
(um) eating panadols to to to keep yourself alive I think that's fine
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
just health ya (mm) ya true cause
partner
(oo) !wow!
I feel I feel I think it comes back to this saying cause (um) you cannot have
no serious okay no if let's say ya I used to go for looks cause I don't do much to them you know what I mean and what I meant is like
(uh) they could be they they they just have to look good cause I want to look good
with them ya
like do I have a good
good appearance
ya example like but now more of like you're gonna do errands with me you know you got
no I'm not looking for a maid maid is like care for my job for my chores at home but what I mean is like
as long as they are healthy as long as (um) healthy being (um) happily not depressed not forced
you know they are happy and
they feel like whatever they are they know that they are loved
by their partner
you know they don't have to be like [oh] I have breakouts and you know like you gonna leave me you know I don't I
why
just use moisturiser or something I try to tell you that a lot of times you know
okay so for last question would be
if (um)
if you had a wish now
in this age and day
what would you wish for
what would you wish for that would
(um) like something that would help you with your life right now
you don't want to be materialistic
(mmhmm)
a money and house
or house
ya ya ya just only one
or house
is that what you're working towards to now
(mmhmm)
of course it does everything needs money
(mmhmm)
like it makes you feel satisfied too you feel like you have done your part at least you make other people life easier to you know like you could help with chores
like buying for them
things for their needs
(mmhmm)
you wish for that
okay for me I feel like I would want a house
a good house or I could really build
a home where you know (um)
it's comfortable it's big enough
it doesn't have to follow like the house you know the singapore standard house it I want to have like a a good
maybe
ya like it could be
beyond my imagination you know I just want a house with this big and then the final product would be however it be like you know I don't want the room to be this small but I want to be this big but it could be
end up a more than how many square feet
square foot it is you know
right
ya
for sure
(mmhmm)
right
(mmhmm)
(mm)
they have better
right
(mmhmm)
right
okay
okay so if if if you could say one more thing
to yourself now
okay to yourself now and to your ten years
ago your thirteen years old self what would you have said to the two of you
patience at thirteen years old
or to your twenty three years old
to both
(uh huh)
[ah] yes correct correct
(mmhmm)
ya
how how does how does it work
in the new F_M (uh) version
okay
(mm) (mm)
so
so basically all the tactics are all
your your choice [ah] there's no (uh) you can you can choose whatever tactics you you you run and you can (err)
do according to your preferences [ah]
[ah] okay so there's no like
four four two
(mm)
(mm)
so in order for me to play
for example #tiki-taka# I cannot have a
(uh) anyhow
five four one kind of formation I have to make sure my (uh) my formation is flick enough for the #tiki-taka# or
but okay so once I got the tactics done
is there what's that called the does does the player make a difference [ah] like there is there a player for example shadow striker
so there's a predefined for who can play what [lah]
so for the
players also
(mm)
is there like
they have a preference of what tactics and and (uh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[ah] okay okay okay so
they have their own (uh) attitude [lah] and (uh) they have their own attitude when facing the
[ah] each games [ah]
(mm)
I I heard I heard that there's a new league right den~ denmark is it
[ah]
if I'm not wrong [eh] (uh) the last F_M
that's that's long [sia]
I was I was I don't know why but I was thinking last year [sia] last year or last two years
so I [eh] correct correct two thousand sixteen
it will be [ah] fifteen
so it's in
one
so the last time I play I play F_M was sixteen
but okay anyway okay before before before I consider playing F_M twenty you think F_M twenty one coming soon or not
[oh] the the F_M twenty is free
is not a trial or anything
it's a full game for free
[ah] ya
[oh] I didn't know it was free
okay
okay okay so maybe later I will later I will plug in the laptop and check it out [ah] so if okay if I am going to download it
[ah]
okay
Acer (uh) you got you got remember what it's a A what
A two nine five okay that [one] I think I quite lost already
[ah] K so
there is you got what N N V I D A
okay [lah] so that means it will be quite smooth I don't know whether my
[ah] okay
okay
F F_M sixteen and F_M twenty might have a drastic improvement I think there is a drastic improvement
[ah]
ya I know I know I know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
I have [ah] eight hundred gig plus free ya but the thing
the thing
is the thing is I don't know how will it be smooth [ah]
I don't want jagged jagged (uh) you know what I'm trying to say right there's there's a
the not seamless enough
[ah]
[ah]
ya hopefully
but wasted the F_M twenty is not under epic for switch
cause switch also (uh) got F_M twenty touch
[ah]
okay okay
I thought the
say what
outliers what what's that
[a'ah]
that's a
that's stressful
wait so
so
if I kick out if I sell or I kick out all these influential people [ah] cause I don't want them to disrupt my my my
reigning off terror [ah] [kan] but how how what will what's the repercussion
will I be able to recover or do I have to bring in another influential person if there is such thing
okay
okay
[ah]
actually true true so for example I give you an example
if I bring
let's say #ronaldo# #cristiano ronaldo#
okay from #juventus# to
maybe
man U
okay from man U
is he
a junior
in man U but he's an alumni
[ah] okay
[ah]
okay
(mm)
[ah] okay okay okay
okay
so okay [ah] #dortmund# #sancho# is the english guy is it okay okay
(mm)
let's say let's say
this #sancho# is is english and let's say his his his old maybe thirty plus
okay let's say he's thirty plus
I bring him to maybe southampton or a jun~ or a full of junior club
so he will be a senior player or will he still be considered junior since
he just join the club
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
okay
this social group is
very important [lah] actually
ya true that's
as sad as it is that's true
know I mean okay so I'm
the the the F_M twenty inside the epic games store is not a trial not a
not a whatsoever is complete
full game for free
and
it is free on epic games but not
free on steam
okay so wait wait if I download it from epic game
free will the game be locked back or not after twenty four
you know like you know like
(mm)
okay
okay okay so it's only for epic games [ah]
okay
okay okay okay
okay I understand already
so maybe after
[ah]
maybe I would
okay
unfortunately my current laptop don't have a LAN cable
no no as in they don't have the
port for it
ya so so unfortunately my
laptop that has a LAN cable is my
poly era
which is
longer than two thousand fifteen longer than F_M sixteen
I mean
internal cleaning I don't know [lah] I I
[ah]
I I mean I I know about the the the
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] ya so anyway I will like I said I will try to how how how big is the file again
okay so
(mm)
it is intensive [ah] okay but anyway
okay [ah] maybe after this then I will give it a try [ah]
okay [lah] we can we can
okay if if I already download the the the game then maybe I can discuss some
well technically
if you want to use your social cycle you're the senior guy cause well you downloaded it yesterday
I download it today
yes okay
okay
okay
so
you never play the game I understand you never play you download the game you installed the game
you
look left look right
look look see see [lah] that's what they called it
now I go to the social circle context I buy this player
I never play him
one day two day okay maybe one season never play him
then I buy another player is he still more senior
yes even if I don't play him
ya so in the sense you are still more senior
in this familiarity
whether you play it or not
okay
(mm)
they have medical centre
okay no I I I okay I confused
what's the purpose of me jumping and see my injured player cause as a manager I want all I give
is you know
whether
he's at the training or not
(mm)
okay
I mean I mean
since I mean since the [ah] F_M twenty is very realistic every F_M every year is getting more and more and more and more realistic
I will be avoiding the medical centre cause I'm not really that sure look outside the window and everyone's wearing face mask and whatnot medical centres the last place you want to visit so for my own
simulated realism safety
I will avoid the medical centre I do not what I
the board of directors not gonna be happy if I have to be quarantine for fourteen days
then what do you expect me to do well manage the football from home
[ah] so
so imagine actually imagine
F_M twenty one when there's the corona virus realism coming in wait wait imagine this
imagine
you play F_M twenty one
your players got corona virus you got corona virus you got quarantine and then for two weeks two weeks
of being quarantined
you decide you you you said you know what
you gonna take out open your phone and then realise
[eh] [eh] how many days left of quarantine do you have
how many days left of real life quarantine you have [sia] god damn it four more days okay [ah] nevermind
since the whole two weeks so you got both quarantine in real life you got quarantine in game
that would be a very nice
situation to be in I mean not not the real quarantine [lah] maybe other people but that will be a very nice story for me to hear other people to be in
ya so ya I don't want to be quarantine
that will be that will be
that will be
prime minister #lee hsien loong# announces circuit breaker S leagues to stop game
there is a singapore league already if I'm not wrong so how
then if I play the malaysian league
my maybe I don't know I don't know whether players like #haris harun# still there but borders are closed how's that how's that gonna help me
well technically
[ah]
if they all go back and then all borders closed how my my malaysian squad is not all malaysians [pe] is
majority foreigners so just like that I spend millions of ringgit malaysia
for nothing
(mm)
[ah] I mean
[ah]
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay wait
league one semi-pro that's actually very terrible [pe]
cause semi-pro is supposed to be the
north north south ya north south
how did bolton wanderers end up there
I mean how can they fall that bad
I mean
how how I mean in in what situation would how would club be that what what bad decision they can make
ya okay
I remember portmore
[a'ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
so okay [ah]
deducting points just cause you are
just cause you are bankrupt
means you will have a higher chance to get relegated
which means you continue to get bankrupt
sorry what
ya I mean like okay you see [ah]
how is there's no
maybe maybe our country is quite good
but there's no government support
there's ya there's no support for this kind of things so if I make you see [eh] when I
relegated
I have reduced
reduced amount of budget reduce reduce reduce reduce reduce
and cause I have all these reduced I cannot support myself I have to declare bankruptcy or maybe in the red zone for financial and then cause of that they deduct my points for me to get relegated and reduced even further and even further even further
until I become just nothing [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay okay so
wait wait wait
this if if your if there is there
clubs so far that you know
they just drop and drop and drop and nobody give
and a
them any any any chance
and they just disappeared from all the place
okay
(mm)
I mean you can ask #juventus# how they manage to drop so so much
suddenly
that [one] is their what italian one M_D_B is it
[oh] okay
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's so
!wah!
ya correct
(mmhmm)
[ah] yes yes
(mm) (mm)
[ah] okay I mean
well that's
(err) when they are from the O_G group of fans and whatnot then suddenly just cause of financial difficulties
your passion that football just disappear just like that
cause there were
(mm) (mm)
there is know the
even below north south
time for them to just you know what
not just the leagues itself but the entire sport industry as a whole [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] that's why
ya
ya but
day
I mean technically if everyday
ya if you are
okay
used to be passionate about it I used to
I used to you know why or not cause you know
sometimes people
(err) physical
body change
and I may not be able to do the
top collar safe as I managed to do
as bad
no no no
no no no no I'm not I'm not fat is just I not I not
fat cause that's a very harsh way of describing certain diseases and handicap I'm not saying I am
one of the rare few who are not suffering world hunger [ah]
ya I mean I'm not I'm not suffering world hunger [ah] I'm the privileged [one] as compared to
so
but anyway anyway we put it aside ya I mean I used to why I said I used to have passion is cause
body change
unfortunately and my body change reflexes change
your mind can't keep up with what your body more and at the same time
when you fly when you jump and fly high
increase weight means increase pain
so I'm not gonna risk it
that was after secondary school after first year poly
second year poly I start I stop already
ya
so poly
poly year two
year three
N_S year one N_S year two
CISCO CISCO [oh] that's almost seven years
[ah]
six seven six seven years I never play
[oh] anyway if you want to know [ah] five aside
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
I mean that's a good idea [ah]
I mean true
you want to be
[ah]
(mm)
I mean technique ya I mean true you have to let it go
but I'm quite surprised why
he managed to win the ball in that manner in the first place
yes
watch football would be know recently [lah] (uh) after army
I don't catch up already cause know
people watch football at three A_M I'm you know guarding certain installations which is not very fun at all I'm I mean I it's fun to guard certain installations
if you know maybe you are
than the cool installations I don't like it I I
is is how do I say [eh]
it makes you wonder it makes you ask yourself this question
you work so hard
okay you work so hard to to to to be in the middle income you work so hard to get out of the peasants and the farmers only only to safeguard
the peasants and the farmers
which is like a sandwich
know like sergeant being sandwiched by the men and by the officer bro it's the same thing you're sandwiched you have no
how do I say you have no freedom still
but ya true [ah]
to [ah]
well I mean
like what
require unprecedented measures to be honest I don't even know exactly what the unprece~
precedented meaning is until he keep repeating until
suddenly I know the meaning without even googling it
so so that's how good he is you know
maybe he should just remain as education minister cause
he just keep repeating things until we know the meaning
without finding it out
(mm)
if you notice
[eh] he cannot speak tamil [pe]
then he shouldn't
(mm)
election before the previous election two thousand fifteen
okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
nobody dubbed over him [kan]
if you're thirty minute speech I can just say #vanakam# for thirty times [ah] for for thirty minutes [pe] I think that would work it's not like I'm not gonna fool anyone it's not being I I mean technically if you who who who's gonna listen
english
of course [ah]
understand it is
okay anyway actually there something funny I need to need to share with you you see [ah] my my
grandfather my
basically all the old people [ah]
all the our an~ not say ancestors our elders right
I realised one thing when they grow old they speak in mother tongue I mean you I I haven't heard anyone come come out and speak in proper british english
to me [lah] so far so
I have when I was young
I asked my grandfather he said I say why your I I ask him in in malay why your always speak malay
and you know what he told me that until now traumatise not say traumatise kind of until now I bring you know he said
[ah] the only language you will remember will be mother tongue
so so so I grow up thinking that is the way
then I then I ask myself if my mother tongue is is crap
how the heck am I gonna communicate when I grow old what people just gonna write me up as dementia or what
ya
(mmhmm)
okay
[a'ah]
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
okay
ya correct
(mm)
but actually
I I haven't pin it but then the the things changed when I was working as a in in checkpoint and then I I met into this (uh)
not say rider [ah] this passenger who needs to need to go to toilet if I'm not wrong
need to go to toilet or need to get the white paper white white pass so he so she came to me very old lady in
and then and he and she asked me in english about toi~ I don't know toilet or the white paper thing the white form
what want to go from #johor# to singapore and whatnot right so I was confused I say what I mean the english was very good
right
a malay a a malay old lady walking to me in walking sticks with walking sticks I mean
looking at another malay officer at that point of time
and speak in english so I take the passport and there was a tiger
logo down there her malaysian passport holder
who (um) who is a malay elder with walking stick I don't know why so important about the walking stick okay I have to emphasise
but but coming to a obvious malay officer
mandarin or tamil [lah] if not there will be quite a very big job but she choose english and honestly the english is more fluent [ah] and then I
reply
I I I when I want to reply in english I feel very awkward
I mean talking to talking to
a malaysian
in a old old lady old old lady in malaysia
a malaysian old lady I mean
right !wah! this is very confusing [ah]
but technically technically technically I'm not wrong there
both descriptions are true [pe]
well from
ya should use the word from ya so anyway okay
so
imagine speaking
tiptop formal or maybe as clear cut english not singlish [ah] no [sia]
so you imagine you say that to an obvious maybe like a relative or a cousin where you have to use the word ma'am
but
I suspect
I mean the car is quite posh and whatnot but
then you you make me wonder
so what english is your mother tongue
that's why you grow up remember english as your core language
(mm)
so how
[a'ah]
(mm)
okay
you you agree [pe] okay say if I only know english for example then when I grow old I say [lah] how
[ah]
ya that's why
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
so so I mean
maybe you never know until you grow up that that's for sure I mean I'm not
I'm not going to you know bite my tongue or hold my breath or anything maybe one day you when you grow old you speak to me in french or italian I'm not gonna hold my breath
the the idea of we both growing old is not to understand each other how many times right
remind each other about know how your C_P_F going and calling each other brother in italian [pe]
okay but you you understand what I trying to say [pe]
the group of people has been the same thing over and over again
cause they are old and nobody listens
(mm)
ya
I mean [ah] there there is a I think there's a occasion [pe] there's a certain
old indian guy at the coffee shop who
apologise over and over again
yet he's always interrupting us [oh] by the way [ah]
(mm)
so
so so so he got the you know he
I
the number is already one I from level eleven stop at level eight right he go in he hold the door open
but if somebody is going down I'm pretty sure there's a very high chance
(err) right if I from
if I were my high high level going down I'm
don't judge I don't want to talk so much
there's a very high chance
when the number is already pressed the red colour light is already at number one try to assume he's going number one
cut the conversation move along
then
(mm)
[ah]
okay okay
[ah] coming up ya
correct correct
I mean
that [one] for what [eh]
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] that is quite long [tau]
ya actually a lot of things changed [ah]
but it's nice
[ah] ya [lah]
think it's time for us to actually
get a proper second house
like work or or or or whatnot [lah] I mean it's so so constricted [lah] this place to be honest
(uh) twenty twenty four seven
you wake up early in the morning you come back at there is a
there's a [ah] there is a schedule
[ah]
[ah] now is just wake up you don't know what you gonna do
going go with the flow and then the whole day twenty four good hours just wasted like that
I mean
now is already twenty september [pe] you you there's what is it called your your
work not you already burn half a day in your birthday already [tau]
how unproductive are you going to get
how more
more unproductive are you going to get
you don't feel embarrassed
technically
I know
(mmhmm)
there is a
ya
yes
I mean I tried to warn you
I mean ya I know I understand how you feel to to to to be squeezed
just for maintenance [ah]
(mm)
ya I know I know
I mean
!wow! that sucks
(mm)
ya ya
I mean just like that [eh]
(err)
a a billion dollar company multi billion dollar company just
gone [sia]
but
I mean oil should be cheaper right or

to
quote unquote our prime minister status
for unpaid
I mean
I mean I'm not saying anything [lah] but in order for you to you know
move forward in this pandemic is to ensure the U_S china tension doesn't rise any higher cause
as long as U_S and china is continue to be fighting I don't think there will be a vaccine anytime soon
[ah]
[ah] ya
okay
[ah]
now that's a very interesting concept
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
I
I don't want to die
the what's that called I mean I don't know what the U_S are trying to think [ah] but
but (uh) I mean if we see (uh)
technically if the U_S government is not very
is saying is saying that the mask does not work
I think we can raise it up to our G_R_C [ah] and

that's why I want to do psychology
(mm)
god I miss this cutie pie a lot [eh] I miss when she's this old
#sufian# did wanted wanted to come back at that point of time but
but I keep on I reject I rejected him [ah]
because ever since that case right I just cannot see him like
the same anymore I can't accept the fact that he's he's like that
(mm)
[oh] this [one] with the remember the
[ah]
(uh) forgot what his name #rudy# #rudy# something
I only know #rudy#
thirty seven [sia]
he got the features really

that's a major turn off for me
(mm)
come on this is our photo
a long time
(mm)
(mm) #haris# is better than the the ex
I wanted to get this for
[ah]
[ah]
I don't care whatever people want to say
I think this guy
shit
sorry
this is #balif#
he also not bad
(ugh) I hate this guy
that time (uh) okay [eh] I never tell you the story [eh]
okay
[ah]
that was the last time after that all the way COVID [sia]
sorry [ah] why why what happened
okay which man U game was that (mm)
[oh] I see the opening game against crystal palace where they were thoroughly whacked by the opposition
I think their
well bro the sad fact is that the if you were gonna blame david #moyes# you should blame him like for what he did seven years ago when #thiago# was supposed to come to man U in twenty thirteen
and he kind of like botched that transfer
[ah]
so so basically west ham has lost their opening two games [ah]
am I right okay never mind (err) who cares about the relegation battle especially when you're a liverpool fan like myself
you know I just the the thing that's the best part of the game for me against chelsea for me wasn't the actual game on the pitch [tau] it was the
the few minutes before the second half started where you literally saw #thiago# go around to like the coach and then go to glow and then like he was doing high fives to all of them he was like hugging them like ya I'm going again
(mm)
okay
(uh huh)
that philosophy [ah]
okay
the same louis #van gaal# were sacked by man U
okay
and their goal is the master of that school
is the top student of that school
(mmhmm)
okay
ya
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
I see
okay
!wow!
so he's like the empty football guy
(uh huh)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay that's that's the same school [ah]
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
just whack [ah] basically [ah]
[a'ah]
when you first lose the ball that's when you're most vulnerable
okay
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
#klopp# denies you space #mourinho# #mourinho# gives you all the space you want but for you to make mistakes with [ah] but [ah] okay [lah] I mean I watch the highlights of the southampton game I mean !wow! wonderful game from a
I mean I mean I mean the work he's one guy who I should have put in the E_P_L team from the start [ah] [eh] how's your E_P_L by the way
[sial] [ah] for
okay so let me get this straight you play a managerial game on your P_S four
okay
ya ya ya best I mean pro evolutions soccer [ah]
I've been using iphone for like the last five six years [ah] actually I can play on my iPad also [kan]
(err) I just watch this movie yesterday devil all the time did you watch it so so so basically basically (err) [ah] I don't know for what reason maybe I was just bored yesterday
(err) so in the afternoon I was watching this show it's actually the number one rated (err) Netflix show
okay but anyway (err)
the infant tyler characters but anyway okay so so so basically what Netflix does I I mean I've I've recently subscribed back to Netflix [lah] cause
what happened was (uh) when september now [eh] so last month (err)
early august after I came back from that O_B_S camp that I told you about
ya the the camp the camp that shall never be we shall never be mentioned ever again so basically when I came back
(err) I was like okay [lah] feeling mildly depressed you know thinking about my life then I switch on the computer I was like
!hey! there's this #anelka# documentary on Netflix
[ah] have you watched it
okay so so so basically the reason I got back into Netflix was cause I wanted to watch this #anelka# documentary [ah] so so it's (uh) it's a
decisions he might have made in his career or the controversial things he might have made the controversial decision like he might have made during his career
I think france had a terrible world cup twenty ten if I'm not wrong
ya ya ya so
ya so so yes so so basically the entire french squad they did not want to play properly cause (err)
raymond dominic actually like (uh) had a an argument with #anelka#
I got into Netflix cause of that #anelka# documentary and and I've been watching a lot of crappy shows on Netflix I mean some are good shows [lah] but some like (err) okay have you heard of cobra kai bro
so so you have watch cobra kai [ah]
like they they they've model you you see so they they they profile you they so they study your model and they know okay this person likes these and and this is how we're going to get him to be like attempted like
ya ya I mean I mean obviously they use all the data that comes in from you and it's not like people say like after that like [oh] they sell the data
and you find that you know you okay the the the one of the biggest problems that we have with social media today is this increasing polarisation [ah]
cause you end up looking at people on the other side of the fence and looking at them and thinking
like like ya no cause cause your algo~ the facebook algorithm has actually
fed you the information that you want
so if you believe that for instance the P_A_P is bad for the country
(uh) am I allowed to say
well I can be will I be will will special branch start knocking on my door soon so basically
you believe that the P_A_P is bad for the country they will continue to feed you stuff from like online citizen independent S_G you know
all this other stuff and then they will ask you they will they will get you to like group which which which are more anti government
yes yes equal chamber that's the word correct so and then and then you you read all these information and then you're like
ya so it's a very insidious thingy and and what happens is you have greater polarisation like what do you see now in america where the democrats are moving further left
and the republicans are moving further right and there's basically anarchy and civil war and you know people rioting on the streets and all that and and and people are like [oh] you know what's happening to america but ya that's that's how it is so
it's interesting [lah] like okay so anyway I was watching social dilemma but last night I watched this other movie which is devil all the time I think I think you might like it [lah] so it's it's set in a america in like the mid fifties
and (err) it's about how this guy (err) I mean it's not a ghost story or anything like that it's just like it's about you know
murder (err) ya like all these all these vices you know happening in this particular town
and how this guy this kid is trying I mean I'm trying not to spoil the movie for you [lah] but but
basically basically it's about it follows this guy from the moment he was a boy until he grows old how he tries to break free from
the the the the so called vices of this town [lah] that he's in
[ah] it's in ohio I don't know if ohio is
somewhere near there but ya I mean [ah] okay [lah] so basically the story is set in two places it's it's based off a book in it's based of a story book so it's set in two places [ah] one is (err) knockemstiff
knockemstiff is an actual place actually in america (uh)
(err) K N O C K E M knockemstiff knockers steve and then the other one is a cold creak so cold creak is like a fictitious places so [ah] basically the story is about the starts it starts out with the story of this guy who comes back from world war two so he come back from world war two
is (err) you know religious you know being religious and religion and having faith and all that [lah]
so so he comes back from the war and then like his mum is like you know that church going christians sort of thing but he is like losing faith a bit so he's losing faith a bit cause of the atrocities of the war that he has seen
so (uh) and then finally he gets married
to this lady
and then (err) and then and then and then
but ya you know you know you get what I mean but then this as he starting
to feel that closeness to god a tragedy strikes a family ya
feels a bit distance from god doesn't doesn't feel and and the thing that makes the story (err)
complex is that people who are seemingly supposed to be good like your
your reverence and your pastor and all that they are also twisted [ah] I mean in the movie they they they
[ah] not not just inner demons [ah] I mean they are just they are evil people [ah] you know like okay one of the reverence in the story is [ah] robert pattison
I think he's going to be like the new batman or something [kan]
ya ya ya you've you've not watch robert pattison is going to be the next batman
so so so so but [eh] but he is he was good in this movie so he plays like
like a last full kind of pastor in the show [ah]
so and and and that has major consequences on the the characters in the in the movie [ah]
[ah] well he doesn't he doesn't molest children [ah]
[a'ah]
okay
are you sure you want to say this on (err) are you
are you sure this is the sort of the thing that you want to say on on on on the record you want to go on record with it
okay okay
not not you're not referring to the Android box [ah]
[oh] is it
so basically it's an app~ [lah]
okay okay
[ah]
[oh] is it
but I think it could be cause of the cuties
okay
okay
ya I mean I I I I watched the trailer and then after that I was like what the heck is this
ya
okay
ya ya ya
ya [lah] they are like they are like eleven years old eleven twelve years old ya so maybe not even not maybe not even eleven like the singapore context that will be like a kid in primary four primary five [ah] it's like not not even P_S_L_E [ah]
ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm)
[ah] ya ya ya
I think she's french algerian or french morrocan or something like that
I mean the the entire show also it's about this muslim girl [kan]
ya okay okay senegal is here ya ya
(mm)
and I think I if I'm if I'm not wrong I read somewhere that (uh) they held auditions
and like a hundred plus girls came for the auditions
no [lah]
I mean okay we we we know it's an open it's (uh) not so
it's not that that much of a secret that that hollywood a lot of the producers are taking advantage of girls and sometimes these girls are really young like you know I mean not just girls I mean I I also read like I think kevin spacey he he wants like
(err) groomed this fourteen year old boy or thirteen year old boy ya kevin spacey
so you you that's that's the that's the thing you never you never hear about kevin spacey anymore but I mean he still has his fans [lah]
because of this [ah] so
so I mean like in singapore #dee kosh# obviously if you if you look at his Instagram account on his Twitter account like there's no there's been no posts from him for the last one and a half months
high speed internet that we have and you know all the like sexualisation that you see in the media and like you know porn going into people's homes and all that and people like not having that kind of like
[a'ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
alright
[oh] my god
and he was a lieutenant in the army
he went through O_C_S [ah]
okay
[ah]
okay
he's he's a good kid [ah]
okay
[a'ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
okay
[oh] okay cause
okay so so so how how much older are you compared to him [oh] you're just a year okay okay okay so so ya [lah] cause you went to M_I was it M_I sorry we're not we're not we're not supposed to mention our schools
okay so
so when you went into army he was already a lieutenant and he was recently in the news for voyeurism not voyeurism what do you call that #upskirtism#
so he actually did it
look [eh] look bro bro if we're if we're if we're comparing weird ex schoolmates [ah] bro
so there was a guy in my batch and I mean like
he seemed like a normal chap in school and all that he was recently jailed for like twenty plus years cause he actually brought singaporeans from singapore
to I think cambodia or laos to have sex with children
seriously yes he he actually set it up and like he got money ya ya exactly sex tourism so he got money from from like singaporeans to bring to
so he was like I forgot his name [ah] but but but I don't know but
so basically he was in one of those classes [ah]
so but I I know him and I I mean not know him know him [lah] like I I remember of
his existence back this in J_C [ah]
yes
ya
this pakistani migrant this chap comes from pakistan is nineteen twenty years old he doesn't know a word of english or word of malay but he comes to singapore and then like
naturally [lah] cause he's from that country
maybe I don't know [ah] maybe we're we're looking at it differently [lah] maybe maybe it was different but I I think that was the situation [ah] from what I understand [lah]
ya
and and this was of course before the disco era this was of course before the you know the sexual revolution of the nineteen sixties and seventies but of course during our parents time I mean
I've I've heard of stories of my dad going like on a date with another
women apart from my mum [ah]
sorry #syed ahmad# we didn't mean to mention your name
[oh] okay
[oh] okay K K K K I know I know I know I I I know that ballad okay so
[ah] we're we're we're not quoting anybody by the way just
okay so anyway
what is he gonna what is the world he's gonna face in in twenty years' time [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
okay
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
okay
ya
okay
(mm) (mm)
ya
look and ya look and behave a certain way [ah] perhaps [ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
well I mean what can you say [ah] these days you know there's not a lot of thinking going on [ah]
and I guess people are just
following trends [ah] just doing what the next guy is doing
you know I mean everybody man woman is
ya she she she has that fear and
that hesitation of wanting to do something away from the norm like cause
you know I mean when I got married I got married in a mosque and and back then it was like
but now is like quite common [ah] you know nowadays you have mosque
ya [lah] but you still had your your function in a activity hall [ah] my my my point is
in twenty eleven when I got married it was
(err) I mean there there are some !huh!
(err) subject to any of these trends I feel [lah]
you can [lah] you can but but but it's not encouraged cause it's a small mosque but what
ya
[ah]
clear on what it is you want to do
what your intentions are what you are trying to achieve and ya just hold it that [ah] you know I mean also I'm like actually I'm looking to sell my house [lah] I don't know whether I told you
bro #sengkang# G_R_C bro #raeesah khan#
[oh] sorry was that too loud jamus #lim#
(err) unfortunately unfortunately where we are right now this is not #sengkang# G_R_C but it's okay
no no this is #ang mo kio# so
[ah] sorry [ah] every conversation between #zulika# and myself must involve some degree of politics [lah] then you know there's some spice [ah]
so (uh) we've covered politics we've covered sports we've covered religion we've covered the latest show on Netflix but that's what we talk about you come (uh) we have a how many more minutes do we have left on this thing
okay we've got fifteen minutes left that's good [ah] [ah]
I I don't want to play games [ah] I mean I think I would draw the line at games [ah]
ya
my wife my wife and I [oh] but ya if singaporean then it might me and my wife [ah] okay
[a'ah]
okay
!wah!
that's a very productive (err) your time bro
[oh] okay okay I watch breaking bad ya ya ya ya ya
so I think like there's five seasons or something and then you watch better call saul
you know something I I didn't have the stamina to last through better call saul is better than breaking bad [eh] you you should talk
[oh] my god okay
ya [lah] he hasn't changed his name yet [lah]
okay
yes yes yes yes
(uh)
okay
[ah]
okay okay
and and that happens right about season four season three season
four okay I see [oh] ya ya ya ya ya
(err) so I think his brother died or something [eh]
ya I mean I I I kind of got to the part where it was a very testy relationship between the two of them [ah] okay I got to the part where the brother went back to work
I I I roughly remember that cause to be honest with you I think the last time I watched it was
what like two three years ago [sia]
okay
!huh!
I I've never watch game of thrones [ah] by the way
of course [ah] bro ya
there was a prison break movie
yes he died right
wentworth miller
[oh] okay he declared himself gay so so like he died he died
to me [ah] no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding
okay ya that's true [ah]
I didn't watch the movie or maybe I did I I can't remember it [oh] ya I watch the movie
there's a season five
[oh] my god I I thought this was over [sia] bro
I think I watched that I I I feel like I've watched the movie
[ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
[a'ah]
[sial] [lah] bro you could have read all the books [seh] in all that time [sia] bro
[oh] I heard of that but I didn't watch it
okay no no no let me tell you let me tell you something else that happened to me
apart from the fact that (err) I got the subscription to Netflix okay on top of that what happened was
I bought I bought a new iPhone recently [lah] so this is iphone S_E
okay so the previous one is a six S plus which is bigger so S_E is a you know it's it's one of the new boys [lah] so apparently you know now if you install I_O_S fourteen you can double tap and then you can safe entry have you heard of this
okay so so basically basically where how do you do your scan safe entry
okay [ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
okay
okay basically
okay basically basically for me I can just
!hey! siri scan safe entry
and then after that like and then after that like
you know the singpass app the recently was in the news cause all your results
[ah] all your all your results will be in your profile in the singpass app so basically
so basically I just scan and then all the details that they need will be in and the other good thing about using your singpass app is bit is that basically if they had a detected case in any of your location they will inform you
they will automatically inform you so actually actually the singpass app is very very useful [lah] I don't know why I didn't use it before ya so so so now instead of using siri and saying you know scan safe entry I can actually just double
tap my phone and it will scan safe entry
so that's the new thing with I_O_S fourteen but
it's only available on iPhones which come after the iphone eight
I think for me I don't know about your phone but for me if I bring up the camera it doesn't automatically scan the Q_R code I've I've never actually tried switching on camera and seeing if it detects a Q_R code
[a'ah]
(uh huh)
it automatically scans the Q_R code [oh] okay
it goes in a anti clockwise [eh] clockwise can you see the
okay so this is the this is
there
like that
[eh] so so so (err) we're coming to the end
okay
[oh] I think I know what your day is referring to
but I tell you no no no bro bro bro I tell you it's
[ah] both [ah]
with all these different stalls it it feels like a hawker centre cause
but I mean it's a bit late for sim~ for #prata# #simpang bedok# [ah]
you don't know #mahamoodiya#
yes
(uh)
ya I remember I saw the vinny guy [lah] and I can tell that he is very self-aware that people are talking about him [ah]
so I remember like just looking at him then like I was looking at #shu# then I was like [eh]
maybe we just go closer look [ah] then we we I don't know whether I was being very loud or he's just that attentive to people around him right but he was looking at us
then I was looking at him then I wanted to like (um) you're the shit bag who is having a weird relationship with this russian lady that is telling people how to do burlesque
(err)
and straits times so I was like thinking [oh] sh~ shoot I should have like told #shu# about it [lah] cause #shu# is always searching for
like articles to write about and it's going to like help her a lot more to (err)
like at least advance [ah] cause she's telling me that like right now she's just taking what people give her and like she
or if you yourself have something nice to talk about and can you know I can set it up you can be famous
do you know that #shura# is like two years older than me right like she's like my age right

N_T_U has like more freedom
N_T_U is the liberal [one] N_U_S is the consecutive
you need to be part of their like C_C_A or some major C_C_A then they will like let you
my god
[oh] my god reminds me of the remember when (um)
running man was super big and then running man running man
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean T_V show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
so after that (um)
we noticed there was a lot of (err) people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in M_R_Ts with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
#jia hui# #jia xing# eldrick elway like just running around like
in the M_R_T station in one in one like tribe damn funny
I remember (um)
so mister #jamal# he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
#trumpist# I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter [ah] I have no idea [lah] that trumpet players [ah] like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world [lah] like he told us that
(err) he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because (err) back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown [lah]
he was a br~ he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that [ah]
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in (err) chicago [lah]
so he would play the trumpet and then his
(um) his
friend would play the piano
so (err) I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior [lah] who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister #jamal# right when he first came down right to the
to the sl~ like band like
like what you call this H_Q [ah]
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts [lah]
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
(err) the
like the U_S [ah] because he was wearing those
(err)
football jerseys [ah] like those what cowboys [ah] patriots
okay I know that
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of #kasanaz# I'm sure you remember #kasanaz#
so #kasanaz's# husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer [ah] to the point that
they live in singapore but by right #kasanaz# doesn't need to work
#kasanaz# is like apparently like got money kind of like girl [lah] but I believe the husband is those
chief engineer or something [ah] like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time [ah]
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
#kasanaz# knock it down
I really miss all my friends at B_H_G
did I tell you that #wei xiang# is still working at B_H_G
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like #wei xiang# first of all right
you and me [ah]
[ah] both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university [lah]
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
B_H_G like for the rest of your life then
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense [lah] since you like you
somehow educated [lah] most of these B_H_Gs are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties [ah] who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs [ah]
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the (err) man~ the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in [lah]
so ya [lor]
I believe he's just a cashier
(mm)
you know (err) he used to intern for supply chain for N_T_U_C
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
(err) so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you in~ you intern for not a small company [eh] you intern for like a really
big
(err)
you intern for a really big like M_N_C like
ya N_T_U_C should be okay [lah] no it's not M_N_C
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe N_T_U_C is a blue what do you call it a blue chip [ah]
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also [ah]
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example #temasek# right #temasek# holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance (err) teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with #temasek# then we were like bonds [ah]
you know shares right you can buy like hundred [ah]
yes so it's really like you need to have money [ah]
ya
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away [lah] but
it's a bit sad [lah] like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan [lah] the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years [ah] I have [one] [lah]
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money [mah] and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents [ah] cause how much could you possibly earn from B_H_G
to be honest
quite sad [lah] quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the o~ he keeps eating at M_B_S
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like M_B_S or what [lah] those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever [lah] so I'm just like
why
the I remember it's quite insane [lah] like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like A_T_M card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue [lah]
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the nex~ boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome [ah]
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
(err)
#wei xiang# was quite a
like not say an advocate [lah] he was quite a
this at this I_T_E
restaurant at this I_T_E then #wei xiang# didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists (uh) near the library
yes
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat [meh] with all these I_T_E like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no [lah] so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was (uh) didn't want to like be near this like be near I_T_E students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an I_T_E student
yup so I remember the (uh) boyfriend was studying [ah] architecture or something [ah]
and then the boyfriend he's (err)
he's got money [lah] he's rich I forgot what the father does [ah]
(err) the father quite strict with the money [ah]
like I remember the father once said that
(err) got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten [lah] then the father got so pissed the father said
(err)
since you on the aircon after ten right (err) [ah] your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
h~ the father and the mother
(um) divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
I think the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings [ah]
I don't know
I don't know [lah]
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so !wah! talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go #jakarta# one
second thing right they always go #jakarta# on like
business then I'm just like
you go to bus~ on business class right
you should go for long flights because
#jakarta# right to me is wou~ two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
#dubai# or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
(mm) go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money #wei xiang# give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them [ah] but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can [lah] one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no [lah] you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be #dee kosh#
don't prey on kids
seriously #dee kosh# is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
(err) okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew [lah] his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me [eh] #raf# want to se~ want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called [lah] then he was like [oh] my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking #dee kosh# then I'm like !huh! what you #dee kosh# wants you to model for him [ah] he's like no #dee kosh# wants to suck my then I'm like
[eh] wait wait wait wait wait [eh] you don't anyhow [hor]
then he show me the like the text [lah] so I was like
you're in~ this guy is insane [eh] you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am #dee kosh# your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like [oh] you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that (um)
like then later on he'll be like [oh] like (err)
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars [lah]
no obviously I don't know #dee kosh# I'm telling my friend that
no so (um) I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal [lah] hoo~ hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid [lah] there are apps and all these [mah]
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these [lah] cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people [mah] like
no one agreed to this [ah] and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this [ah] so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
it's the same as (uh) you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
[a'ah] the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said [ah] is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using mo~ money right is is illegal [lah] you can't se~ like solicit sex for cash [lah] I believe
that is
wrong [lah] like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong [lah] I don't know how how wrong it is [lah] in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due (err) not due dili~ I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not [lah]
I don't know right is not a good enough (um)
answer to to evict you from like (err)
like
a a sentence [ah] it's like that there was this guy who
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone (err) he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
(err) with drugs [ah] that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge [lah] he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious [meh] for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
it's (err) it's not a good enough (err) like what you call it
defence [ah] the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
he the guy never say or whatever right [ah]
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
(err) lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine [lah] like the person cannot say because the person lied [mah]
and the person tricked you into it but #dee kosh# I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that [oh] I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only [mah]
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly [lah] but like people like
influence [ah]
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific [lah] social media influences [ah]
to
follow a sor~ a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle [lah]
that's between the followers and them [ah] some people will like [ah] it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like U_F_C and [ah] you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense [ah] like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then h~ people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this [lah] but we don't empower him to do the things he do [mah]
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram [ah] Instagram empowers him [lah] Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things [ah]
nicole #choo#
s~
yes
there are people your age who do it also you are just one of those people who are not in the trend
you're retard
anyway ya that's besides the point so like
it's just the way the world is [ah] the world evolves in this way [lah] so this is why I always find that
people who always complain right about all these and all these right have to understand that
everything happens right as is is everything is acquisition [lah] everything like happens because something happens [mah]
so like it's just evolution [lah] like something !ee! the previous generation must have done right has created this [lah]
so
like I remember I was watching the documentary about paris hilton
then paris hilton says that she is people say that she was the first in~ influencer
and her responses her response to that was
I regret it [lah] I feel like I created monsters
which is true [lah] I remember she was the first
real socialite [lah] because before kardashian there was her [what]
she was the she was the real like
she her her her parents are freaking rich
her her grand daddy great grandfather is like rich [eh] like really really rich they got a lot of like money
and like she was literally a socialite [ah] she's like those
rothschild
like what
legendary families [ah] like how many legendary families are there left in this world
rockefeller rothschild hilton
(um)
(uh) can't really think of any other people like right now [lah] but
and all of course all your shakes [ah]
sh~ how do I put it [lah] like she is
influencer game thing I think there's nothing
there's nothing wrong with it [lah] it's just it's just
who are who are we right sometimes [ah] to tell people like what they're doing is wrong [lah] if if
if
there is no
like nothing really wrong about it [lah] like to be honest
don't there isn't there guitar influencers also I'm pretty sure there's guitar influencers people that
you know that if they were to review this guitar right that soo~ like tomorrow right there will be at least fifty people wanting to buy it
or place an order
it's just the content
that you you don't like which is like everybody's taste [lah] I personally don't like any of these people [lah] like to me my
I will always be like if there was a foodie influencer will be like [oh] there's this thing that just opened nearby in singapore like pancakes or whatever then I'll be like no [lah] I mean if I'm
(err) I'll go down to town and buy it [lah] if I think that the price is worth or anything but not a big fan of like all these
what challenges [lah] what I put inside my bag [lah] my house
tour [lah] how much money is in my bank [lah] my mother underwear what colour [lah]
like there's no need for you to advertise your life so don't you think s~ like
in a sense right is this isn't a phenomenon that just occurred you know this
trend right exist in people right throughout the ages
people who
they're bored they have nothing better to do they just want
to some people they just want to really they just want to share their
their lives [lah] they just really want to share with people and some people might be
very interested like
I would say that if I have a interest in (err)
in a certain like celebrity or something like
would I be interested in
life [eh] when he on a day that he has fights
the fighters and stuff like that
or he calls or like you know like what is it that day in the life of like
(err)
an S_A_F person or something like this kind of thing wouldn't you want to know
like what is the what is the prep like for a S_A_F person before he goes on a mission
how do you how do you
measure productive right
in in in in in like in accordance to
like how useful it is [ah] it's content
I have no idea I've never I've never watched his videos
they have the power of
humour humour and story telling [ah]
no [lah] the target market is people from like
twelve to eighteen
hi hi how are you lately
it's okay it's okay it's okay recess week you are meant to take breaks right
is it the same assignment that I have [oh]
[oh] yes yes yes (um) ya me too me too I was supposed to wake up at nine (err) eight thirty
ya eight thirty cause I want leave house at nine thirty right and then I woke up at nine and then I was like (hmm) what time is it I was like [oh] my god it's nine and then I didn't want to get out of bed
like it was so hard and then I was like okay [lah] and then suddenly you see take your time [lah] it's okay [lah] then you say really take your time
I was like did she just leave the house
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
N_T_U
(uh) [oh]
ya [oh] my god that's really really far why why why
pity you [oh] ya she study
[oh] for ad hoc [eh] nice cool cool cool cool cool
I_B school [oh] okay
[oh] for different department [ah]
[oh] then they will just photoshop people in the same group [lah]
[eh] she was at her
I_P
[oh] wait she is the
[eh] she is head [ah]
[oh] who is the vice head
[oh] yes yes yes yes [oh] my god
I like I was like trying to think who is the [oh] K K K yes yes yes
ya
[ha] [ha] does you feel like not being in ad hoc this year that's great
I'm proud of you for caring about yourself
volunteers
[oh] because they're not gonna do any physical okay
[ah] I see (err) no [eh] they haven't recruit volunteers for I say members
no not yet don't think so
ya
putting it on record is not your problem
no [lah] I think cause they are still trying to secure the heats
so if there's no heads they can't get the members
that will be kind of weird
(mm) ya ya ya
[oh]
[oh] okay okay that's interesting
do you miss it like joining something at least
(mm) do you intend to join
like next sem
don't know I feel like
(um) like when I join when I was in year two it was purely for the sake of okay trying out new things right and I tried both ad hoc and sub comm
experienced what I need to experienced in ad hoc ya
I feel like
I think I was like [oh] like it wasn't that great experience
and so I don't think I want to join again not in my last semester [lah]
yes last year best year
like I that was right so I am doing other shits instead of doing school stuff
that's the way
okay set set
Muzmatch next sem
I try before I try before no no not me I ask my sister to download so she was like
I feel she was like ya
it was that like it will it will really bring you to the guys [tau] so you can just swipe right or swipe left
and then like we saw the guys I was like [oh] my god there was a okay [lah]
you can just
ya
I actually I think so I haven't really use other apps
I don't think can
I don't know actually maybe we never look through it hard enough to find where to delete
ya so like
we swipe up one guy
nothing within the hour she deleted the account after that
didn't see it but ya so I think
I think you have to complete your profile first so when you because we never upload her her profile or everything right
then there were we it was a limit of ten guys I think
ya so we only manage to see ten guys so out of the ten guys we only swipe up one guy
come here looking for like [eh] it is
but I I guess that's the whole point of (um) Muzmatch and also like like half our #deen# right the app this dating apps but the half of our #deen# is
so that was how my aunt got married
ya so ya
so at one point I think she was tired of finding guys she just wanted to
just go all out and try and then like okay so she she knows what she want she's like okay I'm serious I want to get married I wanted do this I want do that right I want I know what I want in a guy and so she join half of our #deen#
I think half of my #deen# or half of our #deen# I can't remember and then (um)
she met this guy so like (err) he is from another country
but like he comes to singapore and wants wants to do work and stuffs I think
and then he came to met her and the parents of her
nd then now they are happily married but now she lives in australia
ya we want international guys
sure sure ya
that was kinda kinda
cool
the I think because
half of our #deen# need you can have like yearly sub~ subscription or like I forgot what else ya I told my sister (um) by the time she reach a certain age
and she still no guy I can help pay for her subscription
if she wants
(mm)
is it
I didn't know
[oh] okay okay
I feel like Muzmatch when you want to create the thing right they will actually ask you
how halal are you ya ya they will ask you about prayers so like the question was [oh] like how often do you pray then there is like sometimes most of the time everytime that kind of thing
I feel like that's the I feel like now that you said it I feel like there was one of the questions that was asked ya so in their profile they will show
I think I wouldn't mind I would say I'm not against it
it's just I I feel like
(um) not saying any couples out there who met through dating apps like you guys can be happy but like
I feel for me if I want to fall in love with a guy I have to know the guy in real life first
you fit the ideal in because sometimes it's like act it's like you say things and you show things that you want people
to perceive of you that doesn't mean that they are truths about you
I like I rather go through the process of finding these things out myself about you and then I decide like I don't need
(um) this interface to tell me okay ya
(mm)
ya
opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instance if people around him keep saying that [oh] my god it's such a nice person and he doesn't this this this then I'll be like okay see it's like he's kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya and then that's kind of hard to to do with a guy that you meet on a dating app because you don't know the his friends
right you only know him and after that if he chooses to let you in on his social circle then you will get to know his friends but besides that
you only have him ya but like you will say [lah] like if that's important then
meeting a guy in real life whom you know through like mutuals and everything is more important
[eh] do it [leh] let me be the why
but you can tell from okay so because my sister friend
join Muzmatch for quite a while and she dated a guy on Muzmatch but like she told my sister that the guy is that (uh)
(um) quite trashy
it is so like I said like the things that they put on your profiles doesn't reflect
what who they are in real life you know I mean
ya so ya she dated a guy and then she broke up cause the guy was just too
[eh]
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
I guess (um)
when you this is very superficial [lah] but I guess when you do it in real life
it makes you come across and that's desperate
ya because nobody knows how many guys you are talking to in in a dating app you see
you can be talking to twenty guys and that they they just think that like I mean they probably won't think you are talking to them alone because you are on a dating app but it feels like you are talking to them alone
but if you were to do it like in uni context for example when it's such a small social circle
and you put yourself out there and you
you know try your very hard right then it that case becomes desperate
ya
correct I know like I before I join (um) ad hoc and stuff like people already
say [lah] you know did like people like actually join ad hoc and stuff for the sake of
ya so actually that that was what
turn off people from joining ad hoc last time
like during before like during that time when I wanted to join
I don't know
what's like your ideal date
ya [lah]
I would like to know
ideal date no I don't think so
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
so is that your ideal date or your ideal first date
first date ya
I I don't think that's anything is too much
I think it's up to people preferences
[ah] because
watch the movie what do you mean okay then
[oh]
I mean it opens up doors to topics of con~ conversation afterwards like
ya
[ha] your date how long
(um) okay K K ya trekking sounds like a great great ya
okay I first date
I like nature so
I will look so unglam
like just
I I won't I won't dump it on scene on the first date I don't want you to run on the first date I'm gonna capture him first you know
like I will wait for like a few months
maybe like the second month ya [oh] let's go trekking then we see how [lah]
I like I like going outdoor so so so maybe I would like a picnic
ya
right ya
like I would like a picnic then we paint
ya right
like like I don't know like I had seen my friends who are couple and then go a picnics
ya
ya so sweet
it's so beautiful
ya then after that we watch the sunset
right
[oh] no [oh] my god
okay if let's say you are on a bad date okay
would you ghost on him half way or would you
they just went toilet and then they never come back
(mm)
[ah]
okay so it depends on how bad the guys is [lah]
[ah] I see
ghost
ya so that was this (um) they were talking about their dating experiences so there was this person who said that he was catfished
(um) on a dating app you pretend to be someone else
or you pretend to be something very different from who you are like you don't have to pretend to be someone else but you can just pretend to be younger or older or like
shorter or taller that kind of things so
then he was catfished by a much much older woman like at at that point he was only
nineteen eighteen ya
I think so [lah] ya then after that he was catfish so when he came right like
he saw the lady was much older at that point is so young right and then like (um) he just went to toilet
and then he just never come back
ya
(mmhmm)
it is
I mean
I think if I was catfished
the the the guy obviously deserves to be ghosted
because like why in the world would you lie to me in the first place
ya right
that's why
like I don't think that's a nice way to present yourself
[ah] I forgot the name like the dating ya ya ya ya
that's this thing (um) that you date
the girls on one side you guys on one side and then the girl and the guy will enter the same room but they cannot see each other
show (uh) that day I just find it
ya and then (err) so basically they will get to know each other through those rooms for like a few days
and then after that like if they like each other right they they can continue meeting each other through those room but they cannot see each other so when they can see each other is when the guy or the girl if you want proposed to the other person
so only when they are engaged
then they can meet and this all happened within one month
have you watched that so far it is it is
I fo~ I really forgot what's the show [ah] cry
maybe just finding
[kan]
just you know
I mean at this [oh] love is blind yes yes yes
ya love is blind is it was a pretty interesting show actually
(err) ya ya ya it is it is
like out of
ya
so even then there were a lot of dramas and everything because you can only meet the person so
at that point it was really a matter of
(um) they will basically they were trying to prove like does looks matter do looks matter
ya like in in a relationship
so at that point because you cannot see the other person so it's really about
whether you can really appeal to this person just through your personality [lah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
would you ever
no I I would be
I I feel like ya but like but like
I I think in matters to some extent that I get to see who I'm interacting with and potentially get engaged to you know
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
match making [ah]
(um) yes yes I guess it is the same thing like
ya but I guess that [one] is it's kind of sad [lah] cause they don't have a choice you know
ya
what change
that's nice too right
I used to set deadlines for myself okay twenty five I must get married
ya it is
ya really is right but like that was when I was like still young and naive and just thought like [ah] you know
ya twenty five sounds like a good age after uni ya
and I no guy also like where am I going to look for
guy ya like
my batch mates [tau] I understand seniors but my own age
ya ya like
shit
ya ya [kan] is
is I feel like it's really stupid like the the fact that
B_T_Os can only apply where people can only apply if they are getting marry and stuff and then like how the age limit to buy an apartment
the law says it's thirty five years old like I think that's really stupid
(err) ya and also like
I think the government also want people to procreate right so like they want people to get married have children so that's an incentive for them
yes
yes #hazimah#
for women our future generation to suffer
ya
[oh] my
actually ya that's a good thing [ah] and I I've thought about this my answer is no [lah] I don't think I'm willing to have children
at it like in this knowing that the world is like this
nonsense nonsense it is it is and like
I don't know like I don't think I want my children to grow up in singapore
like not it's too stressful then
to be a minority in singapore it's something like in other countries you will still be a minority
true
true true true it's just that for a country that price itself over
multiculturalism multi racialism whatever
ya
I saw I saw my history teacher posted this on I_G story
(um) to my sec four students (uh) here like (um) no actually is like [oh] (uh)
both she teaches both so she was like here is a good
[oh] I'm proud to live in singapore (err) to my sec four students here is a good example of multiculturalism
and then just like right right and then I'm just like
but like you see you can always find minorities doings stuff to be
to like make an effort to accept other cultures but you don't see majorities doing that the same for minority cultures
so you can't possibly say that is multiculturalism if it just fits into
your ya
correct and then I was like [oh] K
no I haven't have you but I saw snippets of it
[oh] god
I saw I saw yes
about like [oh] like why did you not care about politics [oh] because is fatally boring right it was like it's boring
it's boring to you because you don't care about the or you don't care to change about the world that fits you perfectly ya
that's exactly what I discussed with a friend that I fell out with
you know like
it is but
no it's not some disagreements and like like I said to this friend like
it's not something that you can just agree to disagree not when my rights are
being violated you know like when not when I'm denied these rights
(um) have privilege over
you know it comes easy for you and that's why you can just choose to say I don't want to care about politics because it's so boring and it doesn't concern me but for me
politics is so deeply entrenched in every aspect of my life and for you to say that
(uh) like being so nonchalant about it it it hurts me [lah] because then do I even matter to you
be~ because I feel like if you want to be
(um) you (uh)
are a majority in this country right you have a lot of power and privilege
and if you're not willing to do something with that power and privilege
then you're just being an oppressor already you know if you are not on the side of the oppressed you are with the oppressor
ya
I so
perhaps it's also because if they acknowledge that chinese privilege exist then they have to
face the fact that you know the there's this inherent problem in the system
that is damn perfect suits them perfectly but denies
(uh) huge mu~ like minority groups of the same rights and privileges you know then then they will have to to you know they know that there needs to be changed by they are unwilling to go through that change because it brings inconvenience to them ya
ya
(um)
and then like talking about Mendaki system (uh) subsidies and stuff and like
prove that no chinese privilege ya
ya it's just (um)
it's just
ya I feel like
when people say that [oh] you want more why why is it that you need more many represents or more minority representation
for you to hear minorities kind of what they face ya right like why do you need so is that you only hear people with power
what then then who are you really representing that you are not representing the people's voices you are representing yourselves people with power amongst yourselves
yes yes that's
ya so
ya it's true true but you see why is it that we always have to compare with other countries why can't we just compare with our own and admit that it's sucks
ya
I don't think you should just compare countries across countries like that
which countries
ya I agree with you like
there are other form of oppression that minorities face in singapore it doesn't have to be
[oh] because [oh] like other countries if you are muslim you die you know but in singapore like there are oppressions like #hijabi# don't get to wear a #hijab# all the time
there are instances at work where they have to remove that and that is something conflicting with religion and
you know being in workforce
ya
ya
ya like
ya it's like [oh] we should be grateful that we are giving you some rights [oh] [oh] okay
ya like
ya like okay can then like
coming from a I feel like a
I would say privilege background
like I was very (um)
blind sided to all these issues that was prevalent to this society
like I was
I feel like I was like always trying to be accepted in
ya ya
ya
ya
took a lot of unlearning to finally accept that you know what
it's okay like
ya like I'm proud of being who I am and I shouldn't care about what others
like
I mean that's how conversation works
[oh] my god like ya
ya I feel like recess week is ending kind of fast
no no no no don't say that by the time you said that suddenly it's sunday already
yes

that is nonsense
you can't say it
[oh] what what which do you like best
ya
I already know mine but it doesn't live in the zoo
no K K you say first you say first
okay maybe put it in general [lah] in which general [eh] which animal do you like
but that's not an animal that's a category
[oh] okay okay
is it giraffe
K K K is it big
[oh] (err) zebra
mammal ya
panda koala [ah] cute cute cute cute
that's cute that's cute mine
I love cheetahs I love cheetahs for my entire life
yes
and I get by basing their cause there's like cheetah leopard yes
leopard yes yes yes
do you know that cheetahs don't roar do you know what sound cheetahs make
[oh] my god I would love to show you no they do not
they do they do make noises but
they do not call for #kor kor#
hold on [ah]
my favourite word sleep
I don't know [eh] dude there's one
no this is a full grown cheetah
the purr but it meow
and then they also make some okay you listen to the beginning right they actually make some other sound
ya them they make this sound
don't know
[kan]
like I
I love them so much I love cats any any kind of cats
[ha] ya they are all cats
they are so cute
like I want to meet a cheetah one day
[oh]
ya like why should they be in the cage
!aduh!
ya additional five dollars for the boat rides then I was like [pe] and then
not actually a lot of things is not on the river a lot of things is
no idea maybe there's a river there that's all
right and then I feels like [ha] may~ maybe cause like can go first
a bit like a roller coaster kind of
really inside the lock right it's like a lock right there's a mechanic you know so you just go through it's like a ten minutes ride
no I thought it was going to be real but it's not
but but (uh) #kai kai# or #jia jia# whichever is the female [one] she's pregnant yes cute
then like they like she had to she couldn't come out [lah] she was she rested in
in his own enclosure
ya
like the I think #kai kai# is the guy [one] #kai kai# was (um)
[ah] menopause ya
the #jia jia# was just sleeping like rolling around sleeping
I love pandas they are so clumsy just
yes
yes
does it include animals
babies like on where instagram
maybe that's why your algorithm is just on this yes ya
(mm) that is interesting I think mine is also on
shows that
ya
shared to everyone in the world because some things are so intimate like
ya like I was saying (um)
so intimate to you guys I
maybe different people have different perceptions of what is intimate to them but in my opinion this kind of things are
I don't know it's just
true
true true true true I
I would say that I can agree with that of course like I I'm all for you know normalising guys crying and miscarriages happen in huge like
be able to talk about it openly but as you know it's just
ya ya
so ya I don't know like
they are like
I see
ya
there is this I have this favourite couple the guy is so sweet and then like there was like a date the girlfriend did a challenge called my husband and then the guy was like [oh]
my heart you just called me your husband
[oh] so cute
I guess maybe like at that stage they still don't know yet but then when someone says it like that it gives them more reassurance that one day it's gonna happen you know
you you can try [lah] like [oh] like do a live [oh] my husband here then like
then your mother follows you right later your mother b~ [oh] okay [lah] then your friends then
I've never thought of it that way
I've heard like a lot of times people like the the people the guest coming to the wedding are not really people that you
know or are close with they are just people that you invite because it's a formality that you have to maintain relationships yes yes
with family members ya
[kan] and like in this pandemic like you
it is telling [lah] that that's actually you don't actually need to invite a lot of people you can just stick two hundred people and and that's it
you know
ya so
#inshallah#
putting it out there yes I think my par~ my family won't be nice too
okay [lah] good luck to my sister then
!wow!
!siala!
young marriages [eh]
the first thing is the first thing in my mind is just divorce ya
!oof!
like child before marriage
(mm)
foolish this tough man like
okay !wow! wait I need to like plan this out like I need to do
okay young marriages [eh] okay I think
something like that ya is like you know (err) like people said you are so young like you know like be~ obviously people judge right
but then is like you can ya we are married you know we are not dong anything wrong we are not ya they are not doing anything wrong what they are not doing anything wrong
divorce
!oof!
okay
okay
okay
okay
they want to get married like what by by by two years time in a year's time
but they
I think like getting married and having a family is two different things
ya so what are you what do you have in mind getting married or building up a family
then
at least like whatever you do right like people can't really like judge you that much because like you're not doing anything wrong ya you're not giving a bad image you're just young
you just look young
ya
ya
and I I I have a children that means we're not married ya
!oof! that is like
time [eh] I don't think
I don't know I don't
she again she started to you know go (err) around
and the fact that she told me at I was what eighteen at that point I was eighteen at that point she was twenty six then I was like !wah!
but ya
and I think she just started like schooling like [eh] no not I mean working at that school like maybe about one year or two years around that ya around that
tie tie want to tie tie a knot
ya babe but that's you [ah] like everyone is different also [what]
okay to me I would say like
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot or not
one more year to four year you want to tie the knot
[ah]
(mm)
what ya money wise but go back to that question that you said in papers you can be managed with through papers [what] then after that then you can build up your life [what] financially
why
(mmhmm)
(mm)
they just sign papers they just get married they think like they're the one you know like each other soul mates sign then
(mm)
ya
for generation I think like I think it depends on the society [ah]
so it's like
yes correct workaholics that's the word
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that that's what I feel because of like where we live the society that we live in that like that's how we live that's how it is
that's how we grew up like we need money if no money we die
ya
honestly I I don't think singapore only [ah] I think it's just right now everywhere okay fine maybe
we say singapore because we are asian
wait we're not talking about #ang moh# countries

cause #ang moh# I don't think #ang moh# like [oh] #ang moh# is like [oh] time is everything more but they don't care about money they they they care more for time but the thing is
if they have a lot of them and they're not doing shit we have we are rushing for times ya we're always rushing

why
I don't have a bike I don't have
this scooter also like take up battery
so
and the thing is you know okay like my
places
then I'm like so what I cannot work another job ya
ya so how am I suppose to work
bullshit for for them to want ask to work two jobs
ya
[ah]
like but our minister said can
the court minister say can
ya
if like that means right is like okay I'm working for full time and then my side business let's say
bake cookies [ah] let's say [ah] [ah] home based [ah]
side business is bake cookies okay [what] is so do you consider that is a second job or is that just a like but then you said already said is really say side hustle
but also time and effort way to do that effort [sia] because you do that as a second job
so
so
what do is the good I don't see any good in working into two jobs more income I don't think so
I don't [eh] I don't really think that [sia] serious
okay [ah] let's say you work five days a week okay you work office hours then you have second jobs maybe let's say a part time [ah] ya part time second job second job is a part time
then maybe you need to work four days a week
then you have to commit one weekend so so in a way actually you are working six days a week less time for your family also [sia]
I mean obviously no family no problem [ah] if you have a what
for you
because okay I ask you time or money
(mm) (mm) ya
no no no right now money
so they're chasing after money [what]
ya best choice but like you said forty fifty plus not lonely [ah]
[eh]
ya let's say only singapore [lah] because where else
where else [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
and the fact that singapore don't show the suicidal rates
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
(mm)
I can't imagine someone going through it because to me it's like too much
behaviour
split personality
ya [lah] [ah] ya
(err) I've heard about split personality only but I didn't know about you did (uh) you can have like multiple (uh) personality I didn't know about the multiple I only know about split disorder
I want to know how what is the science behind it though serious
(uh huh) right
[ah]
okay
okay
is it
is it a old
old like a video
[oh] it's [oh]
s~ say some
(uh)
[ah] forget about it ya ya ya
different identity disorder
illusion [ah] no
insights right
ya
then I don't know what I was into there's was this video it was an old video then they were talking they say like
(uh) what and they have different names that's the thing you know they have different names
(mm)
what's that
ya that's why I was so shocked and I was thinking to myself
what if actually everyone has it but it doesn't come out like it
we like the other personality didn't
what if everyone actually has it
!oof!
(oo) !oof!
yes (uh) [ah]
yes
that's the one
(mm) how many personalities
[oh]
!oi! [oh] she what she wants to fight with split is it split got twenty three
ya split got twenty three
!huh!
what
[oh] wait the move was about her
portray
okay
obviously I think that part is fake but like
come on [lah] why would you believe the power the beast is real
come on [lah] serious like what the hell
[ah]
okay
why does the
sounds familiar [eh] [oh] that's tony #padilla#
from thirteen reasons why right
ya ya right right wrong person wrong person
okay
!huh!
same [lah] like split
(mm) actually
I think right all these personality is just in our head just that they are special to show it out we don't like we normal like normal people ya ya there's one part in the movie I like right
remember
[oh] my [eh] you should you should
everywhere had her body her arms [ah] legs all that so when the beast saw it right then she say [oh] you're pure
no I thought of that too
something like that [ah] this is what I interpret from the movie [ah]
something like that ya
it's very end it's actually a trilogy
the old movie is called (uh) shit I forget then the second [one] is split the third [one] is glass
glass they combine all the three [one]
[ah] the first [one] it was bruce willis
something I can't remember I can't remember that [one] I can't remember
ya
educated [oh] sorry
it's not rare
ya
true
[ah] currently I watching the lead the king's [ah] you know #lee min ho# inside

[ah] I've been wanting to see how it works
[oh] is that
[oh]
[ha]
you cannot like delete the profile [ah]
serious then what did the guy do
the thing right then they will read it was the limit of ten guys I think [oh]
[oh]
okay okay
ya that's why it's like a bit too intense for me [lah]
Muzmatch
(uh)
(mm)
[oh]

ya
ya
[oh]
[oh]
[oh] my god that's nice okay set I will go for half of our #deen# instead of Muzmatch
ya international love that's the way to go
but half of our #deen# also for muslim
[oh]
serious
Muzmatch no need to pay
[oh]
interesting
where were where is it from I heard it's from some dating apps also was it I'm not sure
so that they will match you to the right person like
I don't know what is it
do you pray [oh] okay
ya
[oh]
okay okay that's cool
interesting
but do you think you will bond to meet your significant other through a dating apps
I think
[oh]
ya
that's true
I know right
I like to observe the people first from afar
then see how is he like then I did like something that
(um) people other people opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instant if people around him keep saying that [oh] my god he is such a nice person and he does this this this then I will
be like [oh] okay since like he is kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya or else
ya that's true
[oh]
ya
that is so sad
ya
(hmm)
that is sad
[oh] well sometimes it works for people sometimes it does not
about putting themselves out there you know some people were saying that in unique
a lot of people also try their best to put themselves out there and you can see there's some people will be turned off by that right
[ah] that is true that is true
ya
ya ya it does
clap for me
ya ya that is scary
ya
I don't know whether it is still like that is it still like that
or maybe I just turn a blind eye on it it just like
but I think someone ask me this before
an outdoor person may I like to do outdoors things like
ya I feel like I told you this before no
I'm a outdoor person like I like to do outdoor things like
then probably an ideal date for me will be doing things somethings outdoor [lah] somethings like trekking [oh] my god I love trekking just like walking around because right
when I trek with my friends I we have we actually don't have a lot of things to do other than walking
and also like since it is quite silent sometimes you want to listen to the silence around you
and if you are trekking with your friends you will be comfortable with the silent so maybe you want to see whether there's ya comfortable with the silent with that guy
and also like (um) sometimes you also want to talk because trekking will be pretty long
so wouldn't want to stay quiet all the time so for instance if I want to go on a movie date
then I can't really talk to him I can't really get to know him right so if I was talk walking I can like
try to get to know him and like see how is he like
[ha]
tricky question don't know [eh] I feel like first date
and like subsequent dates I would want to go trekking
ya not bad not bad is that like too much
I have never dated people before so I wouldn't know what is too much
ya I feel that movie date is too much
because it's so intimate
ya and it's dark and it's scary like
what are you going to do
you never know
ya
ya exactly
but that's like another two hours it's too long
I don't know
I don't know how long
ya
do you also want to go trekking
then what is your first date
[oh] ya that's the point though if you can't accept me at my lowest there's no reason being
[oh] okay okay sure
few months okay
[oh] ya then the first [one] [eh]
[oh] my god that's sound fun actually I always wanted to go picnic
with someone like a significant other like I don't know
[ah]
[kan] like these few days people have been picnicking a lot
ya
lay flat lay is it ya flat lay
!wah!
that is so cute
ya I would want to end my date with sunset
so I am going to go home first but mostly that won't happen [lah]
ya
halfway halfway
like
they just went toilet
[oh] that is super rude though
ya
does that happen often though like you people just ghost
ya
ya
ya I pretty sure it's not
I'm on like a dating app you pretend to be someone else
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
ya
[oh]
maybe cause like he's still very young also so like I think eighteen nineteen it's pretty young so he doesn't really know what to do maybe I forgive him for doing that
because
ya like the first thing you already lie like you haven't even start anything you already lie that is so sad
[oh] okay
(uh huh)
ya
[oh] okay that's so fast but that's so cute too [lah]
interesting
[oh]
ya it sounds like an interesting concept
[oh]
ya
and everything because you only need the birth cert so at that point it was really a matter of
[ah]
[oh]
that's good I don't know
I don't know would you
no I don't think so
ya ya
it is important
I don't know [lah] you know the malay store malaysian drama or malaysian movies
ya isn't that like kind of the same thing also
(mm)
I used to think that I'm okay with my parents match making me but then now
nah I don't think so
[oh] I don't know I change
ya if I don't get married then it's fine [lah]
twenty five is quite early ya cause like in three years
ya [oh] my god
twenty five sounds like a good age
then now you're twenty two you haven't really get your shit together then like
three years to get your shit that's really too fast
ya I think like twenty five sounds okay if you already have a
ya
[a'ah] [a'ah] my friends also
at first I was like [ah] I want to move out I want to buy a house
at first I was like [ah] but I I want to move out I want to buy a house but I can't really apply for B_T_O right you know
ya
is it cause of the current resource
maybe they should like create an environment that is healthy for the future generation to live in then maybe we will consider to procreate
I mean if like the view if we can see the future being so messed up and everything right now are so messed up and like the systems [a'ah] and all that
if you want to have children would you want our future generation to suffer
ya and that's the thing
obstacles challenges you will go stronger [lah] and all those bullshits I was like that is such a sad life
[kan]
I mean like in other countries you will still be a minority too
multiculturalism whatever it is
I don't even know what that is
(uh huh)
ya but she's like [oh] okay

you just one way
ya have you watched enola

it's so jarring to us maybe but
which suits them perfectly
it's so sad
does he saying that it does not exist [oh] my god
ya
that's quite sad
then we should step up more so that there will be more representation
otherwise they wouldn't hear right really [meh]
even if I step up will they hear
do they want to listen in the first place
where is the empathy right
people's action
!hais!
ya like other countries aren't any better either
right right that's the thing right
then like okay fine I am very grateful for that but like
why like why are you comparing our country with other countries who are even not even on par with us like we are
I don't think we should just compare countries across countries like that
ya ya that's the thing
ya
like even if they allow us to wear is like there is still this line
which is sad like sure like he just like I told you to wear [what]
then like you still treat me so differently just because I wear a #hijab#
ya like what you think I don't deserve those rights only some people deserve the rights
[oh] my god why is everything so funny

[ah] im~ bad image like that [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
true true
okay then (err) let's see if (err) they are they are married already then after that (um) they they are not stable
both of them after O-levels maybe they don't want to work anymore I mean they don't want to school anymore so they took part time job then they feel like (oo) got so ma~ ma~ so much opportunity in this part time jobs so they want to grow from those part time jobs
[ah] but they're not stable yet [ah] like they still ya like don't have any plans yet for the future but they know they want to get married
like papers in papers like at eighteen I want to get married now

(mm)
ya he's the one that kind of thing [ah]
ya ya ya ya
true ya
ya
and you're already married anyway [kan]
[ah]
true
okay then it brings me to the next question
(uh) if let's say like (err) you you get into a relationship already [ah] then the guy is like I want to take it to the next level but you you're in a fresh relationship you know
what okay so
the the major question is like how long do you think is a good time until you should move on to the next step in life
ya time
[ah]
okay okay
(mm)
okay
play around you
(mm)
!huh!
they call it off for eight years' [oh]
eight years [oh] my the fact that you actually drop so easily [ah] the eight years
[ah]
[ah]
interesting ya
!aiya!
ease [sia]
[ah] I like I want to to settle down tie a knot you know start the family planning you know like
start my future [lah] you know
yes [sia]
(oo) !wah!
(mm)
true true okay [ah]
okay we are
next year is our third year [ah]
(mm)
true true
that's basic adult things [ah] adult marriage things you know ya like [oh] we have to save money to buy house you know that kind of thing
so I think that's what both our parents are looking at [ah]
but ya [lah] like what you say [ah] it can be on papers you know so that is not a sin for us to be together
(mm)
(mm)
true
I to me I ya I see it from that point of you [ah] to me [ah] because honestly being this old
but it's just that like you know older generation thinking I guess I don't know
but ya what do you think
true
ya [sia] actually true and it's workaholics
I mean people different (err) different mindset [lah] [ah]
(mm)
it's true [oh] my god that [one] that [one] is a major issue in singapore [sia] like money is such
money just plays a big part [eh] in singapore
okay [lah] I mean
okay #ang moh# (err)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
true ya ya ya okay [lah] it is
actually (err) okay when I was in U_S [kan] everything there was so slow
like I have to get in if not cannot [sia] late for (err) late for work you know that kind of thing
[ah]
[ah]
a lot of people coming in [ah] and I I feel like it's not stopping you see true I think a lot of people ya
ya dead rich but the point is like
(err) very late very like (um) she said that
singapore's (err) healthcare is the best
because singapore puts there are healthcare like one of the priorities of the country so I feel like (err) singapore is number one [lah] for healthcare
ya like a lot of people come to singapore like I saw a lot of people okay there's this [ah]
web for (err) what's that called
they come to singapore to get treatments ya so like (err) this [one] is cancer so they quickly come to singapore to get a treatment for cancer this [one] got tumour so you come to singapore do all this
and then another [one] is ya no [lah] I mean it's not that they do it but a lot people want to come to singapore to get that treatments because it's reliable
then (um) I don't know [lah] a lot of people just come to singapore just for healthcare
ya
no [oh] my god you know U_S U_S healthcare is so bad [lah]
is so bad
[ah] [ah] [ah]
I okay come on [lah] singapore is
(err) accessible okay like
got clinic here hospital is nearby in every (err) town area and then that kind of thing [ah] correct but in U_S if you live in the suburbs it's so hard to get to the hospital it's probably like one hour drive away
twenty minutes away thirty minute away that kind of thing
suburbs
who have a lot of land then they do like farming you know that kind of thing ya so it's those like with big plotted lands [lah] it's not necessarily like they are not rich
but it's just that they have a lot of land and they want to do a lot of things like farming you know that all that kind of thing that we cannot do in singapore [lah] basically
so ya there are okay [lah] as
they do have the land that's all that is the good thing about U_S they have land to do a lot of things but then sometimes they don't take
ya they don't take advantage of what they've been given [lah]
so
!oof!
ya [hor]
I believe singapore because like singapore I usually like if any land any
#bedok# jetty #changi# you know ya

a full loaf of bread and the top is cut
like like a like a hat it's like a hat like you take off the top
and then a pool of curry inside so it's like basically a loaf of bread with a hole inside and it's just curry

[oh] okay okay ya we tried the
steelers I think it was a local
burger joint but it was a
fast food
burger joint
ya

I felt
like not like basically not healthy you know what I mean like you can tell it's not a proper meal you know like I shouldn't be eating this that kind of thing
ya
I forgot but but it it didn't it didn't stay in my mind cause after that we tried steelers and I was like !wow! a whole new experience ya

(uh huh)
I think two three years
[oh] god
[a'ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]

(mm) was a thing it was a mixture of things
but it was interesting also
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
it's a different history and everything [lah]
different background
ya ya ya
(mmhmm) but it was interesting also to to experience that and sort of see the different variations I guess on the culture
is it #prata#
ya
(uh huh) (uh huh)
ya ya ya
!wow!
[oh] my god #bo-kaap# okay ya
(uh huh)
what does it look like

it was basically like
loaded in every ways
[ah]
ya
did we keep it for another day I feel like ya
[oh] gosh
[oh] shit
LOL
ya
ya
ya ya ya
ya ya that was too much for me cause ya
I remember eventually I was picking it apart like
ya ya
ya
ya ya ya
yes yes cause they couldn't
ya
ya
and that that was really what it felt like [what] if if anyone out there wants to know how it tastes it's rich
(uh huh) (uh huh) ya ya
[ah] ya the gatsby ya that's what it's called ya
gosh
we ate a lot of ro~ ya
yes
feel like that whole trip was a it was a whole lot of trial and error and just pure excitement on our part but at the end of the day it was a it was a great experience
we didn't do anything stupid that's the good thing
I mean it we did a lot of stupid things but nothing regrettable okay you know nothing like I go back and I'm like [oh] what did I do you know it was just [oh] we did a lot of weird stuff I guess
[oh] shit that was stupid
[ah]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
we are
ya ya ya
yup
(mm)
brain not functioning
(mmhmm)

(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
[a'ah]
[ah]
[ah]
it it was still a nice view nonetheless
yes
yes
you know right
[oh] it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go #bukit timah# hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
[ah]
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot
yes
[ah]
yes there there was five three G or four G I remember
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
yes
we
[ah]
it wasn't that bad I felt like the whole experience felt very
good like surreal
ya
[ah] [a'ah]
[oh]
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
[kan] that was an experience friend
(mm)
lion (uh huh)
[a'ah]
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
[ah] I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
!wah!
ya we went quite ya damn early
(mm) (mm)
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
[oh] we haven't went
cause I I like
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are
two zero
gosh
with a whole new list
like the other day I was talking to her her name is #amisyah# and she's like I was like #amisyah# I really feel that we go somewhere it's for you ya I feel like you will enjoy it as much as I think and then she's like I did thought about it and I feel like I belong
and I'm like okay put it in the to-do list okay
before we die
yes
but my my friend has a stable job so it's just me [lah] which is fine
!huh!
[oh] !wah! that was really an experience man
I was telling her about how you how we had one day specifically just to visit all the mosques
yes
I'm like natasha we will visit all the mosques
okay no ya I know as in
I was completely I don't mind it's just like I just telling her
[eh] do you know or not I actually visit the mosques one by one that was like the most holiest thing I've ever done in my life
I think
[oh] gosh
ya it was also quite near to one another ya
ya
ya and I feel like during the experience (err)
while walking we also sort of explored the region a lot yes I felt I felt it was a good tour
yes
like I felt there was also another another good experience though [ah] ya
ya we did walking tour
we backed out
ya cause we felt like we didn't we feel like what [ah] I feel like the guy did
did a lot of stuff it's just that I could have gotten information online
it wasn't I feel like I wasn't it wasn't adding value to my things I've already read up on the usual so ya
[oh] gosh I don't remember (mm)
ya
[oh] gosh that was a lot of experience
food wise in terms of like which part the safari
ya
three weeks it was like three weeks but the three weeks we felt like packed so much information didn't feel like three weeks we felt like more than
ya it felt so long
[a'ah]
(uh)
ya
ya and then ya and then the weekend trip the the field trip is like forever you know they tell you we going on a field trip
takes like three hours to get there it was it's a completely different town
that kind of thing cause it's a big country but ya
ya ya
the field trip is like it's like hi we're going to the beach then like in singapore if I say to that you think of E_C_P like east coast park over over there is like we're going to the beach and there are
actual penguins at the beach
like it was whole new thing
that ya
like I feel like whoever planned that whole school summer program really deserve a raise man
yes yes but I feel like it was money well-spent
ame~ american ya
ya ya ya ya
[a'ah] [a'ah] [a'ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
yes
ya
ya ya ya
ya
a lot of seafood [lah] I remember seafood

that ostrich
farm okay we were at the ostrich farm okay so we knew very well that the ostrich came from breeding purposes like it wasn't a random ostrich shop down the road kind of thing
you know ya
yes
ya
but ya and then we had what else
[a'ah]
(mm)
I don't okay not puberty you know when you're eighteen you do a lot of stupid shit it's like that ya like like that part where you

ya ya ya
ya
different school but we can trust them cause same land
yes
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yes
(mm) (mm) (mm)
yes
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[ah] ya avoid like we try to keep a distance ya
to spend time with him especially for activities that he need to pair up
a good trip for everyone and I feel like that was that was a good move on all our parts you know
cause I feel like even though the boy like
I mean
ya it's a bit questionable but I mean whatever [lah] [ah] after that we didn't keep in touch so whatever
it's okay we we did our part we did our our community service for the day community service
I feel like
I feel like we did good you know
like it's like [eh]
it's like it's a it's a good looking back !wow! matured
are you serious
but ya that was a really really fun trip I feel
(mmhmm)
[oh] gosh the kayaking
ya I remember I was I was really genuinely scared for my life
like I I really could have a panic attack if he just
(uh) gosh ya
(um)
the cave
the cave
your favourite
is it what you talk
(uh huh)
ya ya ya
ya
you guess that
ya ya ya
god damn it
!hais!
a time to be alive
what else did we do over there
I feel like okay I feel like
the trip was was a fun trip [lah] if I had to look back at the things that I've (uh) did in life I feel like that that will be one of my highlights
yes the highlight reel
before right before I die right
this is what you did
yes that's exactly
us getting stuck in the you and your getting stuck in the cave and all that right
gosh
that was an experience
okay
then what else
ya let's see another prompt
I want to learn how to draw
ya
ya I want to draw
cause I can't draw
it's a certain skill [lah] that's already been presented to me a certain level of expectations of how an artist
should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level [ah]
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
(err) art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my (uh) colouring skills
cause that's also (uh) colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
(mmhmm)
what about you
just one [ah]
can
[oh] !wow!
yes that's the way
okay
I [ah] I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
!wow!
[a'ah]
[oh] !wow!
kind of what
okay
(uh huh) [ah]
ya it will
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh) yes
did they die
[oh] gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so (uh) what else
two more skills
for me (um) other than drawing
(mm)
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember [ah] my dear friend #wen xing# were walking at this
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
[oh] shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak [eh] and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming [lah] ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point [ah]
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think !wah! it's like !wow! this girl really spend a lot of money to go #krabi# when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to #krabi#
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical (uh) suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her [eh] I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like [eh] shit she got kidnapped I die [sia]
seven P_M like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like (uh) if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping [lah] so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have [lah] but ya I also like (uh) and then my friend was also (uh)
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in #krabi# there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then (err) this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
#nadi# stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like [eh] shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is #vishu#
I'm like #vishu# we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with #vishu# is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over [oh] I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there [eh] no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
(uh) the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
[ah] cause (err)
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
(err) I a few people have #jio# me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya [lah]
ya ya ya
ya
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
more you already say live one another alone
ya ya !wah! I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain !wah! that [one] was another [one] cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
(err) I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time [ah] my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear #vishu# looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry #nadi# I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay #vishu# is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
(mmhmm)
but I remember that
it wasn't that long [lah] it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe (err) buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
but ya that was the only thing [lah] I was just like !whoa!
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next [eh] not not country
and then I remember in the beginning it was [ah] there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause [ah] they
they had other plans [lah] okay
ya
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
[a'ah]
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try [lah] like I don't know she will like says [ah]
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure [eh] maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it [lah] cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember [ah] ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like !wah! their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay [oh] I remember
and then I ask #vishu# then why you #jio# and then #vishu# was like you know I okay with travelling with everyone I always travel with you [mah] then I'm like shut up [lah] don't compare me to her but it's
ya that was it but that was a fun trip I had a lot of fun I was talking to #vishu# the other day we need to go somewhere else like after this border closed like this border thing
ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where [ah] ya #krabi# and vietnam with her
it's [oh] ya we keep saying we want to go somewhere malaysia nearby cause (uh) our our clique is actually with this two other like one of this (uh) basically the two of them they have a a very (uh) (err)
tight-knit families
who are unsure if they travel too far
so we were saying since you guys have limitations so might as well just go malaysia [lah]
ya
[oh] ya
gosh [oh] ya and I was talking to my
other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia
cause it's nearby but there's also a lot of places to visit there ya a lot of people don't know about what ya they just didn't do marketing very well like there's technically a lot of places to go to so ya
(mmhmm)
ya that's the thing
[a'ah]
okay
alright so how one two three one
of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her [ah]
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
that guy [ah] then that eventually
(um)
living off from her wealth
was actually very very very
(um)
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama [ah]
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage [ah] because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
(uh) you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this (uh) phrase
ya
but
(uh) they got divorce but then
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
(um)
she like restrained herself
in this kind of thing again [ah] drama again
ya
(mm)
but then I heard that
I mean [lah] I don't know cause #Syamsul Yusof# has always been
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love [what] like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella

but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
ya
but
people private affairs [seh]
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
relationship I mean
ever since primary school secondary school and J_C days
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex [ah] my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell (um)
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students [seh] but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that [seh] and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
so traditional
I don't know [lah]
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
!huh! it's not it it's not
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
mas~ master or what
no [lah] sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then [oh] ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
don't know
[oh] my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay [lah] whatever you young but never mind [ah]
but she cannot handle the team well [seh]
I remember she just graduated from R_P and then she was
looking
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums [seh]
I remember so many people vomited [ah]
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what [eh] I remember she do the stupid like
(err) push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six A_M just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know [ah]
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
(err) the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports C_C_A until
soccer S_P right
[eh]
(uh) I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop [seh]
and like I I feel it's not normal
!huh!
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
help to
discipline us and make us stronger [ah]
but actually it's quite bad [seh] it's like you're not healthy you know
ya
anyway what kind flowers do you like

so that bothers you [ah]
(mm)
I see
don't know I also like you like fifty fifty

hard to take in a stranger into your home and make it a home for them
you know what I mean

I also hate children

like take seven of them

[oh] okay [lah] true [lah]
that time I got go one at Indonesia [kan]
it's like
they are living in the wild which is really good I love I love animals to live in the wild you know
but I feel that they're not being fed enough
cause the food is depending on the tourists
then the tourists will give them food
what if they hungry then they eat the tourists
I just scared for the animals

why
I shall begin it tomorrow my hair

(uh) I see the steps
I know it's not really that disappointment as my previous hair treatment
but I don't know how long it will last

owe a vehicle
the cheapest is about sixty thousand [eh]

then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive
then they said that maybe getting a condo
is better than getting a H_D_B at this rate
cause of the facilities
and like condos [kan]
most of them the new ones are built near like
you got see (uh) is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the M_R_T
and it looks really good
ya
ya
it's small
but ya you win some you lose some
I think condos right the small small ones is like suitable for those that is like living alone or with just a partner you know
but if you have a family then maybe the executive condos or something [ah] if you're rich
in like the richer side of Singapore
it's like !whoa! living the K drama life [seh]

actually that's really messed up that's really messed up you know the fact right that all
all th~ most of the
toilet recording all the most of the toilet recording incidents right
all happened [ah]
like you know
is most of them right that make the news [ah] is all
it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in N_T_U you know then (err)

then (err) but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago [ah]
because I sleep in school
so (uh) and
my friends they also know they also know this [ah]
most of the it's
and some more it's in N_T_U you know how embarrassing
no [lah] but
no [lah] but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in N_T_U you know shit
no
but then again but but then again but then again
(err) most of the
(err) most of the incidents takes pl~ (err) take place in [ah]
whereas the places where I
patron right (err)
the toilets where I go to [ah] they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they (uh) most of them
(err) some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge [ah]
I'm not too sure about this [lah] I can't confirm but
there are some right where
(err)
I think this [one] also depends on the price of your accommodation [ah]
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
so
(err)
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
so the guy actually (err) took I still remember you (err) he had the
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I ente~ I entered [ah] so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
(err)
you know that like single floor toilet [ah]
it's just a
it com~ commune toilet [ah] communal toilet [ah] that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why [lah] people
(err) those #pervs# right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense [ah]
(um) there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a C_C_A
second if you don't have a C_C_A you need to (uh) (err)
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame [ah] (err) that's lame [lah] (uh) I
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but cu~ currently it's no longer the case already like
(uh) for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you [ah]
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know C_C_A and then sweat your punk ass
and then (err) like or hall activities [ah] like
!yay! sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey [ah] it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time (err)
(err) they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts [ah]
so they had I swear to you [ah] it was really cringey
(err) they had those like (err) orientation games [ah] then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they (uh) like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey [lah]
who the hell is running man
who is running man
I have no idea who the hell that is
maybe it's just me [lah] [ah] probably it probably is [lah] just me but
until now I still don't get

#wei xiang# two hundred range I_Q
!hais! [oh] my gosh
your friends right your friends are like
extra retarded [ah] for real
so joe rogan
that ethics of becoming an Instagram model
is there anything ethical is is there an ethical aspect right to being an Instagram model
because Instagram after all right is just a page where you put photos
I mean ultimately ultimately right when it when it boils down to the you know like
common denominator type thing [ah]
it's just a web page it's just a page where you see photos
so is there and ethical ground right behind being an a model on Instagram
like what what constitutes ethics [ah] in
Instagram modelling like what you you have to
I mean like what like what you
be you you be super hot you take a photo right of you being hot right around starving africans
is that ethical
wait which one was it
no
probably because you didn't feed it to me
lies lies okay anyways
so is the sister the sister is
wai~ wait what okay fine ya okay ya ya
[oh] okay okay wait hold up hold up so
technically right technically he
he didn't he didn't flash
in a sense right in a sense right
he advertised himself right as he
he try to proposition for
se~ [ah] for sex right for minors
from minors right with
by
know using using his fame [ah] not with paper [ah]
[oh] really
come with me in my videos
who is him #dee kosh#
would you want to know #dee kosh#
why not
so wait this is what gay privilege
[oh] wait hold up that amber re~
!huh! which finger
okay then
Tesla guy
the elon musk okay fine then
but to begin with right does he do~ does he even know right that
those people are minors or not the his victims right
wer~ did he know that they were minors
okay
if that was the case right my question is
who are the people right who empower #dee kosh#
where does #dee kosh# derive right his fame from YouTube right who empowers him
is the youth of today
why
because right we're easily swayed we're easily we're easily swayed right by stupid shit
by simple stupid shit
to begin with also right
that's it
am I right to say am I right to say I can't remember what's the author's name [ah] (err) am I right to say right that
(err) the person who wrote catcher in the rye right
(err) the person in the catcher who wrote catcher in the rye right is a influencer
because he influenced the guy to go and assassinate the presi~ the kennedy
you know kennedy ya
[ah] [ah] okay [oh] my goodness ya john lennon ya
to influence them to do what
okay

okay so I'm natasha and
!whoa!
the part ya ya ya before we hit the seven mark
yes you break the contract then bye bye
there goes the documentary that we've been planning
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
my most memorable meal
I don't have
[oh]
sometimes I still think about the #bunny chow#
right
ya I know like legit
so ya we had the #bunny chow# in
south africa cape town
and it is just
and that was great
why was it great [ah] I it was butter chicken it wasn't curry
[oh]
(mm)
poof
ya
is memorable right I think it's like the
ya and the area we were at was like
and I think it was also cause like maybe we were hungry
so that explains why
when when we are hungry everything tastes great and
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
[oh] ya the customer ya
(err) I did we eat at another place after that I was I'm pretty sure
ya
I try to remember
ya
the burger right
what did you order from McDonald's I can't remember
yet
that was still much better no I think
cause we were given only [ah] ketchup packet at the particular McDonald's and clearly cause number one
malay number two
prefers spicy stuff
everything they had was like just not
not good enough okay
ya no McSpicy no nothing so of course we'll be like okay fine we try the local McDonald's but
ya so I took out the chili packet
next to the tomato ketchup packet then I'm pretty sure they were like someone was like where did this chili packet come from
just another day
I feel like we finish the chili packet on that one day right
everything we wanted we wanted chili chili
I think like we ate too much but
[oh]
(mmhmm)
it was basically
right
ya we ate #samosa#
[kan]
[kan] something like that
I think I I remember I took a photo
we went there twenty seventeen
three years
so I think there was
it was the thing
ya
ya
and cause of the slavery and all that and colonialism so a very different malay food [lah]
(mmhmm)
remember then we went to the shady okay not shady I'm so sorry but like the well-to-do neighbourhood and then we drove next to the train
then after you were like #nata# got train then I want to look but I'm driving
and then got the people waving from the train and then you were like #nata# look at there but I was driving
no it's not is it a #pani#
and then and then they tell us you wanna you want to half or you want the full and then I think then we so stupid we said full
loaded
ya there was fries there was (um) meat there was what cheese
of the full and then we were like ya one one (uh) beef one chicken so we got the full two full of the loaves right
and then we brought back and then we ate
and then we couldn't even finish
and then we
we ate like we continue
ya we can keep for the next day but we have no microwave
and and it was winter
you remember
[a'ah]
not
[a'ah]
ya
so we had
so like I think for lunch and dinner [tau] we ate lunch and dinner we ate that [one]
half
of course we won't we we spend much money on that
the next day for breakfast
[kan]
and then
ya and then like for someone like you also who can eat a lot also even that was like too much don't want to eat
ya cause the even the half right the half of that
I remember like I remember like why why this food came about was cause the food was for slaves back then right
ya then like it's just the one meal for that one day
like (mm)
cape town and they also [oh] it's called the gatsby
right gatsby ya so ya then the person also eat the gatsby
ya
but then I think like [oh] my gosh
think that was memorable in a fact that we couldn't finish
to be fair they tried to warn us
(err) speaking of anything stupid
that trip
yes
ya I don't know it's like there there's stupid thing was one of the things
[ah] we wanted to climb a hill it was called signal hill something like that so we took a Grab there
ya I remember we were quite sleepy ya and then
(um) the spot but it also seems like the spot cause it it just like the bot~ it's just the entrance of a
[ah]
and then it was almost at the top like I think like ten minutes before we reach the top that we realised that we were not climbing a hill but the actual mountain
and it was like
we should have seen this coming but also why was that man jogging
is it like same concept as #bukit timah# hill
ya and
it was quite high like
[ah] in fact yup it was challenging
and
there was ladders there was ropes and you had to climb the rocks like a big rock
and I remember thinking while we were there I like I kept asking you right like are we sure this is the hill and then we were like [eh]
maybe their hills are like this
and then we reach like almost ten minute maybe five ten minutes before we reach the top
then we realised we can actually use our phones
so we googled
we I think no I think I look at Google map like where the heck are we and then Google map showed that we were on lion's head mountain and then we were like what and then we googled lion's head mountain and then we reached and then by the time we reached the peak already and then we saw the sign lion's head mountain peak six hundred is it metres six hundred or something metres above water
ya
ya
and
ya
surreal
ya
ya I remembered that
that so stupid
so we entered the wrong entrance [lah] basically the the Grab driver confident thought we wanted to climb the freaking mountain
and I also think
hiking stick
I think they were tourists also
ya and they were clearly ready they had water bottle
ya no the first thing we did was get a Grab go back to go back to our place drink water
ya
what a morning
what time did we leave we leave the house I think six or five five or six
and think we went back like eleven right
ya we we rested for like one two hours I think so
the city
we we climb the mountain
okay to be fair our view was very good also
ya okay
[ah] that that's the plan [ah] that's the plan ten years down the road
so
two zero two seven
return to cape town
we fi~ we find a life there right
before we die when we finally get employed
!hais!
you told her
okay but to be fair I told you you can have done your own things
what
cause of my mum right she wanted to donate all the mosques
[eh] but to be fair right we hit we hit up all the mosques
like it was quite surprising that there was
ya and then like cause it's also like
like basically we were just exploring the city [lah] cause we hit one end to the other end to the other end
it was all walking distance right
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
ya even though it was basically just to deposit money
I know we did like
we we bail out
[ah] what else
okay how about we start with food
we we went there for the exchange and the exchange for like a few weeks right ya
(um) south africa
and then the field trip the accommodations my god
[ah] the my god is a very good my god not like a bad
I mean to be fair they took all our money also
I mean safari we imagine I'm assuming people will imagine like flat lands and lions which we did
ya
so in terms of the safari let's see what what food I just want to think about the food
[oh] ya I think cause we were at the coast
[ah] yes the ostrich
we were at a ostrich farm
ya
so the meat that we ate were the ostriches we saw that day in the afternoon then we ate their brother
ya
no particularly memorable food per say
[ah] [ah] [ah]

I mean you don't have to you don't have to have a car to have licence it's just a life skill
for convenience sake I can rent cars you know the blue car S_G is it
it's cute [lah] I kind of like it
(uh) they say is cheaper than normal than owning status as the
ya I'm not sure [lah] but this is singapore right

you know the other day I contacted my friend because she does this like sugaring thing
I don't know why when help you wax the other day it hurts so bad it's like so bad you know my skin was like and
I think cause you didn't put properly I don't know or maybe is (uh) type of wax
cause the last time I bought is the sensitive
sen~ sensitive [one]
what if I smack you so you don't
excuse me you also use my brushes okay
you use everything I have
you use my mascara you use my serums you use my moisturiser
when you go to buy lip balm also you use
[eh] did you see where is the sunscreen
I think it's fine I guess
shut up
but sometimes they have like the floral ones you can look aunty but you can also look like nice depends
like ya
[eh] long time no see bro how are you bro
[oh] you working as a steward is it I heard last time when I saw you at facebook
!wow! six months [eh]
so (uh) what's your favourite country
serious [ah]
saudi arabia
(mm)
and then they have a lot of (uh) weapons (uh)
a lot of things [ah] so I don't really trust
spain
but how do they earn when there's no spectators cause I think that's a huge sum of money where they can get [kan] cause you pay then a lot of people watching the football so how they can earn their money besides the sponsors [ah]
!wow! so they really suffer [eh] so all industry are affected by this [eh]
give you all these grants give you all this money but in the end they will take it back I mean technically is like a business
but then I decided that you know (uh) I don't think I can last in that line
I'm more interested in the healthcare industry since [ah]
you know my my poly days I I took that course right healthcare and management so I thought maybe I would just venture into into this line and then if this COVID thing going on
and I have to do a lot of things admin stuff but still (uh) no choice [ah] what to do [kan]
ya so these things are are the same [ah] so at the at the first few months these swabbers they will earn a lot of money and then now I heard that they
in fact they don't [ah] allow any swabbers anymore cause there's too much
even the doctors are doing it by themselves so
now they are encourage people to volunteer for for to become a swab~ swabbers
but as a clinic assistant [ah] I can tell you it's actually pretty safe [ah] cause you're fully protected you're under the P_P_E the uniform
(mm)
people who try to work as grab food deliveries [eh]
times are hard so they will
they would they manage to sacrifice their dignity [eh]
I think [ah] then still I mean I wouldn't say dignity [ah] I mean that that job is you can earn quite a lot if you know how to play the game well [lah] I would say
(mm)
bro that [one] I think really depends on on the family that you're living with [ah] if you are living with your parents and then I mean that should be fine cause all of you are working if your parents are working as well or if they don't then you have to support them but if you are living with
know children and then your wife that's pretty tough though
then both of you are working then should be okay [ah]
you know
[ah] have a lot of kids for our parents you know
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's true though
(um) actually depends on the expenses that you are
having then
ya but I I worry [ah] if in the future I mean now especially with the COVID situation
I I think (err) the new families are more worried to even have children
they will definitely get it back
despite the circumstance that we are in
bro mine I think around six hundred plus [ah] cause I have a siblings in the house [kan]
and if you living in a big house
a lot more family members you know
and then you use a lot of electricity or water
then if you have little you have low wages for I mean as as parents then it's really difficult [lah] for you to sustain
so and I think a lot of people are now hustling their way [ah] I mean legit especially I mean
grab food delivery riders out there you see a lot of people are trying their best working day and night
my I cannot really imagine [ah] but for now I I think I'm in the comfort zone so
sooner or later I think I really need to hustle [ah] if not if I don't have any savings for now still then in the future I'm not gonna rise [ah]
exactly
I think [ah] a lot of
things are affecting them
you know especially when it's you know you you've been quarantined inside the house
you you know some people say it's a blessing
cause you get to meet a lot of family members but (err) you forget to look on the other side of the coin where
if your family members are more aggressive
are more violent in a way so they are more trapped they are more stressed
and then they might hurt
the other family members [ah] so it's quite
quite a sad thing to hear
and then (err) you know
having to lose their jobs
you know all these stressful matters will definitely affect their mental health [ah] so that's why I think especially if you know if you have a lot of debt
so that's why I think most of them or some of them decided to kill themselves [lah] cause they cannot take it already [what]
and then so this why all these things [ah] need to to be considered but I think everyone is suffering in their own way so we really have to make do [ah]
these things this [ah] period will go away
we just have to stay on and pursue and not give up [ah]
we
suffer bro
(mm)
(mm) true [ah] true
I think it's only important besides you know hustling for the money you also have to take care of our health [ah] legit
mental health physical health also
if you only focus on your work you can get sick
so it's really hard it's we are living in a hard time so we really have to you know our priorities
and to make sure it's it is well-balanced [ah] ya and it's it's easy to say but
you have to make do [ah] with whatever we can we have to change our schedule change our lifestyle for the time being [ah] no choice bro this is the hard time [ah] then
I really hope that this thing will go away [ah] seriously
ya of course bro
(mm)
(mm) true true I agree [ah]
but [ah] I'm not sure if there's any difference cause right now
(um) with this situation going on
(err) people who's been living
so I think is very difficult for those who are
[ah] who are well-off [ah] as compared to those who who who has been living (err)
but this is their difficult times
but what you think of trump personally like do you know that the the way how he conduct the country how he see people I I heard that he's islamophobic I mean cause we are muslims [kan] what what do you what's your take on that
ya islamophobia
[oh]
cause what they are doing is is basically cruel I mean and I think the whole world is against it or most of the countries I would say even america or the united states [eh] the U_K [ah] ya (uh) the whole
you know simply cause they are
they are number one in the business
and they are controlling everything
I'm not I'm not
ya it it's so sad and so sick [ah] to be honest
yet the other countries are not I I don't think they are putting enough effort to stop their whatever they are doing [ah] I think it's it's too much [ah] to be honest
but like like like what I've said [ah] I think it's cause of the power that they are holding
you know in the business [ah] sector that's why (uh) most countries do not dare to to make any actions against them [ah]
it's ironic [ah] we we study history and yet we we are doing nothing for the future to change what has happened to the past
we just repeating the same old thing you know wars
concentration camps and it's
it's it's just I don't know I don't see any change [ah] to be honest it's just
it's all about politics business
you know everyone wants to win a game and no one is really thinking about you know (err) what's ethically and morally right for everyone you know not just for the people who's in power
(mm)
[oh] that that's
that's an~ another actually interesting (uh) news [ah]
the this black people they black people [kan] you know they have been living in america for so long
they have been going through a lot
you know especially with all those [ah] big (uh) big leaders last time (err) like #muhammad ali# the famous boxer and then
they still do not see
the black people as
as american which is quite
I don't know [ah] I don't understand what
you know it's it's it's
it's just a colour [kan] why the whites feel so superior about it
I mean I may I may I may sound biased [lah] but it's it's the fact that whenever whenever you open the twitter or facebook you see all these injustice going on and I'm not saying there's no injustice between the black community itself [ah] but
it's just unfair [ah] cause the whites are just taking over and then they are taking advantage as much as they can just cause they are white
I mean it's stupid [ah]
(mm)
perform [ah]
I mean you just see one george floyd but you never know in other streets in other places where how how did they treat other black people they make it they may be killed silently without us knowing
without us being seen on the video clip without being recorded
so it's really I think it's the the the police system in america is just so
screwed-up and corrupted [lah] in in all aspects and this is just one side of it and the world whole world goes crazy
how the black people really feels to be
to be looked down upon
to be castrated and to be really being to take advantage of [ah] in all aspects even in their lives their lives doesn't really matter [tau] so it's really sad [ah]
ya
(err)
rules applied in our countries so that we we know how to
are are very strict with these rules so if you can see in facebook or twitter
if you can see any people that get recorded for being racist
the police will come down as fast as they can and then really resolve the matter [ah]
but it's really but the offence is really high I heard that's why you can't be racist
too overwhelming to a extent where it's
speaking of which
it's also I think it's it's really the privileges [ah] [eh] in singapore but I think the privileges in malaysia and singapore is is different [ah]
ours is more like a soft privileges for the other race
and then for malaysia it's really the obvious privileges for the malays [ah]
but (um)
ya when you look at these malaysians [eh] they
despite all the privileges that they have especially the malays [kan] they they are quite complacent with
with the how
things are going on with the politics or how the government run the country
or
but I think before they I mean they I I think when they want to become the minister they had good intentions but (uh)
but then ya [lah] you know
when they are when they have the power it's again it's all about the power you know the the greed they have all these then they
their intentions changed
they changed [ah] in terms of controlling
and then they you know they do all these kind of bad things [ah] which doesn't really aff~ [ah] help the citizens so I think they they have lost their paths the correct paths
ya (mm)
[eh] I I actually agree [seh] cause [ah] when I when I watch [ah] the parliaments in malaysia [eh]
actually quite #jialat# [eh] like they the way they is not really ethical and it's just very chao~ chaotic inside the
the room that they are having
and then I'm pretty sure there's (err) a person in-charge [kan] to control how the situation is like when you know the arguments get escalated
or when they have their points viewed ya they want to really you know press the other people then they should really have a someone to control [ah] to make to make sure that the thing is in control but then
ya speaking of which (err) I I got saw this one video
where all the malaysia parliaments
he
he can't even in proper english which I think that should be one of the basic (uh)
basic (err)
[ah] basic skills to perform when you are presenting to the other people from other countries [kan] cause you are representing you're representing your country [what]
then he cannot even speak
english
simple english perhaps
it's it's it's if if if you found it the the video on youtube I think you will laugh [ah] which to me I find it very very [ah] interesting cause how can someone
(err) who is representing his country coming from the parliament cannot even speak proper english
how do they decide on who should be the in-charge
to take the degree for you or you fake a degree and not get caught by it
I think (uh) it's a lot of mysteries happening in malaysia [eh] you can get away with all these things
(um)
how the malaysians are handling their
their their their
(mm)
[ah] that's true [eh] I I I been to malaysia a couple of times for leisure purposes [lah] [eh] but I really like despite how I I really admire my country
and how they govern the country with the rules and the laws but I just feel that
I don't know [eh] I feel like if I were to live in malaysia I'll be more happier in a sense [ah] but speaking of I mean in regards to your question [ah] [kan]
spend more things over there as compared to singapore you can't really spend that much you have to pay the bills and everything [kan] so
it's not that (err)
ya I I probably will work in singapore and then I would live in malaysia
it takes a lot of risk I mean I would say there's a small sacrifice [ah] and then probably (err) you know
get a holiday or something to really enjoy if I really want to you know
to enjoy my holidays [ah]
so [ah] I I think there's risk if you're living in singapore or malaysia
so I mean I will see how it goes [ah] I really don't know how to go about this
but definitely
having to live in singapore and been to malaysia before I really think I would suit
living in malaysia [ah] cause I think the lifestyle there is much more peaceful and much more fun
just feel that if I were to live in malaysia I can do a lot more things
especially when you have the money [ah]
(mm)
(um) how you upgrade yourself [lah] as a person
and if you really
have a good job
and have a good career
or you can do a lot of things [ah] doesn't mean you have to live in malaysia to live happily
ya I think these these these things is really about I think in singapore and malaysia also about education [ah] or anywhere else in other countries
as long as you have good education have a good job then you will live a happier life
(err) ya it's tough [ah] but I think overall still again it's all about balance [ah] if you study and work hard and doesn't really care about yourself you will eventually you know don't don't live happily [ah] which which is not the goal that you would want to pursue I guess
serious [ah]
I I think it's (uh) I don't know how how to say this but
maybe we we we have seen the wrong side of the internet
we just see what cause if you realise
these are the people who want attention so they will post this kind of things and then we cause we live on the social media a lot so we tend to think that this is the trend but maybe
(mm) ya true I I think as a man we should lead
we should we should show that we are
we are the ones who are able to provide
and then not the ones who
to to seek help to I mean I'm I'm not saying in the sense that we we all should
should really [ah]
I mean I I I understand that some people some (um)
relationships they work equally I know they both hustle and they both help each other despite
I think as a man we should be the ones who
to represent [ah] the relationship and should provide and to make sure that we are the ones
are there emotionally financially for our partner [ah]
we can't rely too much on our partner cause I don't know I think this is a culture that has been set
legit you want to see your son being fed and you want to pay the bills you have to work [ah] you have to sacrifice that small portion
for your child for that love in order for them to grow [ah]
I think you have to find ways on how you can make do
all the missing time that you have (uh) have with your child [ah]
they
they have they they have maids to take their child
for some other cul~ other races they maybe they ask the grandparents to
to take care of the child so there's a bit of the bond family bond there [lah] I guess
but ya I think it that that part it's it's it's it's sad [lah] but we have no choice [lah] we are living in a country where
money is our priority [ah] over love [ah]
unless I think rare cases where you are living and you're having a good career
a good paying job
at the same time you can meet your
you can have the bond with your child with your son or daughters
but then again it's all about really the the time [ah] you have to make sacrifices [ah]
we have to make do with what we can [ah] no choice
so really [ah] it's really about up~ upgrading ourselves make sure you you have proper planning
and make sure you can provide [ah]
(uh) both partners know what to do both partners know what are their responsibilities
and then we can grow
it's all priorities [ah] [eh]
okay bro
alright
alright bro see you around bro
bye
(mm)
(mm) because
and having a lot of money
or like when I want to buy something that I like
then the second one I think I want my own transport
[oh] best part is
but I since I already
the travel you know
ya then the third one
I want to have like
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
so what about you
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
talking about family gathering
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
so
I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait [lah] for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
then
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like
no [lah] we put that aside first then we
chalet
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food [lah]
forever food and our transportation
like
share among us
book out already [kan] so okay [lah]
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
[kan] celebration also need more money
decoration need money also
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
party together like that
(um) you know that a
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mm)
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
ya [lah] marina is nice [lah]
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one (uh) one place where I know
outdoor [pe]
cause that time when I went (uh) to marina
(uh) I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there [ah]
so
we
parasol whatever [lah]
[ah] splash [lah]
like
but still like nice because
I think I think our cousin have I think [ah] I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still (uh) that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
[oh]
ya ya this one [ah]
(mm) nice we can go this kind
(mm)
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
they let us
(mm)
I not sure later after this we can google [ah] whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
we confirm know we won't sleep [what]
[oh] nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle [lah]
(mm)
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
cyc~ ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate [eh]
pek~ no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad [ah]
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade [lah] no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
!whoa! okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before [ah] but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
(mm)
what about glove
for rental [lah]
(mm)
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want [ah]
what if people really got like
pee on it or what !eww! but ya still !ee! okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
like
what's more that yo~ that you can do over there
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
(mm)
that's why I say but okay [ah] okay [ah] it's a nice idea

go out like normally

they from east side bring all the drinks and chips
so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
then we need one mineral water confirm

(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
[orh]
[ah]
what I mean is
(mmhmm)
so they will put everything inside only [what]
[ah] so I felt that it's more cleaner like that no
okay maybe for us ya but maybe not for them [lah]
(mm)
(mm) (mmhmm)
take out everything
open all the cans put inside one bowl
ya
so then after that
if we buy the one with the crust then we ask them to cut the crust
which is nice [ah]

sugar and butter together inside
melted butter
mushroom ball [ah] mushroom ball is nice
(hmm)
[kan] that's nice
(mm)
we going glamping !yay!
ya
ya like the normal picnic right ya
ya
(mmhmm)
but we tell them already [what] from from like
and before that we also need to talk about and about the gift right
so
(uh) if you want talk about the gift then I think everyone need to fork out about ten to twenty dollars
I don't know I don't know if it's better for us to fork out ten to twenty dollar each
for both of them or it's better to just buy whatever
we're gonna spend a lot of money there
(mm)
(mm) okay [ah] nice
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] and I think we should have a
colour code

I think our plan like nice already don't need to change
so later we make a whatsapp group right and then we talk about them we can just
(uh) tell all the plans from A to Z nice
but no black
!huh!
forbidden
okay [ah] nice nice
I'm planning to lik
two [lah] because the (um) the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle [lah] early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before [lah] [ah
(err) so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
(err
so it doesn't make sense [lah] to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
[ah] the one definite [lah
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take [lah] bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first [lah] it's either my side or his side [lah
so that's why the the the budget is a concern [lah
(um
[oh] it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
!chey!
(err) they have catering they have decoration with including the (err) plumbing also and then (err) they include the door gift
and then (err) tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just A_V and D_
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford [lah] if I cannot commit to tha
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off [mah] so like (err) very proud you know finally you know somebody (err) my my child is getting married or whatever but the
!alah! they don't know the the cost to get tha
(err) there's no need for any vehicle [lah] I mean there's only just need one way [lah] just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
[ah] that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that [ah] want to get ready just go dow
burning hair to think of i
I suggested to my mum [lah] like come [lah] to meet me and give me advice [lah
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic [kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity [kan] because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
but then because is they have to top up more s
(uh) manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west [lah] so (uh) it's not a location that is suitable for wedding [lah] it's more to like education wis
[ah] so (err) they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so (um) no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
[ah] so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that (uh
became because of that also one good thing [lah] I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore (err
ya [lah] the week after the wedding [lah] she will do that means like I think mayb
within december [lah] she'll she'll do honeymoo
it'll take about like a yea
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know [lah] as usual pay me but then
the groom side is giving a gift [lah] to the bride side is i
is it (err) [oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
ya ya true dare to it y
(err) so is there a magazine is through Facebook [lah] so this lady was cheated and (um) you know I jus
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
that's the thing [lah] and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically [kan] you need to have okay [ah] for example like that that that particular location at orchard (err) it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that [oh] if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people [lah] ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course [lah] about thirty dollar plus plus and then [leh] I compared those tw
they only offering two then drinks also is like [oh] asia's (err) hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company [lah] not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then (uh) there was one time (err) the package includes brida
you compared the price of each [eh] to a brida
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
(um) we will only book one event for one da
[oh] so this one is (um) actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding [kan
tru
(um) but again I thin
ya that one agree but I think H_D_B give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
[oh] ya [lah] that one I think normal [lah] since my time many years ago also same also [lah] the thing ya so I think (uh) ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for H_D_B [lor] at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least [lah
[oh] because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
(mm) I think I think in this case [ah] I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like [ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
more fundamental [lah] but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya #gemod# [lah] #gemod# is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know (uh) his side [ah
hundred fifty ya [seh] hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise [lah] it's lik
like okay in that case we do separate [lah] that is another alternative [ah] other alternative then your side then [ah] then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech [oh] !wah! like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
(uh) bottom line you both must tel
(err) got two choice if want to combine the
then (err) you and #hairin# you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
extra guest whereas for his (uh) no need then you [leh] you just you just invite [lah] whoever that is important between your lis
(err) then is like you al
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say [ah
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
then after that I think (um) at that tim
we buy some things on our sid
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all [lah] ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually (um) pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then af~ okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push [ah] you no need to type [ah] you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes [ah] food [ah] food dishe
you will you will see like [ah] how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
(uh) tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of [eh] (um
(uh) what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place [lah] then after that (uh) if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
(uh) then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
[ah] so then from there [oh] then you all like [oh] okay [lah] then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
[ah] so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline [lah] so that even though you got five months (uh) to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say #khatib# (uh) when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like (uh) the cabinet or whatever because I believe (uh) H_D_B you got to check that one [lah] renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask H_D_B (err) K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this [lah] there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that [ah] so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it [lah] that is one part of it ya so ya [lah] so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care [kan
my only thing is that okay if he's (uh) you all have to like let's say workout [lah] the thing [lah] workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it (uh) on i
[oh] I think (uh
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan [lah
but then you have to stay in one place for two years [lah] or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking (err) is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay [kan] then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that [ah
(uh) take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming [lah] so there's one one idea you can hav
you can have the big wedding but (err) we have to burden one of the side [lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat [lah] [kan
okay so (err) if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the H_D_B but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then (uh) so you spend lavishly [ah] your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion (uh) of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
[oh] ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide [lah
[ah] what they want [lah] [ah] because I thin
(err) mix up what is it like like you think that [oh] what I want to have [oh] I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it [lah
in other in one I read about in (err) on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing [lah
I don't okay y
both side actually exchange gift [ah] how many you want to have it depend
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow [lah] no need [lah] I pay now [loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
okay what righ
[ah] but I think in today's context can be just lik
if not screen shot and then you se
if let's say you know the [oh] your partner [ah] really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either (um
like I said [lah] is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
(uh) get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like (err) like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
ya [lah] she wants the opinio
[ah] there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like (err) the person (uh) then where the family said firmly talk [oh] it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that (uh) kind of situations o
(err) kills the that particular portion [lah] but in this younger generation in your generation (err) things have changed progressivel
they cannot even get H_D_B flat [eh] they must buy a condo or private propert
[ah] high ceiling income but then (err) there's one period of time he changed jo
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know [ah] and then they finally got it [ah] then but there's a word then the reaso
(err) a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple [lah] ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no [lah] to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already [ah
like very stress then me [leh] then ho
(uh) you know the more th
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception (um) but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
you know and [ah] both ways [lah] both parties [lah] so (uh) people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects [lah
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say [ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
[ah] then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then (um) you can't convince your parents lik
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
(um)
(um) ya
ya (uh) (um) ya so
ya
wait wait wait
(err)
ya so they will say I wil tell you the number one nine seven two [ah] fifteen minutes later I I fill the number and tell me again then writing again right ya
ya you know that you are actually
ya do you know that actually are you are supposed to
so it was at the mild stage right you should
gotten it diagnosed then because if you get got it diagnosed then then doctor can frequently follow up but they cannot just do [ah] the
(err) what actually dementia you can see from their brain that it is (um) they having dementia [lah] but because stroke also can cause you to have some deformities in the brain say dementia is still like a mental condition right they have to do all test there like depression schizophrenia all these they still do test
like verbal assessments you know but
the project
you know they don't
you better but there's no need to stop
we
know
so people
that version
you can got you involved
if means that you need to do
want to
we we talk
we
(um)
kid
ya I know
you know
(mm)
I
ya but
you are already tired from work then you go home your parents not to say burden but you have to give hundred percent dedication
(um)
[oh]
but sometimes
ya so like if there is something like that I think it's very attractive [lah] because some is an enclosed space so you can come and visit your
you wanna have a village like that it has to be somewhere that is already developed that still needs more developing like nursing (um)
[ah]
ya
the (mmhmm)
there are because like if they know then some people might take advantage of it
ya
ya
ya
I think
but if you have (um) your rental flat that is above it right that studio apartment that is above you have two hundred to four hundred unit [eh] two hundred unit so two hundred units
but because her dad like everybody has (err) I mean maybe not just singapore everybody
temple is a hindu temple
you know but how about the buddhist how about the carton how about the christians how about any
ya [lah]
(mm) ya
I think
(mm) ya (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I'm not
that kind of thing then (um) then like then
[a'ah]
ya so like or don't no and then I feel maybe
(mm)
(oo)
I think there are a few points that be
take away from here is the number one
because
[ah]
(mm)
but
but it's just me like I because I don't like to travel so you are convenient [lah] that I'm already at my house like that
ya so
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
you think you have
(um) next [ah] what
I think
so far from what I learned about this are taking care of a being a secondary caregiver or living in the same household right
[a'ah]
what I think
ya like
that's the main thing that's the main thing ya like you have to always be prepared like because the thing is for progressive condition right
then you move on on on you
so you like you're drowning you
I try to swim okay let me [ah] see how I if I can go and get help it really is that they're getting help
[ah] swimming is trying to move forward right is really paying like you really can't and sometimes when you want
(mm)
it's like (um)
you know why I believe that it is not working I would like to close the case I would like to go somewhere else then you you have to be let alright I will close the case and then
what for the (um) for the
professional sometimes if they feel like the case is not is not going smoothly it's not working out they can actually feedback to their supervisor and be like I'm sorry but I think this case any if not working out you know
you already have that bond and the attachment
and for professionals that is that boundary
ya
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
ya you guys are doing experimenting on your own you know like that's what doctors want it's because doctors are not there twenty four seven
sometimes doctors are also like unhappy [lah] like you want you keep the medication here medication there but it's just that dementia is so different that dementia is not
[ah]
(mm)
(mm) so we know [lah] that communication is like the key to
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
phenomenon
[oh] okay [lah]
okay
(mm)
[orh]
[oh] Jetstar
okay
[orh]
[ah]
okay okay
and then we've also been to perth
three times already in
the whole of
last year and I think probably
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) okay so because [kan] you are the type of
(mm)
(mm)
like all my house mates like how to cook and surprisingly
all of them knew how to cook [lah] so it was very easy
and they taught me how to cook rice taught me how to cook a lot of things [lah] so I felt like

not so well because I'm not used to it
more of like english songs [lah]
then
after that
(um)
ya
so then I was like a bit like
(um) I don't think that it is
nice for me to
have (err) to go (uh) with you on the Vespa one on one
because it would be disrespectful to boyfriend I you know so it's like
and I don't and and I don't think it is it I don't think my boyfriend would be cool with it and I don't think that
it would be cool of me to do it also
weirded out
(um)
so my birthday dinner is coming up
only you and me
(um)
(mm) disrespectful because it's like
like
you know (um) single so of course it's okay with you
it's nice of you to do that
so I was like okay then I straight up told him
ya because if it's a birthday dinner just you and I it will be very weird
[ah]
tuesday wednesday thursday I'm free
like asking me to pick the day of
where he is free
but not when I am free
okay
then I said [oh] weekday I maybe cannot make it
so
time and and happy birthday in advance
(um)
[oh] (uh) don't worry other days I will be spending with my friends then he said you tell me when you are free
but I thought before this you said it will be with your group of friends
and then now you are asking me
I not interested and like you should not be disturbing me
[a'ah]
okay
so ya
disconnected signal because
he is just not getting it
maybe his brain waves are not getting it but we will see ho~ wer~ but
(mm)
ya
!huh!
the cases it re~ reemerged again
and now they are all back in lockdown
(mm)
so they are all back in lockdown
(mm)
(mm) I think so
(mm)
and the infection is is more (um)
the the virus is more infectious
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
job offers
(mm)
(mm)
ya
you
become prolonged because
(err) U_S_A
could not handle this COVID situation properly so that's why
ended up the entire
(uh) n~ internation~ nationwide
everybody in the world
did not manage to contain the virus because the two largest countries which is the U_S and
china
were not good at managing it
ya
if it happened in a much smaller country or a much smaller nation it would have been easier to contain
(mm)
(mm)
ya
exactly
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
you when you compare to
and it's very diverse that's why people like it here
and
ya
yes [lor]
(hmm) so ya
(uh) and then it's right in the middle of botanical gardens
(mm)
ya
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(um) (hmm)
and then had to like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[orh]
presentation
[oh]
ya
ya
[oh]
[oh]
ya very like (uh) demotivating [lah]
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] media agency [lah]
(mm) (mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
like (err)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya so
anyway
(err)
(mm) ya
okay
okay thank you bye bye
ya
but then I feel like december [kan] school holiday
(mm) (ugh)
(mmhmm)
Pan Pacific service suite
(um) beach road
because you all going as a family so I thought like you'll be
better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
(mmhmm)
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
in pacific
how many
because of the number of adults that you book [kan]
that's why they follow like
ya
[eh] [eh] sorry sorry
(mmhmm)
I think it's easy [seh] if you get like central
[a'ah]
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
[oh]
(mm)
is that the kitchen then
and then
(uh)
ya
like that's what I thought
because since
he's awkward either way
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya correct
[oh]
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
if not I can find for you also [lor]
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that [lor]
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
hundred dollars
ya my
(uh huh)
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think #angah# will
this hotel also nice
have you gone before
I think you went before
[oh] is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since #angah# like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
(mm) can [ah]
at Noosh Noodle Bar
[eh] we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
(mm) okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy [ah]
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
why didn't you eat it's so good
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
if you like craving for it just go for it [lah] twenty plus dollars
because I think they have like fixed
(um) measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
then that time also I had this #yakiniku# you know #yakiniku#
the beef
Yoshinoya
[oh] no okay #yakiniku# is the
okay [lah] like that is after they #yakiniku# the beef [mah]
but #yakiniku# is basically you get
to grill the the beef
maybe because they #yakiniku# it in the kitchen you bet~ you don't get to do it
but ya
that
that time there was only one halal #yakiniku# outlet
the #asakusa# temple area
ya
it's so nice one of the set was #wagyu# then I'm like
it's so soft [oh] my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
I mean it is technically [lah] but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like #mee soto# is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose #mee soto# okay I think I will pick
(um)
[a'ah] there's like so many things that I like
(hmm)
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay
ya that's a dish
if you get a chance to wake up as an actor one day which actor would you
want to become and why
you will [eh] she [eh] she got so many business
okay let's change it to celebrity
ya [lah] so celebrity who's
ya you have your own beauty line
some more you recently if you're rihanna you recently released the
the lingerie line
experience
[a'ah]
[a'ah] [seh]
maybe she got servants
she imaging the sleepover party
[oh] my god
[a'ah]
like got
don't know
ya
ya then after that I think he used
he used
and then they put there as a meme
!oho! like the circuit breaker
[a'ah]
ya
was like I'm ba~
you all have to stay home today but the celebrities
[oh] my god
[a'ah]
that's why
[a'ah]
and then they have
[a'ah] movie room ya
I think probably we have the right to complain
!aiya! I think it'll be fun
can you imagine
like I cannot imagine myself
staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
[a'ah]
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
[ah]
ya so that's one of the bad ones
lower on is free
but I actually find that ya I find that a fair deal
then [ah] if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
(um)
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like (uh)
[a'ah]
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
face
face is
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
(err) you still not a
(uh huh)
I like crime documentaries
[a'ah] [a'ah]
court cases
(mmhmm) correct
fight for their clients you no no no like he or she is not wrong
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya ya ya
right
popular
they still show but I'm not sure whether it's new seasons
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya I think hawk gate horror right I think it's
if the plot case is good
and then I think that (um)
[a'ah]
I don't
I don't think paranor~
I think paranormal activity is
(uh) like you know I don't ya
it really happened
[a'ah] the original camera
so I feel like a bit like okay
tactic
something new
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
the longer ones right
there's this one one movie that she told
that there's !huh!
that she covered
(uh huh) [a'ah] [ah]
I haven't really watch
(uh)
(mm) kids
[oh] the movie is just recently
[oh] okay okay okay okay okay
[oh] okay
crime documentaries but then there's so many to watch
(mmhmm)
stress
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
and she effectively you know
expecting
(mm)
okay I will watch soon I think tomorrow
I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
this can happen you wish
(mmhmm)
or is it
okay like when you
[ah] okay okay
[a'ah] [a'ah]
true
castle
l~ like yo~
[a'ah]
like your own land
with a swimming pool and then you can have a tennis court badminton court
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think everybody
I think primary school
but then it
[oh]
(mmhmm)
SARS is just singapore
I don't expect
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
father daughter or like kids
(mmhmm)
what is it [oh] your your
father is infected with COVID so
I think (uh)
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like [oh]
I think like
like he
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going U_S I guess
be hygienic
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a !duh!
[oh] ya ya ya
#sembawang#
who
he's like so young
ya
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
interning gag
grants and all that
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
because
ma~ that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries [lor]
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card [lah]
I think they like
people
from other working at other places [eh] like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the C_C
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under C_C [lah] then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
ya
so when they
[oh] (um) we actually this this grant is not under us so
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the C_C cannot do all these
because it's P_D_P_A also [what]
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's P_D_P_A [mah]
I mean like okay [lah] if you allowed there's there's
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day (uh)
the N_P_C right
they referred this resident to
to the C_C to change their address their I_C
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like N_P_C should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your (uh) I_C at the N_P_C but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the C_C then I'm like !huh!
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got ran~ resident they come to the C_C and they like
(uh) can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the C_C to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
(hmm)(hmm)
ya~ not everything we can do at C_C
so funny
and then some people they understand [lah] but then you know some people when they like
[a'ah]
that's why I say
[ah]
because now
now also everything is online
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
need to go down (mmhmm)
[a'ah]
ya it's like that so yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
the (um) financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
as in the application that the application for the
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot [lah] because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the C_C for a bit any longer
because by right I use
(mm) ya
at the M_O_M
ya man~
ya
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the for~
issues with the
employers
[ah]
because they (um) employees from different different company [mah] so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
(uh)
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like [oh]
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office [what]
just be mentally prepared [lor]
(mm)
no [lah]
(mmhmm)
they didn't decrease the pay for them
then your diploma when start
[dah]
that time you went for the medical interview [ah]
you went already
ya
ya the immunity is lower [lah] basically
[oh] okay
[oh] really
[oh] okay
[oh] it's at a landed property
[oh] okay okay I think I seen
it's a child care
[oh] okay then how many
children you have in there
so do people like teach
over there or no
do you have to teach them anything or no
[oh] okay
five
[oh]
okay okay okay
youngest
then
but then they have different age groups
[oh] okay okay
child care
(mmhmm)
(uh)
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
[oh] okay and then mixed race like japanese and #ang moh# like (um) japanese and get japanese korean and sweden that swedish within
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(uh)
[oh]
[a'ah]
this one more to the that [one] [ah]
[ah]
is it because the cost is higher or
then how is your like working hours like
[oh] office hours

[ha]
ya
(mm)
ya thank you lyn
okay thank you bye bye
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay what is it
ya
[oh]
so this will be your third wish [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like (uh)
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich [what]
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for (um)
is benefit for myself and my family [lah]
so we can bring whole family go shopping together [ha]
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere [lah]
when you got a big family right it's much easier
[ah] rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen (uh) we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood [lah] [eh] if anybody
[ah] emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
[ah] so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money [ha]
everything about money [lah] [eh]
because although once you being rich you still think about money [ah] that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
(uh) stable financial [eh]
ride their own bicycle to school [ah] [kan]
so from there also safe you see everything think about money [eh]
I already think very far [lah] [kan]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
then after that
[ah] you say that you read about the news [kan]
[ah] but like what
two months' time right about two months' time so okay [lah] not bad [lah]
so why not then
so at least if we can use that (uh) one hundred (uh) dollar voucher [lah]
we can save up money save up some money [lah]
to buy our own food cook our own food so we just picnic
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(um) you know that (uh)
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
[ah] they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you [lah]
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest (uh) maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso [kan]
(mm) so like that better right
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
(err)
ya [lah] marina is nice [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
splash
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think that one is quite cheap also
because (um) that time I saw a youtuber
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this [lah]
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
[ah]
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
[ah] so maybe we can go for that one [ah]
(mm) so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you [ah] so we no need to go for separate rooms [what]
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk [ah]
cannot gathering [ah] cannot make side illegal gathering
[ah] cannot gossip [ah]
so at least at least [lah] (mm) so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
have [lah]
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle [ah] I not sure
but they can (uh) ride on the bicycle right
th~ they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride [ha]
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part [lah] that we can do
[ah]
maybe we can plan saturday morning
(mm) no maybe afternoon
[oh] ya because actually we don't want
(um)
we don't want
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
(mmhmm)
the next morning we go cycling
[oh] over there if I not wrong got burger king [eh]
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin [ah]
ya that's why
but I think (uh) over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure [ah]
(hmm) maybe we can search everything
(um)
inside the

[eh] bro long time no see [ah]
not that [ah] actually cause I just got sacked [ah] by my company
ya ya you saw my posting is it
(err) around six months
and if I would say it's wonderful [lah] cause
I got to travel to different countries [ah]
among all the countries I would say
(uh) saudi arabia cause (uh) it was very peaceful you know cause I mean I'm a muslim right so when I go there
I really I would say I practice my religion better there
I'm just a normal person who wants to go there to practice my religion [lah]
(err)
besides practising my religion I I think I really
enjoy myself
(uh) finding [oh] discovering new food there the arabic food was
I would say I would want to go to
spain [ah] cause ya I would like to go to spain cause
(err) I want to go to #barcelona# cause
whole (uh) football period (uh) resumes
(uh)
I I sure think that you did receive all all of the grants right
probably can last me for six months [ah] if I really (err) spend accordingly and safely [lah] and how about you I heard you working as a
driver or something is it
four thousand !wah! that I think that's a lot [eh] for a part-time job
[oh] I see ya but then
yes speaking about jobs I think
(uh) moving forward
it will be a tough period [lah] for singapore and singaporeans itself cause
(mm)
I mean be it any be it like be it any jobs [lah] you know regardless of any jobs sorry regardless of any jobs
I mean if you earn enough for yourself and family I think it's good enough
so but then ya in terms of singapore context
I think you think how much should a singaporean earn to sustain him or herself and their family
ya I really agree on that [lah] cause as we (um) you know I don't know if you notice it or not cause singapore is currently facing a
declining birth rate you know people are scared to have children cause they they are worried that it might cost them a lot
you know with the I don't know with
(err) the what diapers with the milk cost I think they are the parents will be scared you know to raise a child
to have a stable saving or to have a sufficient saving is very important [ah] in singapore
(uh) ya I get that a lot [lah] I mean
especially in the malay tradition right I don't know why
(err) it's very important or they really emphasise emphasise on having a
I think having one or two children is enough you know like if you have more I mean if you are financially stable I think it's good for you [lah] but then you are just earning
one point eight
two thousand and that is provided (err) you are not doing overtime or what [lah]
so ya two thousand is not enough [lah] at least two point five and above
that's why we are that's why we notice that (err) or rather we witness there are a lot of news over facebook young parents are struggling [lah] you know to sustain themselves and their family cause
I mean the living cost in singapore I mean you also know it's not cheap
and (um) the pay that they are getting is already not enough
so ya I think
perhaps singapore government could give them give them [eh] sorry give them a little bit more
financial schemes like for their own children [lah] you know maybe
for (err)
ya I really agree on that [lah] we really we don't need we need to stop blaming on the government and you know (err)
put the responsibility on ourselves first I mean speaking about the electricity right !wah! my house [ah] I'm just living with my mum and my bill is around two hundred and I barely shower
maybe I only showered two times per day I don't why my electricity bill until two hundred what about yours though
ya I think I really urge you [lah] to [ah] hustle more cause
I mean if you think probably right if you earn around two thousand and then
after you pay bills mortgage you pay I mean you give some of your pay to your parents I mean how much you're left with you know and maybe you you barely have time [eh] you barely have money for yourself and for transportation I mean
(uh) this kind of issues right might really affect your mental health you know and as you can see over the news
you know I really like to read news [lah] I mean and you know people are committing suicide cause they are really stress with their condition and
I I'm really sorry [lah] to hear that people are killing themselves cause they are really stress with their own condition I mean what do you think about that
we gotta suffer
ya I mean I I agree [ah] there are multiple aspects that (um) lead to (err) emotional (err) depression
or probably (um)
issues that can affect your mental health like I think especially in singapore context right (um) financial
(uh) issues I think is the most depressing issue [lah]
you know cause
ya five hundred for myself every month
I I'm not happy but I'm content with whatever with !wah! sorry with whatever I'm having [lah] you know
you mean the COVID period is it or
ya I mean this is a very tough period [lah] for all singaporeans and especially for those lower income right
and if we were to put ourselves in their position I don't I mean if I were to put myself in their positions I don't think [ah] I can like endure well cause
you know having to think various issues in one time it's very (uh) depressing I would say
ya I mean I I also (err) came across the news that he was diagnosed with COVID [lah] I mean some people
(err) actually celebrated that he was diagnosed I mean maybe I don't know why [lah] I mean it's not a it's not
good to actually celebrate that someone is diagnosed I mean be it any issue or be it any remarks that you are unhappy with with what I mean be it anything [lah] that he had done that you are unhappy with I mean it's not right for you to be happy that someone is sick cause
I know it just it's not morally right that you are celebrating someone is sick you know
I mean some people might I think some people misinterpret that issue actually he just
I don't know if you heard the news he only
(um) hold the border
to some (uh) high risk muslim countries it's not to all muslim countries so I think maybe people misinterpret the news [lah] may~ maybe might think that he's what is it you called islamic islamophobic or something ya but then
well if he is then that is his position to
(uh) explain himself but I myself as a muslim I've nothing against him
but I have something more worrying to actually worry about which is the (uh) about the uighur muslim in china
where I heard that they are being tortured
was tortured was raped in front of other people</H1>
P_B_B
(uh)
in my in my opinion probably they are practising communism you know probably they just want to have their own people you know in their own country
and to have other races to in their own country might
if they feel that it might be a threat to them hence that's why they
you know hold the what what is it called the concentration camp is it where they gather all the muslims and they rape all the women they torture all the men and they</H1>
all the children I mean do you really have to torture the children I mean they are</H1>
they are still weak people you know I don't think it's (err) moral morally right [lah] I don't know what's wrong with their head you know to even torture all those kids I mean
kau pukul ramai-ramai dan kau rogol perempuan semua</malay> I really</H1>
(err) don't know what's wrong with their country
ya basically I would say (uh) history is repeating itself I mean what's happening in china is another example of holocaust in if you really know about it where the jews are being (uh) killed
(err) you know there's a mass I don't know they were killed in groups or something back then and know the same thing is happening but the weird thing is it's not
(err)
the events that are happening in the concentration camps are not exposed to the mass media and I'm not sure why it's became maybe it's cause they are muslims or what
I don't know and
(err) I don't know what is it called the black lives matter you know where the black people are really (err)
out~ being outcasted in U_S what you think about that
ya I mean in every community [ah] be it in our own country also be it in malay community chinese community indian community there's always black sheep in every community you know but then it doesn't justify that when one person from that community does any bad thing
it (err) it (err) really (err) bring a hole
intentionally in front of people !wah! that was another level of murder I would say [lah]
what you think about that
screwed-up
ya I think in singapore
I mean
(err) we did have I mean we do have (uh) casual or soft racism among the community I mean maybe some maybe for friends right they interpret as a joke you know as a casual joke but maybe if you are
you know being racist to a stranger I mean you're really asking for it man I mean if that person really punch you I mean you're really asking for it [lah]
you know you really deserve it I mean in but then in singapore context
I don't think such (uh) racism that is happening in america would happen in singapore cause
we just need to be cautious in what we saying or what we think about others [ah] you know and what do you think about singapore
so called racism
if it if it exist [lah]
ya I heard that (um)
the malays do have more privilege than (uh) comparing compared to other races [ah] know when they buy houses actually they actually can buy it at a cheaper price which
why
why are you living in a country where you as a (uh) national citizen are denied rights as a
I mean as citizen as a citizen of the country [lah] you know another in another citizen of yours
example okay example [ah]
you and your neighbour
and do you think you are treated fairly as citi~ as a citizen
that's what I heard [lah] I mean I I don't wish to be the source of this
news or what I mean (uh) but then ya that's what I heard [lah] when you are chinese indian
(uh) sara~ sarawakian or #sabah# you know someone from #sabah#
you will be treated better or you have a you have more privilege in malaysia and I think the malays in singa~ I mean in malaysia
actually
a G_P clinic I don't know you could (err) easily pay forty dollars if you don't have a CHAS card
I mean sorry to say [ah] but I think that their government
is
weird is a big joke I would say I mean do you can see the way they run their countries and I mean it can be (err) it can be seen in the news you know on how their ministers are having tons of corruption cases being [ah] you know
they are they are going to get charged in court [eh] I know you confirm know [ah] who's that guy [ah] #najib# (uh) #najib razak# and some other
his (uh) friends getting charged at court cause
ya I heard he was charged on
twenty charges if I'm not wrong and he would be in prison for twelve years [ah] but I doubt that he will be in prison cause
I mean
that's why I really
I mean
I do really love to watch the malaysian politics cause it's funny and the way they speak to each other is really funny the way (uh) you know they
they (uh) give racist remarks which are the I mean I don't find it funny [lah] but the way they speak it and also they shout to each other
but ya if I'm a citizen of malaysia
I mean
they of course everyone should be proud of their own country but looking at your own ministers acting like that in the parliament
[ah] our ministers in singapore is acting and how (uh) well-spoken are they in the parliament itself the way they project their views and points on how to improve the singaporeans lives are very (uh)
I would say [ah] I don't know what to say [ah] it's very good [lah] I would say what you think about that
(uh) ministry like for example financial or et cetera [lah] and but then
ya but then ya they are paid well man they are paid
I heard fifty thousands maybe more than that but ya their parliament is
I would say I'm sorry to say but it's kind of joke [lah] I mean have you watch the singapore [one]
in YouTube or something and I really fancy how mister #shanmugam# and mister what it's called [ah] mister #vivian balakrishnan# the way he speak at even at when you go to when you travel to foreign countries the way he speaks is
very I would say as singaporean I'll be very proud that a man of my country is travelling and speaking in such way
basic skill is it
I read I mean ya again I read again on the news
you being a minister you will only (err) how to say (uh) not doing the job a citizen would expect them to do [lah] you know
recruitment
I mean probably those with (uh) in a higher position right they seem (uh) they see that this people are maybe kind of interesting join in joining the politics and ya maybe that person is just
a son of their own friends so they just take it [lah] so there's a conflict you know there's a conflict of interest there they it's not recruited based on merit you know and and I think in singapore most ministers I would say most [ah] I repeat again most ministers
I mean I don't know can you be happy with that
!huh! so you willing to wake up in the
(um)
(uh) maybe you wanna maybe you want to try to live there with having
(err) like I said [lah] having two thousand is barely enough for yourself and ya what else if you have to have a family
(uh) ya I mean I do agree [lah] on what you are what you just speak you know but (uh)
do you notice that we've been speaking so seriously for the past (uh) thirty minutes and actually I you know I wanted to ask if actually do you have a girlfriend right now
(err) no I I don't
I mean I might sound
(err) like an ancient man but I don't really believe in relationships [lah]
and I think
in the current generation right relationship is just so
I don't know I find it wrong [ah]
have have you even notice that you know this pers~ person A and B
break up on january
and the next month they have already another person by their side and how is he how how is it so easy for them to find another person so fast and
what is love for them you know what you think about that
ya like like what you said [lah] I mean it's not the right time to have a relationship cause
it's embarrassing [ah] I mean this is not some gender inequality [lah] but then as a guy I don't think it's right for you to ask for money from your girl you know
ya I mean I hope that your point is not implementing that women are weak you know I mean if you see nowadays women are actually women are earning more than men actually
but it's just that (um) ya actually women [ah] do earn more than men nowadays but I don't think they are
emotionally stable so that is why we as a man
(uh) have to lead them [lah] I mean I mean this topic is very (err) subjective [lah] you know but I think in singapore women are really (um) having a good career earning more than man I would say
(um)
probably ten thousand twenty thousand for your own wedding [ah]
I mean actually
and stuff and (um)
anyway [ah] it's a it's a good catch up with you I would see you again around
alright see you bye
just now you say what Pan Pacific hotel is it

that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel [eh]
because the Amara hotel what what my (uh) what I
thought that I
(err) should do right
is I will take two separate room
at least they can spend the night together
there
[oh] they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay [lah]
let's see the photos
Amara
!huh! got no plate

#angah# don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
okay this one is for three adults right
they can sleep
on the floor [lah] of course [lah] with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that [lah] as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I were I I'm in that kind of mood

can consider
or the another one is this one also Ascott [oh] the price [oh] my god
actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus
is a apartment also
(mm)

[oh] ya [hor]
(mm)(mm)(mm)
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward [lah] but I think he
I think he don't mind
no [eh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why [ah] why you don't like it
[oh] is it
what did you have
a a what
[oh]
(mm) okay [lah] I will decide
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm)
I also have it every month
on the itinerary
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that (um) indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
is like a bit weird [lah] so when I taste it [eh] I thought that it's going to be bad but then like [oh] my god it's so nice
(err) I ate the prawn green curry you the #naan#
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we (uh) we
(mm) it's too loud (mm)
because we we passed by and then after that we thought [eh]
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay [lah]
and then I don't really like #udon#
that's why maybe I don't (mm)
your japanese car~ curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
(err) okay [lah] I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like (uh)
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar [tau] for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
#naan#
okay [lah] it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay !wow! I I I don't ever have
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
(mm) (mm) (mm)
they had it si~ they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
(mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in #bali# remember the ya~ the Yoshinoya
the #yakiniku# beef
is it the same thing
[ah]
but then that one the one that I ate also called #yakiniku# beef why
[oh] wait
maybe maybe maybe
[oh] is it
(mm)
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose #mee soto#
[oh] okay

okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know [what]
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like (um)
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it [lah]
of course right
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
[oh] but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity [ah] rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like [oh] my god [oh] my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the #wayi# can just like (err) can I
ya can I just like (err) take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
(err) helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room (uh) house is like seven million
(err) with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets (err) attached (uh) with (uh) indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
scary [siol]
I don't think I can
don't [ah]
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
(ugh)
(mmhmm)
and then they put there as a meme
okay [oh] ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play te~ play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
buy one get one free
[oh] you mean like okay okay I don't know
(hmm)
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
[ah] okay then that kind of deal like okay [lah] [meh] I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay [lah] maybe we~ that one is a bit worse
like !huh! one for one
but I don't get to choose
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
standard [lah]
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body [ah]
[ha]
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like (ugh)
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like (uh)
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things [lah] maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
(err)
go all out to save their client even though their cla~ clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients [eh] no no no (uh) like he or she is not wrong
and everything like that and then
[ah] I like like ya I like (uh) true crime stories
I like like last time I like C_S_I
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news [oh] I like serious I
ya I mean the whole C_S_I I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are (um)
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami C_S_I miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think horr~ okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
(uh) or like paranormal activity all these like
(um) (uh) cable (uh) ya
a good movie correct
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
(err) ya ya ya
ya
(mm)
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what [ah]
[ah] chris watts [ah] is it the chris watts
the [one] that she the [one] that the the
ya the [one] that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
(um)
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can (uh) on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay [lah] maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix [one] [eh]
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
(uh) I mean he's a narcissist what (uh) eventually he will just gonna act that [oh] no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
about two months prior prior to the wedding [eh] prior to the murder sorry
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
(err) the girlfriend [lah] but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious [lah]
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like (um)
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
ma~ me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle [lah] like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like (uh) grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the [one] that
I had after I had
#aryan# after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
(uh) healthy okay [lah] healthy is subjective [lah]
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
this
take care of you when you are young [kan] so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
(err) they need I have to
do it
for them
[ah] and then my third wish actually
(uh) I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still (uh) I'm already pretty
[oh] I
(err) when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
(err) (uh) (um) lower secondary
then I think
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head [kan] I will actually really think like then I was like [eh] like quite sad [lah] like
they are somebody's
(err)
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya
ya and then after that you are at the risk also because maybe you know
so it's quite sad [lah]
ya
you have any wishes
ya man
ya man
because my my
you think what
that's why why is he even the president
!oi!

correct correct you can definitely (uh) look up
unless if you cannot find whatever that you're looki~ you you want to know online then no choice [ah] you need to go down what
and then if your mum
you know like cannot go down you go down first [lah] like check it out for her what's the problem
that some some people just think that we actually don't want to help them
you know because like we want to do the easy way out
but actually we really cannot help
don't want change colour

why
[oh] is it
but then the pay is st~ is the same [ah]
as C_C
that [one] higher [ah]
november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
(err) actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation [lor]
then you need to be immune~ immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya [lah] I pass
so
you know that day I went for (uh) a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
and white lodge is (um)
it's a private (uh) institution
ya it's a private (err) it's a private school [lah] it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's (uh) it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge (um)
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in [ah] okay like the the one I went I went (uh) from eight thirty A_M to one P_M
I have to (err) assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates [lah] but they are they are like
one teacher (err) to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then (um)
after that the okay so what I did was like (uh)
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
(um) I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children [lah] (um) okay the first half the eight thirty to
(um)
for kids that (uh) the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
#ang moh#
and then mixed race like japanese and #ang moh#
like (um) japanese and jap~ japanese korean and (uh) sweden
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local [one]
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international (uh) so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
[orh] ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
eight thirty to five [lah]
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because (uh) if you go under government
saturday you're o~ (uh) open half day
then you need to alternate working [ah]
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this [one] like saturday sunday you are closed and then [what] I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower [lah]
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see (uh) what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some aller~ kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
colourful
colourful characters [lah] like
(err) and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the (uh)
they call me they call me miss
#hu#
because they don't my my name is very long right then like (uh) okay never mind (uh) just okay just call me miss #hu#
okay then after that they
[oh] got one kid say (uh) miss #hu# can I go to the toilet please
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
(um) can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like !whoa! [eh]
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
go to school on that day right
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay may~ sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so [ah]
[a'ah]
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this (uh) one (um) one
(uh) no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
(uh) one kid is (err)
ya
half german half japanese so
(um)
tell us like okay (uh)
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is actua~ he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like (uh) and then the kids will like [orh] then they will (uh)
(uh)
attempt to attempt to say the language also [lah]
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because (uh) the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys [lah] girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually P_E
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their na~ naptime (uh) they (uh) then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
(mm)
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already [dah]
feed breakfast [lah]
they have like a snack [lah] like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that (uh) doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one P_M [kan]
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later [lah]
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
(err) when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring [lah]
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no (uh) you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like [oh] my god (uh) and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before
okay so we are here again
what do you think
he's working at foodpanda so far it's
ya

then you can clock in maybe maybe like twenty orders something like that then like per day you can earn ninety

it's calling us
[oh] my god
wait what's my last trip
#bangkok#
is it #bangkok#
I think it's #bangkok#
okay toodles
it's a small group [lah] not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then (um) the place also okay [lah] not so busy last time used to be very busy but now (um) because of the COVID thing so companies send their
[ah] their staff
a participant they only allocate (uh) fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like (err) two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
[oh] I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the (err)
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
I don't know because the deal is (um) they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges [lah]
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
(um) the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge [ah] one que
and one B_M_I and then myself doing (um)
B_P but surprisingly all the participant came for
[ah]
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're B_P will be just nice
(mmhmm)
[ah] she [ah] panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause (uh) every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and (um)
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
level
which is different [lah] this today's it's so much different from the past
ya
she's a bit timid [lah] I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister [lah] but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really [lah]
timid is different from people who is fierce #shah# timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
ya she went through all the assessment
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that (uh) these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but (err) she turned to me and tell me of like (um)
(mm) (mm)
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you (um)
cute [lah] but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no (um)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
you didn't
(mm)
(mm) ya
(mm)
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
(mm)
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much [ah] maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
(um)
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
(oo)
(uh) sooner or later she she will forgot how to (err) right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the (uh) leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad [lah] mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
(um)
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
(um)
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
the because people don't go through
so it's gonna be the same
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put (err) into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got (um) cousin [lah] she could say [ah] eight boys [ah] the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be (err) medical attention given to her [ah] anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then (err) third she got (um) caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver (mm) they have
(err) nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know (um) half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday (err) maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
famili~ the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so [lah] because she's already bedridden
(um) don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this (um)
that's that's what my opinion is [lah]
ya I know
(mm)
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this (err) dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya [lah] I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
[oh] [eh] you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
old generation [lah]
(err)
(mmhmm)
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
you know like like like specially our C_P_F money [ah] nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
that's problem [lah] people take advan~ ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right (err) your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card (err) see see and then (err) this this lady said !hey! you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is (err) (err) giving some (uh) help fund because I really apply then is it [oh] you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true (mm) how to accommodate right
(um)
(um)
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious [lah] I think the more points of
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite (um) (err)
complex [lah] I should say how to handle the future gen~ and the future old folks generation
(um) I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
(um) I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at (err) until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't hand~ (uh) take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
you mean you're not used to it that (uh) you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
[ah] sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
[ah] contribute no that's what I think [lah]
I I mean right now this is
(uh) right now right now right now at this situation that I (um)
at present [ah] most of my (err) friends
(mm)
[oh] you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
(um) ya
(um) how you want to (err) how you
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that [oh] it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
(um)
(um) ya true
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really [ah] really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand [lah]
(um) that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
you know so quickly the other
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle bi~ in future
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
[ah]
now it's a time for them to take care of me
or as what you say [lah] don't you think that this is a reward that you are given to you yes I agree with that
I have the capability [lah]
the
(um) (mm) (um)
ya ya you have to change your mindset and then you always have to tell yourself
you are human you have feeling you are human you have (err) your energy level is our only that point of time [eh] is that much
and then you have feeling [ah] that [ah] you are human that you know that (uh) sometimes you can be angry sad cry you have to have all this
(err) emotional otherwise you're not human you are not robot it with you robot
(mm)
forever ya forever you be
ya
(um) ya true true
ya true
(mm) ya
breakdown
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
(um) (um)
somehow you were saying that family knows best [lah]
okay (err) family know best in terms of tackling one (err) let's say the mother [lah] because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming (err) since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
trial and error also
(um) ya true
(um)
so because chicken
[oh] complain and complain
(mm) (oo) (mm) (mm)
(oo)
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant
(um)
(mm) ya
ya true ya true
so it would so when you have a when you have to take care of a dementia person you make sure that you always do (uh) a lot of research
research and research because dementia not only happen to our community our it happen to the world so every everyone in every everyone in
I should say the world world the global global it's a global (err)
phenomena is going to be as what they say pandemics you knows

[kan] like what's the point bro you sneeze from your nose not from your mouth so you cover your mouth for what
and
(mm)
you know
so it's just just from her face
like a gangster [seh] but then
okay (uh) were there other people that felt the same way as you
(um)
(um)
(um)
[ah] so like two face
just marker
I think (uh)
because
you know for what ya so so it's just like
maybe
some of them are okay [jer]
but it's just you know it's just a stupid reason for me to just like [ah]
ya it does
ya ya ya ya
ya but but thi~ this is why I guess
we
as millennials I guess or gen Z or whatever okay you you millennial right because you are ol~ older
ya but
because we we put ourselves online
you know even especially this recording is also online ya so
ya precisely
actually is good for you to hide yourself like you know on social media especially
(um) if you do want to
go on dating apps
I suggest you can use a different name
well technically but like at least is still obvious right
okay that [one] K K K okay that [one] F_B_I case [lah] but like ya that [one] that [one] is like but ya I got see a lot of people
on Tinder also [oh] okay say they put in their bio like
hi I'm actually seventeen or like fifteen then I I just straight away report they just fake their birthday [lah] but straight away we report [lah] because it's like
just imagine if
(um) a police read or something for some reason and then it's like they ask [oh] why you talking to a minor and then just like
I feel like we doing podcast but ya well
(um)
for example you are from a royal family or something or you are someone very very important you know [ah] ya [sia] but then ya it depends on the situation but
ya
you going to get bitten
(um)
Maggi Maggi cup [jer]
which one is it the indomie one
karma !wow!
I wonder what they serve
trauma in karma
but then I heard (uh)
okay [lah] I just google [lah] just now they have no menu so how [ah]
I feel like
it will be a full course meal starting from
starters appetiser and then all the way until dessert
sorry I never go restaurant before but
ya either way ya it's like the seven levels of hell basically I feel like
ya
but ya if if karma were to serve me something right it will be
revenge I feel like
from
#lek# [ah] #lek# #lek# #lek# #lek# #lek#
(uh) it's just
because back then in school [ah] now I working full-time already [lah] [ah] so
(uh) I made a lot of enemies because somehow some way people just don't like me and is like is like some kind of an algorithm
for at the end at the end of every school year right I will lose all my friends
ya ya well I don't know if I lose to them or they lose to me [lah] but
either way is this
ya I still remember one occasion
[ah] secondary school
but ya because like [oh] my god first major exam P_S_L_E so like you expect people to at least
just
but then well [ah] long story short
it's just a
when I
that night where (err)
whether now so
you know like those kind (err) high school sweetheart kind of thing it's a no from me
[oh] shit okay no no
and then
ya so after that
(uh) so I guess on that night we just decided to be together to be in a relationship not me and my best friend my and the guy so
so somehow right the next day
his girlfriend is me then I was like who [sia] who spread and then obviously the first person that I suspected was not even my best friend you know that was how much I love her I want to say like but that sounded a bit
ya but then then [ah]
(um) before me and the guy
(err) talk right
he like another girl and
ya so
ya secondary school anything can happen so
(err) I talk to my best friend [lah] and say like [oh] why who who do you think spread and everything then she like [ah] I don't know you know everything then I was like ya true I also don't know because the thing is that I somehow I was too dumb to realise that she was also in that call yesterday [lah] like I didn't remember that fact
you know and then
ya that's true [sia]
that's why okay that's why you know the phrase where
some some people do say that [oh] I prefer befriending those on ya ya ya
some of them is like that because they will act like everything is just like [oh] hi let me ask guy best friend first
some of you all you just don't try to act innocent when you're not [lah]
ya
but
but that's why for me is that I prefer
how do you [ah] say I prefer
(um)
ya ya ya ya ya
(um)
ya but [ah] I got I got those kind of friend before I just drop
ya
[eh] ya I want off topic [sia] but okay your turn your turn I I go I go back #jurong# [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
example
check out rhythm skins in latin
who knows
ya but
ya I guess karma is technically revenge [lah] but not from the person itself but it's just from the world
ya (mmhmm) thanks
ya I guess (um)
if okay if you okay for example if you were the restaurant yourself if you were karma yourself what would you do
for supper
not for yourself [lah] not so bad [lah] for for anybody that you feel like
I guess
okay
(mmhmm)
in what sense
[oh] bro is is he living up to the quote of like every great woman is there's a great man behind or something I know it's the opposite [lah] but
but let's say
[ah] then that means
dude
do you feel like they are insecure of themselves when they say that [kan] (um)
(um)
(um)
(mmhmm)
[ah] ya my ex also did that
(um)
to a certain extent
or snobbish also
exactly in twenty twenty please get therapy
ya
even
okay this [one] I cannot brain
women also the same [what]
I guess in a sense
(um) (um)
ya because I feel like we
we don't have to mansplain stuff
right is that the word
so we okay if we say that [oh] my god I was
I don't know ya it's just a bit only not asking for much
I the self-proclaimed resting bitch face basically R_B_F
ya like very edgy in a sense
no [lah] you normal [lah]
yes
but then for her is just
it was very hard to try to make her open up as in not open up to her secrets or whatever it's just talk to me like a normal person that's it and then it came to the point where she became clingy at first for me I I she said that I was clingy because I was trying too hard to become her friend but then I was like
(err)
and then after that
and then like [oh] how I wish I was in your group then I say [oh] ya same how I wish I and my friend were in my group but at that point of time I already started this liking because the way she was being very possessive and jealous over me even though we were just friends ya
(um) ya precisely unless you're married [lah] that [one] I think
a bit can
it's
ya
okay we're just single [lah] that's why we talk about this
ya but maybe for me is just I don't like the way you text so bye bye
so okay I I got I always ask this question if if you had three wishes
what
will you do with it I mean what would you wish for [lah] you know you know like those eleven eleven kind of thing
true I agree
so okay if everything was free how will you obtain those materials
forming [oh] farming how do you farm an iphone
ya how
what
okay she she living in thirty thirty one can farm an iphone
well I guess but we need a lot of land though singapore don't have a lot of land how [ah]
get a rooftop
then for the next wish okay other than the first wish will be everything will be free second
[oh]
wish
so explain your comfort characters (um)
ya anime anime ya
can you imagine he just pop up and just answer you
I see okay so
maybe you should manifest some cash
okay so what what
okay so secondary wish is your comfort characters third wish
[oh] that's cute
okay if if your cats were to talk right okay for all your cats that you have
how would you
how how do think they will they will talk to you for example #gizmo#
what do you do
give them a character ya ya ya ya ya
okay then your other cats
do you think she will be like the queen bee of the school
okay ya got some people just like that like
ya some some people are just naturally very attractive but
ya they very nice
ya maybe she'll be like what your big sister kind of character that will be cute
am I I I I guess maybe
and then okay your other cats
you live with them [what] that's why I'm asking you
[oh] that's cute !alah!
[oh] damn
I see okay I see
(mmhmm)
what
ya
okay [lah] makes sense (mmhmm)
something like a lot of
but is a cat a lost kitty
[ah]
[ah] okay [lah] at least (um)
dear you still have #gizmo# I know you you sure #gizmo# a lot
and and and
(mmhmm) ya ya her name is baby
damn okay
[ah] okay how how you take a cat home
in the carrier !wow! the love ya
[ah]
cute
so does she give more or does she want more attention
[ah] [kan]
no you you can have more cats than you know than more boyfriends so
and it's and it's and it's socially acceptable
okay [what] at least you're not spending money on someone who who can cheat you know which cat would cheat on you
right most to most is just get fat that's it
it's fine I can always you know help you
ya get
get I don't know get scratched I guess no the thing is I like cats but
sometimes I'm afraid to approach them
I mean you live with them
[ah]
how then the cat never fight back
[ah] that's true trust on trust
yes if you don't trust there's nothing nothing will happen so many things
[ah] that's true true like if animals were to like you except for insects
no thanks that [one] a bit sus
no we got a problem officer
so okay between cats and dogs
okay
I was thinking of something but okay thanks
why in what sense
that's
[oh]
(um)
(mmhmm)
okay that that makes sense but you know about the law where they they are forbidding people from having cats in H_D_B
ya ya but demonising but ya it's just I feel like it's unfair because
for from my perspective right cats
they are cleaner and they are they make less noise the most to most they are meows are just very soft
when they run around
damn okay
so so animals are like that also okay
ya
ya [sial] [ah] who who ask you ghost
ya
but
ya I got around my neighbourhood if I do see the big dogs they are fine they are chill it's just the small dogs I don't know for some reason they just want to approach you like don't don't
ya
glass panel
is the one at the door right the gate right
specific [eh]
because you angry
what why !wah! so specific what you do [sia]
ya
[ah] (mmhmm)
(uh huh)
I don't I don't understand [sia] like I feel like they they have some kind of hate or anger inside them to the point where they can just hate so much
okay ya that's right
but but if you are below one five zero that one is a different kind of temper honestly
serious
ya because it's all compressed
ya it's all compressed so if you are ya if you are power
ya that's all the short guys don't date short guys
from experience maybe it's just a stereotype please don't take this too hard
well okay
I wish I had a cat
but I feel like
I don't know I'll be so emotionally attached to it
I don't know I I emotionally attached to a lot of things for example my water bottle or whatever is it can be quite toxic ya (mmhmm) don't make me sound so old please
so so it's like
nah I'm not single I'm I'm I'm single but not ready to mingle okay but
but ya ya I think I'm those kind of grandmothers I think like with the family heirloom that I just I just pass pass down my granddaughter my bottle that she cannot do anything about it she sell also people will just realise it's just a normal bottle that's not much value
well gen gen Z gen #zentiment#
okay [lah] I guess ya that would be our labels from society right like gen Z and just [ah] strawberry generation [lah] all those kind of shit
but things are done [what]
like everyone is struggling in their own things it's I don't know
yes
yes
precisely
of course they can [lah] the competition not that much
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
I I agree but because because it's true because I mean everyone is facing the same thing no matter how how much of
how much pressure that are getting [lah] so very little or what I mean I feel like
the future generations will also feel more pressure because there will be
too many things happening at once especially the pandemic now like
are home based learning okay [lah] a lot of people struggling especially those who
are either starting their first year of like you know I_T_E or poly just [ah] tertiary education or like even
on their last year of school
it's just like
it's a very [ah] ya I don't know what to do kind of thing
content morning but game is a
(um)
so it what it's saturday sunday just
ya I mean for school I understand but for work
(uh huh) so so
by monday to friday so she had like rush it through and
damn
I'm just amazed at the fact that okay I mean sure working throughout the weekend but who has a meeting at ten P_M until one A_M okay maybe makes sense because timezone ya
but still
ya
well
okay other than school
but I feel like ya well
we all trying our best [lor] so
you know they were like like what you said just now like [oh] I did back in my days it was easier and then like now is just like there's so much competition there's so much you know if you want to study for example nursing a lot of people are taking nursing now because of the pandemic and then [ah] you know like now even the tourism industry is just basically dead
you know like (err) ya and then like it's it's just sad because
so much time wasted so many people getting retrenched and everything
I mean at least we get to you know some of us maybe we are from like
[ah] from our business background then we go into like
medical background or like vice versa you know that works also
but I don't know how it will play out after
how many years [lah] I feel like
it will stay for quite long
getting
no no it's just about the world we we never mention any ya
ya but but also like culture wise you know like I feel like there's still this thing about tattoos and going around
ya and I thought that you know at work it was like some kind of offense you know with the law that [oh] you cannot have tattoos but then when I ask around is just is just the culture
or any kind of physical [ah] body modifications I was about to say mutilations
ya but
it's nice [oh] especially it's just weird that
you know if you go to poly university can colour your hair you can do whatever but then like
ya brown dark brown
slightly dark
ya but (hmm) that's it
it's just chicken that has been un-raw
ya
I mean it's not it's it won't affect
you know it's just
ya
ya and it's as long as you do your work you do your part that's fine you don't have to like [oh] because she got she got tattoo [lah] he he got piercings [ah] you know he got piercings on the eyebrow and then just like how is that distract you you just don't look ya that's it
ya but I just hope
how to say I guess our generation we have things to look out for right
ya
ya and hopefully all the other things happening will be great [lah] right right

so the
so
ya ya ya ya ya so exact obviously it's a school trip so obviously you have to learn about all the
not not even the worst bro because it's because I think that's
are you sure

but
but it's not as bad as this [oh] that [one] was it before SARS or no
I think it's before SARS
(mm)
[ah] it wasn't
[oh]
I know it was a big thing in singapore [ah] but it's just for what because we were
[eh] is there I'm not sure though is there I mean I don't think so if I'm not wrong they say there isn't any
it looks a like flu [ah] like you know COVID is like a flu also
ya if I'm not wrong if I not mistaken
ya ya so
[kan] [kan]
[kan]
[kan]
but then again if you think about it the possibilities of you getting the virus in singapore what's the possibility though
[kan]
ya
community hospital basically
yes not for surgery kind of thing
ya it's also
ya ya
yes yes yes
ya that's why
ya
that's why
ya
ya but in the first place there is so many
ya
expats expats
I didn't know expats were okay sorry expats ya
ya
true true true
[oh]
[oh] #jurong# island
ya then that's why that time [ah] I don't know don't know whether it's a
should be [lah] right
ya
it's not good [ah]
should be [lah] I don't know
oil right why is oil good
that's the thing
ya
(um) so how is school these days
ya true
october
you know
(um)
then
sarah also [oh]
me and #nashrul# all meet [ah]
cause sarah also busy with her C_C_A
but
then supposedly my C_C_A is like tuesday and thursday
but (um) now we like on campus training instead of virtual so ya
then I think semester two
which is I'm not ready because
it's physically and mentally tired
ya
so (um)
when your exam start bro
at the company and not choose to
at the company and not choose to
go and continue
for me like for example [eh]
(um) I would consider [ah] because it's really
challenging then having to do assignments all over again
exhausting [ah] like what I see that's why I really
then for me also like my G_P_A results it's (um) released on like I think one october and then my diploma courses also [eh] will be released on the email email
then ya but it's like (um) because actually there's two
phase for my diploma course first is the interview phase another
so like
maths [jer] for that day so like after that day they will like grade us [oh] how much will we get like A B C then ya
then after that like
if you have a lot of Cs means like probably your G_P_A will be around like two to two point five which is
not what I want [lah] of course my expe~ expectation is higher
my A also my mod~ my A
I think is not a lot also
then
so like
(um)
it's okay
which is ya like
like almost all of my classmate if if I ask if I were to ask them [oh] what course do you want to pick like why is your first choice they would say like biomedical science that's for sure (um) and then after that but biomedical science also like biology wise [kan] and like a lot of
biology then because like sec five
I never take biology so like it's a bit hard for me [lah] then my daily grade from
like it's important subject [lah]
so ya (um)
then
for sure but (um) for my co~ actually for me right
like this course is also okay like poly life for me is like manageable [lah]
teacher will give us like (uh) practice questions to do
[eh] eleven five nine
but
right this question for biology is like
so hard even if you revise you before you want to do practice question there is like
so hard
like every time (um)
like our teacher will ask us to highlight the key points when answering the question but the thing is you don't even know what's the key point you know then how you want to (um) type it in the answer
that is hard actually then presentation for R_P is
damn lazy to do the powerpoint and stuff and then you have to write scripts like what you have to say before (um) [eh] like when you presenting and all
then (um) for me [kan] like during secondary school also when presenting right I cannot impromptu I always must prepare script because like I can't impromptu
like impromptu is just like my weakness like if I have script then
whatever I say [kan] confirm doesn't make sense
so like ya cause my english also is quite
bad honestly for me like because my vocal also
not that good so ya (um)
ya
and then
also ya
cannot cooperate with you
it is
gonna be hard you know
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
ours
is different [seh] we like on that day [kan] the presentation on that day you have to [ah] prepare your slides and everything then they give like about three hours for you to do powerpoint slides and then like script a bit after that after
I'm like is this even lunch break might as well just put it as study break [lah] [kan]
ya
(mm)
and it was (uh) two hour just either sleep they to write you off a camera thing of my mic slept then but still there was a assuming given at the end of lesson then I was like
ya
(mm)
(mm) no really like
time to spend with your
your other your partner you know
[eh] but for her [kan] NAFA
really
[oh]
[eh] !wow! I didn't know that
[oh] my god that's so much friends
seriously
ya
for sure
I'm proud of myself like !wow!
ya same
same [lah] as my
sister sometimes I also get irritated and annoyed like as you can see (um) every time I go out with my family like everyone is just like on their phones that kind and my dad is always
(um) gone
that's cool I don't know
so was that awkward I never had that
ya after you see like other people's family [kan] is like
okay
(mm)
okay anyway
[ah]
minimalistic
minimalist
(mm) minimalistic
[ah]
[ah]
[a'ah]
okay you
[ah]
master bedroom
(mm)
[orh]
then
who know how to paint
(hmm)
frame
then
that separates the living room and the and the bedrooms
remember [ah] I want to make that wall I want to
what's that
they have the drawer
I want to tear that down
so that it's a wall flat wall
okay from bottom from top to bottom is a flat wall
of anything [ah]
ya
yes yes correct it's like a frame wall
because it's a
it's a walkway [what]
!huh!
(mm)
but I think
I think no need raised floor [lah]
then does it really have a purpose
then
quite isolated from the rest of the room [tau] to mingle
because the the house is big the hall is big
[a'ah]
and then the [one] behind behind the entrance
so if people sit there then you cannot mingle with the people there already
because it's across but then it's quite far
you understand or not
[a'ah]
[ah] [a'ah] [a'ah]
[ah] but we make it minimalistic [ah]
[ah]
(mm)
then I thought
I thought of having the minimalistic dining table like just a normal because the floor is marble [what]
so maybe matching [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
which bedroom the small [one]
(mm)
master (mm)
the second [one] is the second [one] smack you okay then
can
can
okay wait wait wait wait wait the first bedroom
then
you don't want to buy playstation [meh]
sure or not you don't want playstation
you don't use the space to the maximum you know
because it's triangular
(mmhmm)
reading room
okay but how how you want to do how you want to do that
(mm)
okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
it's about knee length [lah]
the raised floor is about knee length
okay
(mm)
okay
[ah]
(mmhmm)
[ah]
L
okay
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
laptop and all
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
because of the weight of the
of the swing itself and
when you sit down you know
[ah]
ya so that [one] need maintenance
(mmhmm)
[kan]
[a'ah]
still
I'm in the same house [what] difference does it make
does it make any difference
I'm still alone
(mm)
let's scrap the swing no swing
okay why not
we switch the swing for
maybe one or two exercise machine
you tell me you want to buy weights [what]
we will
(mm)
then you no weights [ah]
sure or not
(mm)
okay [lah]
then
you'll never know
I don't want I don't want I don't want I don't want
!ee! not helping
(mm)
because okay last time people use T_V console because they got speakers got D_V_D player now don't have already [what] all you sync to your phone want Netflix everything installed inside that's why you buy that kind of T_V right everything is installed inside right so
by right [ah] by right you don't need T_V console but we are buying T_V console temporary because
so that's why you want to buy it from Carousell fifty dollar one
anything [lah] #cincai#
(mm)
ya [lah]
you choose a wall you choose a wall where you want your T_V to be then we just stay like that [lah]
you choose you decide
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh huh)
no
the mount is not inside the inside the wall you know
no the mount is just a hook whereby you screw into the wall
ya
then
ya ya correct
so actually by right right
we cannot move the T_V
because there's only one wall
beside the gate
ya [lah] where you want to move it because
the main wall is right now the T_V the main wall is beside the gate right and then and then after that (uh) beside that wall is already the window
so
you can't really move it anywhere
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
okay fair we can do that
you cannot do that you know
but if you want to move it
(mm)
(uh huh)
[ah] [lah]
(mm)
okay
then I think
this [one] put on the floor
no that [one] you put on the floor
then I think
the L_E_D light
(mm)
ya it will be cool
(mm)
just play with the same colour palette
[ah] and I don't want black white black white black white [ah]
I don't want like that [lah]

(mmhmm)
no I don't want
I don't want
[ah] a lot of money to change cannot [lah]
[ah]
(mm)
[ah] something like that something like that
yes something like that
or or if you want to make it fancy we can go gradient [ah]
let's say let's say we choose green [eh]
[ah] the royal green for our bedroom [eh]
[ah]
because
that [one]
[ah]
get it
yes
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
cannot really see
(mm)
but you still need to buy two colours [mah]
(mmhmm)
[ah] [lah]
(mm)
compared to compared to let's say you want to (uh) do
of paint can already
settle
[a'ah] only one colour
that [one] save money also [ah]
(mmhmm)
two big tubs
(mm)
[ah] [lah] [ah] [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
if I'm not wrong
is around eighty plus dollar
one big tub
(mm)
[ah] eighty plus dollar
and depends on the brand
now they have paint
for your walls that purify air
[ah] serious serious serious
[ah] so the paint on your walls purify air

to either #dabao# or like see if she can like register us in that time we said I'm willing
to go the extra mile
to be registered in but ya
I did I didn't and I was like everyday I eat #mala# I was like
you took it for granted [ah] that's why it's gone now it's your fault it's literally your fault
[ah]

the richness of the flavor [tau]
I didn't like want it to be spicy
ya
ya
I bought Samyang light
ya
ya
(uh)
it's lesser

ya you can barely taste it
do you do you get where I'm like coming from
the ya the the the gravy
but this [one] the calories is lesser so I feel like I'm
it's literally about three hundred seventy calories
and the noo~ but the noodles are slightly thinner but it's the same texture the sauce is like less spicy
no but it doesn't affect much [ah] to me
but the taste to me the sweetness is a bit a bit stronger
[oh] (uh)
your ability to taste is there but it's still very spicy to me I was literally still dying
ya
Samyang
[ah]
the packet [one] not the cup
[oh] okay
serious
[ah]
ya
(um)
(mm) bachelor of

they liaise with the university for us

ninety plus already besides cost of school
ya like for real ya
right
ya

#elisa#
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
okay
super smart okay
how her G_P_A is like almost like it is like three point eight kinda vibes
no but if she has a four point O it will be known [tau] because usually that is like honour roll
people get four point O in their courses usually like
like is broadcasted to the whole cohort
like during the process do people like the does the teacher like favour her
[oh]
daphne also four point O

(mm)
[oh]
[a'ah] yes
ya
okay okay okay I mean everyone has that like dream that they want to go overseas right
like why would they want to come back because their university degree cert is mostly applicable there [what]
ya
loan right is a very risky
I don't I don't think singaporean I think it was from china I I can't remember [ah] I honestly can't remember
ya so within like five year he can pay it off
[oh] ya they have minimum wage ya that's right that's right
singapore like university degrees I think like three thousand like I find that quite like
low [ah] to be honest
which one
that's all [ah] he can pay it off in five years it's like a it's like a return on investment kind of vibe [ah]
but ya
but it's still a bit risky [ah] like what if I can't find a job
[kan]
ya but I mean I'm just putting it out there into the universe about the overseas thing
cause I'll obviously try my best to go into a local [lah]
like no matter what
it's quite scary [ah] to be honest
go overseas and everything
ya
(um)
like my class is number two like there's five classes so O one O two O three O four
ya
but I would not choose a class
[kan] what course right

the TikTokers in general
do you notice how
as a person
super
no she is
she is like serious she has like millions
I know #avani# is not as famous as the rest
even james I feel like james couldn't even like hold conversations with her
like as a person she doesn't have that personality that
is linked to a influencer
ya she's just like any other introvert
who just got this fame and then she doesn't know how to talk like at least with all these you should learn how to talk right
but you don't
she's a good dancer but does she deserve hundred million do you agree
ya because it com~ it literally convert
okay
to be on a record like none of the TikTokers because it literally it's just fifteen second videos
it's just fifteen second videos I think
ya but if you have this fame you should at least learn [lah] to
ya
ya
ya period bro nothing on them
ya
ya
do you think she's interesting
no when when we talk about influencers we don't talk about talking to them do you think they have a lot of personality because that's like the
a main selling point like james charles he's so interesting
no he has an it factor
that's what I'm trying to say
ya
he's
(mmhmm)
(um) talented
like legit it's legit just (uh)
period
going out and drinking coffee

it's like having an anxiety attack but like #intenser#
after that
like for thirty minutes later ya I I literally like I don't know it was so bad
ya
it's the white coffee [tau] you know it's like basically caffeine like zero per cent [eh] zero point one per cent that kind of vibe
ya
and knowing that I have like
caffeine like resistance and like all these like bad stuff
anxiety a bit
ya
I feel like it's worse that I didn't pass out because I get to feel everything except black out you know
so I feel like it's unfair like let me pass out bro just take me in
what
ya
ya

ya it's it's basically just to get your money [lah]
it's so useless even if you pass fail it doesn't matter you just have to go through the simulator
then it will be easy
then you should do final theory ASAP also
final theory is more to me final theory is harder than
theory
no it's different content also you memorise a whole different set
I think I took like two hours memorising everything
ya
I did it in like legit like eight minutes
like I entered
like by a minute or two everyone's already doing it

the same thing right asthma right ya
like that is so
why
you know one of my assign~ (uh) one
it's like very controlled [seh]
like well managed
ya ya maybe that's why also
like america
region also
really
for like base~ not for like what what's the difference
[oh] okay okay okay
when they are better
just for just for
ya but when [ah]
wait #ng teng fong# really
[oh] that's why it's like so big
so like east wing is basically like the major [one] and the other wing is actually the community hospital [lah]
(hmm)
ya
the house itself and how it's suppose to look like later
[oh]
I mean now because of COVID I don't think so
they take a lot of aspect to be honest
same [lah] same like saudi like they take a lot of ex~ expats
ya ya foreigners to come work ya
ya
I know so sad [kan]
ya
oil I mean saudi [kan] oil
ya
oil also #jurong# island ya
oil [oh]
yo low-key me too
I mean I don't know
ya
raw oil
there's no there's no stain at all you know but like literally I could smell like the petroleum
even thought there wasn't stain or anything
school is fine but it is very boring (um) because
all of the other courses already have their holiday and
and we business school
still have not had our holiday
like
Y-
like from other courses [kan]
like jess all you want to meet up but then like our schedule is
very different it's like
and then that's all so it's very boring and depressing
go eat together
then when your school start
true
(mm) ya
(mm)
(mm)
my exam start
around the same time as A level
but
because I take four modules two term five modules like including like the sports and wellness but then now like
(uh) in the because we have like college west
east right
and then (err) west and east they don't
like because in I_T_E like
thirty percent of your
thirty percent of your overall behaviour like thirty percent is from your B_A_H your behaviour
(um)
elementary business analytics and cyber security E_B_A and E_B_A and life skill is like type A module so we don't take exam for that we just take like (uh)
tests we take tests we take (uh) we do assignments we do (uh)
like stuck class task group task all and then that is our like final grade [lah] like our participation you know
like tasks and assignments in the class all and then for
(um)
how we are supposed to like treat the customer then how like we supposed to like analyse data then make like
(uh) op~ like
[ah] I talk about like first
[ah] seek first to understand than to be understood is that kind of stuff is like le~ things you learn through life [lah]
then then but we have two other modules which is business rewriting and early childhood [ah] that one is a type B module so we must do assignments like we do everything that we we do the same thing as like what we did in like
(um)
E_B_A and
what's the thing
E_B_A and
P_P_D life skill but then like this one we have exams so we have like chapters to learn and all so our my first exam is like fourteen september and which is B_W_P exam and then second exam is sixteen september so you only have two exams then after that we can go for our break
somehow we can go for our break then like they will release the result online then you look at your result online [jer] [lah] but then it's very complicated because like
(uh) what kind of mental disorder what kind of like
(uh) mental di~ (uh) mental disabilities is
a lot to that
and then
(um) minutes of meeting notice of meeting taking like notes when you have meetings is
a lot of writing like one you have
in exam paper you have com~ comprehension
section each comprehension and then you have letter email notice of meeting
and then [ah] like another one is what ya I forgot but there's another component and then you only have one hour thirty minute so you must like
very very fast like really fast
but then like there is a lot of content
so like multiple choice just do it just like pass through that get average thing
lowest mark should be like
twenty
hard part but then like
we are looking forward like (err) after finishing exam right
we forget that sometimes it is still we're not ending our first year in december then we are ending our first year like next year april because started in april then now it's just first semester and then sometimes like when we think about it we are like
we have been this school for like so long we have been like in the first semester for so long like we do so much project we did like what five project work and so many
damn tiring
it's very tiring and I do not
really want to like
continue continue like this for a long period of time I just want to like two weeks break and just like go to sleep
like really let's like spend the day like sleeping I didn't even want to go out I want go out but
so it's just but I just want to sleep
cause like now even now they are preparing us for like poly life they asking us what poly you want to go and I'm just like [oh] my god we just stay in the first semester why [ah] why you thinking about poly but then like we have to think about poly cause ultimately some of them don't want to continue this course like you can tell
(mm)
(mm)
I think like
I think we're in I_T_E also same I find it hard working in teams honestly cause like I'm the type that I like to
(uh)
(mm)
the classmate cause we have a group like forty people
(uh)
quite a large number of people in one class forty forty one
and then secondly is
(uh)
how you
well you work with people and thirdly is like
the different opinions that people have because you are going to be somehow like you my course you are going to
be a teacher you have to work with a lot of different people in the area people cannot speak english people that cannot speak
like
people they want people can only speak chinese then people that can like
how you
but then I find it very like
even
like
it's better if you can finish earlier [kan] in a sense but then
perfectionist like on
point and he has differing thoughts from mine
like where we stand [lah]
because he is the type of person that think very like
[oh] he doesn't think outside the box often
he thinks like inside a box like shoot my rules person then I'm not that kind that kind of person somehow I'm the type that I like to talk about it then like I think other ways
is that kind of thing
but then like it's very hard because like
like because you can't I think you're other classmates don't do it you're gonna get A you want get high marks just because you did it but in my class is very competitive they're not stupid people you know they are really not stupid people like
there are people who score like eighteen
then after that
some people come into our class thinking that come to I_T_E thinking that okay this is going to be easy right cause I_T_E gives a lot of the scholarships
scholarships and more [lah] a lot of like opportunities for students
our class is my class it's very competitive like
like a lot of the things we learn like more like less
le~
even that for even for me that is very hard cause like to adapt
to being in like (uh)
like secondary school
but
at the end I produce like good results but then now like
it will be like very like easy right
I'm like then my friend is from early childhood poly then she is like
(uh)
guidelines for how certain age you're supposed to like talk by what age you are supposed to talk by what age you need to walk then that kind of stuff but we have to memorize that kind of stuff then we talk about the brain like temporal frontal lobe
the parietal lobe then I'm just like [oh] okay then was like in unit what unit six that we learn about that kind of stuff and then when I look back I'm just like
[oh] my god
same things as like a normal teacher do like all all is linked somehow then it becomes like
when you realise that how hard
that this is gonna be right cause from the
damn
this is gonna be hard and then [ah] I'm like I'm not even in poly that's the thing
not a lot of paths for you to go
you know that
or you want to sign contract with N_I_E_C and just work for a few months
(uh) for a few years and like
cause that's what I want to learn [what] since my points didn't get me to achieve that but then now that I have the opportunity [kan] I just want to go for like child psychology
I don't know somehow like girls are better at planning their paths
like I is no shade to guys there's not shade but we think about the future a lot which is like overthinking [lah] we think about the future a lot but like okay is this gonna be like
a smooth journey what am I going to do next like the thing won't even come don't even bother and I'm thinking about uni I know that I want to go to
cause it's a very even on twitter you are like [ah] you guys look down on I_T_E but then like you must experience that I_T_E cause it's fun it's really like fun it's like secondary school but upgrade
cause now people are more mature so like less drama and just small fun and then you get along with everybody everybody is like
you know it's very fun but then like obviously now
cause first of all we never when teacher first cause when you first enter I_T_E [kan]
what do you want what is your achieve what do you want to achieve
and where is your next step that is what
they asked and like we go around the room
so like we already we all have our own end goal this is where we stop that kind of stuff
when you go uni you fighting with J_C J_C secure spot obviously they are clever people then you fighting if with poly which is clever people you don't know who yet there is no saying that I_T_E is not clever but we are slower in learning pace
that kind of stuff I think
I I realise at certain point if I_T_E is this hard
that is the shock and then I think
go to poly after I_T_E
I_T_E
it's gonna be hard in poly cause poly is more like tough
then we just one person do then everybody speak out like now my group has become like usually we it's a group work but now it's like I do the slide and I just separate the part
language I am okay with it but I'm more to english in a sense cause
in early childhood if you get at least a
if you get C five right you have to retake
like ego is what
good thing about I don't want to say good thing about COVID it but the great thing about online learning is you record a lot or your lecture
then but I still there was assignment given at the end of your lesson then I was like
okay now I have to do assignment but I didn't learn anything cause I (uh) sleeping
it's a good day but then it's like
eighteen it's not such a young age but it's not such a old age either it's in the middle there at least [eh] there are people that want to get married you know marriage is like (ugh)
older and more responsibility in a sense
and then [ah] one of
at eighteen you find out a lot about yourself
what kind of person you are yourself discovery journey is eighteen what kind of person you are what
who is your real friends who is your friends and who is just your acquaintance these three groups of people
and then she say then you realise are you a relationship person or are you not
like how are you coping with your relationship it cause like
I would choose studies [lah] if a guy said I want you to stay home when you get wraps up
no I'm not marrying you (uh) I want to like I want to have like education I want to work I want to travel the world
she
don't cause she wants she said after she graduated [ah] she want to take one year break
just
she want to take one year break then I'm like that's a long time bro one year of your life what you gonna do but then I also respect
cause taking a break is something that
NAFA is poly after she finish NAFA she graduate
she can work she is basically a college
[kan]
you know you can join us you know cause you know what megan me and #aqil# are going there for
(err) early childhood cause their programme that early childhood is very strong and then megan is going there for science like food science I think you can go there then we can all get a
apartment stay together it's gonna be so much fun but #hada# don't want to go
studying a lot
she more ex~ prioritise experience and I kind of understand that
(mm)
there's no right or wrong
in a sense there's no right or wrong but it's just that there's people more like
you don't want them who struggle in a sense
ya I feel
(mmhmm) it's like
there's no such thing as no free no care like to me in singapore right your education really somehow determine
that's that's total like
ya that's total like a lie like we all know it determines who we are as a I'm always like e~ every
year right at the end of every year right
I can understand why they put pressure cause we talk
like like
plans like of like timeline I have a timeline of my life what I want to accomplish like I don't have my dad already set by twenty five then can bring back home guy
bring back home you don't get married you know bring back home guy so I have like (ugh) and then now what another like
nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five
seven years to find my one but then like I don't focus on that
like cause now
yes
the crying no non-stop
that kind of thing
the cry non-stop right then but then
to me I don't know in a sense right
like okay I want
a boyfriend but then
somehow
when I realise can
like how to say [ah]
I'll be like you focus on your life I focus on my life
we'll see where it goes [lah]
I mean like
even with my ex I didn't know you know despite all the off and ons right we dated for like what
two years two years and half like that's a long time
like that's a pretty long time [lah] but then like then you realise at the end already right
how I am
you have a lot of happiness in you
because my friends say you number one when you break up [eh]
like that's not good
it's but [ah] then you get get okay can be there then you just like I'm fine I'm the greatest person then you
spend that that days like okay I'm actually that good and you focus on yourself
that's what I've been doing for the past like two years I think I beat up a lot of myself I'm like the
like I think this year
changed me a lot
somehow COVID [kan]
I now I know like who I want to be friends with
like during this period of time now I know who I want to be close with like I have you I have like the other girls I have like even #raziq# sometime although he's gone most of the time I try to understand cause you never know what's going in a
person's life like there is a lot of things that
I would say that the start the twenty twenty the start of twenty twenty january #imelda# is different from
september #imelda# now in the sense cause I'm more like
okay because I feel like I've been like living my life
you know that kind of thing
we talk a lot less spend then second most is like with the girls the other girls then third is #raziq#
like I is mostly because I spend a lot of time with family and that's the best thing you know cause they can
appreciates family time a lot like he really loves I think when I was in sec actually [ah] I hangout a lot with my friends like sec four I can talk a lot with them
then I realise like how
checks up on our like
(uh) she checks up on like our locations
then she check up on our like
(uh)
like with with her phone she can switch off our phone like time in time out but then like
then my brother my brother would ask a lot of question
but then we will give and she just download it and she just install it we didn't even know
I don't ever feel personally I don't feel angry
in a sense [lah]
cause
[ah]
we just like (uh)
cause
but [ah] same to me [ah]
(mm) cause is I think my family is like that you know then you know the one good thing is we don't hide anything from each other
naturally when I had boyfriend I tell my mum and my dad actually they don't
that kind of stuff cause the guys that I date tie me down
okay
especially during B_M_T
you will trans~ your transitioning from a civilian into a soldier and then like
you have to throw everything away and then like you lost your rhythm [ah]
so ya and then like
okay [lah] they teach you a lot about like
[ah] regimentation and discipline which you are really not use to
it's miserable [lah] everytime I'm working right ya
so you have anything that like interesting you want to ask
[ah] that's what I used to think [lah] because
when I when I became a recruit at #tekong# I thought it's going to be the hardest part of my life [ah]
but honestly when
into inventory
is basically [ah]
it's like it's like way way way harder
is like B_M_T times ten [ah]
like even though you got your privileges like you can keep your hair a bit
and then you are treated nicely [what]
no no
when I went to #kranji# camp into inventory unit right
so basically I'm treated well I'm treated better but the exercises are getting way harder
sly
is like
even even though you are treated fairly [ah] but the the exercises are even more like strenuous
ya
ya
[ah] B_M_T basically you are treated like
like less than human [ah]
then
but not as often
ya way better [ah] but
I even though N_S is hard right
is the I think once I O_R_D right
I will really miss it [ah] all the achievement that I have right
ya it's like I didn't expect that
like I managed to go through it
ya
ya one year pass by [what]
is like I have a bear with it
so ya but I got a lot of achievements [ah] is something that I didn't expect that I can do
is like is really like
break your
your capabilities what you are capable of
[ah]
ya okay
okay so
basically my
achievement right okay
when I P_O_P
before I P_O_P the twenty four K_M not much
from the first day we move up from five P_M
and we finish the next day at two A_M working with all the maximum load with all weapons and
and then I'm left with like
four kilometres left right to the marina float
cannot even feel my own legs [ah]
it's like
like is the most miserable thing ever
but the thing that makes you like really push on because you know that your family is going to see you
so I (uh)
and then like
you know that someone is waiting there
and then like and then the the fun thing is
and then I I let them (um) try on my bag [ah] my full pack
(hmm) all [ah]
all of them
and then like (oo) no I don't want to carry this again
and then okay [lah] that is P_O_P that is twenty four K that is so big [ah]
and then
the another one is when I got my green beret
(um)
the send us out
to #lim chu kang# cemetery
at three three or two thirty A_M
and then I was inside the bus looking out the window
I'm like [oh] my god S A F
who who who who who does things like these two A_M come on and then is two A_M until like
that same day eight P_M we didn't even stop
ya and then at eight P_M at night that is where they presented us our beret then like
!wah! #shiok# [ah] (hmm)
(hmm)
hap~
happy of course [lah]
if is like you will not just happy that we got the beret because we are happy with
I don't want to do that thing anymore that's why we are happy when we we are the most happiest when we are inside the civilian bus back to get camp
it's like aircon imagine in jungle
and then like soft cushioned your your transitioning from laying down on the soil
(err)
(uh) is that bad you know one of my friend who
you know about #tekong# water
the our water doesn't come from new water it comes from a reservoir from #tekong#
and the water have (err) certain minerals that is good for you
is very nature [lah] and then it's straight from the reservoir to the water cooler
and it taste it taste like (ugh) it taste so bad
and then there's this one point where during the confinement week my buddy the #toh#
[ah] you don't know (err) military term #toh# that means [ah] basically you pass out [ah] or you just fall out [ah] some sort like that
during exercise no no he just wasn't feeling well and he passed out on the first parade
so he was sent out
and then (err) he
and then in the few days he head back and then he ask me [eh] you want to taste singapore water or not
it's like
because that plain water is so nice
and #tekong# isn't the !duh! [eh] ya
[oh] [eh] [ah]

it's a future that is not promise to you
like if as if like you have a job when you have a job like all your promise like are going to get paid monthly just
you just follow orders and just do your your own stuff and then
but this [one] is like you are not confirm that you going to make it or not
so is very stressful
so it's like
it's like you're gambling you're gambling it away [ah] you gambling all your N_S savings away [ah]
I like that's why I like trying to save up money for my after N_S life
so ya
and I plan to also

the tap the screen to skip when like nine of it is like you watch and then it's not funny at all then you waste you time
then
okay swipe up [lah] sorry [lah] that I saw people use tiktok right is basically like that after one thing they show another thing they show another thing and then like
and then like the first one is funny and then the other nine is not and then you are wasting your time I rather like use youtube because you can learn a lot from it
like what you want to learn about
like recently
I learnt about (err)
like photography and photoshop
so basically (err) after I O_R_D
during the like
the stages where I'm trying to build my portfolio and
trying to get ready for competition right

supplements before and
after is everywhere is like I'm literally everywhere and
to me
every account is very boring some of them like
there's instances where we have
where
it's it's about bodybuilding much he's funny
but
I want to make a instagram account where
where I want to show the world and !hey! bodybuilding is more than just a sport is a lifestyle and art
so when I take photos I would like take photos like as if
you know those seventies era black and white photos there's like
like like like really good looks like statue is artistic is like very artistic so that is what I want to do is I think is very different [ah]
ya

[oh] no to me
technology now [kan]
technology now is to the point where
it's so good especially phones
can be anything like what's the point of buying calculator and having inside your phone what's the point of having like
video camera when your phone is like
you also want to travel like
you don't want to
walk around with a backpack
with a your your D_S_L_R and then another lands and then you have your phone and then you need to have a spare battery for your camera
so technology right now is like
is good [ah] how is progressing [ah]
ya ya (mm) S twenty plus [ah]
I I decided to buy a S twenty plus instead of S twenty ultra
photo focus issue
and then S twenty plus is the same performance as ultra so
so ya it cost only I think eight hundred plus
nine hundred
but
ya
just the phone itself
ya so get that phone [ah] I bet you like taking photos right
(mm)
okay
okay
okay ya ya you need like a
you need a phone camera that has
no just ask them any camera phones that
because
when customers look at your live right
and then use this the quality of the view and they see the hear the audio

most of the time right like those new customers they won't stay in because they barely can hear them and the speaker the microphone is like
ya but you need to up your game [ah]

ya
[kan]
[oh] ya ya like if you have like like a premium

okay
but
that means you need good lighting is not the camera
okay

so and is quite quite long [lah] but what I heard is that whenever they say paradise now right
after like a tech right you know what's a paradise now
it means mission complete so when they say paradise now means
[ah] then you're done already [ah]
it's now it's paradise you have nothing to worry about them

like thirty percent of N_S is also is becoming a cleaner
I'm not kidding

(um) except for canteen
we clean it
some sort like specialised thorough cleaning
where soldiers are we not like [ah]
they don't hire us spec~ specially for
but we have always to clean toilet [ah] every week
every week clean toilet clean bunk clean corridor clean gym
clean clean lamp clean parade square
(mm)
you you have to clean [oh] kitchen [what] right
(mm)
(mm)
your practical practical [kan]
of course [lah] is
your
I bet there would be
labelled for doing certain things like for example
like (um) in camp
we have one idiot
(mm)
okay
(um)
ya [lah] you what secondary school [eh]
college
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
okay
confirm you the most irritating one I bet
shy [one]
(mm)
!wah!
luckily you're not in army [sia]
because they have things like this
like (um) like my position is like I'm
second in charge in for company H_Q [eh] no no
(uh) platoon six H_Q
so basically I'm some sort like under the
is like you have to do jobs like as you
you are a sergeant
and then
everytime before we move out for a mission
they have like a briefing briefing room only two I_C will be there
so basically our commanders will give us what to do how to attack everything
like they they draw on the whiteboard
and then
after that we go back to our what section
and then we'll build them
(um)
I no
I wanted to be I wanted to be a commander not a two I_C
I wanted to lead because of the pay
right now I lead I have the same pay as a trooper
okay okay
(hmm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
I know
depends on the depends on your bully
depends on to what extent
and then
when because
everytime everytime like
whenever he's he's trying to chase a girl
he will put on this like this personality
like okay there's this one time
!wah! he says skater
that's because he wants to impress someone
so funny like what
is is like [ah]
like I really miss my I_T_E life [ah]
(um) what do you mean which one li only have one I_T_E life ya
[oh] two campus [ah] no but I love my I_T_E life [ah] I_T_E #choa chu kang#
that that [one] you [ah] cannot blame your stupidity [lah]
because you you don't want to said it like I live at #choa chu kang# then I go back to balestier when there's a #choa chu kang# campus there ya [lah]
so I agree [lah] you agree to my statement [ah] thank you so much nurse nurse is see me
(oo) but college central is such a big school [eh]
once I went there to collect my award after like I graduated right
(err) my my my brain is like melted when I saw that school
why
(um)
that's why I love primary school it's so cute so small
and then like your class so near and then !yay! recess and then it's like what
or at least one minute away
at least I hate my poly life [lah]
they can that one campus there's like five canteen
and then every single canteen is far
and it's crowded the food is not nice is expensive
and then so stuffy
it's such a horrible school I hate singapore poly singapore poly is the worst school level
is
is I repeated one year because I'm just not interest
like to me right
I_T_E is like progressing way better than poly well to me like one day like
one day like a diploma in polytechnic will be so obsolute
like I learn a lot from I_T_E even though it's two years and my poly is like four years I retain a lot of knowledge when I was in I_T_E
but back in poly [ah] it's just that I have to study this just to pass
that's the mentality of it so is not really a good school
and then like there's a lot of assignments so is like
you don't really have your own time [lah] outside ya
that is ya I have a diploma in electrical electronic engineering but
that you you I told you already that what I want to do after O_R_D right
but that diploma is basically just to
is a backdrop career so like if at all else failed right
I have something [lah]
that I can
work [lah] but
honestly I don't want to [ah] I don't want to be electrical engineer
[eh] in in may seem like a electrical technician it may seem easy job but I don't want I don't it is just not me I just love bodybuilding that's it like I felt that I was born to body build
like when I was young right even before I started lifting weights when I see like heroes like arnold #schwarzenegger# at when I was like really young was like or inspired
that was like I was eight years old
and it's like
!wah!
there's a lot of foreign talent
like I want to stand out from the crowd
I want to be that guy
I don't want to be just a normal person
like is blended altogether in society I just want to stand out
ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
(um) ya right now singapore you are competing with foreign talents
because in the end I_T_E wins right
(um)
P P
is like
why why why would you spend that amount of money on private
ya
those are those people who have like private diploma
once they get a job
you must really stick to the job for quite a long time
so like by the time move to the second job right people want to hire you based on your experience ya but initially is hard
that's why like why I_T_E boasts about or within three months all our students got a job
that's what I_T_E like to boost especially ya
the ya the banner
on top right
and then they always boast like that seventy percent of our students got a job within three months of graduating
(mm)
is it like your your challenging the I_T_E students
it's very hard
ya but it's hard ya
because they don't know what they learn
because okay
when you go to
is a government you know government school [eh] I_T_E let's say for example most everyone went to I_T_E and they know what is taught there
but but your I_T_E cert~ is different
ya
but is is NITEC
but why is it
I thought you only I thought you will just only saying this because of like
culinary jobs

singapore is quite messed up [ah]
this one the reason why a lot of citizens
feel like they don't belong in singapore
right
ya
ya but but singapore is good because it's such a safe place
that's the good but
singapore right I think it's progressing so fast
that people cannot keep up
can tolerate that way
look at
okay singapore progress in fifty years
in fifty plus years of third world country officiating port in the world like a first world country okay
you see [ah]
because we progress so fast ya ya but when you look at overseas right those people at of aged right they can use like
they are able to cope because their progressing slowly
like
when was america found it
like what year was it is more than a hundred years right
it's more than a hundred years but singapore you become third world to first world in like fifty years that is very fast people cannot keep up
see how stressful it is
it's like not a lot of people like

business management with comms
ya just like one question like the running of it you know [lah]
it's quite interesting but like
with like everything going on at work like I wonder if it's even worth it you know like what's the point of it all
I guess
like what's the point to like doing anything
if the world is going to fall apart
business
[oh] that time
ya
yes still still there was still some profits [ah] it's that
ya now I'm just too busy with school so I cannot do that or inside job

ya I better not gonna sell anytime soon [ah] honestly
feels like it's it's so much time and like
I I'm not gonna realise any any profits if I sell now definitely
cause right the state of the game now it's like so bad
[oh] then
honestly [ah] if it comes wrong then I'm I'm just like whatever man like
ya I'm really just like kind of like given up on the game already
ya just like I mean
the money somehow translate to that so okay [lah]
ya
ya
ya they should at least like I mean they should at least like balance it out [what]
I don't know like to keep like the business going and shit like that
I mean like you still owe it to but your customers will be like
they #sian# about how you manage the game
like reservice
ya
so annoying all these capitalist vultures
they are they are the main reason why is is this pandemic to you state that you please
there's always sole reason why
ya
[orh]
when was that
really
[oh]

snail
snail god [eh]
okay I ask you this
if you were to be given a chance to choose between good looks or fit body which would you go for
for yourself and another person
as in like your soul part your
your dream partner
think if it were me
between good looks and a fit body right I would go for their credit card
that's the only only reason why you should be very
no I think
no I think good looks also I feel like good looks is more more sustainable
if you're superficial
if you're superficial
ya
ya I think after awhile you will get tired of looking at a person's body
I don't know think face is like more more personal and like more adoring right
ya
like
looking good ya
so what you're going to do after this
today or any other day
[orh]
you shave it [jer] [lah]
really as in like shave
how [sia]
when less less care about
why [sia] think you look good [what]

(mm) I don't know about that
god
house with a farm attached
with a garage attached
with a arcade attached
it's all considered one
ya actually ya that that's that's that's really good
ya he have a house we can just chill inside doesn't leave it for anywhere
ya
people only people just work they get a house and then they die
ya but like
it should be free right
like houses housing
like nobody ask
before they just work
like this is the place
and you need a place to stay
so you make a place for yourself
that's why should be free
#yishun#
island [eh] !wow!
[oh]
(uh) what's the island what's the island by #punggol# called [ah]
you know the one in ya there is
there's an island by #punggol# I forgot what it's called but it has like a solitary cow
ya as in like cow
ya it's like a random cow that just stroll there I don't know how they nobody knows how it it got there and then like people go to the island and they tried to look for the cow then they say if
you saw that cow right it's like a bad omen for you that means there's like something something else nearby
you know what I mean here
and it's off it's like off limit at night
it's only open in the day I forgot what it's called [lah]
[oh] yes coney island coney island yes yes yes
it's it's very near here
ya I can go
[eh] let's go
I feel like going I want to look for that cow
nobody knows
ya
I think it's more interesting how the cow ended up there
I guess ya
(oo) maybe ya
I guess what happened
I think I was thinking that like
#kampong glam#
!wah! serious [ah] [oh] I think I heard of that
[eh]
wasn't it our E_D
[oh] was it
it's the one that you posted on instagram right
the one the girl with the bangs is it
right
[oh] ya I remember that
(mm)
ya
but
were they trying to co~ colonize area
[orh]
but is it like a relatively close to like the surrounding flats
!wah! that's cool
(mm)
!wah!
that's really nice [eh] I want I want to move there [sia]
I want to go visit
I want to visit
but is it really dark at night
so it's quite big [ah]
the place
[orh] [orh]
[orh] so you guys didn't actually like explore further inside [ah]
I feel like she is one who's scaring people people never saw anything
ya I would want move there just cause it's like peaceful I guess
like away from everybody else
away from civilization even though it's just next door
and you have friends also
in a sense
but that means the auntie just live alone [ah]
I mean alone with her friends
M_B_S
all the nature reserves [lor]
right I always thought of like going you know but I like don't want to be out in the sun
think that's why they normally go at like seven eight A_M so
ya but that is also an issue
for
I just I just like the deserted areas I know there's like a
nature reserve near #mandai# area there it's like a hidden
ya
then recently there's been news about it where people talk about it place it's like really unknown then people got something to explore that area
that's like really cool
ya
yes
actually I don't know [eh]
the animals all wear masks
the features [ah]
[oh] ya
they do actually
ya
they should just
let it be free
#pulau semakau# the place coney island
ya
can't remember
ya I mean compared to you [lah]
I guess I mean not as if you're supposed to go every week or something [kan]
thing is three years is quite okay [lah] [kan]
ya it's quite sad
especially like the the cat enclosures
it's like
as in the big cats [lah]
they just like pacing around
cause they just like pacing around right they like big cats they supposed to be like roaming around
ya
and then they just like keep there inside what glass
semi-glass enclosure
then they just walking back and forth
just like restless
they should be free
it's still around right
[oh] ya
I forgot [ah]
what is he doing here man
should put it in freezer right
[oh] ya that's what they mentioned they got it as a gift or something
from #yishun#
you never went
!huh!
no
it wasn't around in secondary school
what you talking about
maybe sec four [ah]
what
you probably just saw like
the construction
like some hibiscus on the floor
I think it's either here or botanic gardens
marina bay gardens
ya twenty twenty it's exactly it's like sec four
[orh]
ya so you were looking at the construction
hibiscus on the floor
but there's nothing to look at
opening
got things inside
they open the door
fifty million what
what !huh!
as of
I thought one year
who would go to that place
I mean ya ya
it is pretty like
makes you wonder like where our money is going to
plants and #changi# airport
I think they spent at least
thirty dollars on #changi# airport
that's where all our money went to
that's why everything is increasing
yes correct
that's exactly
where all our money go to
!hais!
ya
actually ya I would also
same I would also ask for a house as well
ask for a house
and then ask to be (uh) happy and then ask to never worry about anything anymore
I think that's a lot of like
with three wishes
[oh] shit
genie
you [eh] what's the other two wishes
a drop shipper
he will be richer than jeff bezos and then I will put him in jail
that's my second wish
and my third wish I put myself in jail for being that rich also
if you cannot imagine that amount of money
then you cannot wish
you cannot wish properly
why a H_D_B
every year you'll get a new COVID so you'll be a
multi billionaire
that's cool
that's big though
!huh!
[oh] never worrying about anything
having a house
being happy and never worrying about anything
okay [lah] I change my never worrying seems like
it's it's too vague
[ah]
what would I want
[ah]
I think just like a sick amount of money to spend
ya
I think that that somehow relate back to like not being worried about anything
money is like all of our issues
why
why you wish that
bro~
that's cheating
did you see the did you see there was this video
(uh)
no it was like I think there's this kid as well
there was this guy wishing
wishing for like with a genie right then he was like saying ya I wish for you to be
free genie
and then the genie was like but if you if you were to wish me to be free then he was like supposed to be like happy for him and all right
then
I would just fade into I will breathe in and die
and then he dies so it's actually a good thing like the person wish for you to be free
he wanted to kill a genie
ya cause he hated the genie so it's like quite cool
quite a twist from like
what's typically
that three wish
scenarios you know
no but like the first two he wish on like things that he wanted and like he was annoyed with the genie cause he was being an asshole
so he wish that
[oh] my god you know you know black widow has been postponed again
to like I think april or may next year twenty twenty one
it's damn long [eh] from may this year they move it back to november
and then I guess COVID didn't die out
so it they postpone it to next year instead
so hopefully COVID better like just evaporate
by next year
cause I'm like so sick of waiting
ya
god
I wonder how
like what would we be doing instead you know
like where would we be
[oh] shit
no like maybe not even doing stuff cause you know like doing other stuff
[oh] ya
but
but I feel so much comfortable with the mask you know
cause like on days you're like you're like
insecure and all like worry about people looking at you
or like worry about looking
half ass
[oh] ya and that as well
(uh huh)
[oh] ya
I think you like got scanned use your I_C and all that time I heard quite they like making it compulsory to use that bloody token
but like the Q_R code is already enough [what]
actually I don't understand what they need they need us to like adopt it you know like if it's like a lot more convenient for us then okay [ah]
they don't right
like it's just a back the question is to like why there's a need for it
like why they they doing this
it's it's been around for awhile
like they did did initiated the project like a few months back
and then they got done with it and then they said anybody who was interested to collect it but I guess
there were
not enough people who are interested I think now we're just it's just sitting somewhere in some storage that's why they like giving it out but
they making it compulsory to be used
but I mean who's fault is that to be like pouring all of our resources into developing tokens they are like practically useless
when like our phones is already enough right
ya it's just like an additional worry for them honestly
and it's not like they very careful with this kind of things also
think everyone's gonna drop it
if it have G_P_S then I would mind so honestly
I mean
I don't know in this the idea of like being actively surveilled and monitored ya
that's the thing there's there's no
I mean like
the idea of it is like good and all [lah] but like
nothing good comes out of like being overly surveilled
as in like like from
like all these like big companies gathering all of your data and all that how we use it you know
like most of it has like involve like criminal shit you know
or like
things that they do like
reveal to us
so like we don't know what we doing with our data and shit
ya
I mean it doesn't have to be like overtly criminal it's just it could just be like
the precedence for them to like
introduce more stuff to be like
[ah]
like so like have more surveillance over us like at some point like you have to
say that that this too much already like we don't want to be actively monitored like all the time
but it's about like your
individual
privacy I guess I don't know
I miss I miss cats
ya
I just want like go to a cat
and like
go play with it no I haven't been to a cat cafe before
ya
cat
ya
ya only when I
only when I go to like the east east east area like
#pasir ris# or #tampines# then
!huh!
[oh] no I haven't seen him for very long [sia]
ya cause when I've been like super busy with my assignments
ya but I'm like
I'm like going to
(uh) I'm planning to like going to see him soon [ah] also
wild cats
!oops!
sometimes I like my bed I'm like
[ah] I know what would be better me lying with a cat
just like cuddling
ya it is like sitting in a chair
ya
I think she's like
also like very
(uh) she's like a clean person so like the fur I guess worries her
but how
but I think I'm like developing allergies with cats now [eh]
ya cause every time I touch cats like my nose gets itchy
now
last time I don't have it now it's like very sensitive
it's quite bad like if I touch for too long right maybe like more than five minutes then
like
my nose is start itching and then I would sneeze like so many times like
for very long also ya
[oh] ya the bathing part
actually you know by right you're not supposed to bathe cats right
ya
but he had fun
ya I guess I mean he's he's not really like scared of it right is he
like overly scared
or
ya catty catty gets like really
no not aggressive she gets like really scared then I just really pat so like no I'm not gonna do [lah]
(mm) ya
you know I've been thinking about this
I how how you think we would become extinct
you know if like the presence of like COVID now and all I feel like
cause I read up some stuff right then they said that the future of
(uh) human civilizations will be like
(uh)
be like a lot of our problems would come from like diseases you know like COVID nineteen is like one of like
like a good example [lah] then they said like in future there will be more
of this this kind of like global pandemics
like not like not like (uh) like world wars like before
which is like this kind of like
(uh) issues of this kill would have like
the rest of us that's why I've been thinking about this question
[oh] no [lah] like
it's just like
ya I just like born out of like I don't know like being overly like in careless
about like taking care of our environment and all
and like
or
like
hyper capitalistic as well
ya
I think I think it has something to do with climate change and some shit also
ya like cause like the rate like the the climate is changing the virus itself is like evolving like faster as well
ya so like and then like we not really pouring like resources into
into that and like also like human-centric stuff [lah] like taking care
(uh) like people
and we're like researchers like
being put into
solving pandemics like this in the future
so like ya we not really exactly equipped for it cause like most of our
like resources are like invested into like
technological advances
or like
productivity and shit like that you know all those capitalistic shit ya
yes
somebody is stopping disease like
stop like the next the next american president
campaigns slogan will just be
stop
seven hundred thousand
ya I mean like
I mean like technological advances these days completely fine you know it's like what technology is
used for like for now right it's just to for us to be like more like productive you know but like
I mean that kind of like resource can be like be put into like
like
like into innovation that could be more groundbreaking you know like
like [ah] I don't like solving or like getting rid of like poverty that kind of shit you know but they will rather like
spend the resources on like (uh) like growing their wealth that kind of stuff it's like
ya
this payment
and then their all these will be malaysians
malaysians would be the new americans
what
[oh] yes yes yes
that's so sad
like so unjustified
like
he shouldn't just be getting away like so simply you know like it just gives like a bad message to like future
ya
if I was the judge I would say that
just
[oh] ya that's like really
[oh] why
okay I think we're gonna be done soon
ya okay [ah] next time [ah]
see you
test and
okay hi I'm #amir# I a~ and my partner #salamah#
okay so first conversation was how
a bit
but I think it's the perfect time [ah]
I mean when it comes to like l~ l~ face mask from what
then
ya ya ya the step cool kind I mean is also to prevent like you like at higher speeds like around you are cycling down
like you will either injure or just things going your
face your nose or your mouth [lah]
okay ya so I was cycling because I was doing part time
ya but that is okay not compared to there was a time [ah] I was like
cycling down to woodlands just to meet my my my girlfriend my ex girlfriend [lah]
you you imagine you
I mean it's it's better that you chewing it [what] like you chew I I don't even know what I taste but
I mean it's just
after that I was okay [ah] so I think the house fly was
ya I guess so I was fine
ya you don't know [meh]
ya [lah] it's just that I got the most freshest one [lah]
ya I
ya
yes I'm I'm taking my bike license [lah] my motorbike license like
k~ I
I don't
deliver ten then you will get incentives like maybe for grabfood was ten dollar
you divide it a extra extra five dollar ten dollar then after you deliver hundred than maybe extra
I mean I I work for both
I mean not this is not advertisement [lah] but then
they grab the deliveroo their support is mu~ like way better [lah]
it's not a tipping thing [ah] like the culture
ya
second second
bro that one that one is I mean that one depends like I mean H_D_B you cannot
that one is the~ they give big tip is maybe
ten dollar
the app like you give you ten dollar that will get the ten dollar because some countries like for example in like happening in other places I think U_S like the their
like it's just
ya I got it for six [eh] four hundred plus [lah] like because
I mean long term [ah] and I think I really gain back that four hundred I've
ya ya
I mean
sometimes you see
they those like
food delivery they like I mean
blind blind spot
I I think I might feel fail someone from the C_D_C the the I was like on the road going junction then there's a light then on my left is the zebra crossing [ah]
[ah]
there was no nothing no one else on the road on the road was me
I mean but
you license [ah] you
so you know how the da~ the most dangerous thing so now you technically you will go out [ah] as a motorcyclist style more car then you will like maybe can put yourself in other shoe [ah]
so I think
but before that defensive riding [lah]
so
S_S_D_C
ya
but I think I
ya
no
ya
thirty six when it comes to revision outside or the the the test outside is sixty or so around fifty plus
six or five
ya
I I think the bike I'm looking for is (err) the one like my friend is riding I think C_B_R one five zero or M_T one five
ya ya okay that one I
I I don't even know what
those brands are like [ah] because I think the one that everybody using that have been recommending me fuel efficient is the C_B_R I mean s~ s~ somewhat fuel efficient is C_B_R one five zero [ah]
seven more years or seven seven or seven more years [ah]
e~ t~
like I I need to decide first whether because like i~ if I were to do my work
ya
I just keep renting [ah] depends on like what bike I want then
like at the at the like a dead end
what was the question I have to remember [oh] was it something like okay what is the
ya ya yes yes
freighter then I noticed the mere driver was my one of my teammates
(um)
like
so
my birthday present I think honestly now
so I think
[ah] ya
I mean I am okay wi~ grand if it's just the person that I want
ya
ya [lah] I mean but like honestly
like like what you say [lah] or whatever if the person has done but then ya [lah] but
like you have to know what the person like intention of birth~ what a birthday is [lah] for me
they have to know [lah] like like it's not gonna be feasible [lah] for the rest of their life if they wanna do something like often but then with his once in lifetime you let people celebrate their twenty first birthday something grand then like okay [lah] whoever their close friends planning gonna plan like really
so I think when it comes to birthday it's like all ultimately is do you want to grand or not
but I think when it comes to like if I were to choose a place to go out maybe not just birthday [lah] a holiday or something [eh]
I think I will most probably do something
like maybe like if
like I would think or maybe going to east west of like of the U_S like a road trip or just maybe just like go japan north to south that's that's what I would do [lah] a road trip
further like whiter they are I mean and when it comes to nearer to the equator you gonna be much more darker [lah] it's I think that one is like it has been for so long already and just that now people are more migrating more so it's a different more complexion
[oh]
okay ya so ya [lah] I mean wait this six hundred is a lot [lah] so
recording no I don't I just realise that one of us are talking I don't know how we gonna survive

[ah]
really
the long
historical korean dramas whatever this one long
yes
only if I if my eyes loop
I only realise it when I saw when I met #haziq# yesterday I don't know if he saw my Tik Tok or not but I was like no one saw his face and [ah] now I know now I know what is dark humour
it is there's loop thing
[oh] my god we just talked for one hour
right non stop actually

but then you gonna see him fight like the eight tails
the [kan] [kan] #naruto# got the nine tails right
then he will then subsequent will find the eight tails he almost gets killed
ya by the eight tails
he will like
later on later on I think so after that fight with the eight tails then they will be like a
(um) all the five nations no all the five nations will meet together
to discuss on the upcoming war
and then after that a #subsikey# will just appear and then say I will I will declare war on everybody here
ya all because
his battle #naruto#
[oh] but wait hundred seventeen I think so you have two hundred more episodes
cannot reme~ [oh] my god I just realised I spent
[oh] the the filler episode I will always skip [one]
the you always can check (um)
is it easy
page right just search for #naruto# then search for the synopsis part and then you see you scroll down the moment you see the words filler right
then you just skip [ah] you will know which
the owner like get surgery on this its actually because
one of the ways to make it look nicer is I have to go for the surgery [lah] ya basically like cut a piece of the skin off and then stitch it together and make it like but someone do that but just double surgery on both
make it look like right
serious [ah]
okay
that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better [lah]
like I know the outro was a bit okay [lah]
a bit better
because the outro previously was like [meh]
ya
now I think intro okay [lah] still what my second second video
so
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that [one] eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together (uh) then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade [ah]
saw online like two hundred fifty [sia] for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it [ah] [sia]
just buy [ah]
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade [lah] as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five [eh] the new Ryzen four gen four [eh] gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
!wow!
then what they release it as
the fuck [sia]
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him [lah]
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company [lah] I guess
but okay [lah] it all worked out for them
free money [sia]
ya
Sony is terrible [sia] you know they don't allow discord on P_S five I'm like what the fuck [sia]
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users
ya ya it's terrible [eh]
no the the thing is I'm like okay if you have a P_S four chat you know but then now a lot of games support cross play and then you like
and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first [one] that was like quite good [sia]
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least
ya
of course (uh) I mean I took awhile before I went to discord

australian or singapore
australian is
you know at singapore currency is stronger than australia now
after very long no
now is like their three thousand is two thousand plus
or what
ya I think
ninety cents around there ya that means means ours is stronger I'm actually surprised I remember last time people were like go australia one point four
then the currency drop like shit
no now the best place to go new zealand they don't need wear mask anymore
but then it's like
ya
no because you know why because we were prepared because we had masks we had a lot of things that we prepared we knew what a pandemic would happen you know
and I think
not really rod it's like a more like a a a a gi~ giant dildo shove up your butt
ya
really
really
I last last week [oh] ya [oh] that means it really surged [sia] !wah!
two hundred twenty I believe was like a week or two weeks ago only [sia]
[oh] my god
it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya [lah]
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals [ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like #siao# [lah]
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage [eh] only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck [ah]
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
ya
the gov~ because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money [ah] then then but wou~ but that is unlikely [ah]
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like [ah] you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late [ah] can got late payment [ah]
but there's no interest [lah]
ya
you know the new #borat# movie coming out soon #borat#
and then there's this video of (uh) donald trump's lawyer rudy #giuliani#
so the thing is right he was [ah] asked to come to the bed [ah] the hotel room of the #borat# #borat# two got #borat# and his daughter I think
so the daughter of #borat# supposedly [lah] ask him to come to the room and shit [lah]
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever [lah] so then he put se~ #borat# put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
[ah] so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room [ah] then he was in the room [ah] then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the #borat# came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen [ah] she was twenty four [lah] but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is [oh] he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet [ah] but a few people in the media industry watched it [ah] like I because #borat# does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week [lah] next week monday most likely the video goes public [ah]
[ah] no they wou~ he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad [ah]
#borat# does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer [ah] the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video [sia] come on guys
no [ah] they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and th~
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
why
why [sia]
!haiya! they wo~ I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
#taiwan# [ah]
the missile [lah]
#taiwan# [ah]
this is how countries do diplomacy [lah]
same like north korea what
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to U_S then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions [lah] it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over #taiwan# then it says #taiwan# wasn't theirs in the first place
the only sad part is actually #taiwan# defeated not defeated [lah] kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
because china is
ya ya #taiwan# isn't listed as a country of the W_H_O because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china U_S and a few other countries
republic of #taiwan# no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news [ah]
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between #taiwan# and singapore is that we are not under another country
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean !hey! are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like [eh] [eh] boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't kn~ have you seen the video
and then now cannot go back home
[ah] so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because K_L lockdown back
then I was like (uh)
[oh] okay
why [ah] then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think #sabah# had (err) election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like [oh] that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread [lah] I guess
I don't know [lah] difficult [lah] the policies they have also not very strong so
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to J_B [lor]
to like buy stuff buy fuel
[a'ah] [sia]
[eh] come on [ah] it's one third the price bro that means [eh] I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time [ah] [jer] per week [sia] that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only [sia] instead of times three [ah] two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time [mah] you travel there [ah]
every month [eh]
but okay [lah] takes a lot of time [ah] I personally don't do it because
jam [ah]
always jam
and then the closest [one] near #tuas# and then #tuas# you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
but okay what [ah] now got the discount what twenty percent [sia] for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is [ah] if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions [lah] okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight [ah] I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line y~
fuck you [lah] no
no you can just clear the thing don't let anyone bang and just leave it that's why you're do~ not a politician okay or saving the earth the earth would be dead if you are saving it
[ha] [ha] [ha]
no expediting the process is donald trump man
very sad like he worked eight years [sia] for that would fight against the congress
you know and then all went to shit
just like that
not not not one person it took a whole nation to vote him
it took no it took a whole nation not to vote for hillary that was it
I'm like [sial] [ah] you all talk about emails #ivanka# also got emails what then no one cares only
don't know [lah]
then he then got mention what I remembered trump recently mentioned like if he lose the election he's going to run away from the country
cause he say he be embarrassed for losing all you know why or not he's going to run you know why
as it
he know if he come back he's going to sit in jail for very very very long
because I I bet you joe biden will try his best [sia] to do it
who
who
on fucking twitter of all the places them really [ah] guess how he want the millennium will vote eight years back in that they are few politicians who was actively like in social media ya that's
I mean because obama is acting on twitter [eh] bro
ya
now he still now he still
and first ladies [ah]
like melania trump nobody cares [ah]
ya I mean I I don't really care about the opinion of the country that voted trump up you know
I'm I (uh) I really don't care
who
#valkrae#
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya #alexandria ocasio-cortez# ya she she was the highest ra~ the most viewed stream on twitch [sia] the most viewed stream I was like [oh] !wow! but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really [sia] she's really good [sia] and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan [eh] like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also [ah] bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say [ah] aggressive a lot of people don't like her
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like [oh] she's too progressive
[oh] (err) reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering [lah] begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
U_S is one point two K every week [eh]
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same [ah] it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything [ah] he's not gonna like [oh] let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
[oh] my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like [ah] the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct [oh] my god I was like (ugh) and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
world [sia]
never right
[kan] [ah]
any proof [ah] I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview [ah] like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things [ah]
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation [lah] the questions [ah] then after that he got
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes [ah] like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
[kan]
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible [ah]
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible [ah] that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
so how how's your job you know like [ah] do you believe like trump's economy will pick up and then why while this guy's there and it's like
making economy great my business is booming and then he's asking like what what business are you in you know what are you doing [oh] I do (uh) money money money lending
his business booms when the economy goes down what
so I think then the guy like just laugh he just cannot stop then the guy is like I'm voting for trump then he like laugh again
it's like holy shit man it's like !aww! man these are the kind of voters that vote for trump because for them selfishly their business like when the economy is like the same what when somethings go down right when there's a down turn someone earns what it's not like everyone will lose equally
so like this kind of people earn [ah] like this moneylenders
like other crap [lah] that happens
like the obviously the ones that go down like deli~ like grab riders because COVID and all these shit transport
you know public transport and shit
all the same [ah]
but like this [ah]
public transport ridership reduced what
by ridership reduce then the
ya I mean as a general the drivers don't care but as the company you would suffer losses [lah]
at the end of the day is still a government agents like it's not agencies like it's like ya is a guv~ it is govern by the government [lah] so for them they not really like going to take the hit that hard [lah]
they are not going to closed down and the like [oh] no more public transport for singapore

!wah! [sial] [lah] that [one] I remember [sia]
that was the worst I didn't go supermarket
I was like fuck that shit
I guess sceptical help [lah]
ya
I remember during that period I went like
at like two A_M to the grocery store
because no one is awake right
so it's like lesser people to fight with
but then the thing
they restocking around that period as well
ya
then got nothing for you
ya
ya
that's why [ah]
no [lah] mine got more mine got three or four three or four no mine cause it's twenty four hours
but mine they do the restocking at that time so cannot be two person what
the store quite big [sia] mine
it's not like like the one here the here is kind of linear what mine is like a weird shape so there's a bit of blind spot that the cashier cannot see
so they're going to have to have have two people cause one station at one area
ya
[ah] ya
ya that's the thing [ah]
[ah] okay
put the money then go [jer]
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]
scan yourself you know like
then you just go fuck off
okay [what]
ya what you doing [ah] what you doing I'm paying for my own groceries
why never ring the bell cause I lazy bro
the starting [lah]
one point five
no the thing is singapore water can drink [sia] the tap
and COVID is not waterborne
it was proven not to be waterborne that's why they said swimming pools were safe
ya I guess I guess so
but there is still [ah] you know
not all [ah] but a lot of them [ah]
[oh] ya
which is
that's why [ah] WhatsApp group dangerous
all this fake news
I I never really like
like some people just join [sia] random WhatsApp group you know like
the fuck [sia]
I don't know that's the thing
it doesn't make sense
but I guess that's where like they get their info that's the thing [ah] the info not verified also
I can just send some random shit that I made
one thing at least singapore give free mask okay [ah]
I feel the free mask initiative was quite good
two time [oh] ya ya ya okay [ah] not bad
okay
dude
what's a super chat
[ah] okay
I mean like I guess
a lot of them are like they all look the same you know they kinda
they have the long black hair then they all they're all sponsored by like Shopee and
ya I don't know
that's true
[ah]
how much is fifteen thousand yen in S_G_D

[oh]
Apex players
I mean I just think it's
like do the controls and stuff then I was quite new to the game then he ask me come nearer then I'm like okay I'll come nearer then he said it'll come a bit nearer nearer nearer then I'm like okay I'll come a bit nearer then you know he taunt kill me which is basically like you you take like he like he pressed Q and then it makes your character do something cool and then it kills you so he stabbed an arrow up my body and then I flopped and a died ya
no no no no no ya but
basically
ya that's my F_P_S experience I guess after that
did I I think
no it makes sense
it's pretty normal [lah] I think to be honest the only reason why my like
controller ya then he would we would just play like Street Fighter [lah] or like Super Mario and stuff then he will lend me his game boy then I started playing Final Fantasy when I was like six but you know like at that age you don't even understand what's going on so I wasn't really good at Final Fantasy [lah] I didn't understand the strategy then like until this year also I don't like strategy games ya but then cause of that like I got used to the controls like from a early age I guess then on top of that I used to do sports like you know in primary school (uh) like I used to be from floorball ya you know cause I did ya you know I was team captain also like but that's just because the rest of the team didn't care but that's besides the point then
(err) I guess cause of all of that my hand eye coordination got
[oh] I I played I played COD like a long time ago cause it got boring it's just you refresh the round then after that you like shoot people and then it's like the same cycle ya so now I play PUBG ya with #riti# but I used to play PUBG in secondary school also it was (uh) like cause the other girls in class they didn't really play games then I was I was (uh)
one of the girls or like there was another girl also [lah] like I think #shahira# used to play games a lot also but basically she and I
would sometimes play with like the guys in class cause my classes
B ya B_P_G_H_S
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya the Switch is sort of like a
Taken [oh] Taken is a pretty good game though I my brother had a P_S_P then his he had like a bunch of games I'm not sure if they were pirated or not cause like he pirates a lot of stuff not even gonna lie like even my games on my D_S were pirated I think ya but he had like ben ten and like some other few games but I don't I don't remember the rest ya but ya I really I really really like the P_S_P just because it was so easy to bring around you know ya
basically more or less [ah]
then
[oh] shit
ya ya ya correct correct correct
funny story right I the first time I saw Mortal Kombat was when I was like
my first sign of childhood trauma
but
I think so I think he's like the main character in one of them or is it all of them I don't even remember the plot to be honest
(mmhmm)
ya actually I stopped playing that Tetris game I think cause I got s~ I got b~
bored of the loading screen cause like to wait for a new match is quite sometime right
quite long right ya so I think I stop playing that I was thinking about getting smashed
[kan] cause I think
march like it was the start of circuit breaker I think ya so like around march then it's the
ya so I need to
email them about it cause now they have my thirty dollars
(uh) it's on Carousell but then like they're an official website they're they're not sketchy [lah] to be honest they're like quite well-known it's house of K-pop
like email them I guess I don't I don't even know what I should say what should I write in my email
ya they gave me the order number ya
(mm) I guess so
no no no the signed one got cancelled cause that time two members went on hiatus ya I didn't I ended up not buying that [one]
ya
that [one] I only got
I decided to buy two normal versions
ya then I just pre-ordered it [orh] ya
something
I know right it's so like you kind of question like what they actually do in the army and then like you know sometimes they get the idols to perform also inside the army it's quite entertaining though especially when they like come together [oh] it's super entertaining
ya ya ya I think so
I don't know maybe
ya
I don't know it's very weird also it's very weird to think that like our friends are going to go to N_S I have some people enlisting in like I have some friends enlisting in
(uh)
like
what is it they ya they get to get discharged earlier but still it's kinda sad then I can only see them on weekends ya
(mm) but my closest guy friends haven't gotten it yet though know like #set lin# hasn't
gotten it
ya ya ya maybe he'll get for april or something maybe that's why they haven't sent out I don't know I don't know how N_S works
forgot his name one of the malay the one that
used to that you saw at Don Don Donki
do you do you know
[ah] ya ya ya him he and
#saz# were in what is it called [ah] infantry in N_S or something ya then that [one] also is quite
I think it's it's like something like commando but I I don't know what's the difference [ah]
then you know #saz# also was like a medic sort of like he wa~ he he was really good at doing first aid and stuff then back then when we were doing part time he will explain to me like what to do with different people like d~ for different injuries what you should do what
methods to apply or something ya infant is like the man
[orh] is it
I don't know I just watch war movies and I watch people die and I I don't really know the like the specifics
ya ya
then they don't have
I think
what I read about was that japan back then [lah] don't know if it's still like that now like in history um they really train on mental resilience and then like they would they really drive the nationalism into like the soldiers so that's why
like the
(uh) what do you call it the the one that sac~ the people that sacrificed themselves in the warplanes
I think so ya ya then like those pilots they were willing they knew that they were gonna die but they willingly volunteered themselves to like drive drive the plane into the ships ya like because they at the back of the heads they're like yes I would I would love to die for my country cause like for them it's like I think of honour I guess I think singaporean culture doesn't really have that but japanese people I think korean people also [ah] they are very strong about their honour then like that's even that's also why they taught soldiers how to commit #seppuku#
ya it's like you start from the right then you left then you go up then like your guts will literally spill out of you ya (uh) I remember after the war I think after certain battles [lah] if they lost right they would just commit #seppuku# and die
ya can you imagine that like
you are so devoted to your country to the point where you would rather die than just
ya than just lose the war it's it's quite intense
ya in general cause I watch so many war movies right war was just terrible man it was terrible for everyone and
a lot of people
I think the saddest parts are when
people die not even cause they were fighting but they were they just got like diseases and stuff I I was watching this story atonement ya then the guy (uh)
are you are you gonna watch the movie
okay well then the guy died of
septicaemia or something which is basically when like you have a wound then (uh) there's like bacteria and it infects your wound and then like basically you just
(um) I don't know [ah] it just
ya then because of that they just can't breathe or stuff or something ya
ya so he died like that and he died on the last like before the last ship back home
ya it it was really sad [lah] so when he died and then the wife not the wife but like the girlfriend I guess
(um) she died too but it was because of
no it was cause of a bombing and then she tried to hide in a train station but cause of the bombing I think it burst some pipe or something and then the whole train station got flooded
ya so that's how she died then so they both died before they met each other again
ya it was a really it was pretty sad [lah] but I didn't I didn't cry that much I think cause
that wasn't the main message of the story ya but it was pretty sad
it's so realistic to the point where it's not it's not like you know you're not like watching a movie anymore it's like you're really there so that's why it really broke my heart
that's why and he was really trying his best to take care of the sister you know then it's just #suay# [ah] the sister ended up dying of malnutrition
[a'ah] [a'ah] [a'ah]
it's not even not even an entree
i~ it happened in nineteen forty two-ish ya
(um) I think
my mother's generation is like one of the last few
to have experienced effects of the war
[a'ah]
then (um)
I think
(uh) like
and she did she barely took anything with her I think he just took like
some clothes then s~ like her money [lor] then she just came to singapore I mean
I don't know I don't know how they got the house but ya
it was (mm)
before the war I think
it was ya it was like a year or two years before the war
that's why I'm glad I'm not though ya
[ah] ya ya ya it's they they don't even like to acknowledge it [lah] to be honest and then t~ they I think everyone knows already [lah] but like they put a lot of money into giving japan this new image and then like you know just showing off their culture and everything ya
but
I think so the magnitude of nine or something ya then my mum was like [oh] this is
ya it's like karma for what they did during the japanese occupation
ya like I mean sure I guess whatever you believe in but it's still a bit insensitive to say it while it's happening
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) I was watching unsolved mysteries on netflix then they were talking about this one town there also got affected by the
(err) what do you call it the tsunami ya then um it washed away a lot of people basically and a lot of people that I think in that region alone fifteen thousand people died ya and it wasn't a big town it was maybe their population was
like they didn't know where to go cause they didn't know that they died cause it was all so sudden right then especially taxi drivers whenever they were driving around right (err) like usually nighttime they will find people who are just like in the middle of nowhere then they need to go they want to go back into the town where the tsunami happen
then like
they will stop
near the town then when they turn back the person is not there anymore
ya
something like that it's it's I guess it's kind of a spin off version of buddhism not not to say it's like not to be disrespectful it's just that it's something like that ya
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah] [ah]
ya
[ah] ya it was in
in two thousand three ya ya
I
like the whole
I don't know how I don't know what you call it I guess town ya and after that a lot of people have like trauma of just even showering
a lot of people lost their my parents their grandparents then you know like if even like you can't even retrieve
your
serious
like he got pulled in to the water ya then I think I don't know [ah] maybe the mother ran in after him a
ya but I know that I think they died ya
it's pretty sad [lah] that's why it's quite fortunate that we live in singapore like okay there are a lot of cons also but at least we don't we really are quite safe from
(uh) natural disasters
ya
[ah]
that's so creepy
!eww!
there's like similar stories about this in the U_S basically like they m~ people move into new houses right then you know houses in the U_S are freaking huge like if you watch renovation stories right dude their basements are the size of like a flat you know and that's just one floor and it's the bottom floor so their attics they also have like attics and stuff then got stories of people they just move in and then they hear like like I don't know [lah] footsteps around the house right then usually I think people would usually think like a ghost or something then but then they sh~ they wouldn't believe it [lah] so they think [oh] maybe just the pipes or something but then people find out that there are like people living in their attics and when they're not awake or something they'll go down and then they'll eat from their fridge or something then they'll go back up into the attic to hide ya then I remember one girl she was showering or something then she heard the person climb down ya then I don't know [ah] I don't know how it happened but she managed to call the police then the police arrested the guy
ya then I think the guy was living in her attic for what [ah] year ya a year since she moved in and she didn't notice at all like that's so creepy I cannot imagine having just this random person
in your house like don't don't even know what he's doing
actually ya actually ya ya ya ya ya but in a more
ya less (um) #murdery# kind of way
it's so insane I cannot stand away you can do you know what what higher speed said I cannot sit cross country and no [lah] I mean
I don't know [lah] I mean
(mm) I guess has to do with like their amendments and stuff ya
(mm)
ya I can't imagine people our age voting a lot of people I know didn't even keep up with the
like parties and stuff ya I mean it's not bad [lah] it's just that it's not necessary you know I think it will only work in
countries like america I kings or like okay [lah] maybe it will only work for work in favour for her talent like other workers party basically any party that's not P P
I guess or like okay [lah] maybe it will only work for work in favour for the I don't know worker's party basically any party that's not P_A_P
cause
(mm)
I think P_A_P
then they moved to a zone
that was under
was it a worker's party or another party [lah] like you can tell that the residents residences are different like the way they are decorated [ah] like it's very different and the~ then I think it's like the one
(mm)
true
I don't know I mean my friend is taking political science now so by the time I can vote I'm just I'm just gonna ask everything then I'll follow her her guidance we live in the same G_R_C also like she lives what
two blocks away from me ya so I'm just gonna trust her instinct
it is it is ya actually got her she did she got her first essay back already she did really well she most people she said most people only got a B for that paper then she got then only three people like their professor gave an A then she got an A minus then she was so happy I'm so proud of her
I think it was about karl marx and just his communism idea ya
ya no really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had to write a whole essay about it like two thousand words
ya
[ah] but nah uni sounds so exciting can't wait to do stuff like that

but funny funny [leh] I I didn't
I didn't get a reply [ah] they didn't reply me it's actually
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get [seh] I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job [kan]
[ah] yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're (err) ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so [ah] it's easy for me to
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier [lah] so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which (uh) which location you prefer
then
!huh!
ya so I I I actually a~ applied for the that one right the the
the ya~ the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
now I'm waiting for another call [lah] then they so far never call they're taking quite some time [ah] I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true [lah] true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that (err) right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that (um)
some people are not really serious about the job [lah] they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulti~ difficulties at this point [lah] so
that's what my mother said [lah] then I I think I think quite
true [lah] like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
(err) I'm just applying
I think because we~ when they when they look at my resume like you know they [ah] (um)
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
(err) diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary [lah] a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs [lah] so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya [lah] of course [lah] I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like (um) if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time [lah] I will I will do (mm)
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently [lah] I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up [lah] definitely like (um)
ya getting easily more tired or you know like (um)
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different [lah] when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like (um) [oh] I'm the best I can do
[oh] I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
(um) you realize
you're not really the best [ah] other people better than you or then you
you start to ya [lah] it's a different thing [lah]
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also [lah] different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya [lah] different different privileges
yes
correct [lah] actually actually true [lah] I I
[ah] I know I mean the the the thing is that because (err) right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk [lah] I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
[ah] nicely have respect for elders but
!huh! I don't know about the s~ the the the current (um) I don't know about the
the the pe~ the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they bu~ but not all [lah] some of them some of them are res~ I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have (um) respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job [lah] teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
they know how to talk to to
older people [lah] so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them [lah] like (um)
like old old people old values [lah] old values like like (um)
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know
ya but some some are different some are like really they
ya they
you know ya but it's all ya [lah] it's it's all a small thing [lah] at the moment (mm) ya
(mm)
maybe [ah] because I got oily face or what then in the morning
in the morning I if I don't if I don't shower or what then I
you know my face will be very oily or what that kind of thing then that one will
okay [lah] that kind of thing but maybe maybe maybe
I don't know whether it's a
(mm)
pass very fast [lah] for me so
so [a'ah] [lah]
was more relaxed [lah] more
laid back chill ya
so (um)
COVID I mean
(mm)
apocalypse no [lah]
i~ imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actu~ actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing [ah] nothing much [lah]
I I was just trying to get along earn money [lah] you know ya
ya
[oh] okay okay okay ya the first the very first (um)
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one [lah] phase one circuit breaker was
was ya [lah] it's a bit a bit (um)
a bit stressful [lah] stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
[oh] circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
li~ I felt I felt like [ah] I don~ I don't care [lah] I will still go out [lah] I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that [lah] I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing [lah] then I I s~
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing [lah] so it's not like
just go out you know like
(um)
ya so I f~ in the end I followed the rules also [lah]

different time [lah] you know (err) nobody
nobody expected this to happen [lah] so so everybody
a lot of pe~ a lot of people was stressed [lah] that time they a lot of people stressed (err) a lot of (uh)
domestic violence suddenly at home in~ inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry [lah] then
because ya

like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot (uh) like harder
times [lah] a lot of people going through like more hardship [lah] you know that
if you think you are like
quite sometimes I feel quite (um)
I just feel quite sad [lah] sometimes when I see all this [lah] ya

cause the husband agent [what] if I had agent husband let's be an agent
on [sia] a lot [sia] they earn one house they sell can get two three K more than that actually that is the minimum

okay let's say if your G_P_A is actually good would you go for do you think you want to go for poly [eh] poly uni
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
no [ah] it's considered but for a start it's considered a lot
but for
my for like my course is not a lot my course (uh) starting for diploma is three point two
ya that's why it's so damn hard
yes
that's considered a lot [ah] like start then plus bonus or plus incentive
like minimum five K
ya if you want a normal normal life like you want a house you want a car then five K I think it's the bare minimum
total
okay [lah] enough [what]
no five K one person
but that's not bad [what] you see your house also like like bigger than my house then your father can afford a car so okay [ah]
I think something right starting another business [sia]
like six [eh] seven A_M to three P_M [jer]
so it's not like very long hours
there you don't need a waitress you know you just takeaway you take the food and go
who
my mother after she pay everything right and you know that stall
is four K you know
ya then she can earn herself like that one shop like minimum three K
ya then like
but
earn a lot but you say the expansion though she cannot wait for one shop she open
fusion
!eww!
[eh] actually can try [sia] if it's nice
at where
[oh] really
!wow!
one day I should try also maybe we should go
I
ya but I think they are not earning that much as that last time with her friend
for that shop
ya I mean but I don't think can even earn twelve K though
they are at home [what]
that's why they
same
don't let you what
around in singapore
[oh]
like if they if their bike screech or something then I fall then after that I go inside hospital
(uh) ya ya
okay
(mmhmm)
w~ what do you mean by not progressing
actually (um)
so like I want to make use of it
even though (um) the
the idea that no longer having money is kind of like scaring me a bit [ah] cause like
I don't know [eh]
(mm)
T_F_T_C
cause like honestly nowadays
started business
like microbusiness right solely because of
sometimes in your head you think you can do better
or like you can come up with something better cause nowadays
not saying that I have a lot of skills or what but then like ya it's just
something I sort of feel like ya
I saw
(err)
so like it's I feel like she shouldn't price it so high cause I have a feeling that's the same probably the same process
(um)
when I saw the TikTok I think it's
in a way it is (err) embroidery in a machine but then like I think maybe
she just has to like either type out the name or like design it a bit ya
actually I think there's a okay maybe there is a bit of difference
like
I think we both follow the same
I think we do [lah] we do follow the same account so whatever accounts we follow is
is is unique in their own way I like maybe like
[ah] necklaces or like earrings
[oh] ya ya ya
ya ya [oh] my god ya
(mm)
and by right I think actually if you cannot also you can actually
can glue right
but it's just it won't last long
is either they have to give up their style or they have to (um)
not give up but maybe like either alter themselves or like
ya
actually ya now that you mention it I I actually don't know how like how did
the like entire universe decide
that [oh] this would be this makes an S this makes an M this makes and L this makes and X_L like
how because like I can
nots I mean I'm not really I would probably say that I am considered average
[eh] average [lah] ya and then like
don't have M L I don't know if they have M L but ya it's like that
(mm) (mm) so like I'm like
like what if like you on the
cause like it's not that it's not that thin like not really that hugging but then it's not exactly
I don't understand
[orh]
your bust
speaking of like
what's that call (uh) sustainable sus~ is it call sustainable fashion
ya sustainable fashion and thrifting and all that honestly
(um) I think people confuse that and thrift that and vintage a lot
and I really feel like people should educate themselves because
there's a difference and
I don't know how to I don't even know how to explain the difference cause like
but like you know how (um)
and not not to name any but Loop Garms and (um)
cause that time (um) actually
my boyfriend actually ask (uh) ask me (uh) send me this post by Loop Garms
[ah] chris chris #jericho# ya chris #jericho# the shirt
then [ah] he like he like it [ah] cause he really like [ah] W_W_E
like he was say~ saying like he likes it [ah] then like he's
he's too shy to ask so even though he he is like to be honest when I
but but I mean like I guess
some people might take that as
I don't know if they considered if people do consider Loop Garms or stuff like that
or whatever shop similar to that (um) as thrifting
is just like another man's
trash that you consider to be treasure you know what I mean right correct right ya
people see it as an investment
I mean there's still a lot of W_W_E fans it's just that maybe like
I don't know like only certain people will still be able to see the value in it like
cause there will there will always be like this
ya but also like there'll always be this resurrection of
of people who suddenly fall in love with vintage and like
really want to like spot
so ya
[ah]
the whole [oh] okay
so cute
honestly I think
like you know you your comment about the fashion in ge~ in general the fashion industry I think
I think people I mean obviously we're trying
more [lah] like this I think
this generation is more aware and like willing to like
make certain changes but honestly it's been like years of
is
is been years of like (um)
it just it just happen we suddenly like care about it I guess or like we're less ignorant
like more aware of what we're using and what we're wearing and like whatever we're consuming also now we're more
(um)
I don't know we're just more conscious yes that's the word conscious
honestly it's ironic that
that the thing that was meant to (um) reduce (um)
I mean honestly I don't even understand how
that ha~ (uh) I mean I understand how it happened but also don't understand cause like obviously at the root
it's just that like other humans and like us like just
that and just I think we are just wasteful people
entitled I guess a part of it is entitled and also
er~ ya era era ya so
(um) I think we just
too
everything is too convenient now
like we don't really see the value in that in that thing we don't really see like
(uh) how much was like
put into like making it
and stuff like that
honestly (uh)
what we talking about
okay I don't know how we got to this I think cause we started talking about sustainable fashion ya
but ya I think you know how you ask me like ha~
I think maybe
for now you just try to
(um) I think that [one] once you done I guess you can
cause you sold it to her at a reasonable price (uh) honestly
I I also don't un~ I mean is it she make her own tote bag or what like no no no I meant the tote bag itself you know the
she made herself
[oh]
okay but but I think (mm)
pricey [lah] in my opinion is not that pricey cause you set how much you want to pay
no as in I meant the promotion you know how you told me about that advertisement and all that ya all those ads
you set how long it was so like you can actually just have it for one day for like seven days
or like one month also can then you can also choose how much you want to
how much you want to pay
how much you want to pay per day so it can be like
five dollars six dollars seven dollars per day also can actually
[ah] cause
you can choose you you like I said you can choose how much do you want to pay per day also right then you can also like
choose who you aiming for cause you can choose like
(uh)
if I'm not wrong you can choose like based on interest so you can choose like crochet shopping and
bags fashion whatever [lah] like you can you can put that
under the interest so that you will so that the ads are targeted to the correct person
[ah] by right I think that it can
I think your posts can end up on there
overseas
ya
[oh] ya ya ya
you know the account gosh girl
ya I love
upcycle
[orh]
should we order together
[lah]
ya I know
but actually I kind of like those type of stores I kind of want to do something like that
honestly I think for honestly now that I think about it right if (uh) if I were
you or if like I have the
resources and I have the energy and the
motivation to do it myself I might actually
will you be interested then you see [lah] how many people would and all that like if it's a really popular design you should
probably consider bringing it back or something like that
ya cause like I think that's
that should be the goal of any
I_G shop I guess cause like
cannot come up with anything new
a few back up or like a few
a few designs that you really
like know you can do it and then like it's not that complicated but it's still nice or stuff like that
so I don't know [ah]
honestly right ya
yes I can see that
actually I think
I mean honestly it's smart [lah] and also and also
you post about it like once on her story
you know what I mean and that's still a lot [what]
anyway the designs also so cute [seh]
will it last if there's no lining
actually I love (uh) that some some I_G
so I think it's cute but ya
ya
I mean we're not encouraged to follow it even
honestly (um)
(err)
I really think I love the baggy look a lot then like I don't know [ah] I just want to do something creative not that I've the free time
but everytime I have free time
I don't understand why like I already have free time [what] I don't know why I'm not using it you know then like
I'm actually still thinking about it
but ya so like I actually kind of
to me it's not really that complicated
you know accounting actually I think
realise it's an important skill
because even though account accounting is kind of a
just a bit boring to me but then (um)
because (um)
okay (uh)
okay so I I took P_O_A when I was in like secondary ya it was in secondary I didn't do well [lah] honestly but
but I still understand what it is [lah]
financial statement or whatever okay no [ah]
like
took my score because it was a bit low ya but but honestly
is not
it's not dreadful but then
it's honestly just very is desk job [lah] but you
ya
ya (mm)
(um) industries that will be fine in a
in this situation is banking accounting food
food obviously [lah] cause
maybe
[ah] yes education and then
[ah] ya delivery like
ya [lah] just logistics maybe and stuff like that like
but arts will always be affected

yes
it instead of it being like a
[oh] I'm really going to
put in like minorities in my show cause they deserve to be the main character
versus like [oh] I'm just going to cast this
like just to be there so that people don't say it's completely white or just completely

I don't know [ah]

I mean ya [lah]
not all I will just say right now I just going to say right now even if I said all I don't mean all [lah] okay

[ah] if I just for unlimited amount of shoes for any type of sports I want right
my money won't go down and I still have time for shoes [what]
so you get where I'm going from
for my love life I think
these two things already I think is already up there to get like
the girls I want not saying they're they're gold-diggers or anything but like
I'm saying that it would help me
a part to get girls [lah] like a love my love life to kickstart my love life I would say
so ya
so what so what
why you keep talking to me about your love life #akid#
what is wrong with your love life
because like you know (err)
you can't
hate everything this I mean if you hate everything in this world right
like you don't like love right then what's the point of living you know like what is the point of living so if you hate everything if you hate everything right then
easy to say it's like it won't be good [ah] everything will just be everything [oh] I hate this I hate that so like your life would be just be full of hate [ah] so like
so like you know [ah] sometimes right you need to think about
worth it [ah]
living
so you trying to say that
you need to work hard in life [ah] for things
like a little purpose
purpose to living for living
[ah]
I mean everybody has their own opinion [what]
their own opinions in life
!chey! just joking but ya of course [ah] I want a pretty lady in my life and
(uh) show respect to my parents like that kind of girl [ah]
in that's what I look for in a girl [ah]
(mm)
she doesn't take anything seriously she's just too who to say [lah] like too playful [ah]
it's not serious so the second one is she is too serious the second one is too serious for me
she's a good mix in between [ah] like she's very serious can make me laugh and she's a nice person overall [ah]
but then turns out I'm not her type [ah] so if that that one I cannot do anything [ah] but
what I really look for in women right is ladies of course [ah] every guy want every guy want a girl that can make them laugh you know every it's just a super good bonus [ah]
so ya of course I also would want a girl that
makes me laugh and one of the key things for me is that she must be very
is it weird that I don't want a girl
so ya that is one thing I totally do would not want [ah] I want I want my my
I want my like future girlfriend
maybe not to be so needy
!whoa!
[ah]
process [ah]
process your morning
[ah] okay
[a'ah]
(mm)
it was just like out the blue [ah]
it was like your first relationship is it or
first date first D_M first everything [lah]
it's like your first breakup [ah] you don't know how to handle [lah]
[oh]
it's like you know when you thought you found the one
like you know like
I know I mean relationships are bound to have ups and downs moments [what] but then like
there are definitely more ups than downs [what]
so right when I'm going through the ups right
I feel like [oh] this girl is like really made for me you know it's like fated [ah] some would say
so ya
but then when she
labels [ah] I would say
(mm)
so you just became like a emotional guy [ah]
like you just needed like reasons [ah] like you want to solve it [ah] like you don't want to just breakup
like that [ah]
so like you try to you know talk to her [lah] but she didn't
she didn't like get back to you [ah]
she
move on [ah] so you just move on with your life
forget about her slowly
I mean if you're really lucky [lah] your first try you get
until to that state then you can marry that person then that's very good [ah] because like
so like ya [lah]
[a'ah] [seh]
in this world [ah]
if you can get anything for free right what would you want
free it's not about the three wishes
the three wishes was another thing
but
[a'ah]
[oh] okay okay okay
so what did you leave her for someone
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
the more you get to know her the more you feel like it
ya relationships is has its ups and downs so it's okay
(mm)
so like just out of the blue she just kind of said she lost feelings [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] that's good that's good
[ah] to be honest [ah]
it depends on how the break up went [ah]
it's like
ya
so like
what's the point [kan] ya
so like so like after your break up then you all became friends or
didn't [ah]
look for any other partners everything going to stay as friends [ah]
do you still searching for love or anything
[ah]
[oh]
[ah]
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh]
(mm)
[ah]
you just try to care for her [lah] like just be there for her be a friend that is
for be you just want to be there for her like a friend that cares [ah]
[ah]
that's
that's a super hard question [ah] because like people like you and me we are like totally two different type of people you know so like
four or six months
depends on hard
the break up ended [ah]
like
so like ya so like I'm trying to say that
different people have different paces in moving on [lah]
so like maybe for you right how long did you take to move on from this [one]
were you still moving on
ya
(mm)
your second girl your ex [lah]
[ah]
is I mean it's not wrong to care about like what is she up to you know
you get what I mean
so it's like
it's like that [ah]
it's like something that is lost can never be found again [ah]
people say this one
so like ya
(ugh)
ya
to~ totally not wrong
(mm)
in my in my relationships [ah] my past love life and all these things right
it's like it totally comes down to me [ah] I feel like sometimes I don't put too much effort like I feel I always put
sometimes there's always this thing
where I always feel like I don't put enough
effort and I put too much effort you get what I mean
so like
there's stuff I did like I totally regret now [ah] like
imagine if I did I didn't do that in the past I would I might still be together with her now you know like
it's like of course [ah] I I I feel like sometimes I
you know I'm still young also like as you said like I'm still young also so like even you leave and you learn [ah]
so like [ah]
(mm)
it's like you just live [ah] like your future self think about that in the future [ah] I get what you mean
so like ya like you know [ah]
you always got to know [ah] sometimes it's not always your fault in the relationship [ah] so like
you know you always got to tell yourself
[ah] go the way you want it to then

(uh) five of us
okay so
(uh) five of us [lah]
so in K_L
so there were five of us
my sister me my three of my cousins [lah] so we planned and then we stayed in a hotel a quite famous hotel
so we okay so they were insist they insisted
to
take bus
I don't want to take bus
I I hate long bus ride
I prefer honestly I prefer like (uh)
bus
more expensive [one] type more expensive ones so it was quite comfortable ya so it was quite comfortable
so that's not the point the point was
we reached the hotel at five A_M
five A_M and all of us are like half awake
so reached the hotel lobby and then we checked in as usual cause we did ask we did request for early check in cause one thing about our fam~ there's one thing about me and my family we don't like to waste time
we don't like to wait we we just would rather just pay extra to just like check in early whatever [lah]
so reached the hotel the hotel lobby
(um)
(uh) one one one one of the one of the famous hotel in K_L that has a shopping mall
so
cause there were five of us so we take the suite
the okay that that was not the first time (uh) I stayed there
it was the second time actually the first time was with my family [lah]
so it's technically a a door like
door within a door you get what I mean
okay on the okay so on the next next okay the door next to our room
is the emergency exit
so when you walk a little bit more (uh) it's the kitchen the big living room with the dining
with dining
inside that living room next to the dining is another room with a king-sized bed that that that that's my cousin's room
so we have two toilets [lah]
okay the thing is that right when you when we went in (uh) cause we were all very sleepy already
so we just take our spot we didn't even bother to like
(err)
give any comments we only shared our experiences when we reached singapore and it's not like the next day after one week and we actually heard it from
our mothers like like I told my mum
[ah] they told their they told their my aunt
so actually my mum and my aunt shared our stories then we we went back to the WhatsApp group and like
[oh] my god you experience you experience this
I experience this also
then after that we meet and then we shared the story like it's funny that
all of us experienced different things but we only decided to share that thing when we in singapore
okay so
my there there were five of us so
(uh) my sister and I took the first room
so my cousin insisted that she wants an extra bed
so we so we called and all these we we called and then they said that (uh) [oh] (um) the bed is hundred fifty per night and all this [lah]
ya but
so so we were like okay [lah] we didn't think much then like just heard the biggest the bigger sister took the sofa and then we all just went to bed and then at twelve and then at twelve and then at twelve when we wanted to go for lunch
then my cousin brought it up again I want to get an extra bed
so everybody sleep in the room together
ya the same cousin that okay one of the younger [one] [lah]
so she she insisted she wanted to get extra bed
so we were like why why is she so persistent then my my sister my sister my sister offered
(uh) no okay wait no babe the story has not ended
so (uh) when my sister offered
she she was still very persistent my cousin was still very persistent no no no no everybody sleep in the room
so
at night we all went back
and then we we all went back and then
we all went back to our hotel room and then suddenly we just
together
so we actually brought the entire (uh) we moved the entire bed (uh) all the mattress outside at living room imagine how big the living room is
so we moved everything out at the living room and then we just slept together for three nights
okay let's just sleep together
okay
so
we thought of like (uh) let let's go get bath bombs
(uh)
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
no
(um)
after that is the bathtub
(um) the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
kit~
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too [lah] so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money [lah] I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty R_M
thirty R_M bath bombs so
(uh) that okay that was the second night when we decided to (um) buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and (uh) my grandma
yes
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
[ah]
but
we didn't think much [lah] cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me (um) what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something [lah]
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
(um)
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say (um)
ya
when my mum called her sister then
(mmhmm)
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
(uh) another bed
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
(um) this this kind of thing [ah] ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
(um) she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually (uh) on the left
(um)
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
(um) dusty
nothing else (um) was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall [one] the room was dusty [lah]
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think (uh) occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like
(um) in our heart [lah] we're like
(uh) this is the
first this is the first time we are getting a high floor room
ya but then we didn't think cause (uh) it was like five thirty A_M in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed [ah]
so when we so so after that
so okay the continuation of the story
that was our personal experience and then
and then when and then when my cousins (uh) she we all we all went back to work
and some right
so my cousins [ah]
so my cousin said (uh)
best [lah]
(uh) it was fun
but we had (uh)
we had experiences
(uh) in the hotel room
she is a malaysian
[oh]
yes
so they did that (um)
so so the moment she know what that she (uh) quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google [lah]
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
(uh)
the first time
was with my family
but that [one] we actually (uh) my parents took the first room and then the four five of us right the the living room
technically it's not okay technically there were no living room [ah] during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just (uh) king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the (uh)
front room [lah]
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
[oh] only sixteen twenty
that (uh) definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel [seh]
corner corner
okay the the floor
so the the the hotel very big right
(uh) the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
(uh)
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like (um) kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
(uh) we couldn't be bothered [lah] cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
(uh)
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work [ah] we we we like (err) don't want [ah] we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in K_L and we could have been to #krabi# if not cause of this COVID
[ah] it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us (uh)
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were (uh)
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think [lah]
[eh] ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal [one]
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
(err) given a choice I won't want to go back there
[ah]
but I've
but I'm okay honestly I will I glad that I experience it with my cousins

we would put it in like one basket
great grandmother
sec two or sec three
she was she was the seekers she used to take care of my theatres all the time when she was
if like a good education
I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to (um) another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
(mm)
op~ click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you [ah] they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
[ah] so
yes ya
then you can you can use their (err)
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you [lah] I'm not sure about your personal [one] but my school [one] has like
(um) my school's background
(err) you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show [lah]
(mm)
K
(mm)
so when you click share screen right
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
it will show everything that I go
everybody can see that
but
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share [lah] share
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
[ah] you stop share [lah]
ya so you just stop share
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
(mm)
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say (um) they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that [one] is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
allow
she chose don't allow
pick the stop video I mean I mean [ah] like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
(mm)
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
thumbs up thumbs down
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands (uh) put down your hands yes no
(err) thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs [ah] hands up
ya usually at the participants area [lah]
ya then like just now you can like
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want #siti# instead
so #siti# ya and then other basic things is (err) okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
okay so you can choose between like (err) record on your laptop or record on cloud
and then I had to record the classes
[ah] I chose
the first mistake was I chose (uh) to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
(mm) so so I had to I had to
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
(mm) ya
and then some basic things like chat
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host (uh) even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which (err) will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
(uh) instead of everyone there's like person [ah] other people's name all the participants' name [lah] then they will have like bracket privately
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
it will be altogether
(mm) ya but that's just like
(mm) other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
forty people
so I will just
I'll just be like (err) there will just be a notification that pops out (uh) proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait [lah]
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
(mm)
(mm) I guess so [lah] but like
cause
I get
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just (err)
it will just be somewhere here [lah]
like ya
google meet or live outlook something like that [lah]
(mm)
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal I_D then you just copy and send to people [lah]
(mm)
but just now you had you had something on
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
(mm) but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries [lah]
[ah]
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
[ah]
[oh]
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
!huh!
the gavin (err)
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation [what]
[oh] then the escape room is they create or what
welfare pack [kan] everything is online now [what] so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff [ah]
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with [lah] so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like (err) cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical [one] or something like that but like
maybe maybe ya then they
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather (um) if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay [what] to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that [lah]
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried [lah] we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that [lah] like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
(mm)
and then like initially I wanted to
(uh) produce like three different
to produce one instead
engage in home-based businesses
like it was supposed to be
release
[oh] it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of (uh)
they open [lah] but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
(err) we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
!woohoo!
ya our target was four hundred dollars
four courses [a'ah]
(err) each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my (um)
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half [lah] like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible [what] it's not to rely on like
[kan] so like that's what he said [lah] he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
(mm) but ya not not there yet not as
(mmhmm) (mm)
ya then we're like that's quite true [lah]
(um) no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is [oh] third is excel and forth is (um)
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like (err) in our faculty there was there's another group
[oh] by the way I won a giveaway from them
ya it's a just a makeup set [lah] ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
[oh] ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
ya
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course [lah] ya
and then fast forward (err)
like
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him [lah] I was like [oh] will you be interested [oh] I ask his number from my friend and then after that [ah] I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
[ah] but ya it's just it's
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
(uh) two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like (uh) extra class notes and he even like answered (err) post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
[oh] but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like D_B_S
and like
ya and he
[oh] he was (err) he was chosen for D_B_S and Facebook or something like that like I know like (uh) ya
prestigious one [lah] but then
but he in the end he chose like D_B_S I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
(mm) really [meh]
(mm) okay [lah] ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like !wow!
how is someone that smart
ya
soft launch soft
soft launch for what
[oh] the Staple B is it
bento set
[oh]
(mm)
but like what does his dish contain
fragrant white
right
but it's like is it meant to be healthy or like
[oh]
what else is inside his dish like it's just chicken and rice it's a bit like plain no
but I saw the pictures it was quite nice
ya
it's at #novena#
so is that good
[oh]
how is going to earn from that
[ah]
so food court [lah]
that's basically a food court
(mm)
that's a food court
there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
(mm) no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
[ah] it's focus more if your if your room is conducive [lah] but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all [what] I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
like I don't even know how people study in #tampines# hub
the basement [kan] you're talking about the basement right
ya the N_T_U_C is twenty four hours [what]
ya I mean how can people go inside N_T_U_C without going inside the area
ya
[oh] no cause COVID then now they
[oh] but library now they open
I think
#bugis# the national library and like some bigger national libraries like #tampines# library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online [lah]
like I don't mind studying outside but
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is [oh] my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that [one] my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams (err) assignments to do
six
all different [lah] so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
twenty four hours [ah]
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can [lah] but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you [lah] but
like it's not not
#neh#
no but it was
it was so much time [lah] I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
!huh!
no [lah]
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
[oh] you look at
exactly ya
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
[oh] no but
but one thing bad about online school was that (err)
[orh] okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module [lah] but
[ah] generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
no the answer is no
[oh] that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
like (err)
about the same so let's say
in this (uh) my first mod then my second mod right I have like (um) my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
(um) let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like [eh] it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like !yay! no exam fun [what] then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like !huh! why I never knew until I experience it
and my major (err)
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words [lah]
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major [one]
and then two thirteen november okay then this [one] is okay [lah] relax [lah]
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two [lah] but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam [what] like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time [lah] then now I think
some period
now and
two [eh] no week six that's the crazy period [lah] cause that's the like now now is my #chiong# period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster [lah]
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
that's that
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
(err) result for my which one
my G_L four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
(mm)
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you [lah]
ya
!huh!
[oh] no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments [kan]
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case [lah] cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that [what] then I think they don't want [lah]
ya but
I guess it's it's okay [lah]
like
(mm) will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did [lah]
ya
ya
it's like
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni [lah] I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my C_A_P
cause when you freeze your C_A_P then cause of my C_A_P now is is okay [lah] I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
ya and then after that
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
(mm)
(mm)
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like [oh]
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
(uh) our sem two [kan] sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email [lah] they said like [oh] like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no vac~ cause they were I think
so they said cannot [lah] like
I think only countries to europe
asia and U_S
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there [lah]
ya
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything [lah]
but the thing is my
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again [lah] cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
you have to wait
you have to wait another year [lah] so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do (um) online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause (uh) you're it's actually taking
right
no it's not
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if (uh)
they don't let
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck (lah) we just we just trying to ask but
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then (um) the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
and obviously the school will not allow it [lah]
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore [what] if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can [lah] which is damn unfair cause it's just like
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
[eh]
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous [lah]
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first [ah] so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options [ah] to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay [lah] no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now [what] it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
[oh] ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision [what] remember
like for me to enter my my R_C
but ya [oh] did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know [lah]
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report [lah]
ya but no the thing is
(mm) like cause some people notice like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
then like people like
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything [lah]
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know [ah] just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
(uh) what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release (err) a statement [lah] saying like [oh] increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for N_U_S again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know [lah] look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
(um) my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like [oh] like it only happens in N_U_S everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous [lah]
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report [lah] like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic [ah]
like everytime another one comes and then like (uh) yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that [what]
okay so I want to ask you question how's your army life
what kind of achievement that
excited right
what's #toh# what is #toh#
during training
[ah]
(uh)
but you already have your plan for after already what plans
yes
jobless for the first three months first six months after out already
(mmhmm)
and compete
how long it will take [ah]
how long will it take the
working from home yes baking taking orders bake cake
and then ya if I can
so I'm baking from home doing facebook live selling clothes and also doing a part time job
kitchen actual kitchen space to bake to actually bring my passion to the fullest
passion to the fullest got such word or not some sort
ya basically is it okay it's not that I don't want a job [ah] okay I apply for job job don't want me
ya I mean it's normal it's normal like job don't want you is normal [lah] a lot of people so don't have jobs right then
that's what I do this baking home business baking selling clothes
so but right now I'm really hoping my facebook live selling clothes right will
will will
ya will progess~ progress so this is what I really want
or what what what
(mmhmm)
my next step obviously obviously this is so obvious I wanna shop I want to earn a shop and I wanna sell clothes in the shop obviously [kan] but at the same time I would be doing facebook live as well so (um) hopefully by then facebook life won't die off hopefully by then facebook

and (uh)
[ah] switch off switch on
freshen up
she doesn't mind [ah] so I was like (uh) !wow!
was like [oh] !wow! and then my reply was [oh] !wow! I didn't expect her to be because I
I was in a fifty fifty [ah] thing [ah] where I expect her
(uh) you know I will just
overjoyed [ah] I was over I was just overjoyed [ah] and excited to you know [ah] talk to her and then she said like she didn't mind and then I
(err) [oh] !wow!
I didn't expect her to reply and then (uh)
so we we talk and then after that we started to talk [ah] she was like replying
constantly and then (uh)
[ah]
[oh] K K
in her and I was like
in front of my me
[ah]
and then
it went [ah] it went well
(uh) it went well until
you know she was
the first day [lah]
[ah]
and then (uh)
you know you were happy and then we went our first date [ah]
okay [ah] everything went well and then at this one point [ah]
and then she and then like
[ah] she just said that
(um)
the whole thing
like your first
(uh huh)
as in
[oh]
almost everything [ah] and then
(uh)
[ah]
they didn't
you could say that (uh) you could say that it was long [ah]
and it was my the first time what so I didn't know what to do so I was like
and when I was in denial I was like
still (uh)
I wouldn't say want to force [ah] it was just like
maybe in that in a sense I guilt trip her not really guilt trip her [lah] but maybe maybe it was [ah]
it was just so heartbreaking [ah] you know for me
[ah]
cold also she said thanks that's all like literally that's all
and then that was I guess
(err) the last straw [ah]
final one
ya
[ah] then ya then basically I just move on [ah] because it was my first I don't know what to do I feel scared
so I just I had to move on with life and I did [ah] somehow I did
I mean I guess it was good for me [ah] I was the first
you know and (uh) you cannot expect the first to be your last
I mean (um)
that's one
(err) but I guess
[a'ah] [lah]
as in example [ah]
(um)
the second [one]
the second [one] okay the second [one]
for feeling this way because
she was my second and I'm already having
okay so this my second [ah] it was in my
my I_T_E you know (uh) it was my first year in NITEC
and
(err) I saw her [ah]
and then
contact [ah] and then
and (uh) just looking around [ah] I'm just like
and then
same thing you know
[ah] I was excited you know again I felt that way somewhat I fell away again
and then you know we talk know I was excited I was entertained
she was very funny
okay she was very funny (um)
(uh) I like her [ah] pretty much the from the start I was like I like
[ah]
I never thought like it would be with this girl and then like
and you know we went to dates we went to everything she was funny know she entertain me she understood me (err)
you know again
this
(uh)
(um)
(err)
she's not feeling it anymore [ah]
and
[ah]
and then again [ah] like like just the previous one again like again everything I thought it was going good you know and
I saw her as this girl that
she was just perfect [ah] in even in her most
a touchy thing to say so ya and I'm being honest [ah] like she was like even in her imperfectness I saw perfectness [ah] so
she was my ideal girl [ah] in
in in fact [ah] you know like
so when she said that I was like
in shock and like again I took it
I I can say I took it better than the previous [one] [ah] how I took it was better
you know
so I say like and and then when I tried to like talk her out of it I talk about the last relationship the last relationship like how I went to go with it you know how I pestered
so I told her like [ah] okay [lah] then I cannot do anything about it
I just want you to be happy [ah] that's
so
(err)
and I'll I still do [ah] still do care about her [ah]
(um)
you know and she's
amazing [ah] so till this day she's still amazing [ah] and
so I move on with (uh) my life and she move on with hers so she give
she give me her closure in her own way and (uh) you know
we stick out we somehow made it as a friends [ah] you know
ya so ya I guess somehow we made it as friends you could say friends [ah] till this day because we still
(mm)
[ah]
I think she got with like
(err) in total like
two guys after me so
and then
[ah]
we were just friends time and time again I will ask about her I will ask her like how's
how it was good how it was going you know for her
and
because I truly cared for her [ah] like I could say after the break up I
even till this day I could say that
I would say I still think like about her like what she's doing like how is she is she fine
and
on occasionally as I said [ah] I would ask her [ah]
you know she also ask me like how am I doing and like
update me on some stuff
then to me it's fine [ah] I think to me what we have is
I think I believe that both of us what I believe is we both have
we like to believe that we both have moved on [ah] and I think I moved on
like in fair enough to say I moved on [ah] just that I just care about her as as some as someone
who
was special to me at one point in my life
and then (um)
we so we just kept in contact and then I met this girl
(err) and she was also with another man
if I'm not wrong [ah]
no [ah] it was very mature [ah] for me it was mature [ah] as much as
it was a mature relationship between me and her it's not like we meet meet still meet up or what you know
[ah]
(err)
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days [ah] some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone [ah] I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
[ah]
something like that [ah]
[oh] [ah]
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now (err)
I was
still in process [ah] honestly I was still in process [ah] low-key I was still in process
but
(err)
somehow I I
I move on [ah] I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is [ah] and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
(err) I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
[ah] I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
(um)
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay [ah] maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening [ah]
but it feels it feels like a crime [ah] sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having [ah] because I really love what we are having already [ah] so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good [ah]
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask [lah] like
what what what went wrong
[ah]
okay so it's like
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride [ah] I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous [ah]
my previous
girl [lah] and
to me it's fine I guess you know (uh) as you said also I think it's fine [ah]
so and it's okay [ah]
(um)
(mm)
but
doing my best as well [ah] so if it goes to where
but if not
like
(uh)
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
okay okay
first thing
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is (uh)
you know I learnt how to accept
(err)
third thing thing is (uh) I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time [ah]
(um)
true ya what you said is true [ah] and
ya and then you know those are the three lessons [ah]
and
(uh) I guess so far it's been great [ah] when
I don't want to say
I don't want to say she's my last
but I hope so
good thing like in what way
or like
(err)
[ah]
okay so there other day right I was recently I've been watching a lot of
the VTuber A_S_M_R [oh] my goodness I'm going to like combust you know like because normally s~ sometimes they have like the A_S_M_R mic right like the really good quality one so this guy he bought the I think it's called a bi~ binaural mic bi~ the for the basically you can hear like left and right right
[oh] my goodness then he was like (uh) then he was like whispering inside the ear and then I was listening it listening to it before I went to sleep and then I was like falling asleep already then after that he shifted the mic
he put it he put it to his chest so you can like hear his heartbeat very clearly and then after that he started whispering and this is damn cringe but I thought to myself !wah! is this what it's like to lie down on someone's chest while they're sleeping [oh] my god that's the dream it's so good then he revealed
he spent about
he said he spent I think twelve K on the mic
then after that when he said that he spent twelve K on the mic everybody started sending him money
like I just want to be a VTuber so people can send me money like they were pulling
this other guy he was pulling (uh) #gacha# for the Apex game
and then the moment he sent it someone sent him like two hundred dollars
and I'm like
dude
like I want to earn #gacha# so I can just earn back everything and pull more #gacha#
then another one they
he what [ah] he cause he didn't turn on super chats for his streams like ever since he debuted I think but then he decided to turn them on for this one stream and I think he earned about one point seven million yen
that's the dream job though
super chat is the
is the way to send money through if on a youtube live stream so like you can send different amounts so there's like five dollars ten dollars it's up to maybe like five hundred dollars I think
and then you can send a message and the more the higher the super chat amount the longer your message is pinned on like the comment board so they can read it that kind of thing
it's like it's damn cool but then
is the
it's just that's the dream job jobs I don't want to work
I really don't want to work
it's insane
all they have to do is sit there and be pretty
ya then like
it's like but I guess especially for streamers right from what I see I guess it's not that easy especially because of like the drama that I told you about just now
I and the fact that they have to stream every day I guess it's hard to differentiate yourself in such a saturated market [lah] that's the thing
there's one guy who streams at least two hours everyday he's the one who spent like one point five K on #gacha# the other day just because he really liked the voice actor
then he spent I think he spent another
a few hundred dollars [lah] at least the other day to get the cute girl the one that I showed you yesterday with the really cute running cycle
he's so hot like
(um) what [ah]
(uh) I was gonna say something but I forgot
it was damn cute I want to see them play together they a~ they're competing I think they were training for like this thing called the C_R cup so basically it's like (uh) an Apex Legends tournament
these help it's organised by like this other VTuber this other streamer who's like really good at Apex so there are a lot of people from like VTubers or just pro gamers in general they can join the cup and then I think this time round they actually got prize money they like fifty thousand yen or something like that
it's quite a lot
fifty thousand fifty thousand I think
n~ n~ no (uh) fifty thousand yen in S_G_D is
okay [lah] six hundred fifty dollars I thought it would be more but this I think this the first time that they are having
prize money [lah] but it's quite interesting to watch
it's
the the last one was quite interesting because
there's this VTuber whose avatar is literally just a gorilla he's just cause his his username is just V gorilla virtual gorilla which is quite interesting like you actually like when you listen to his voice and then you look at the avatar it's like !huh! that makes sense it's not surprising but he's like really good at Apex a lot of these people are like the top five hundred
I cannot [sia] F_P_S is so scary
I I thought you meant in real life as in like he tried he like hit you with your or something like that
hand eye coordination skills for games is good because I I started playing games when I was pretty young cause you know my brother right
my I know my class ratio was also quite whack we only had like
I think that ratio was similar to yours we only had ten guys eleven guys I think it's common for schools of like a~ an~ anderson and B_P_S B_P_S B_P_G B_P B_P yes that level then the
I never really started playing games a lot until I got until I got the Switch actually
because before that okay [lah] my parents raised me to be a bit of a nerd [lah] I mean I'm not surprised I mean look at them right this guy reads
what's it called P_S_P
that was damn good though it's like now you think about it right the P_S_P was basically a Switch
that's why it's like the P_S_P was so ahead of its time I love playing with the P_S_P I don't know mine was pink and I only had like one game on there and it was Taken
the P_S_P is like quite similar it's basically like your Switch Lite right
it's basically the same then what [ah]
(uh) shit what's that other game called Mortal Kombat is it the one with the this like this blue ice guy who's like do you know who
I like that guy I used to have this phase where I just really like watching their like what is it called their finishing moves that [one] !wah! that [one] is quite cool I really like the whole concept of like coming up with each characters like
like finishing moves or like their character design that's what I really like watching looking at when I play games
I remem~ I remember watching I remember watching one of those the ones where like they just yank your intestines out
but
I I have to admit I really like the character design even regarding final fantasy right there's that one guy I think his name is cloud is he from final fantasy
I like watch~ I like playing him on Smash because [eh] he quite handsome and his power quite cool
[ah] I want to get good at Smash though
I really want to get good at Smash but it's so difficult like I was watching okay not to bringing the conversation back to VTubers but like they often sometimes the livers like to play with their audience right so they put like the room password and all that on the screen then one there's one notorious guy known as h~ he's not a streamer he's a a viewer also this one guy whose username is pornhub then he always plays as donkey #kong# and he has never failed to turn up with every single [eh] thi~ this company [lah] this company at least every single livers livestream if they are playing smash with the viewers and he always beats the shit out of that liver [ah] I don't think I think to this day
nobody has ever beaten pornhub donkey #kong# in in smash if they play with viewers that's the someone has gotten very close it's the guy who spent on point five K on #gacha# he's he got very close to beating him but I think in the end the donkey #kong's# the one that's quite that's like a interesting piece of lore from youtubers but that's quite cool
like I would like to have the title [oh] I beat this VTuber in Smash once I want to play Tetris but they never play Tetris anymore like they used to they used to play Tetris a lot but now now that I'm good at Tetris nobody plays it anymore I cannot flex my skills
it's my one secret talent Tetris but haven't played in quiet a while though
it's quite long right
[ah] (uh) did they give you like a batch number or something like that
then maybe you should ask them about that [lah]
it's it's been that's really long it's not a signed on right
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya I remember now I remember now
I haven't bought an album in so long
but I heard that one thing that was quite scary before #changsub# enlisted was I heard that
something
he has something to do with his vocal chords like it was like
either getting quite damaged or basically it wa~ it was like threatening his the ability to sing [ah] so that was quite okay I can't remember the details but ya that was quite scary they said
he was straining it too much or something like that
I know they often I don't know if it's an army thing or what but they have like musicals inside the army is it
right
you
like
discharged
!huh! serious
#alhamdulillah# I don't know if it's the right
term but
then
I was like how do they even figure that out
you know you know what I mean your NAPFA is one thing [lah] but
like the more intense stuff like
like diving I don't know I don't know to be honest but it was quite scary but I think he rejected it in the end because it was like nah bro I don't want to become a slave to the army
[oh]
[oh] serious
(mmhmm)
I can I I remember but I cannot remember #ashraf#
I think infantry is like the main
the only knowledge I have about singaporean national service is [ah] boys to men that's it that's the only that's the only thing that I know
but that was the whole thing like singapore is
one of the f~ is it I don't know if there are more countries in the world that make it that make cons~ cont~ conscription is that the word
they're like
okay anyway the the the fact that they have to go to army enlist
if it's I wonder if they're more countries that make it
the law that they have to or more countries that don't it's probably more countries that don't right I only know korea is necessary singapore necessary
I don't know what malaysia is it necessary
I know I think it was
was it japan they said
that they don't have like their army in the army they don't it's not like they train physical they train physically [lah] but they do a lot of other shit like
what meditate or stuff like that it's like it's basic army is basically like therapy for them shi~ it's interesting but like what happens
like
I wonder what would turn out better you know people who are forced to be inside there or people who like
they and you enlist but then again your training is not necessarily
as bad you know
it's so scary to think about though
kamikaze
ya that's the one they like stab themselves in the stomach right or slit open their stomach like that
lose
but then again I guess death
being a prisoner of war
not very two bright sides you know it seems like a lose lose situation here so
probably not
screws over your whole body
!huh!
heartbreak
[oh]
I don't like watching war movies just because I really cannot like you know you know me right I cannot watch anything with too much emotion I'm a very mellow person the most
t~ intense war like thing I probably watched was the
(uh) what's the one that the Ghibli [one]
I cannot that part was like that that that shit really hurt I really cannot
it's so scary to think that world war two
was not even that long ago
it's
it's not even not even hun~ hundred years not even a hundred years right
like that's so recent that's damn scary
ya that shit they can't that can't be not traumatic right so I didn't really want to bring it up again but it was like
damn scary imagining imagine that you have to hide for your life like that
damn scary
serious [ah]
#bestnya#
that's that's that's terrifying that's real terrifying [oh] my god
when was that before the after war
#suay#
!wah! that's damn scary though wasn't there the controversy recently about like
how
[ah] okay I don't know if controversy is the right word but people were quite angry at how the japanese pretend like they never did anything bad ever
ya
#hiroshima#
karma
!wah! s~ I remember watching a documentary about the what went down at the nuclear plant like they were
interviewing cause it's quite rural right so then they were interviewing the people who were living in that village
and then they were talking about how [oh] all are the kids were
they interviewed like the schoolchildren and all that
like n~ the people who were still kids at that point and like the school teachers and all that then I think some of them even though they were like quite far from the thing
they
got exposed to like all the radiation and all that then a lot of them like they didn't not that they passed away instantly but they passed on like a few years after that then it was so scary the way they talked about it so like
you can feel that they are still like very scared of that area then they showed the village what it was like and like a lot of the they showed like the fruits and like the plants and all that it's
the nuclear plant
!huh!
wait that's both very scary and very sad at the same time cause I know they they believe quite strongly in what religion do they follow [ah]
it's not it's like a subset of buddhism is it
spin off
sorry I laughed just now because you know I sent the message to my parents to tell them to enter the house quietly
I misspelled house as horse and then my dad said there's a horse
that's the thing right but like how to say
even if you're different at least they're nice about it that kind of thing I remember last time I went to
irritating
it's just
like damn dude d~ d~ all the stares [what] you will literally like stare like nobody's business
[oh] speaking of the like tsunami and earthquake right wasn't there that one really big earthquake or tsunami in
indonesian #aceh# is it
I know it was really big but I don't
do you remember like any news about it I cannot okay given that we were one [lah]
that's true
!huh! serious [ah]
then they said like
(uh) when they is the causeway open already
ya the thieves they stayed in the house
right
(ugh)
(ugh)
it's basically parasite
less gruesome sense
but the fact that they have to resort to that is quite sad as in like the homeless people in america the homeless crisis is so bad like I was watching
a documentary about it the other day
like there are so many
homeless people and because inevitably all these people like fall end up falling sick right and then (uh) for all the people apparently
it's insane I cannot it's a gross country
I cannot [eh] my first amendment my right to own a gun like it's gross dude disgusti~ I almost swore I don't know if I'm allowed to swear but
I don't know [lah] it's just okay [lah] granted they have a their population is what three times
five whatever [lah] it's huge right and like I get that elections are much more big
the one again one of the pros of living in singapore
okay apart from the super super what do you call it
super majority
if anything but at least now things are changing but I just hope they don't lower the voting age
countries like america
that's the thing you see like okay not okay I might sound a bit like a boomer like but
please [lah] if they
on~ okay I can~ cannot sorry reform party but did not specifica~ specifically targeting you but it's just
okay how to say
then the money shouldn't it be equal s~
given regardless of your party since technically this is still
the go~ the government see this is why you shouldn't let people our age vote we don't know about this kinda thing it doesn't it just doesn't work out
is that sh~ it's not #shahira# is it he's not suddenly right he agents near G got her she did she got her first as a back already she did really [lah] she most people said was reporting or A B for the people that she got there are only two people like the professor gift and a push by eight minus and she was so happy person as it was about I think it was about karl marx and just his communism until ya there's marks and then he's called though not really she had to like read the book or like some excerpt from the book and then she had read a whole essay advocate like two thousand words ya
[oh]
the essay was about what
just karl marx and just his communism
(ugh)
I can't believe she's in uni already that's insane
makes sense though
#bestnya#
I also want to go overseas study
(ugh) my heart pain yesterday
you have to bid it's like imagine N_D_P but like on steroids
my heart pain I was I was more sad about the fact that we wouldn't get to go (uh) university exchange because look at #rifqi# he's still so close with his two friends like [eh] I also want to be friends with a cute japanese boy okay
I'm sure like and not gonna lie if both of us had applied I'm pretty sure both of us would have been shoot in students
like not gonna lie like I don't normally don't have that much confident in confidence in my abilities but like
!wah!
twenty twenty man one more and I can't believe it's almost november already november december [eh]
and this sem okay [lah] given that our assignments are quite hands-on all that we're moving so fast
I cannot I really cannot
okay

I'm just there like (oo)
ya bro but not dogs like I understand [lah] like if nature I understand if like a deer fell inside a river and like crocodile eats the deer but like this one the human is the one like providing the dog to the crocodile there is something that could have been prevented [what]
my god
I read the comments you can like somehow predict [lah]
and like animals are so vulnerable like they are not even to like talk to us
but we are like doing this to them
drop kick
[eh] [eh]
[oh]
(uh huh)
as I was saying I love animals
ginger is like he's trying to scratch me
ya ya I did it to my cat before
(uh huh)
okay hello hi [ah] #amir# how are you doing
!huh! okay [ah]
doing good (err) just I don't know
COVID situation
but the same for you [lah] you're also in army right so (err) it's just S_D_M [ah] social distancing
okay
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] what are we doing now
okay understand
(mm)
ya
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
they take turns [ah] like in six
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see [lah]
ya
(mm)
yes
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(uh huh) (uh) (mm) [ah]
(mm)
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
[oh] actually [ah]
[ah] okay okay good
okay [lah]
[a'ah]
(err)
I don't [ah] nothing much about it it's to me it's (err) quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause (err)
I post that like the last thing I said was (err) it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades [ah]
[ah] paradoxical [kan]
(err)
like it it
automa~ because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself [ah]
really your P_S_L_E score
really [ah] I see
[ah] I haven't seen that
[ah] same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school (err) to secondary school [lah]
as of time
ya ultimately (uh) what happens (err)
what secondary school the person goes to will affect thei~ their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about (err) that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
(uh huh)
(err) these days like
like I don't read the news
ya
[ah]
ya
basically that's the thing
(mm)
(err) okay
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army [kan]
ultimately what S_A_F is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
or
fireworks
I guess
so
(err) we come from J_C then
we just talk to our own people [lah]
[ah] own circle [lah] ya [oh] ya
(mm)
ya these two years not wasted
ya so far
ya [ah]
ya (err)
so unless they went out of their way today
(uh huh)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
do anything else
ya true
[ah] ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in N_S [lah]
but even in N_S you can do stuff outside N_S you can learn other skills in your free time [ah] if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
(err) so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
(err) which wouldn't be applicable [lah] cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn (err) can be applicable [lah]
(err) recently I went through this (uh) ammunition course
then (err)
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff [ah] (err) stuff related to storage
and (uh) inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
(err)
going out with my family that rarely happens
[ah]
[oh] ya it's it's different
I see
[ah] easily [ah] [ah]
okay [mah]
(uh huh) [ah] okay [ah]
that's that's true [ah]
most of the practical
[ah]
same
[ah]
family sunday
(mm)
(err) ya [lah]
for me I
I spend
on weekends mostly at home [ah]
I spend my weekends are mostly at home usually
this usually happens like on a whim [lah]
so
ya sometimes I just stay at home relax but at home
you talk to your family [ah] at home
ya
ya that's good
[ah]
[a'ah] ya really
[ah]
ya
ya
(mm)
good point ya the thing with me is that I have
(err)
more women at home than men
so ya I only I only get to talk to my father about it but then
every time I go home he always
ask me questions about (err) when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one [ah] like that (err)
ya but during B_M_T (err) during B_M_T
(err) the start of the N_S
ya
[ah] then okay [lah] [oh] I forgot ya you registered at the same time as me
yes
yes
bro I only have two tickets dude
I only had two tickets
[oh] !wow! okay that's nice
[ah] must be western wednesday [ah]
of course [lah]
ten days worth of days
ya
[ah]
that's true that's true ya
ya
yes ya
(uh huh)
yes
(uh huh)
(mm)
that's cool that's cool wait
[ah] ya you didn't do twenty four (uh) twenty four K_M [kan]
in #tekong# ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
hawker center [ah]
ya
they were like [oh] thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits [lah] we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but (um) is to is to
yes
ya B_M_T
[ah] that's a good point ya they just did
ya
[ah] nine weeks and then next one nine months [lah]
[ah] [eh] I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you [oh] you're going to talk about the pay [kan]
so (err) to me okay
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
(err) back in J_C [kan] my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but it's okay
[ah] okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] same
[ah]
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending [lah]
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
[oh] no me too
(mm)
(mm)
ya
same
yes yes [oh] my god
[oh]
election [ah]
ya
ya that's how it is but (uh) personally I also don't
(err) I don't follow that much
(err) I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates [ah] [oh] my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about N_B_A but then N_B_A finished already
so now they're talking about elections [kan] every day they will talk about stocks
!wah! buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive [eh] [ah] this one going up the percentages all
ya and (err)
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good [lah] I think it's good that
(err) more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in N_S you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's a good thing [ah] that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we (err) get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good [lah]
but the thing is that after this
we're going to go through how many years
(err)
you have to
I have to find a way to either make money or just I don't know I'm personally
no I don't want to burden my parents like honestly I don't want to burden my parents
like they're going to sponsor my I mean okay driving license is not that much [ah]
but they've been sponsoring my whole life honestly
so
for uni so they don't have to fork out more money for now
ya so
ya
okay
[ah]
[ah]
ya
(mm)
personally I I
I aim to at least save a excess of five K (err) by the end of N_S
(err) s~ because I I've I've made a lot of plans [ah] like I have the investments
and then I also signed up
I got I got tricked into no okay not tricked I got lured into
signing a deal with A_I_A investment savings plan
insurance [oh] my gosh yes
a few bucks okay [lah] about a hundred every every month
that they will take
then save it saves more than a bank of course anything saves better than a bank honestly
interest rates well
so ya just apply and then
other than that I don't know what to do
like maybe I should also start taking down
(err) how much I spend
that will be better right
yes
(mm) okay
(mm)
yes
(mmhmm) thinking about it's
it's a rookie work yes it's realistic
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
ya actually though
forgot
you're talking about
N_S pay right leading into something else
was it
ya financially independent correct
(mm)
(mm)
carry your own weight [lah]
yes
(mm)
ya the thing is that of course okay family is written in my blood you know
the they'll be there for life but they won't be there for life like for your life
you know what I'm saying ya the
like eventually you have to live your own life [ah] so
(err) you have to start eventually
and now is a good time to start being independent
ya we can yes yes we can that was the idea
that was like we were going to talk about food
ya I don't know it's you it's you you brought it up yes
what ya I don't get it
and like okay in school or like even now
people can talk so much about food I I don't I personally don't get it like wait have you tried this thing
or have you ya
not dude (err) not about that but wha~ what what did you ask #amir#
what's my favourite food [oh] snap
(err) my favourite food is
the scone from texas chicken
the scone the biscuit thing
(mm) ne~ ya
ya
ya
[oh]
that's true that's true
for the taste or
nugget okay continue
yes
a drumstick
[ah]
!huh!
[a'ah]
[ah]
yes
[ah]
ya it's booming
yes
I do too I do too
ya same [ah]
so you look at malay people you got the highest obesity rate
highest diabetes rate probably I'm guessing
yes it's delicious
okay ya it's not so good for health
ya
you said comfort food right
#ban mian# [ah] #ban mian#
[ah] okay #tom yum#
ya
what is like the maggi #tom yum#
[ah]
[ah]
yes that's true
ya
okay understand understand
(mm)
just so and so ya
when secondary school miss the [pe] [pe]
(err) swimming lesson [kan] ya then after that
everyone including everyone has maggi
yes
[oh] my god ya
ya
ya that was the times
ya
it doesn't fill but yes okay maybe back then maybe in primary school in secon~ in early secondary it fill
[oh] it's al~ it's always bulking season it's like in N_S it's it's it's mean
what thousand calories let's say ya ya thousand calories and I think that's not even enough for me
cause of the amount of work I do everyday but it's okay ya it's a [eh] that's another thing [ah]
(err)
sometimes okay there was a point like when I was studying for A levels right when
I was eating cho~ almost purely for sustenance
like I was just buying the cheaper stuff like (err)
what saying yes
!wah!
are you serious I went up by sixty [ah]
[oh] my god
ya
comfort ya it was comfort also okay okay okay
[ah]
(uh huh)
yes
ya that was the essence
(mm) yes it's true
!huh!
[ah] yes ya and I didn't mind I didn't mind it
because it was a perk for studying
no the thing is that I mean for sustenance because
I mean it because I would spend five hours inside an aircon room
just going away at my books
or okay I don't okay [lah] I cannot read tha~ for that long but
ya reading and writing doing exercise for five hours and then after that
because I need to eat I will go out and eat
ya so
then after that go back to study [ah] that's that's what life was like
(err) doesn't matter as long as it's food
and it's cheap cause money was
I mean okay my family is goo~ is in a fortunate enough position to not worry about that but
considering how much I got per month yes
[oh] [oh] my gosh [oh] my gosh
yes
ya and then non muslims also queue up
ya
no but I think it was it's fucker level it was fucker level
and
it technically was illegal in school canteens but it doesn't matter it was good and everyone liked it
ya used to be a secret menu item right
yes
ya
ya
yes
yes
(mm)
[oh] was in the canteen yes that's true
I never skipped lectures by the way
that's a that's a very good point yes
no I sleep during lessons that's the thing
ya [oh] my gosh
the thing is that I still sleep during lessons even now in N_S
nothing has changed
(err) except I have to study less now so that's good I guess
(err) no nothing nothing too complex I can make sandwiches but okay
but I still make sandwiches if you think that it's just
taking raw items and putting it between two breads no there's a lot more to making sandwiches the
just take and pop
okay [lah] even on the pan okay fine I'm making it sound like there's more than it is
yes it is
it's not ya
ya
ya
(mm)
do you cook
okay
I remember yes
I get that a lot
[a'ah] [lah]
yours was half a bite sized
experiment [ah] experiment ya
[ah] that's true that's true
[a'ah]
ya you don't you don't think about that [lah] as a as a new cook even
yes
they'll just tell you how to do things easiest okay sometimes they does
but even then even then you have to create ourselves
yes
yes ya pretty wholesome
and he dodged my mum hoo~ hoo~ hoo~
[a'ah]
ya
[eh] was that was that trip just for me
[oh] my god
[ah]
okay
okay
yes [ah]
my gosh that was mad you [oh] wait
[ah]
ya the things you do I I haven't done anything like that in a long time like
I find myself not doing very kind these days I mean I do
like if I see opportunity like (err)
for example aunty needs to bring her bags outside the M_R_T
ya like that I help but
(err) ya I don't see
like when it comes to friends I don't I don't I never see anymore
(mm)
ya
why is it
(uh huh)
okay
(mm)
ya
ya so
you doing the thing [ah] doing the thing
yes
yes that's true
yes ya
ya that's the that's the that's the silver lining in helping others [lah]
that you have to consider their personal dignity
like when I do volunteering also I go to people's houses and I clean their house
there's certain things that they will say don't do this
don't don't wash my dishes that's not for you to do that's for me to do don't mop the floor I can do that
can you just paint the wall
or like reach for the top because I cannot do that
yes
ya so when you help others
like especially old people they only want you
to help when they really need it cause
they they still want to feel able
like putting it bluntly they still want to feel like they can do things on their on their own
ya
(mm)
ya
[ah] yes
(mm)
ya so ya
I don't know I don't know how it got here
ya
ya food
it's not a question okay
(uh huh)
and that affects the taste
okay I don't know man I don't know
okay
[oh] yes
yes yes very true very true
yes
ya
fast food [lah] fast food is easy
(mm)
#ramen#
right
yes they can they can appreciate their prices because they're halal #ramen# stalls
ya
ya
yes
(mmhmm)
okay ya I think correct [ah]
ya you can have your pork
ya it's okay [ah] it doesn't affect me
ya I'm not it's just when I go out with them
ya like I'm your I'm your limiting factor when you decide where to go
but no they say they don't mind though
they say they don't mind
but do they though
ya a couple of times I've I just followed them to where ever they go then I just sit in
[ah] buy drink buy drink
[ah]
that's true
yes
not ice cream inside
ya ya your mum always pas~ that to put something inside but but I stopped buying I stopped buying though
ya it is it is
[ah] ya like where we are right now [ah]
yes
so much
yes yes
[oh] bro ya ya ya it's okay that was an easy option
and they don't mind ya I mean ya they don't mind
that's true that's true
some will say ya like
[ah] (err) halal [lah] so everyone like once it's halal but then
a lot of the halal food is unhealthy especially malay food
ya it's quite ironic
ya I think [ah] yes yes malay the malay malay food
[ah] that [ah]
ya ya it's very obvious ya
found another fucker
[ah]
yes
ya
yes
yes malay community
(err) my gosh like you ask your malay friends
ya it's older generation [lah]
but you can change the recipe
ya
[ah] that's true
ya
ya
but they don't [ah]
ya
yes ya and it tastes nice that we have
ya
(uh huh)
[oh] [oh] everyday
okay
okay
[oh] so wait the reason why you bring your own food is because it's healthier is it
okay
that's nice that's nice that's nice
sushi okay
(err)
I'm not sure about that but I think it is also I think it is
ya
definitely
ya by a long shot
wait or ye~ [oh] sashimi itself ya that's true that's true
[oh] my gosh ya sa~ sashimi is so nice like I
ya
have it more often
yes
bubble tea (hmm)
[nah] dude okay ya I get it like a lot of people
(err) I'm not a big fan I cannot appreciate bubble tea
like I I can taste it if
I mean like it's okay if friends are getting it together right ya then I'll chip
I'll buy along ya it's a social thing social thing
I wouldn't get it actually no I do get it on my own sometimes like if I feel like it
but my bubble tea preference is very small
I wouldn't buy the
I wouldn't buy the the tea flavours
ya so
I'm more smoothie I'm more smoothie
ya the oreo crush [lah] [oh] my gosh yes yes
Sweet Talk
[ah] closed
[ah]
[ah]
ya
ya student card [lah] which I still use by the way
no it's not legal
I know
ya imagine if you are out for the whole week how much bubble tea will you buy
yes
ya that's that's the thing
no after we O_R_D right
(err) everyday you'll be out like imagine if you go out everyday
like the amount of money you lose compared to the amount of money you save if you signed on six months
is insane
ya ex~ ya extend the contract
I don't know no no no I'm actually thinking about it like the six months two K two K plus per month
no no no joke no joke
[ah] yes yes
I need money bro no but I realise [kan]
ya
ya
and earn the same amount of money [lah]
ya
but N_S is easy you're ya you're already there
ya
(mmhmm)
cooking
let you learn other stuff [ah]
it's not
[ah]
!huh!
I think ya [lah] definitely
okay (uh) my name is
salihin also from singapore poly</P2>
two also doing (uh) marine engineering</P2>
so
first we are going to talk about
ya
okay
(err) okay first
(uh) I_T_E higher NITEC but then I found out that (uh)
I got a chance to go P_F_P [ah] because my
E_M_B three was
just nice eleven
so I join singapore poly (err) through marine engineering as my first choice
so I can say
like why why are you not (uh) interested
(mm)
(uh)
what else
okay (uh) so
both of us are in year two now
so far
doing okay [lah]
ya
C_C_A
for me is (uh)
(uh)
actually from
from P_F_P till now I just keep changing C_C_A
apparently now is #muay thai#
which I find (uh) more interesting than the others [ah] in terms of
(err) social connection and all that
cause I'm performance wise is not my interest because (uh)
I guess now #muay thai# is going well so far
(uh) training quite intense so ya
[oh]
competition (uh)
not not a performance kind of competition [lah]
but performance is
like never my thing
so that's why ya
(mmhmm)
okay secondary school life okay actually because (err)
so
it was less
play time for me I guess
because I just went through the four years like
just being low key and all that
but overall I think my secondary school life was just
studying and just got through it [ah] and I go through it ya you go
(mm)
[ah]
so
is naughty [eh]
(uh)
my choice [ah] because (err) sec one sec two I had the same form teachers
secondary school that is known to be
(uh) for like naughty kids [ah] and but is because is near my house so I take it as my first choice but ya
sec one sec two
I just
that day I didn't feel like it so so I didn't go
and then I think a week after that the (uh) the the teacher in teacher in charge of the student counsellor
why you never go for the interview and all that
he's like [oh] ya ya you're a student counsellor [what] ya ya so I
wasn't expected [ah] but then I was just like
okay [lah] never mind I just I just take the role [lah] do whatever I can
but ya so I didn't really have
like like (err)
naughty stuff that I did at least
[ah]
I think okay okay wait back to the the question the
whatever naughty stuff I did I think the only
wrong thing that I did was
when I don't feel like
like going through school I just act like I sick
then then later my parents come to school
school then I could go home
ya
other then that (uh) not much [ah]
is just like I I have no problems with my studies all that so like
ya
ya
ya like I think aft~ right after N level [ah]
still retail the the best (uh) job that I did [lah] as experience because okay I started
(err) in twenty seventeen which is (err) N level twenty seventeen after N levels (uh)
I join (uh) because a lot of my classmates work there also
so usually I do kitchen so I prepare the burgers cook the meat and all that
which is fun [lah] for me
I got to
like teach myself how to handle pressure
and be independent [ah] because usually
(err) we have a lack of crew and then I have to handle the whole kitchen myself
which is still okay cause I was trained well so
ya
then what about you
(mm)
[oh]
a lot
(mm)
(mm)
these two at McDonald's
ya ya ya ya they are humble also [ah] and I think like
for malaysians also they one of the
more hardworking crew
yup and they travel so far and then you just to work F&B
ya
(mm)
so
(err) actually I got a few jobs after that so after burger king I tried
retail
so I I work at tommy hilfiger
it was
damn bad because ya because
can you imagine from burger king they're busy right then you are adapted to it
and then you have a lot of work and then
so when you have a lot of things to do
time goes on faster and then (err) so compared to retail
(err) in tommy hilfiger
it was it was
so long like I I work for eight hours a day
and then (uh) imagine like
one hour I think like only like three to five people come into the store and I don't even do much I just ask like (err) how how can I help you then they like [oh] no just browsing around and then they just leave their store and all that so
didn't have much to do other than folding clothes and ironing the clothes [ah] then so I quit after one month
but the thing was the pay was much better than burger king [lah]
but I I still prefer burger king
so but
I don't I think I went back to burger king I don't remember but also had a few other jobs
I work for McDonald's foodpanda
I also did (err)
photo booth (err)
kind of job
and then
the pay was quite good [ah] like three hours
ya
ya
and then the job also was fun because
which was fun [ah] I got experience a lot
(uh) ya
that's all for the job experience [ah]
ya honestly ya
ya
ya
think retail I counted like every minute [eh]
it was terrible but (uh)
(err) I think part of
the job experience also is why we
(uh) business and all that
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
yup
ya
yup
shore
(mm)
so six months sailing
just one month of it how how can I cope [lah]
so
but
hopefully it'll be a
lifelong kind of (uh) career
for me
to reach chief engineer
and then after that when I come back to shore (err)
exciting [ah]
[ah]
so think is okay [lah]
to have a stable living [ah] for my family
so ya
I think after all the the years
until I reach chief engineer until I can
retire the marine engineering job right then
it'll be more time spent with my family [lah]
nine to five job [kan]
and then you come back you only have like saturday sunday as your
like your days with your family
to be really you with your family [ah] and then it's it's not like your partner also has to
like work you know because you have a stable job already you can support them
so it's just really spend time with your family
(mmhmm)
yup
you can pull down [ah] ya you can come back to shore maybe (err) continue as lecturer I you relax [ah] ya
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(uh)
so (uh)
police
(uh) it was a
ya
and it was like
[oh] what what yes
(uh)
that sense of (err)
[ah] [ah]
why [ah]
ya
frogmen
(mm)
so
how will you adapt
ya
ya
I I
no no I tried to apply for the
sponsorship from air force
and then I went through the
forget what they call it but I went through the test
and it was a four hour sit down computerised test
(mm) so
ya there's a lot of different different types of test [ah]
mathematics [lor] they call it arithmetics
(uh)
then other parts is the
the intelligence but either copy spatial awareness
okay the copy north south east west
and then you know you have to know when the
when when the plane is bank left
you have to know what what kind of
they give you shapes of the planes so what what does this described and honestly
it was okay for me because ya because
(err) at that point of time
pay is
but that's the air force [ah] I mean the armed forces you you won't know what
like what went wrong you know
just
(uh)
so
but
(mm)
(mm)
then hopefully just continue marine engineering [lah]
the different opportunities
ya consider
if I get the chance to be posted to air force then in the future
then I think I would continue as a career yup (uh) I I don't mind any (uh) what you call that like areas [ah]
(mm)
ya
ya
so
ya
but ya
what else
(mm)
what about copy [ah]
primary school life
spent there six years [eh] primary school
which are compared to our different stages [lah]
ya
ya
ya
(mm) yes
ya
ya
ya
ya ya
ya
that time parkour was like trending [ah]
[ah] the jump style
it's about (err) other than that
I think by primary three I was selected to play for the school
I was quite small in terms of size
(err) whenever my
my coach like sub me
then the
I remember one time the the the ref
was talking to my coach then he said [oh] you you sub the big one with the small one [ah]
but I I didn't mind [lah] because I know my potential and then from there (uh)
so
by primary
ya so
motivate around ya discipline and all that ya
think my teachers in charge also
played a very
big part in who I am today
so so ya
ya
#tekong#
(uh) depends
okay usually striker is on your on the #tekong's# right
and then feeder is on the #tekong's# left
ya
usually striker and jumper for right leg
ya
!wah! I think after almost ten years playing
(uh)
I mostly play either #tekong#
ya
ya
the thrill of competition
and then (uh)
gain my own confidence [lah]
primary [eh]
ya
we never face them before primary school ya nationals
(err) that was like the our best performance
for the senior team [lah]
(uh)
(uh) and I also think that's important [lah] because
as in primary school also if you master your basics you are quite good already
so
I think
in total we beat over
ten close to fifteen schools all the way until (uh) finals
(uh)
[oh]
east zone is #junyuan# primary
the the one I know is
the powerhouse in nationals are
(uh) is #qihua# #qihua# primary
and
either #qihua# or #junyuan# [ah]
but
ya #junyuan# is the east zone
champions [ah] power house
but
ya and then
I vaguely
that's the thing like (err) even though
that was one of our most
the our best performance
it was my worst loss also
because it's like (uh)
personally I felt was possible [lah] but it it came down to my
my (uh) my team
that day first
first team
and the thing is it was
important to us that because
it will be the first time that our school name will be engraved inside the the the national trophy
that was so it was
I I lost [ah] it was a it was an intense match because
by right ya by right it was two rounds okay so
(uh) if
if (err) one side win two rounds means they win already but
best to three ya so
(err) we won the first round
and then they won the second round
so we had a tiebreaker and then they won the third round
so
I was very ya
[eh] but ya
ya
ya
but I think
overall they was still quite proud of us [lah]
ya
nationals to be second
like in the in singapore is
was quite
(uh)
it was a big accomplishment [lah]
but ya
okay
performance
(mm)
[oh] okay
okay
ya ya ya
is is a very big accomplishment [lah]
congratulate [lor]
which is demotivating [ah]
yup
yup
I think
[ah] that's why
no
so
no
okay [lah] (uh) so
ya together with someone
(uh)
is a girl that I I know since secondary school
so
(uh)
this overseas trip
(uh) it was a service learning trip [lah]
so
seven class
so
she's from (err) two zero two I'm also from two zero two
okay
(uh)
so we went to this overseas trip then
(uh) I tried to make friends [ah] then (uh)
one of them was her
(mm)
back then I was just like making friends with her
then
I think after the trip
then I was just like thinking about I was just like
she's a nice person and all that [lah]
and then (uh)
we were we were quite close after that trip
and then (uh)
during sec three
(uh) we
we were in the same class
okay then
from there started to talk more often and all that
it was just to me like a
ya ya
so
(uh)
late sec three
that that guy just wanted to play games
like as in like like like literally play game
ya so he's a gamer [ah]
ya so when he play game he also never tell her anything so she left on read
so ya but then [ah]
I think during N levels (uh) we studied together and all that
after N levels we somehow got together [lah]
for what
to ask
(uh)
obviously I ask [ah]
ya ya but
but ya she's
she's chinese
(uh)
she's christian
ya
and then
so
she's the opposite of me [ah] basically in terms of race and religion
because I'm malay (uh) I'm muslim
but she's chinese and christian but
so far I I look past that [ah]
but I still see a future [lah] is just
how things will work out

you know what that story is about so that story is about actually when I read it two years ago I wasn't a lit student so I didn't really quite understand what it was about but now
I'm trying to reread it again and try to know but back then my point of view for that book and main whole story plot
a few years ago or a couple months ago he suddenly refuse to talk he can talk but he refuse to talk and he say he cannot talk like he's in denial that he can talk so he just writes like anything he says wants to say or like anything he just writes it down
he didn't fell in love at first
and then like they help through each other [ah] but eventually the girl committed suicide by jumping off the bridge that's why the cover is the golden bridge
you look at the back you can see the girl at the back
at the back of the book
ya just flip it over you can see the girl
!oi! it's at the back it's at the back page of the book just find it that or is it in front [oh] okay I'm sorry I can't remember

(uh huh)
[oh] ya is it grazy grace [ah] okay ya ya
ya because it's cement no one
like who in the right mind like okay unless you are psycho or like a over thinker over over thinker
but I like grazy grace mainly because of her content like her criminal stories
become insane like a psycho
graduation
like you know [ah] I think if I'm not wrong there's like a universal language where it's like basically just signs and you like those signs that actually has specific pronunciation to it pronunciation or something like that miss #lee# told me about it before during lit class I think was like a few years ago
but I remember that because she ranted on how much she hated though she ended up being a teacher
really
what
!hais!
late night talk late night talk
plagiarism [lah]
(um)
if you ever do have a like your own house what type of interior do you want or like what type of vibes do want to get from your house
you know girl
why
no is it
what
ya why
exactly it's because of the branding
so you need to find ben~ if you want to live a minimalist life
then you need find different sources you cannot just go to like a specific shop
well that's the irony there then
(ugh) I don't want friend you anymore
like I want her I mean him to have his own house like
he's like I don't know he like to sleep like dozen places you know he like to hide under the sofa
you want to come with me
no girl that's just psycho I want like blackout windows
I want blackout curtains so when you close the curtains you cannot see any light at all
you bet I'm going to sleep the whole day girl
why you si~
how can you live without like fresh air
you have lost your mind
like last time before B_T_S was famous like this famous
like back in twenty seventeen they were not famous but they do exist
[oh] wasn't that when dope was released
ya I like I like baby #jungkook# now he's so !aww!
would you live in a maisonette or a condo
!oi!
why
why not
or condo
why you don't
one le~ why
why then we might as well live with your parents
like she's very sheltered in a sense can you get what I mean
I don't know what I ask her [ah] and after that she suddenly said like her mum [ah] did get all As for like her O levels
then I'm like [oh] then why why is she not working because I legit ask [ah] out of curiosity like I wasn't asking in like a way to downgrade her mum then after that she said [ah]
then I feel like I don't know for some reason I feel like she has a very #atas# lifestyle
I mean that also I travel almost every year
I mean the places that she travel is not like places of my interest so I don't really care about that
but she has like pass pass pass
and maybe because of that right because of how she have the percep~ that type of lifestyle [kan] it does affect her in the way she thinks
she thinks it's like everything is easy to get and like if this way doesn't work out for her right
then she will get like super sad about it
ya
ya
I mean
why
so you don't know #insha# and christina are both captains for the netball team right although I have already get out from the school and like shit they are still like one year younger than me right
in terms of responsibility right if I was still in the team [lah] I would have like shouted at her but then [oh] my god just thinking of it frustrated the shit out of me
on like they went out and then they went out then they were like okay already then I'm like okay cool then after that the next day on #insha# story there was like this tiktok it was like a repost of someone's tiktok then [ah]
like goals that things I want to do with my best friend and one of it was like get married then after that double stuff like that
and it just doesn't make sense to me because why would you have a boyfriend if your boyfriend can't even pay for you girl and like girl why would you go on a date without money girl you okay it's just three dollars
I mean if you do if your diploma is in like in terms of food and recreation or veterinary I think they
that's river safari
but pandas you I think you need like specialised
no the panda bear the polar bear we had died
#inuka#
did you just sigh #oppa# #gangnam# style
but I don't think you like animal
because they they won't talk back to me
but crocodile eat meat
ya (ugh) human beings
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]

they cannot even talk
dog kick
drop kick
[ah]
(um)
cause must clap
[oh] wait by parents or teacher
but they never hit you right they cannot [what] wait your parents didn't know !wow! she sleep she sleep
[oh] tell #sike# [ah] ya [lah] you are like already adult young adult okay [lah] not bad
I mean like some people start like even younger but then what since primary four then you keep [oh] try try [jer] [eh]
!wow! !wow!
I also want try
what does that mean I'm so sorry
[oh] [oh] [oh]
!wow! teach [eh] you got tutor got mentor already from the start
but now cannot [lah] twenty years old [oh] twenty
no [ah] you look like [ah]
[kan] [oh] my god you know like every single time I tried it's so difficult I like so like cause I used to be in a sports C_C_A right now I had to like stop because (err) I got injured
what the hell
no no no that is very unhealthy that is a unhealthy weight to lose weight no but anyways
then you will rebound back ya so now I think you are damn traumatised too [oh] my god that was so bad but then like you didn't know
like light snacks
no but like you also have to think like in a in a healthy way
it means maybe he is worried about your health then like for you to get both why you want motor though like I planning to take car like next year why motor
(mm) like your brother (mm) wait are you an only child !wow!
wait wait he do army malay army quite shocking [ah] cause you know they always #jio# us at S_C_D_F
they throw malays everywhere but the army
of course [lah] but
the thing is I also scared cause did you hear the cases like female in the army like the chances of them getting like harassed sexually harassed like a lot of things [lah] you know last time malaysia had like female army also then they abolish it because event the sergeant all that rape the girls
I mean like that's like the ones that speak out some of them get silent like don't tell but if you go then I wish you all the best hopefully
ya those are like misogynistic people I hate that but like I don't know cause I always thought like I can juggle myself but I hear my friends all that the thing is like when you are at the stage K maybe cause you are strong but
no I don't think we is worth comparing like that itself is itself a whole different issue ya like but then and racism is completely different but the situation is like of course [ah] but like black women have it worst
you mean over why you refer like that
but he his child is what he believes what you can handle yeah cute [ah] you you thought like your friend like that
that's
too formal ya I think he also understands the way we (err) the way we speak
how are you gonna disrespect [orh]
ya like I don't understand (err)
then like just leave us alone if you don't understand us you know you don't respect us also there's no need to like bash us just leave us alone
sometimes is the way they say is very hurtful ya (mm)
how they say like last time they small young they pray so many times do this do that I'm like why
say it out loud if you want to say you know there's a way to say it across without I mean you get it there's a vibe ya then sometimes if if like more than one person say is wrong and this is what we get from you then you still reject it it's obviously not us it's you ya
I think is is how you act on your jealousy
I don't know how it digress but if you get like license motor you want to get like what type of motor !wow!
that's first hand right I think my friend bought second hand [one]
!wow! like that's a lot of money [sia]
[oh]
I haven't even think about marriage [eh] I wish I was that far ahead
really (err) I just broke up ya I don't know like during circuit breaker you know then like things just ya also like not worth it [lah] cause like is (err) I don't know I'm trying to re-fix you all first
but like what do we know we only know what is our own thoughts only but other people learn from him ya
will you let me refer cause got manner
for how long how long is that !wow! six months one K !wow! that's good [oh] ya I mean we all products of capitalism
no cause no I have a business course then the teacher keep doing that you know for the economy to run they need the people and singapore main resource is the people so we are like on a train
no I'm like is it nine to five also your job then how shift is it !wow!
!wow! you got night shift also
then if you want to move to which clinic like near here
but is it like rewarding I know some people do job like there's the feeling to it you know the feeling
[oh] so is like !wow!
they kinda plan for the month so is like by two weeks
like can I ask how many sticks do you usually like
we try to be but we are not standard
#astaga# I never heard
they will hate all of us you go first you go first
I mean not only the religion but sounds like tiger wife like scam tiger parents also are they actually a bit controlling !wow!
forty three I hungry [lah] I cause actually I forgot what we actually talk about though really that's a lot I feel like the topic we talk about was like heavy ya
I'm not sure yet like ya I mean I just want to drive my parents around [lah]
yeah I think yeah that's the priority actually I plan to take it this year like my birthday passed but like #chun# #chun# right like the month I want to take it then circuit breaker happened
walk in and like ya a bit the timing ya cause like if I start in april this year what if I finish it next year june july cause like the estimates my friend got like one year mine is the shorter [one] ya that [one] like she go everyday or what [lah] clear
I have no idea but [oh]
wait you have an island there !wow! that's so cool
which part is that which

(mm) I've never been there also
[ah] don't attack me like that ya K but not saying our humour I think we've been bred like that do you see now like the media singapore media so lame
!wow! [oh] ya
but interesting [what] they get to think what we are thinking also I bet they are like listening or just like what the heck is going on wait do we have to transcribe this [oh] do we I don't want [sia]
I think so ya
no
sometimes malaysian humour confuses me (mm) (mm) on spotify have [ah]
cool (uh) I mean that's good also they are trying to
or you can start like refillable refillable lighter start a business !wow! look at us planning business ya I mean go for it
I think as long as you can hold a conversation is okay
how how no like cause like I've been to M_R_T K everybody been to M_R_T stations but like like most of them they are like chinese
like then they get so aggressive I'm not I'm not hating or anything but they are so ya and like ya and like you know on M_R_T also during sitting down they will like stare you down I've never seen a malay aunty stare you down for a seat
(um) I won't go as far as full responsibility maybe just a bit ya
okay I start
two marine engineering</P2>
how is it going
so for me and
how about you
okay
and I'm doing quite okay in it [lah]
(mm)
doing okay
[oh]
is like to win [lah] is like to
is like not to impress the audience but to do it for yourself [lah]
so actually our poly life quite stale
so really boring nowadays
so how's your secondary school life
introvert [ah]
studying
in secondary school especially in my
I can't be doing it because I almost retained
that's when N levels I did well
but
I doubt all the teachers wrong [ah]
so basically then I went to sec five
I got
[oh]
[oh]
[oh]
so when I was in sec three the the way teacher ask me to not be naughty is appointing me to be chairperson of the class
so is the only way
that I have to tone down all my nonsense in class
then after that I think
I used to be a sports leader then I was the I was below the head [lah] I was vice I was vice head for the sport leader last time
ya
ya
they love it too much [lah] they think you can they can
you can hold on to you [ah]
I think because you are one of the nicest guys in the environment you are in
burger king
(mm)
I basically after N levels
free shirt free meal free money so I just go
I work there and it was a good experience [lah] it was a good two months
I work there for about
I work there the whole month I only have three off days
that's how much I work because you have nobody to juggle the stuff give me outlet
don't have the same (uh) mentality as us
then ya I made a few friends malaysian friends
malaysian people you got malaysian
people or not that you work with
yup yes correct
and some more nowadays COVID they can't go back to malaysia so they have to rent the houses here
so it's a tough time [ah] for them and they are still working doubly hard triply hard in singapore
ya
after staff day nope
yes how how about you after burger king was McDonald's [what]
the group [mah]
(mm)
okay that was that was fast
like photographer [ah]
[oh]
okay that's that's like one hour ten dollars one hour eleven dollars
park
but do you agree or not that F&B pays the least
but you have the best fun
how to say [eh]
my opinion [ah]
and these courses you need to be independent nobody can spoon feed
you apply yourself
they would expect you to know how to do and all
very hard to reach the top back
ya
internship correct you go sailing you're going sailing
so you are second semester run
ya
I don't know how many weeks I think thirty six
okay fun story the reason why I put marine as my seventh or eighth choice was
because I was intrigued
because it's the top few [ah] from what I know [lah] from my past experience for my friends that tell me and all that
I never get into sailing that's when I got very very disappointed
but
so I just follow the flow
then ya [lah] I'm still okay with it ya so how about you
(mm)
to make it as your career
(mm)
correct agree
the highest type of engineer which is chief engineer then you just work shore [lah]
ya that's your plan I think that sounds like a good plan [ah]
but you're grinding your first few years
when when you just start working
good plan actually
you can cool down [lah]
ya
yup but honestly
so I've been watching a lot of youtube videos
and that's when I I fall in love with biomedical
that's how much I love bio last time
so N_S is not over yet for us
so
where do you plan to go where do you think you'll end up
you want green green
why
annoying
like what could you do when you're at the age of eight like what's the worst
all my books
stomp they will just stare at you
yup understand
(mm)
I want I want the police I want navy first okay
because navy is just fun [lah] I mean
I I watch a lot of [ah] boys to men [ah] so I find the navy part the best [ah]
I really hope
because right now I'm overweight so
got highly likely [lah] B_P
PES PES B pending so I hope to go to the normal PES after I finish my I_P_P_T I pass my I_P_P_T
then after that I hope I can go to S_O_C [ah]
special operations command
because I wanna be firefighter
ya so I don't mind police navy and
police navy and (uh)
[ah] firefighter civil defense
but I mind air force because I'm scared of heights
like I cannot take it I cannot I just cannot I take aeroplane once in my life [hor]
so ya air force is a no no
bungee jump is a no no
but I got feeling I need to go because I will be the first [leh]
will definitely be will definitely glow up [lah] after N_S
confirm puff
blow up
yes
correct
yes correct so
I mean the
I mean the
honestly I I don't I don't fancy
who wouldn't take it
I will take it
and it's like we have to take it we have no choice but to take it
ya so
ya I don't fancy it but I don't mind it so let's say you put me in engineering or communications I'm okay
ya even if I get what intelligence
I don't think got chance [ah]
intelligence
talk [eh]
four hours
quick maths [ah]
okay
it was okay
so now you're not in under any scholarship or
whatever no you're just
you just want to end the diploma [lah] there's normally
consider
pilot I heard they need to be of certain height and a certain in weight and a certain eye eyesight
okay
it's kinda cool though
(mm)
primary school
(mm)
is like our one of our longest [ah]
yes correct
is who you want to shape to be [ah]
who's your idol who's your idol don't remember confirm
wrestling
so I really look up to them [ah]
so I like their character [ah]
ya that was that was fun days [ah]
do you do parkour in school it's like normal [lah] primary school do parkour
ya was the was the peak [ah]
yes
(mm)
(mm)
okay
[oh]
so you have been leading all the way [lah] you have been leading the lines [lah]
discipline
(mm)
okay correct me if I'm wrong the right side is
feeder
the right side
the the centre is
#tekong# the left side is striker
[oh]
left-legged or right-legged
okay
so what what's your best position
have you ever heard of queenstown primary school though
they were national team player [ah] after they finish
secondary school
yup
but they are both from primary queenstown primary
ya
#junyuan# #tampines# located around #tampines# [kan]
#junyuan#
who did you lost to in the finals
okay
okay
yes
ninety ninety plus [lah]
pressure [lah]
so it's best three best to three basically
disappointed
you never go this far [lah]
!woo! amazing story
I don't really have much luck [lah]
in it because when I was in primary school I was in football
you will always be blamed
to our highest position that we ever got
in #gan eng seng# secondary school was seventh
and that was from my batch
so my batch got the highest ever which is seventh
seventh out of about sixteen schools
that makes us (err) (err) the
the the drop dead centre [lah]
then when I go so basically no luck [lah] I go delta league also I play under my school name
(uh) and that [one] second round also out delta league is a league whereby the police
under age smoking
so the police made this association made this league
for a prize
then when I goes poly
we got second last
and that was also disappointed disappointing for me [lah] it was normal for the rest
but it was the first time for me
but I see all my seniors they're laughing
like
go down [ah]
but
but because I'm the type of guy whereby
I need to see change
because if I love something
and I see the thing is going wrongly
or doing things the wrong way
but then I know there's somebody else better than me that can do that can change the C_C_A to be a better one
so when I entered in second year
(um) this my biggest accomplishment so far in all my in all my life as in school life is when they appointed me as captain
they they appointed me as captain and
and I look at how rich our history
twenty fifteen seventh twenty sixteen second twenty seventeen last twenty eighteen second last twenty nineteen second last
twenty twenty fourth which is this year
this year finally we got fourth
after twenty sixteen after four years
since second we got our best position which is fourth
and I'm very happy with my team
like that's the biggest accomplishment but I never ever felt the podium kind of
and leading the team is really like an accomplishment
because it just give a lot of motivation when
you and your friend you teaching your friend rather than coach teaching a friend
you know because sometimes
ya so I guess
both of us ya
wee sweet sweet
ya that that that's very demotivating is like
you
you will not succeed
you know
at least something know
how how would that be
how would that be happy for everyone when everyone is celebrating that we at least got fourth
it's very hard for a S_P to rump up fourth though
and read up on fourth just one below third
you know
yes
the change the journey [lah] how they get fourth how they get fourth don't celebrate the fourth because we are not there yet but celebrate how do we get there
because to see change you also have to change
we are everytime at the bottom we must think that some someday we can be as good as R_P
N_P T_P we must be up there
you know
but ya [lah] it's all good now
then now hopefully in the future we can
do more things and improve further [lah]
ya so talking about how sweet you are to me
how's
like do you have any love life how's your love life
(mm) love life
okay
[oh]
like candy [sia] nothing serious
[orh]
good one good one right right
went out more often then
then who who had the courage
to go first
to ask
[oh] you ask
and she's a nice woman
how do you cope with it okay
I think it's now close to an hour I purposely ask you that question so that we can end it on a high
more even though I know you already
but ya we we we open up more
[eh] #hazim# so what have you been doing in school today
[orh]
[oh] I see I see
then then like how's the progress for that [one] going
[oh] I see I see
!huh! serious [ah] what the is like
[oh] for three questions
[orh] ya [sia]
so that part we have to like
just write a
write (uh) regarding
what's this
(err) exercise benefits on
(err) for people who have (err) chronic diseases demo
(uh) no (uh) that's the infographic [ah] but then for the assignment part is
we just have to write about
like (err)
what issues they face
(um) when adhering to this (err)
this (err) (err) exercise programme ya
so it's like from D_C_D (err) is like a D_C_D assignment [lah]
ya
so ya [lor] that's been like
(err) what's been taking up the most the most of my time for the past two weeks
no [ah] I no time [lah]
like really like really just been about school [mah] the past the past like
don't know how many weeks
(err) considered moonlighting [lah] so they they don't want me to
work [lah] ya
just focus on school [ah]
then you [eh] you still at
[orh]
[oh] ya ya
then what he angry [ah]
[a'ah]
[oh]
[oh] ya ya
[oh] that's week three [ah]
[orh]
[oh] ya we have
the M_H M_H drive
clinical decision making
so that's like an assessment but that [one] quite fast like I also don't get why is it so fast [ah] they have so many groups to assess
[oh] but that [one] damn #shag# [ah] that [one] that [one] cause the previous assessment
me and darren never really do that well
so this [one] really have to buck up [lah]

explained her stuff compared to like all the other profs who like just give
and like you don't even know what they expect then this [one] she will specifically state like [oh] this thing that thing

#takraw# [lah] then like nobody care [leh]
I read like many it's it's like they don't give a shit [lah]
but then now now I feel like
singapore also quite stable [lah] so
you think will move into phase three or not
they say most likely before end of the year
so like
!huh! eighty per cent
of of what
[oh] then they will go into phase three
[oh] that's the incentive [ah]
#sian#
I mean just for that bit of freedom [lah] but then still need wear mask [ah]
ya they say is like
it's like won't be as what you experience
before like it won't be back to pre-COVID life [lah] definitely
but I just hope like there comes a point in time whereby don't need wear mask
damn hard to breathe [sia] sometimes
especially on hot days
(hmm)
but then
what to do is like that [lor]
[oh] you want to go K_T_V
[ah] ya [lah] then I think need wear mask also right
I think so definitely [lah] that is also true
[oh] but then got a lot of the
actually I also kinda miss K_T_V [ah]
but they selling all the they selling all the equipment online
like ya
but that is quite expensive [sia]
but then again is all used [lah] so I think the price is even cheaper but then other people use already [sia] you want to use [meh]
ya [sia] that's why
but I also
!huh!
but I also want to go back J_B [sia]
!wah! that will be that will be the dream [sia]
!huh!

january [ah] january eight ya
next try will be next try will be when [ah] early of [eh]
eleventh of jan I think
[ah] [oh] damn
okay [lah] hopefully [lah] cause
the the one that they actually ask me to go now right is like
W_H_D ya but I don't know why they ask me okay (err) thursday you come for W_H_D then friday come for the shoot then like
why not just one shot
because I remember right like
is very fast also
it's not like takes a long time
[oh]
maybe [ah]
[orh]
I mean that would make sense [lah] is e~ earlier
[ah]
been awhile since I go there also [sia]
[eh] no [lah] last time I went was for I_P_P_T
!wah! that [one] #shaggy#
ya
ya
no now is cause of COVID right so now they make the
they make it (err) you so (um) one week
push-up all that right the person is
(err) standing away
from you
like maybe
ya then they count [lor]
but then (err) cause of this right there's no contact thing right then
(err)
there's no gauge for you when to
(uh) push-up until
so they say just make sure your
elbow ninety
and something else I forget already
ya then so is easier [lah] but then
ya [sia] true
you got try at #maju# [ah]
[ah] #maju# the
#maju# is very the the machine
the the what [ah] the
the track is actually shorter
like I don't know why but that day that day I like
screw up the the run [eh] the
the
(uh) statics because is all automatic
(err) when I use then I !wah!
why so hard then it always never detect
then like I needed like a ten ten to
ten ten to get silver minimum
then like !wah! I never run this fast before [sia]
even like our our trainee time right I think I run like ten ten thirty
ten thirty was my best
and that was like the most fit we ever been [sia]
then suddenly I run run run right like I didn't really care like tired or what then I run then suddenly ten O three then I like !wow!
ya I think adrian the one that told me the track is like very short
so like you won't you won't feel
it doesn't look like it [lah] but actually is
shorter I
think cause one thing is indoor
ya
so ya if you wanna like
if your statistics like not bad and then it's just your running right
then
you can consider #maju# [lah]
cause anyway very near like
you take one bus
[ah]
[ah] ya ya same same like #maju# [lah]
I mean
okay [lor]

I always thinking I always thought it was command like not commanders like
S_O_C
but then that's #nas# #karim#
#aqil# #umar# ya
ya I think the four of them only but the four of them also I think were instructors
[oh]
(oo)
instructor [ah]
I always thought like what what would you be like if like
my N_S experience was front line
cause I mean
I'm behind behind the scene a bit boring [lah] as in
okay [lah] lesser stress but then
no action also #sian#
like at least you all get to experience stuff like you got to experience stuff
you
no [lah] #siao# why talk about I_U
there was one [lah] but it's damn lame it's not like it's not like your kind of standard like go go deployed for anything is like
is this is the police day parade is it
(uh) I think then it was at
marina stadium there [ah] then what they did was what I had to do was (err)
I just accompany them on the boat
and then just
do towards [lor]
wait I don't know what's this I forget already but then
I think home team show then they then all the people they just come onto
the boat
then they the my all the regulars
show them around make them
ya that was okay [lah] but then
I was deployed as a medic but then there was
nothing to do
okay [lah]
fudge
plaster
that was like legit like ninety percent of the time [sia] plaster
ya
[eh] then later what movie you all watching
[orh] that's the free ticket one you all got [ah]
[eh] I thought you had one extra ticket
or is that xavier
so you you xavier maria
who's joel
[oh] volleyball joel [ah]
[oh] at #dhoby#
[oh] ya that's true [ah] okay
what's what's the then what's this like demons layer thing about [sia]
is it like is it like A_O_D like attack on titan
ya ya ya
right
is like at the start right all the it really caught me cause
is like
super dynamic the way they
put the like animation style then I was like !wow! this is quite
but then now the story like I don't know what's going on already
but then they say the final season coming out soon
ya ya
why
how is this
but I haven't like
but like read any #manga# before [sia]
got recommends
[oh] the D_C comics but why you read [sia]
no as in as in what what what what what was it
now this
year still got what movie that's
marvel when you went there ya
I watch the new mutants not not that good [sia]
but that's D_C
black panther [eh]
[ah] ya black widow I think
end of the year [ah]
the
the whole marvel scene
who fuck [sia]
wait why did this even happen like
how did this even happen
[orh]
no
[orh]
but now what he doing [sia]
is it
[oh] ya
after
I see serious
[orh]
I mean maybe it's just like the institutions [lah]
that's what he don't have
ya [sia] that [one] !wah! that [one] #shiok# [eh]
but
coney island [ah]
is literally coney island group
okay [lah] then we got one more year you want you want
[eh] no no no touch wood touch wood
go up
three to four hours right
!huh! no [ah]
I mean
you don't need to stand just
sit down and pedal
[oh] ya ya ya that's true I think one of my friends like
he he does this like
me and #hasif# got the gazelles team
the #hasif#
ya then we got the gazelles team then one of them now is like a fitness trainer then I think he does spin
class quite cool [eh] and
but sad [lah] like the club like
gone already like we stopped
stopped playing
but then I asked #imran# [lah] like if after
like all these phase whether like once
eleven eleven a side then maybe my team can
play against his team think would be quite fun [lah]
I miss playing football [sia]
why [sia]
[orh]
is the clutch game [ah]
well cause like approaching the end right I think
it was hard to find numbers [lah] then
then I think #hasif# just ask him
to fill in the numbers but then ya [lah] quite inconsiderate also seeing that like he come all the way down just for
five minutes but
maybe first second or third season second season we got like some good players but then
and it's just play amongst themselves and me [lah] so is like
unfair to others [lah] so I think they decided to leave
but that one #safi# #jio#
so then they stayed for long they were good [lah] but then ya just selfish [lor]
is that the start of this year ya ya the start of this year april march there
ya but I wanted to play [sia]
I sign up for captain ball
then I got the sport
because like I really wanted to play captain ball then (uh) I wanted to play the first year but then
it's either captain ball or
but then captain ball
I think there was too a lot of people then
not enough for football so I had to drop one then since
football not enough then I just join football
ya I was the keeper
clean sheet twice
first game concede second game clean sheet third game clean sheet
fourth game clean sheet
then final game
(err) think final game I think concede one
but the goal was damn stupid like
like the guy kick not even hard
but then it bounce bounce bounce right then I dived then it bounced over my hand
then go in then !wah! I tilted
I have no clue I think I think the way he hit the
ball not a clean strike
but then it was like
so it hit the ground then it bounce then it bounce then
I misjudged [lor]
but by then they all would have played at N_U_S right
!wah! #shiok# [sia] !wah! #shiok#
that's why I was like hope really hoping like
hopefully the COVID won't get in the way
then at least
we get to play one more time [lah] before before like
before
year two okay [lah] year two was fun [lah]
you have to travel with caleb they all
actually I was quite lucky [lah] they get to travel that [one]
ya not bad [ah]
ya ya
#bo# #pian# [lah] so it's just like
you just go there then you learn about their healthcare system
get to know like they are how their
how the hospital works actually they all I was surprised [sia] like their
they quite
not say backwards [lah] but not as up to date as like singapore's kind of
like technology like their technologies still
quite old [lah]
ya maybe ya cause that [one] was up a mountain [leh]
but it was quite cool [lah] then
try #soba# then the
(err) we learn about
their stroke management actually their stroke patients like I think it's a japanese thing to be like super positive even though you are like phase three
those kind of adversity
ya so it was quite an eye opening experience
then like this year this year never go #dublin# right
so actually going that japan thing was quite good [lah] so at least some of the mods cleared
you all also supposed to have trips right
taiwan [ah]
korea
korea
but is just one week though
ya ya ya [ah]
cause like
I see the price right then like
for one week is it really worth it like I feel you can go
can go on a holiday for one week
at that same place with like lesser expenditure [oh] ya that is true
ya [sia] ya [sia]
how you got learn [ah]
what you learn
no no as in as in what you what recipe you ya
macarons
isn't that like super sweet or something
the capsule [ah]
[orh]
!wah! sounds tough [sia]
I do (err) during the circuit breaker at what they are
I mainly bake cake also #pandan# cake
(err) what other cake
(err) was it
butter
honey pound [ah] ya but then like
and all my like asked me like [eh] why you suddenly like start baking then like I got bored [ah]
but all the baking was just like just to relieve stress [lor] cause I think that period was also like exam period
ya then
ya [lor] that was like circuit breaker in a in a nutshell [lah]
it was just like at home doing nothing
actually it was quite therapeutic [lah] having that like time to myself also
[oh] ya that's true [lah] that's why a lot of people like
they did all the exercise stuff and all that then put on
story ya ya that was like the hype [leh]
you me no you did
[oh] ya ya chloe kept on trying [lah] I think #dekai# also kept on trying
[oh] ya [lah]
neighbours
actually mac and cheese I don't know why [sia]
because there was that time when (err)
my parents were overseas in new zealand right then like I had to
I had to cook myself [lah] for that one whole week
then I go cook mac and cheese thinking like it's gonna be damn easy then I
I don't know how I screw it up [sia] then I eat right I can still the taste the flour [eh]
ya maybe [ah] probably probably
!wah! but that one whole week was quite
#shiok# [ah] having the whole house to myself
which was the best
what was the best recipe like
whether is solid
actually is like the recipe and the ingredients like all so simple but then when you actually get down to it right !wah! is actually
ya
but the
[ah] ya you use what
(mmhmm)
mean
I think I use parmesan parmesan cheese
I think it was not bad
but I also use it to make this pasta recently
I think I made with #fifi#
then like he teach me how to like
make make what's this thing called
make (err) the mushroom more meaty [ah]
so like he when he cook the mushroom like he grill not grill [ah]
he pan fry the mushroom but he put like he put like (err)
butter on the pan first
then after that he put the mushroom
then he let it sizzle for awhile then he put salt
because the salt will like take out the
(err) take the moisture out
draw the moisture out cause when it's frozen right a lot of it is trapped inside [mah]
then after that he will
he will take
[oh] what he do after that [ah] [oh] ya then he will take
(err) like this
press it then
(err) so you will take out all the moisture !wah! then we make
we use that to make like cream pasta !wah! damn nice [sia]
actually next time right if like after all this
like if can go each other house then
you all can come then we can try to make it together
ya
I feel like cooking also

yes yes #ubi#
[oh] you
course
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
is it pronounced triumph T R I U M P H I think so [lah] I'm not too sure myself
waiting time either too long [lah] or the
(err) the
[oh] ya true true fair enough you wanted to ask me one question right just now
[oh] like what was the best surprise [lah] I've ever received yes [ah] okay okay
so they told me one of my teammate told me to
told me that they will be bringing me out for a birthday dinner
the driver and two of my other teammates came out
and then when they came and approach me they said that
of guys around my table they also turn and look like why am I sitting alone in a table in a big round table for about ten people but I was the only one sitting there then my friends will like
so (uh) of course I was even more happy [lah] that you got like the birthday present I wanted but having said that
ya no okay ya I was very happy when I got the present
anything
I prefer those kind of like intimate stuff where I can spend times with my friends and family that I'm really really
tha~ that's why that's the thing
think about anything but then again
we barely see any sheeps you barely see any
to find your places that you want to go [lah]
a lot of steam food a lot of soup a lot of herbs
so of course I wish I had that kind of a complexion but it's okay no problem
that feeling of like you are sitting
staycation at resorts world #sentosa#
do the spending and we are the ones who will have to
(err) help to revive our very own
economy so I hope that so I hope that I hope that (uh) we will we will be able to come out of this (uh) COVID nineteen strong and hopefully we will
go back to being normal arab we will all still stay happy and positive
okay so we have come to the end of this one hour conversation
thank you very much bye
[eh] #amshar# I'm doing good [lah] how how about you
you mean great and just
what's up [ah] with you and your like the whole COVID situation how has it affected you
ya like your daily life [ah]
ya I mean to be honest so far my
life has been as per normal because now we all have
preo~ preoccupied with things that we need to do [lah] like like s~ for example
weekend is the only time I got time [lah] to go out and meet my friends then when we are outside also
got a lot of (err) measures that have been imposed [ah] that we need to
you [eh] wha~ what you notice anything different now
as compared to last time when there was no such measures
one hundred is it
hundred people [ah] now so but is that part of phase three or is it just phase two regulations
phase two
[oh] so at the end of the day still got the safe distancing measures [lah]
then I got wedding I need to go to [lah] next week then is
(err) from what I know they got three shifts starting from morning all the way to the afternoon
then they separate by like family and friends
people per like per time [ah]
so that they still adhere to all the the safe distancing measures and now also
then there's no like what intermingling [lah] between each of the people that are going to be there so the functional groups do not counts [lah]
ya I mean at end of the day this kind of things how to say this [ah] is like
it definitely affects how we carry things out like socially [lah] it goes against like social like norms
cause you go to a wedding to interact with other people and all that and but then I think given the
kind of situation
like I mean get to see each other also
I mean should be grateful [lah]
ya
[oh] no serious serious like my uncle's
(err) wait my uncle's sister wait that's my aunt ya my aunt is getting married
ya
okay [ah]
[eh] then that time your I remember you posted something about (err)
ya that one I'm not
ya
okay okay
okay
okay from what I saw there's like (err) a bit of a
contention here right because (uh)
some people say that (err)
J_C or poly or something ya ya
something like that [lah] from that's what I understand [lah] but I haven't really read into it yet [lah] so
okay
[oh]
but I mean this kind of things if it's going to affect primary school then of course I think
(err) will also affect judging from (err) taking O levels and going to what tertiary education as well [lah]
ya
speak
[ah]
I think for me I think it's the same for both of us [lah] especially
I still need to focus on getting things done and obviously focus on going home or booking out right
ya I mean obviously I think it's quite boring now
but then I guess in the future there'd be
certai~ maybe we'll need to use what we learn in army for our own good [lah] ya
so I think
okay I just ask you honestly [ah] do you any see do you see any purpose in doing N_S now or not [ah]
ya
understand understand
ya
ya
you learn life selec~ the life lessons that you learn are social [lah]
work with people
who are from like different different backgrounds like they all come from different areas [lah]
can or not
ya
like your own circle [lah] ya I a~ I agree with you about that [lah] I think
also for me I'm having the same experience army
people outside my own social circle and
(err) I got to make new friends [ah] which is quite good also
and at end of the day I feel
that
(err) these two years (err)
how to say this not only I guess to a certain extent serve the country but also
ya [lah] I mean we all have our different opinions about N_S [lah] but so far ya the year is going to pass soon
ya these two years will not be wasted and I'll still get to
enjoy it [lah] while it lasts ya
(mmhmm)
go to N_S or choose to go N_S or not to go N_S
I'd say I think I would choose to not go N_S [lah] because I feel
like (err)
I can (err)
well when I'm outside [lah] as in cause you think about it now I'm at my prime
[eh] I'm at I'm at my prime of my youth
I still go I can go out I can go help out treat my parents all that like they all am I as I think
most importantly is like my grandparents [lah] now is like the best time for me to after J_C right
(um) you know I take a short break I go help out my grandparents for a while and all that before I start school and all that I think that will be what I want to do and learn
you know travel around the world all that but okay obviously now maybe it's the best time
to be in N_S cause I can't really
do anything else [lah] ya because of the whole COVID thing I can't really travel also ya but
I think okay [ah] now looking back (err)
it's not such a bad deal [lah]
(mm)
really [meh] you think it will really
help us [meh] like cake
[oh] okay fair enough
yes
(mm)
okay okay I mean
ya I guess I (uh) I mean this is no brain right so
ya let's jump right of the next bed let's go (err) #amshar# what do you like to do over the weekend when you're not in N_S
actually no let's change it now like
let's just say (uh) you're going out with your family
I think those kind of places really got the vibes [ah] ya
you really just feel like (uh) you're shut out from the world already then when you go outside that's when you can really spend time with your loved ones [lah]
ya and especially when you eat ho~ home cooked food
ya that's
ya that that's definitely a different experience [lah] then when you are inside camp when the meals are all provided for you
ya but for me personally I think
(err) free [kan] everyone got (uh) no plans so we all just go (err) at least have a meal [lah] together
and most of the time (err) my mum will cook and then (err)
we just make it a point to just sit down together at a table and eat [ah]
you worst comes to worst is (err)
how you call that we just order in food [lah] if everyone too tired
ya but
sometimes when there's a bit more free time or I'm blocked leave and now especially school holidays [kan]
so
even though (err) we then we will go out like
ya so
we actually we stay in the car then we just drive around singapore [lah] you know that kind of thing
ya it's just it's just about spending time with your loved ones [lah]
ya
I think for me I like to
so betweeen fam~ spending time with my family and friends because both of them are
are as equal importance to me [lah]
ya because friends are what (uh)
has made me like (uh) what I am today for the
how could I say [ah] for like the latter part of my life so far but family
ya most of the chapter of my life I'm thinking about my friends [lah]
but my family is the one that raised me and had been with me throughout my entire life
so I definitely owe it to them ya and I genuinely (err)
(uh) enjoy spending time with them [lah] ya
so it it's definitely I think a struggle cause
so the
so it's all about (err) that
what you call that
balance [lah] between (err) spending time with
(err) your family and your friends
I think definitely another thing we should talk about is the challenges
with the allowance that we get
your N_S money how do you spend your money on N_S #amshar#
ya
me ya actually
I'm quite open if we my parents so lately
ya I just share with them then they just share me you know how father [lah] right they talk about
cannot what it's all they will just exaggerate the stories until it becomes so extreme
and I know they consider us the strawberry generation [lah] having it easier than them right so
it's nice to have a conversation topic you know with you parents a very natural conversation topic
ya then I guess to a certain extent it brings them together [lah] like they say it's (err) every singaporean son's journey right so
it's something that (uh) helps
maybe it helps me feel closer to my parents if not my dad [lah] ya and my brother also
ya
I think for me I had
haven't haven't yet because it was still in january [mah]
so ya we all went
ya we only start just about I think a month apart so we're kind of in the same batch just the batch after yours [lah]
cause we're already went in batches then I remember that first day
my whole family follow me I think was me my
what
ya cause (err) I don't know people had extra then they just give me [ah]
so the five of us just went in together then
so obviously it was a western wednesday that they even there was a
what it was a tuesday I think ya or monday [lah] ya
and one of the worst workout days
[ah] first thing I went back to bunk [ah] I just
like !wah! what am I doing
far away from my family in in awhile [lah] doing something that
I didn't (uh) explicitly choose to do [lah]
let's just put it like that
ya
ya but then I think compared to
my batch my batch didn't exactly get the
full experience cause (uh) we didn't get to P_O_P at
marina bay you know that whole (err) walk
across east coast and all that walking together then
going through all the tiredness all the fatigue together
carrying everything back I mean we
didn't manage to do that [lah] but because my batch was more like
we just ended up at the parade square then we just P_O_P there
then we call it a day then we went home
although we lost that bit of it I think
since my batch was longer I got really close to my
B_M_T friends [lah] and some of them they had followed me all the way to my new unit also which is
quite good [lah] then we'd be even closer ya
[ah] the most recent batch they did twenty four
(err) [oh] #changi# food food center right east coast east coast food center ya
but
I mean it's all about that (um)
encouragement and that feeling of like you know you are finally finishing
of like that B_M_T journey right so
I think is I mean they give it to you all [lah] [ah] you finished
ya that nine weeks of B_M_T then you just
I mean you feel good about yourself [lah]
like before you go into your unit or your next phase of training [ah]
ya
yes
I mean it's not for everyone [lah] bro
[oh] ya ya that's true
(mm)
okay
okay
(mm)
okay I think this kind of thing is like at first I was also wondering why then that's when I really started to
I spend my money on [lah] so you know the money that I get I just
it's already like this much
then it's like I feel like ya it's easier [what] I mean taking M_R_T is cheaper
but time is definitely of the essence in this case cause I always want to
what book out early book in late [ah] ya so
what
[oh] the the amount of money I spend on
transport (err) food
and then after that (err) miscellaneous stuff they are like things that you just have to spend money on let's just say
(err)
going to like gift shop or the emart
to buy army supplies so these kind of things
it gets (err) what you call that you don't really think about it [lah]
at first glance then there comes the
other things that you don't need but you want [lah]
so that's when you really need to be more
(mm)
(mm)
honestly correct correct (um) [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
slightly more [lah] ya you don't save
ya
but I think it's the this time is the perfect like opportunity for you to
you're really getting (um)
that taste of financial freedom
especially on your on your own right so you really can decide what you want to do with your money
ya sometimes [ah] I understand
like what you said [lah] like when I first got it also I was like !wah! I'm actually finally getting money then I end up
all the useless useless things that I don't really need
but then I want to buy cause I
finally have the
capability to buy them you know
ya then that's when I
(err) I started like really writing down everything cause I was wondering
where all my money went
ya then then then you realize (err) actually
there's a lot more that you can do with your money and one thing that
people are doing now is that they're really making their money work for them [lah]
come on especially N_S right so with all the investing and all that
ya which
which I'm not so sure how it works I'm going to be honest but
ya I think everyone is just putting their money in it then they're waiting for the results now [lah]
because it will determine whether they earn money or lose money [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya I think I mean
I understand [lah] maybe this generation is
the the mindset is a lot more different I guess certain extend it's like it's more towards like
(err) a lot a lot more people from our generation are thinking ahead
as as compared to (err) trying spending their money [lah] feeling that
I mean trying to (err) not to say like enjoy now [lah]
but (err) saving the money for retirement per se
that kind of thing or for their further studies and all that
I feel that
more of us are more aware of what our
our future is like
you know and what how much we need
for our for us to like live a better life in the future [lah] ya so that we can always (err)
like help our family out [lah] or
at at the least like help ourselves out and not be a burden to others [lah]
ya so more of us are becoming more financially aware
and more
and hopefully financially stable [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
four [lah] four
ya okay
(mm) ya
ya [lah] [ah] ya I understand where you come from [lah]
[ah] ya
(mm)
I think for for our generation it is like
[ah] no as in from what I've seen they're still
I think some people are from especially my seniors [lah]
since they're all what you call that [ah]
cause you know that that (err) we have that break routine (um)
when once you O_R_D then the start school then they go overseas all that spend all their money right
then when you start uni then you really feel the crunch but you
don't have enough money [lah] for yourself
ya then
because of that you don't really get to
(err) fully enjoy your your life I guess
because you think about it let's just say you
spend all your money in one shot you don't get to spend it like
(err) throughout
I mean throughout your university before you actually like
get like a stable job [lah]
ya and I guess the purpose of N_S N_S
really like gives you that a bit of a headstart for you to have (err) financial independence [ah]
and (um) do what you want with it [lah]
(mmhmm)
(uh huh) yes
ya
ya
what was my plan right for investing I think for me it's not so much about (um) investing but
(uh) what (uh) I want to do is that
I guess it for the next year I will try to get a scholarship [lah] that's something I would like to work towards to [lah]
spending I'd definitely want to do it myself
and for the uni fees all that I really
how to say [ah] they like what you've said they've been supporting you whole life like maybe it's time you really take things into your own hands [ah]
ya and really just (err) be more
independent ya
but then if that doesn't work out !whoa!
maybe I might even consider signing on [lah]
cause okay if you think about it it's a
it's (uh) realistic it's realistic it's worth especially (um)
(err) you don't spend money as much
definitely because food okay realistically food is provided for by the cook house
okay I won't say it's amazing
ya it's acceptable [lah] ya and it's like
basically food outside is nicer but I mean I can't complain [what]
right so ya and then you the more time you spend inside
you don't spend so much money outside and then because of that you can save more
and because you can save more you can do more money with your money outside
right then
I guess by extending our contract you already give yourself a headstart of going into like
a tertiary education [ah] or in my case I guess uni [lah] so
by doing that really
(um) provides me with an excess of cash that
allows me to
okay so where were we [ah]
I think was about being like (um) financially independent and
being able to spend your money the way you want to but at least
ya I think that's what more things are
are things people my age are noticing becoming more
(err) responsible in that particular aspect of their live [lah]
which I think is definitely a good step ahead
if you think about it [lah] because everyone is (um)
how to say it's not about
(mm) not wanting to accept help from your parents but it's about wanting to really
being able to (err)
take your [ah] carry your own weight ya and really (err) feel the sense of (um)
what you call that of that reality you know that your parents have might should have led you from [lah] over these past few years [lah]
ya definitely [lah]
can we talk about food now #amshar# please
okay
ya I don't know how we ended up talking about N_S and all
ya [eh] so #amshar# [ah] what's your favourite food
!huh!
ya
I think what's your favourite food
ya
the what
[oh] [oh] scone scone
ya
of course halal most important bro
ya
I think for me it's not about
having a favourite food but because eat I don't know I feel like eating for me is always a reason for me to socialize
no [ah] like it's something that helps me
people around me that I know
and I talk to so
eating is more of a social thing to me rather than
being (um)
ya for the taste of it [lah] and
that's why when I eat I don't necessarily
have any (err) preference of what I want to eat I just only generally ask what people like to eat then I just go eat there
ya so
for me if you ask me what's my favourite food I like comfort food [lah]
comfort food
#hajjah maimunah# bro #hajjah maimunah# expensive bro
okay
is booming is booming
no that's not even
then I remember bought (um)
eight dollars for one head
!wah! that was like ridiculous man
so
okay the business is booming
definitely because there are people that love that kind of food
and obviously I like it [lah] ya but you cannot eat it too much and too often
ya
bro it doesn't help that the food is like delicious
ya
[a'ah]
okay [lah] okay so we're talking wait [ah] so I was as I was saying right so let's just say
but if you ask me about my favorite food right I know I feel like
a strong inclination towards #ban mian#
#ban mian#
soup is like really something that !wah! I feel like [ah] #tom yum# also to~ but #tom yum# is definitely maggi for me bro
ya like if I eat #tom yum# right the maggi one it just hits different [lah] I think
would definitely be instant noodles
then it's also quite easy to make [lah] then like that I also don't have to what
(err) wake up the whole family to cook right
so I just cook on my own and then just and then it's a sharing thing also
so you don't always don't just cook maggi one person
let's cook maggi for more
cause your ya
like then
it goes back to a social thing
ya I mean it's like food is not just about
(err) for sustenance per se but it's all about (um)
looking out for others also
no then I guess tha~ tha~ that's what can really bring people together also [lah]
ya
okay [lah]
just feel that just taste of food in your mouth [ah]
[oh] swimming lessons ya ya ya I remember that time
[oh] ya we'll stand outside the the convenience shop and then we just
!wah! I think now is like really the best [lah]
!wah! is that !wah! then the keep brings back memories so like
like what you said [lah] I think it's a it's a
is in
ya
back then we ate a lot less ya
[oh] bulking season bro
ya
ya
[oh] ya
I think [eh] two I remember when
ya when when I was studying for A levels right I don't my I don't know cause when I was in J one
my weight was sixty five kilo
ya it's like I went up by fif~ about fifteen K_G or so in like a year
because I was just stressed out from studying A levels [lah] and food was something that gave me comfort [lah]
ya cause okay cause you think about it right you can't
so right
so cause the moment I'm eating means I'm not studying
correct so I'll I'll just eat like I'll eat a lot so like
fe~ feeling [lah] [ah] ya [lah] so
that that that the break time right was really very precious [lah]
so obviously you try to extend it as much as possible because of that I ate so much
then I just well just studying eating studying eating studying eating then what it said it was eating
not say purely for sustenance [ah] but so you don't feel so bored
cause the moment you're studying (err) the moment you're eating you are taking a break from all your books all that
then you get you that is quite boring [lah]
ya so I feel like
that time was a
it was a good time that I just ate the same type of food everyday
that's ridiculously unhealthy
ya but I didn't mind it
(mmhmm)
then after that go back to study again
ya it's it's like the same cycle everyday
(mm)
(mm)
ya but I I I think I
for me personally I cannot forget the school canteen food yet
the what I remember cause cause coming from our school was like
(um) what you call that there's very lit~ remember there's only what two halal stalls is it
there was only two halal stalls so the options for the muslim students were not really that much also [lah]
ya so it's like
[ah] they had they had the only squee~ they for the #roti# #prata# which is like not even allowed
[oh] so fucker level and the food was so good
ya
ya then we'll buy that was a definitely a secret menu item
then when people started looking [eh] bro what's this [ah] what's this then after that
then we all start everyone started ordering and then there was this (err)
it was like !wah! really if I go eat there again that would definitely bring back memories [ah]
ya
and
that's that's that's that's the thing [lah] because
food was
what like bond us together cause the only time we met each other right definitely was at the canteen
ya and there's only reason one reason you're at the canteen it's either you're skipping lectures or you're eating something
and most of more often than not we'll be eating something
ya I mean if you're awake [lah]
that's a
prerequisite
(uh)
[eh] but speaking of food right do you cook
ya [lah]
[ah] yes
it's such a millennial thing to do to use an air fryer
you know it's really not that much healthier in my opinion it's like (uh) you're still cooking it in fat
but it's just it's own fat
ya okay so I guess if you ask me I mean
ya !wah! that was a absolute (err) logistic nightmare
this one can make forty then come out !wah! twenty five pieces only then I was like what you want me to do
obviously I it's my first time again
ya then
obviously that's terrible right so I had to make like two to three batches if I'm not wrong
(um) wet
then I have to [oh] (err) ask my mum [eh] what to do what to do then my mum also not really a baker
fair so like okay so we figured out okay !alamak! just add more flour [lah] that kind of thing so it's like it makes it more
(err) usable [lah] ya then experiment that's when
you really figure out like [eh] actually it's a lot more feeling than to actually
(err) know the exact quantities of what you need to use cause you given the humidity and all that it all the that kind of thing plays a part
temperature of your surroundings
ya you don't think about that and your recipe doesn't tell you about that also
ya
I mean ya [lah] ya [lah]
but as a new cook all these all these kind of things are definitely out of your control [what]
some came out nice some came out cracked then you like [eh] why
so I end up eating the cracked ones the nice ones I give away [lah]
ya so I don't know that's just quite fun [lah] I remember I'll go to everyone's house
then (err) slowly drop off one by one
and you know (uh)
ya I dodged his mum so I s~ I stay in the
that trip was just for you bro
that's quite nice also [lah] ya
I mean because that time I remember it was
cause it was the COVID thing
no no (uh)
ya
and you had your interview
ya [lah]
ya you got your interview that's why I asked you to meet me at the M_R_T then you're like
(err) (err) ya
is not bad not bad
[ha] !wah! the things I do !huh! for my friends
(uh)
no [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
I generally just wanted to try baking it and see what you all thought of it [lah]
because obviously I cook what twenty five pieces of
so I might as well just give it away [lah] then the other thing you were saying about
you naturally you're helping people out on the street all that
that one is still that's still (err) like a blur for me because
the thing is (um) how to say this [ah] that time I help someone then he said that
actually she doesn't need my help
cause she has done this many times it's just that she's a bit slower
so at the end of the day right I also feel
but then (err) she knows the she can do it on her own so she doesn't
want to seem like she needs help [lah]
and obviously I want to respect her decision but at the same
same time [ah] you can't help but
notice that [eh] you're kind of holding up the queue [lah] so
I should probably make you go a bit faster [lah]
but then I (um) feel like I don't want feel like I'm undermining her effort
you know of trying to being independent
how [ah]
ya
yes [eh] definitely
(mmhmm)
ya
ya because ya I understand
ya
ya
because there she cannot reach understand understand ya
ya
I
(mm)
understand understand
ya
but at the end of the day they they know that they they need your help [lah]
ya there are certain things that they definitely cannot do and it's rather to
and they rather choose to avoid it [lah] but at the same time that's when you guys come in [lah] when you guys help out
I think like from personal experience (um)
you know that (um)
you have to be sensitive [lah] be more aware of this kind of things so this kind of issues you
you cannot say them out loud
definitely because it can hurt people's feelings
but it's something that you have to consider when you're about to help someone [lah] especially elderly person
ya [oh] my god how did it run out of topic
again by so far
okay then let's just
bring it back the thing it was about you talk about
eat [eh] helping your friends [oh] talk about friends right then you
[ah] then you talk about helping others on the street
ya
okay
[oh] my goodness wait where were we
ya let's just go back to food I feel like that's a good consensus okay
you know right I think in my opinion
a lot of people have this misconception that
I think
ya
ya
okay definitely ya
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
okay
no I'm not I'm not talking about that I'm talking about more is like (err) more to being (uh) okay being like
the
ya in general in general ya because because the
the amount of food that we can eat right is definitely there's definitely a restriction
so in a certain sense you'll feel like [eh] you're
how how do I say this (mm) like when you go out with your group of friends
then you just see you're the only muslim guy there the only practising muslim guy there who needs to eat halal food
to a certain extent you feel like you're doing slight inconvenience
that they have to go eat at a halal restaurant I think this is a
it's a it's a it's a known thing [lah] !huh!
cause like let's just say [eh] (err)
let's go eat [ah] #din tai fung# you know obviously that's a no go for me
(um) make us feel bad so they will just (err) go to somewhere we can eat [lah]
and end up we go to the same place every single time
eighteen chefs bro eighteen chefs is the go to bro
ya then
at the end of the day it's like
these food options they are still there but
just that it's it's (err) slightly limited [lah]
according to what we eat and and I don't know I have to admit from what I've noticed that
(um) let's just say you're eating halal food obviously different cultures have
(um)
halal versions of their food also and a lot of people are doing that
but these tends to be more expensive
than usual
like okay then in my opinion let's just say you go (uh) there's a lot of cheap #ramen# stalls
ya [lah] let's just say #ramen# stalls but they're not halal
cheaper #ramen# stalls but then for the halal versions of these kind of stalls right I think a lot of prices are quite expensive and
ya because they're halal and there's definitely a demand for it
so I feel that to a certain extent this is not fair
and then when we go as a group also then !wah! the obviously the receipt be quite expensive [lah]
then it's not fair to them because there's like offers on like
other shops and all that
so it's it's more about the variety I think that's the issue here
ya but then again I don't want to restrict my friends from not eating pork you know what I mean
ya like okay I'm I'm definitely fine with you eating pork but it's like
ya it doesn't affect me it's just it's just a personal stand when I see it's like
I don't want to make them feel #paiseh# also
ya what you want to eat
so I guess what
they s~ I mean they say don't mind [lah] but sometimes like what I've have done is that
I just go and sit s~ s~ somewhere there also [lah] but I don't eat also
ya just sit in and then you just
talk [lah] because at the end of the day like [eh] actually it goes back to the same point where
for me eating right is more of a socializing
thing rather than actually having to eat because I can eat anytime bro at home there's always food
ya there's always that ice cream container inside with
ya with no ice cream and not wha~ what you call that (uh) but I've no no what's that (err)
that's it's like ya and it's never
what the neopolitan one [ah]
ya [eh] that's definitely a piece of your childhood right there
ya okay
then I think if you like going back to that point right it's like
I don't know [ah] there's no solution for this it's just something I felt like talking about
take to the edit [ah] there certain definitely there certain places with
a higher concentration of halal food as compared to other places [lah]
[ah] like okay I meant #bugis# #paya lebar# or #bugis# bro
so many ha~ halal food there and but it's definitely more like cafes and all that
so it's definitely on the more expensive end
that kind of stuff ya that's the easy option
and they don't mind but th~ I tell you I can't eat #prata# every single day bro
#prata# is not mi~ I can't live on #prata# bro ya
(mm) (uh) (mm)
ya
ya definitely
especially here especially here
yes no actually that's why I think it's a good thing that
the government is like trying to push for using more healthier ingredients and you can see this a lot in
they've (err) they're slightly no le~ update okay it's very obvious
obvious and (uh) they're slightly cringey
(err) what you call that national (err) health promotion board [ah]
what you call they try to insight
healthier choice references into like certain malay #jamaahs# right
(err) coconut milk and all that right
so when you see this kind of thing it's like okay obviously they are pushing for it so that people
will like [oh] actually there's healthier versions of this kind of food that we can eat then you can actually eat more of it [lah] and
to a certain extent the taste will change a bit but for the most part it'll be the same [lah]
like cause it's still the same dish [mah]
ya and
like what I said it is definitely obesit~ not obesity diabetes is definitely a big problem
like ya !huh! so
(hmm)
I think but to be honest is
I wouldn't think it's from our generation it's all the older generation mostly because
the the diet has and will always be consist of (err) will always comprise of
that [lah] of that kind of traditional food
definitely definitely you can change bro but (uh) you have to understand the
mindset and the
practice of someone who's (err) older right it's definitely something very difficult to
(err) change or enforce it's it's definitely it's definitely it's like
it has to come in like very slow stages [lah]
ya
[ah] yes yes yes
[ah] bro then when the #teh# O is like what three scoops of three bold scoops of sugar
[eh] ya understand
but they don't
ya and and I can understand where they're are going from we've been doing this our whole life why should we change
ya they're still okay and it tastes ya ya definitely I agree ya
ya [ah] that's why they cook the nicest food
but you definitely cannot go there and eat there every single week
they're having that's that's just too much
no we my my family makes it a point that we just bring our own food there so they don't cook
so we bring when we bring our food we tell them in advance and then we bring like healthier food [lah]
so the
but we only go there every week [lah]
that's when we are all are free [mah] cause if we go there that's when the whole family is together
so we can go there every weekend [lah] or so
ya so
ya
also
to a certain extent because okay imagine like
(err) this kind because like I mean (uh) for
so she definitely want to try new food also
then like because certain things that she cannot cook
especially like it's quite cool [lah] that's because she likes
to she doesn't mind eating sushi you know japanese food she doesn't mind anything
which is quite sick and this this this tends to
how do I say this I think it tends to be healthier
I mean especially like sashimi like that kind of stuff
ya I think sashimi is definitely healthier bro
it's just fish right so ya so we bring it over
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
I mean
I think by a long shot but ya
and sashimi is not with rice so on it's own already
ya ya [lah]
so like going back to that is
like when we bring we come over we'll bring food right so she doesn't
it's not that she doesn't have to cook because she insists that she definitely makes family [lah] because
so the guests feel I mean it's something that they hold to [lah] quite close [lah]
she prepare less [lah]
ya so that's that's a good thing that's a good start
I mean ya but I think ya okay
straying off topic again one of the unhealthy things that I will always look for to (err) weekends is definitely bubble tea [ah]
ber~ I don't know I'm a bubble tea kind of guy man it's like
what's your stand what's your stand
ya
it's a social thing social thing again
so you're peer pressured into buying it
chocolate [eh]
[ah]
[oh] so [oh] you're more of that old school bubble tea [lah] so you're talking about the oreo crush that kind of ice blended drinks is it
so I mean this brings back memories bro okay actually that's the thing because last time right
and then got (err) sweet ti~
I don't know man it just closed bro so
I remember it was what oreo crush will be like two dollars
in fact it was I think something it was less than two dollars then you you upsize it
!huh!
ya you upsize it to two fifty or three dollars
then now you !wah! you take a look at all the
standard bubble tea shops one cup is like three dollars [lah] at least
or like or student card
okay which is not legal by the way
so it's like it's still then that's when it becomes like two dollars or even one fifty something like that
ya
I mean I I think I think about it that
these kind of things is
it's something that you enjoy on the weekends [lah] something like you don't really have all the time so
I think it's okay cause in camp you're definitely just drinking water
some other thing
dude I think I'll be I'll go crazy
definitely [ah] my money you will just disappear on poverty
okay I understand extend the contract [lah] you mean
ya bro I haven't considered signing on bro
ya
especially you'll be in a situation where you'll be more aware of your finances
ya
okay ya [lah] ya [lah] definitely [lah] I mean there's still a lot of ways to fill up your time
I forgot more beneficial if before uni~ starts
N_S is easy it's an easier role ya you know what's going on
I think like
if you
like if you about about the food thing right let's just say
e~ even though
you spend money like buying food outside and all that at the end of the day it would be better if you end up cooking
learning how to cook on your own because it's definitely a useful skill ya it's a skill that you should have in for your life because
at some point in your life you'll definitely be living alone
right obviously you also know that
that's not very sustainable so
if you want to eat something else [lah]
but this kind of thing is
definitely up to you
and up to your own preference [ah]
but
how you how you how you feel about that
ya I agree with you

(err) cleaning cleaning makes it like very like I don't know I feel like it's like
therapic there like ya therapeutic
like I don't care I'm not going to do it
ya
[oh] it's already almost an hour
K after this I'm gonna like go to sleep straightaway because I've I haven't like I haven't been sleeping for like
I haven't been sleeping late you know I've been sleeping like ten to eleven P_M early that's early for me usually ya usually I will sleep like last time your is it our sleep very late now I'm like
(uh) (um)
(um)
(uh)
(um)
(err) ya then (err)
[ah] ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
[oh] yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get (um)
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad (err) cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it (um) ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
(uh) any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but (um)
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back (uh) just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it (um) even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but (um) maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me (err) excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not (um) just buy (err) knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya (err) just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that (um) whi~ which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work (um) then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes [ah] okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then (uh) you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say (err) when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss #johor# so much our old house ya but now it's (um) make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it [ah] #abu#
[oh] it's a terrace [oh] okay
yup because [ah] it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and (err) I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun [lah] ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase #abu#
sticky #sambal# I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's (uh) it's whatever happens (um)
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
(um) because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper [what] I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger #ramly# burger #ramly# that I miss the most yup and the abalone
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of (err) cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to J_B cause
yup (err) sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go #johor# and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that #abu#
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
(mm) I think so
(um) [ah] we went to cycling (um)
[ah] we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge (err) you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
[ah] and we tried (um) tried their obs~ [ah] that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it (uh) you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say #abu# like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
(um) yes because I was (um) for my C_C_A I was from N_P_C_C
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
(um) I think it's S_T_C
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
[oh] wait I can't rem~ (um)
[oh] actually I think I didn't went (um)
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or (uh) high elements it~ in (um) school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay (um) my camp was at the #pulau ubin# H_Q there ya
(um) I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the (uh) I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore (um) ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to (um) rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
(um) you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
(um) I remember (um)
I can't (um) in secondary school we did a lot of things
(um) like (uh) like camps mostly camps
(err) give I remember (um) chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days (uh) and then what else [oh] (err) it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time (uh) in our secondary school (um) we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
(um) cause we had we change our principal I (um) our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they (uh) do (uh) about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
(um) ya
and all of them all of these charities (err) will be donated to the (uh) respective
respect~ respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs [lah] for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that (uh) you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy (err) to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games [ah] and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you (err) I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
(uh) plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
(mm) ya and we have a lot of programmes [lah] actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme (um) like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed (um) how the way how they speak
we and their english [ah] the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that (um) I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup (err) from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them [lah] ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type [lah] actually (um) but [ah] for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you (err) like example for me (uh) I was given a choice to go to I_T_E I I did wish to go to poly but ya I_T_E is also like poly but
(err)
like I in I_T_E is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like (um) ya (um)
it's like school also but no [ah] I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in I_T_E or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in I_T_E
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
(um)
sports there's a lot [ah] actually ya and yup act~ [oh] to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves [lah] like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
(um) doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my (err) using my I_T skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school (uh) we didn't have like I_T workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs [lah] like you have to make (err) you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your I_T skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically (err) and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking (um)
because I I cause why I choose that course is (um) I I I want to learn how to (uh) bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
(um) pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun [lah] to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
[oh] (um) okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot (um) okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made (um) I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or fin~ financier focaccia and it's a great (um)
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made (err) the pizza it (um) and we also make cakes (um) black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could (err) redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if [ah] even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like (uh) you have to cut it into threes (uh) three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and (err) after (err) the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling (err) at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
[oh] okay I remember (um) we didn't make okay (err) I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is #pate choux# in french and then you know (uh) we had to do eclaire #choux# so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like (uh) cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my (err) my class advisor though
(um) my sir showed us (uh) a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough con~ this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who (uh) they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed [lah] like they have really nice talents to (um) which I can also learn from them
ya
[oh] my lecturer name my (err) we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really (err) sir jeremy is a very nice (uh) teacher he
the (uh) he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our (uh) parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him (uh) he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who (err)
which teacher doesn't want to see their children (uh) their chil~ I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud pa~ like a very proud like (err) like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
(um)
do you mean during COVID nineteen
(um) I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
(um) this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows (err) appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does (uh) when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause (uh) because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because ex~ example [lah] like (um)
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross [lah]
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know (err) restau~ in restaurants last time was like (uh) you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the (um) the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like (um) (um)
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
(um) I know wearing a mask it will it will helps (um) to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face [lah] example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to (um) get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a cit~ citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen (uh) to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like (um) it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know
(um)
ya and but now when going out you need to always ensure you have your mask
wear a mask I I once forgot like I was like went out for I went out then I was like something was missing
and then I was looking around like [oh] ya it was my mask I had to rush back and get back my mask which is the struggle and act~ [oh] and I was [oh] I was rushing to school ya
and you know wearing a mask is also a nice it can be good and bad and also be good because that you can cover your I mean you can cover your face
for those people who are introvert and does not like to speak and doesn't like show your face mask wearing mask is a good thing cause people can't recognize you that's what I like about wearing mask
ya (mm) but it's hard to breathe sometimes and [ah] ya
(mm) I don't know [lah] like
I don't know as long I can survive I do what I can maybe learn just keep on learning thing new things and all ya
(um) so #abu# (um)
so how [ah] I heard that you went on on a holiday I mean you went on a staycation with your friend
how was it like how's the hotel how's the service and please (um) why not you share with us
(uh huh) (oo) okay
!wow! that's really fun I would like that too
just nice
yup
(oo)
and you played your game there [oh] okay anyways you won't get bored I mean ya
really [oh]
[oh] okay
going to #bugis# yup
[oh] okay okay
so do you recommend that (um) those who can't travel overseas and want their holiday wanting to have your holiday in singapore should have staycation in singapore
but ya but
ya because like (um) as me as a singaporean even though singapore is a small country I I don't really travel like to other places because I'm not I don't really like I'm not used to traveling to singapore a lot but I mean like you you know like discovering singapore
like you don't discover much about singapore but actually there are so interest~ there's a lot of interesting interesting things to do in singapore ya like I went to singapore flyer before
and then see the national day parade and
discovery centre science centre the esplanade olive twice ya remember #abu# you went (um) you went to perform your choir performance at the esplanade
I think you already did a amazing job and it was very adorable to see my own brother (um) you know doing choir you know ya how was your experience
esplanade at a singapore building
[oh]
[oh] you had to sing like twenty for twenty two songs
[oh] that must be tiring
ya few
ya I agree
[oh] [oh]
[oh] I mean I was quite shocked that even guys doing make up but I mean (uh) simple touch up will be nice too you know yup
[oh]
how was your plane experience like tell me how the whole trip
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
ya
where was where where (uh) when did you when did you like (uh) were you chosen to go to hong-kong or what is this a overseas journey
[oh] [oh] geography students and you went to hong-kong that was cool I didn't get a chance to go to hong-kong I mean I'm a geography student but we didn't have like a programme for ya
[oh] pure geog
[oh] I see
what's the difference between normal geog and pure geog
it's like it's like it's like (err) O level it's like normal maths and O level maths
[oh] so
[oh] what do you okay so what do you I know okay tell me what you learned about geography or what can you tell about geography like what what what do you learn about geography
[oh] but [oh] you can understand what you learnt in geography
really
I see
yes
[oh] I see
I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the C_D in a in the C_D diary thing
like back then like the C_D player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the C_Ds all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days [ah] like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and (err) the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so given that nowadays phones they (uh) they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me [ah] I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about [oh] no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to M_R_T and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about #johor# do you remember going to #johor#
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old #johor# house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old #johor# house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to J_B is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to J_B
yes it kind of sad
(mmhmm) now the closest to #johor# we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there [ah]
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at (uh) #pulau ubin# what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to I_T_E
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so (um) what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to #bugis# like literally a five minute walk to #bugis# if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to K_L last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to #bintan#
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I_T_E I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said [oh] we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like [ah] we're choosing to go to hong-kong [oh] why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but
at the end of the day I don't really use it everyday because I'm not a geologist but it's still good information to know
and like I'm honestly was either geography or literature and I just you know love geography more so ya I mean secondary school days were great and now I have fun even though it was stressful and all that stuff but it was
you managed to survive you currently I'm just I'm proud of you brother
when I was still in school I wanted to get it so much but now they have graduated I kind of miss you miss greatest because davies

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I see
(mmhmm)

(mm)
(mmhmm)

last question

well
okay
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(oo)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
well if I have
three wishes [kan]
(um) the firstly [lah] I
I would like to become a millionaire
[oh] ya sorry my last wish is that
I got a lot of friends who from all walks of life I can just (um)
okay how many options just [ah] one or two or three
not that good
meal [eh]
[oh] overseas okay I got one that I remember
whale meat when I go to japan
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
the taste is really unique [lah]
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best [eh]
to that extreme yes
[ah]
no the #wagyu# beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
a special kind of breed only for
ya
#itaewon# the #itaewon# actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain [ah] it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up (err) that hill
then after that if you go down
they are malaysians but the way they cook the #bulgogi# is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the #bulgogi#
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
cause I go it's actually
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal [lah] I I actually go down
nearest park then that's where all the snow is [lah]
very interesting
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
cause why for I mean for own
and !wah! I tell you the
okay in japan [kan] in a middle of
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of [lah]
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive [lah] but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
school [lah] cause (err) frankly speaking in asia right
really far [kan]
[ah] so that is the gist [lah] actually
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
hundred percent halal they won't accept (err) alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting [kan] that's what I when if you go around the world then you see [lah]
(mm)
correct correct correct is like that one
(uh) so they have the alcoholic
for them to to you know to do their things
[ah] so that is the gist [lah]
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy [ah] but again [lah] like
into youtube [kan]
[ah] yes cause garlic is very good [lah] basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy [eh] I
healthy
fruits [lah] I eat fruits [lah] but (uh) if you want it
okay [ah] usually fruits [lah] I just eat fruits
[oh] almost everyday is egg [lah] by right egg is is considered healthy food [mah]
skills [eh] meaning what
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code [lah] code very very well so that I can build
(err) games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
and that is your business product [ah] after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
(uh) one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
all
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause (uh) again [ah]
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again (uh) it's all about the skill set [ah] if we got
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food [ah]
just say food
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
goes very deep [lah] and also very (err)
they have very rich history (uh) their okinawan
karate-do #aikido#
if you're late for one minute [eh] they totally banned you from the class at all
tense your body means you have more strength but by right #okinawa# the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
realistic more relax and more
#kata# it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
to charge at the long distance
to fight the short distance
[ah] that's why when they have the any competitions
they do not know about okinawan the original one
they are trained not to use any weapons
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use (uh) a weapon to fight
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really [ah] do research on it
sorry again
was free
(err)
yes of course healthcare
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this (err)
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
I mean that is the realistic view [lah] but if like you say you ask me again
humans no longer
[oh]
[oh]
okay [ah]
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
(mm)
everything
so most likely will
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
go to mars maybe go to venus
[ah] cause I think that is the way to go [lah] you just want to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
activity [eh]
meaning what [ah]
(hmm) [ah] eight hours [eh]
activity [eh] activity
activity
eight hours [eh]
!wah!
no no no is working out
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight [eh] I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
karma
ya
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke [lah] if a comical joke easy [ah] double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause (err) my life how to say [ah]
it's a pretty boring [lah]
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya [lah]
actor [eh] (err)
okay [ah] actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
(um) he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one [ah] also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like (err)
what troy that
trojan war troy
between this [ah]
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
that cannot be killed (uh) then after that
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
[ah] [orh] even beyond that (um) you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that [eh]
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male [ah] character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this [ah] characters also this achilles
(uh) his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya [lah] and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used (um) can really
make if you really into this [ah] like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful [lah] I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
ya that's the gist
[oh] how I keep [ah] I don't know [leh]
actually I just went through life [ah]
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that (um)
after I read a book for half an hour
all these (uh) youtube [lah] especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it [lah]
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read [one]
I don't like I would
pictures and of course obviously the videos [lah] I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right (err) I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something [ah] (err) you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist [ah]
seventeen years old [eh]
seventeen years
old self
[ah]
seventeen
need to know [ah] you need to give me a time period
seventeen
[oh] poly [eh]
(err)
advice
I don't truthfully [ah] I don't regret anything
advice [eh] okay the best thing is
[ah]
[ah] actually frankly speaking [eh] at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago [ah] and actually
[ah] if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
even for those like you imagine [ah]
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
(err)
things in life yet
your character back then when you
(uh)
so my character when I was only
that kind of thing so just live life [lah]
just a live my life that's all [lah] (mm)
where do I see myself [eh]
in five years' time [eh] okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already H_D_B
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same [ah] as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married [lah] so usually is you do like that
actually
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially (uh)
money making invention business so basically is
the coding [lah] hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it !wah! then I'll be !woo!
ten years
for houses they say lease ninety nine years
[eh] !wah! back to back
!huh! serious

and when I open my eyes this is small dude was trying to put on the face mask was trying to put the power ranger mask on my face
like it's a bit not like bend fully but it's a bit like bendable so what happened was he actually took it and I think I didn't see I honestly don't know what happened but I think I assume that he actually bend it until it broke after it broke he just looked at me guess what face he made
ya I never even scold him and then
yup he cry and then I immediately sent him to the room terrible [sia] this boy
no he was about to so he was burying his face in the that one
he was burying his face in the pillow then eventually I check out check up on him and then he was actually like
falling asleep but he he didn't [ah] then by the time already I went out then after that he okay

so he actually vomitted at work and then they sent him home because it's like you know COVID measures and stuff like that
ya then after that no he had to go to doctor straight but I think he didn't or what [ah] cause the company just sent him home straight and then he kind of actually tell them ya exactly but the symptoms are silly [ah] as in like I'm vomitting
because my wife is pregnant !alah! whatever [lah] papa was a bit annoyed by it [ah]
is it really
ya that's true [ah]
that so mean
[oh] ya I don't know [lah] but anyway after that he came back home and then he kept

you cannot say that these people can't hear [eh] can't see
so mean digging my nose
it is not a chore it is like
quite fun I mean we can finally we have finally have a reason to talk to each other for one hour
ya we have to wait for the aircon to come ya because we cannot on the fan that's quite sad this this rule kinda suck
ya cause if there's ya which means

ya whatever [lah]
[oh] so married people cannot eat
soup
steamed
no mama already going out tomorrow papa is going to play golf in the day so I can he can fetch me in in the afternoon but I don't think so
#keat hong#
really
I don't know so how do actually people talk for good sixty minutes I'm sure it's not all content we're all just gossiping right now so
fifty minutes no I'm very pretty sure that it's supposed to be one hour
meet the fifty
ya [lah] okay [lah]
ya exactly actually my kids will actually talk more but then I don't think four years old can talk
papa why animal ya papa what animal starts with letter
[oh] yes that sounds like fun

seven thousand
everybody wants to buy a bicycle now
I want a car
I don't care I still want a car
ya maybe whatever I just need a convenience of a car so used to having it at
ya that's true [ah] I think we will still keep the bike in the long run
ya but until you are old and grey
really
confirm
[eh] ya so disgusting so far
what what what do people do in the east ya but that's more travelling time so means longer time for you to come back home and go
ya but definitely double [seh] the timing
[kan]
ya definitely
ya inclusive of traffic light dude
like from the moment I step and ya that's true the walking is then fifteen twenty in the run that's not true walking is about thirty minutes
just now [a'ah]
then teacher #amirah# like say about the P_T_C that's why I want to check
ya
next week but we supposed to submit the form by tomorrow which you forgot to print

cheap phone with no iphone is like the most straightforward phone
really
march [oh] ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
really
ya but still that's a month apart [what] it's not the same date [what]
I don't know [ah] let me think about it [ah] I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that [ah] which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home [ah] cause the home is a bundled family thing [what]
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
[oh]
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
but with no sub charges [ah]
[oh] !chey! how sure are you
[oh] but you cannot change to singtel
same like #ayim# right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay [lah]
don't say that you don't know though
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya [sia] it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what [oh] you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an A_I that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course [lah] someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or P_G thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like (uh)
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish [what]
make the computer understand this language
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
#ira# [jer] [ah]

#alhamdulillah# okay [lah] I don't think it's any girl's dream to be a housewife okay [lah] there are girls #ira# dream is to be a housewife
ya but #alhamdulillah# ya kind of I think so as in like we never thought that I will be the one who's gonna be a housewife but
not for long I plan to work soon so I am working now as we are speaking this is income
ya it is I mean some money is still money
my money is not off yours so !hey! that's not nice ya but whatever I can just transfer it back to me
no the example they give was repeating the same word like
ya okay then let's think of a topic okay let's think about what we can do to the house
[oh] really
stay in bunk stay in bunk
but stay in camp [ah] for one day eight to five
!huh! stay in
[eh] but not like [meh] like COVID [meh] why would they put you in camp if they are not gonna let you do anything
swab you have never done
how bad was it
papa #abu# has to take every week you know [eh] every week [eh] every two weeks
that's not true I have very small and cute nose
I think we have a lot of things to talk about
I have a lot of things to talk about and I need you to be the one who reply so then the co~ the conversation ya [lah] that's true just trying to pull your leg the conversation has to be a bit of malay also
ya
no but I want to be a balance of both I want them to actually think we are so good
whatever dude
at the same time we have a lot of overlapping so we have to get that not so much [ah]
means when I speak you want to speak when you speak I want to speak
ya which means I keep interrupting you [lah]
which is not supposed to be [what] it's supposed to be understand
yes they are confirm going

I'm in the middle of the conversation then you
then you tend to like murmur I we're not gonna do this here we're not gonna be fighting in the middle of a recording
there you actually waited that's just all I'm asking for you to do
I
ya
you know there's a red line which means you spoke too loud was it you or me ya
no because you went you won't see then it did it got shock
no just now when I read they say you if there's a red don't know what then it means your voice is a bit too loud
no [lah] obviously not void [lah] dude ya exactly I'll be so disappointed
ya that's not true
okay I'm sorry I will not interrupt you again

of myself which is not reliable because I'm biased myself
ya that's true
of course not why would I do that that's just digging my own grave
we are doing this for money could you have some pity on us because this has been a lot of effort on our part
ya

then it came off then what's the point
ya that's true [ah] and then are you gonna finish up the star wars
okay why don't we try one question
[ah] please the questions are quite fun okay (um)
I remember the question was (mm) if you had a superpower what would the superpower

I think I want to read people's mind do I really (hmm)
what would you want the superpower to be
ya

[oh] ya that's true technically iron man also no but he has that stupid heart thing that doesn't function [oh] is it [oh] that's his flaws
[ah]

with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money

that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
ya then #rizal# got stabbed then what else happen
[oh] ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
(err)
ya exactly so which means #ushu# have to still like be in good terms with them [what]
#rahman# [sia]
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house [what]
that's very (um) vague ya
is there really circumstances like this
ya [lah] that's true [ah]
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it [ah] meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say [eh] I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
!huh!
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting [ah] as in like they bought themselves a resale
I don't know [lah] he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand [lah] could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know [lah] I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
(mm) ya
ya [lah] true
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the #de la salle#
five years of course [ah] he's like that what which is good [ah] I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around #choa chu kang# area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works [sia]
#alhamdulillah#
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
#inshaallah# no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block [what]
ya probably [lah]
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to S_J_I but okay [lah] S_J_I also not bad
can he go R_I
ya [lah] that's true
#inshaallah# #inshaallah#
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to I_J schools do they
ya like C_H_I_J
ya but because it's catholic school [what] #de la salle# is a catholic school
so
[oh] ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else [oh] I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya [lah] that's true see how [lah] I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
[eh] dude
[eh]
what's wrong with that it's good [what] to be prepared
grubby like very I don't know he has a malay vibes
okay we can start talking now [ah] so first thing first let's remember the ground rules when we talk we cannot overlap each other
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also
[oh] ya ya
I don't think it was part of the rediscover thing I don't know the whole list isn't out yet right

true [lah] but okay [lah]
but it's okay [lah] crowne plaza now got staycation package [mah] next time he come over then you can stay staycation package use up the one hundred dollar voucher
mama wants to go for that actually
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
ne~ never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook [mah] mama can cook
but she eat #ramen# all that
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest

no not not me [lah] then the others all catch [lah] I just relax [ah]
but then the the best part [kan] you know this [one] scary scary story [lah] little bit [lah] scary horror so that time I I went there that was like three A_M in the morning three A_M in the morning then then two of my friend [ah] actually I think #sulaiman# wasn't there [ah] #sulaiman# wasn't with us
so there was I think the five of us if I'm not wrong there was five of us then two of them sleep already
#han# sleep then I think #wan#
!wah! rhyme #wan# five
then I think you should be #wan# five [lah] should be #wan# five okay
don't ask [lah] don't ask that was a a bad experience weird experience
ya so we we take the log then we just take some dry logs [lah] then we just make fire then he was cooking I think he was cooking Maggie #mee# [ah]
Maggie #mee# and hotdog
[eh] no he he haven't even throw his his rod ya then was three A_M already
because at the right side only got because it was this [one] is an open area it's an open area
then there was two ways to go to the sea so the three of them go this way me and I forgot who [ah] I think
#han# [ah] we go to the right so (um)
ya then that that was the first story then the second time I wasn't there [ah] this [one] was #han# #han# and the rest went I I didn't went there
#han# already know [lah] he he got experience before then after that he knows that this [one] is
(um) like [oh] (err) then he just keep quiet [lah]
then he he knows already [lah] then he just stay awake [lah] then the next day the driver came [ah] came to pick them up
that that particular
(mm)
(mm)
but it's not from malaysia [lah] [oh] so they they hear all over
so loud
(mm)
maybe that that might explain but three A_M in the morning testing mic [ah]
then when you look out into the sea right you can see there's two paths that goes to the sea then if you go to the left
[ah] I think it's like fifteen minutes drive it's ten to fifteen minutes
ya ya ya if I'm not wrong because in the when we fish
in the morning when we wake up or is it we [ah] ya in the morning we fishing fishing fishing then the O_B_S people all
sailing in front then we like no no don't don't then we see our rod move !alamak!
then you are literally pulling the kayak
ya balance things out [lah] !huh!
[lah] [kan] [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
but how many how many jobs have you applied for
then all the all the sentence all english
that's why
then (err)

in the forum itself then #fandi ahmad# at the back because he's just a guest maybe you you can explain it like that [lah]
[ah]
game [lah]
(mm)
a caricature [lah]
(mm)
but this is but this [one] is what is considered as a volunteering or are they paying you
say you wanted to help [ah]
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm) ya is a
[ah]
yes
ya
then after that then the way I see you edit [ah] !aduh! is just to edit like a one minute sequence like
that [one] was one minute that video was one minute itself and it took us what three days just to edit one minute
the way you wanted it now you say the client don't want it
definitely [lah]
[eh] feelings feelings
say goodbye
#sulaiman#
so
I must I must say that it's not we start the day is we start the night but our night is not the day the day
[oh]
(err) podcast
per month ya
so we can only select up to three so that time I picked three jobs one is
paying me one point eight one is paying me one point five and the last one was only paying me one point two so
I applied I forgot this job pays me which one because by the time I accept it I went to check back they take down the info like how much they pay whatsoever it's just the address [lah] the address of the company then after that then I was like okay [lah] at least I know I'm getting paid
at least one point two [lah]
the same exact thing that I'm telling you I I told them so it's like I think at least one point two [lah] [eh] cannot be [what] no there's no C_P_F there was it's just allowance
then after that then then the thing is I went to the boss I went to the boss then after lunch I went to the boss
the thing is my company is just a small company is a S_M_E so there's only like ten to twelve of us working
so I went up to the boss after lunch and [eh] boss (uh) can ask you something [ah] yes yes what you want to ask I just want to ask [ah] the the allowance
is one thousand [ah] because I went to check the internet they say like if I'm not wrong is like one point two or one point five ya we only pay one thousand [ah]
I think this type of thing you need to check with the school then I'm like
I give it to you
typical malay [ah]
!aduh!
actually I so
just asking [ah] I I I haven't actually really go and see so they are linguists
plus computer science ya
we just keep it simple [lah] keep it simple
#mat-mat# #mat-mat# [ah]
nothing [lah] it's nothing nothing much
[ah] so little bit [lah] just just to cover up that that last seven minutes now I guess six minute yes
so go apply school [lah] [ah] [oh] ya talking about
said so we are going back one hour ago
so
because I I myself also got (um) work as Foodpanda delivery so the thing is [ah] the pay to me is I tell you [lah] it's quite it's quite [ah] quite decent for I would say (err) part time [lah] because
okay I'm I do deliveries quite slow like to take my time so usually in one hour I can get like two to three deliveries done so for motorbike usually get paid about seven dollars to eight dollars depending on what type of orders you get [lah] so
let's say you get three orders so it's like twenty one dollars per hour so twenty one dollars per hour then after that then let's say you just only work four hours for that particular day you already got like eighty dollars so it's quite decent ya if
so it's it's quite possible to get like hundred dollars per day but that [one] is motor [lah] but ya [lah] but motor if I'm not wrong motor is being paid like seven to eight but bicycle you are getting paid from like five to six
ya so honestly speaking I guess is a good place to start if
if you have an interview for a full time you can technically like I don't want to work for the day I don't want to work for two days I want to get ready for my interview
you it's possible for you to do that and still there's some kind of income coming in for you let's say you only get like what fifty dollars per day it's still money like in one in one in one week you can get like what two hundred fifty dollars
one thousand my internship ya yes
let's say you you take it at most like you do two orders per per hour
so in order for you to get like fifty then you just need to deliver ten orders [ah] per day which is like only five hours per day you just like
a good place for you to like start [lah] then some more because you most likely will be cycling and then you can build up your fitness
marina barrage
marina tower
marina got what marina bay sands
six hours
!huh! so fast wait you run or you walk you walk
so fast then why why when we
maybe maybe we I should I should start with you [ah] what nine five five P_M
five five eight
[eh] play mobile legend [leh] you know there's a lot of updates now then like they revamp a lot of players and some more and and and and you know their their the players was not as toxic as it was before also
ya ya actually for [kan] they revamp
they revamp #layla# ya cause right I don't know
she really did
they that even in like during attic right the draft pick
a lot of people choose those
surprisingly [ah] ya
I'm totally not judging you
the fact that you spent
ya but then
but bro
for a skin
such a nerd no
but okay okay [lah] let's start playing
ya ya
ya
how to unfriend
how do I unfriend
why do I have such
a friend
but okay [lah] okay [lah] I
but then #karina# #karina# squishy [lah] bro but then
okay #karina# squishy
like at the start I always noob right then confirm at the start they will already say
a man of it the toxicity is not as bad as it was before [oh] but then ya and bangkok [lah] stop being a chicken dilemma
not bad not bad
the toxicity is not as bad as it was before but then ya
and
rank up [lah] stop being a chicken !alamak! (err)
where got I feel that level that time I saw you play okay [what]
okay [what]
okay the fact that you actually smash buttons I thought you actually did your research but I thought you nailed out on #freya# but okay
unfriend
okay [lah]
I keep on saying okay [lah] [sia] but okay
what okay [lah]
the rank the rank
I'm not judging I'm not trying to do it now but the fact that you already did a lot of research and thing it's a progress you can go up and up and up but
if you want to stay start then okay
win win the chicken dinner
invincible [eh] but if you want play fighter right I feel that okay there's this new fighter called #yu zhong# #yu zhong#
whatever
have another fighter [eh] but since you say you play #freya# #freya# right
#freya# #freya# has
why am I not surprised I am never surprise when it comes to this but
[eh] I really didn't know about the health spinning thing tho
!wah! okay okay cause right there was this like my team that time I play alone then I play with this one person
it's okay you can
you can you know improve that that ulti so instead of hitting minion you will hit
maybe three or four player you know
ya then
yet [eh] #masha# is not a tank #masha# is a is a fighter
ya I cannot tank
would you could that the
excuse me excuse me
[eh] !walao! I mean like okay I suck at new new heroes okay so like you know I'm I'm already comfortable with the heroes that I have
ya so it's like
[ah]
it went there there there there there it's okay
there there there there there it's okay
I mean it's true sometimes in life nah I don't know what to say cause like I ain't no therapist unlike you
but [eh] but if you play #hilda# or what then I just support you [lor]
but I'll be there okay I'll be there I'll be playing my marksman or my
ya
[eh] what other what other tank [eh] I feel that #hylos# also not bad [eh]
it's for you
ya #hylos# like ya
ya #hilda# and during
draft pick right they also
ya ya legit legit like they always did
or tank just odd [ah] and there's no one who'd ban #hilda#
so I think there's a good chance you can
but ya ya
they they ban uranus actually I played uranus before it's quite fun but
the surprising right they don't really much new players ya they bend your illness because actually you organise is a very thick thing
surprisingly right they don't really ban much new players
they ban uranus
cause actually uranus is a pretty thick tank
once in a while they will ban #ling#
[ah] #ling#
who they ban who I forgot
but now [kan] instead of two
they ban three each so each team ban three
so total six
players six heroes away ban
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes okay I really want andes I really want the fiery chicken [oh] my god okay I'm salivating
let's go find this but lunch [lah]
best [pe]
or like [eh] I'll be late
[oh] ya [eh] but !wah! the leave [oh] he's taking he'll be taking two days leave [ah]
okay now I feel very bad
ya whole day leave
lunch
no we're not bringing our rice cooker
[oh]
that's not happening okay we're not gonna repeat that
I can't really we bought a rice cooker for a staycation
okay this is such a
such a
feisty thing to say out loud
yes we bought rice cooker for our staycay previously and it was so it was so handy I admit though I mean come on man you gotta admit that it's very handy dandy
it's like what we cook maggi we cook #pau# we steam #pau# some more [leh]
okay okay no but we're not going to bring that rice cooker for sure
because over there right they already provide us with pots and pans
but ya we're not going to bring rice cooker
and no I'll make sure you don't bring your
freaking luggage
that's not going to happen because it's just
it's three days two nights so we're not going to have
a lot actually
I take that back I think I'm going to bring a lot of stuff also
luggage
okay okay then we
[eh] but the thing is we're going to eat lunch outside
dinner
it will be side tracked again actually in a way sort of
okay maybe not really
because right
okay I don't know
I'm actually imagining it right now
okay the fact that [oh] my god
#haizat# he fully endorsed it
I'm questioning our friendship why why are we friends with these kind of people
but
ya I wanted to mention that
pathetic
no I'm not going to do that
so it's like
the waking up though do you think
you think we will wake up easily
you nasty
okay [lah] if you don't you nasty
okay day two
in the morning we going to prepare some breakfast
okay it doesn't matter the order and then we going to do we're going to trampoline park
after trampoline park we're going to be all sweaty and disgusting we're going to go eat
I haven't do my research on that I ya I'm not as on as you
there's also I found one in #ang mo kio# before but I mean from here to #ang mo kio# is a bit like (um) but ya I thought if [oh] I know I know three one three [lah]
bounce [kan] ya bounce is there I don't know but we'll do research on that
but ya we can go there
[eh] but there's no shower place also right around the area I think we just change our clothes
then I just hope #zat# don't tell us to you know
go back to
you go grab home go back grab
but then like at the same time I feel like I want to fully utilise that
ya
[eh] I ya to what as in like you are indeed very correct because why why go out when you can stay in inside a cosy little
container with aircon with all the things you need like
T_V
youtube netflix
what why go out okay [lah] I mean okay we're such a
party pooper
ya but
(hmm)
I was speaking of grab I mean coming from someone who reaches
an hour earlier than the meeting time every time
okay you
so it's like I mean I'm not even surprised if your account is not even gold
or silver to be honest or bronze
or below bronze but anyway
I'm so on to stay in container also
but at the same time okay if activity (mm)
if cheap and nearby I don't mind but it's at promenade promenade I don't know it's that far [meh]
I think okay you know what we just see if there's any like places nearby in prom line problem is it depends [ah] okay so the first option
first
first ten
first day
we just
stay inside
second day stay inside third day stay inside that's the first plan second first day we eat
go up and trampoline
go out and trampoline
on the first day I mean okay the first plan right it includes the gym also
because technically we don't go out [what] it's just that we go to the gym nearby the container gym anyway
ya we go outside which is first day we go
we don't we we stay in [lah] we stay in then second day then we go trampoline park then after trampoline park we can go back to the container
I don't know what other activities we can play
I mean even if we two car bejewelled and everything we stable soap [mah] like we still feel very icky instead okay ya then
ya
then
ya or we can go cow play cow moo first or wherever [lah] that first activity that we do and then we go trampoline park
and then we end the day with
going home for going to the going back to your container for dinner or we just buy dinner then we #dabao# to container
do not talk about my winx club like that winx club
that's not a very nice of you okay that's very mean move what's wrong with watching that I mean you watch barney you watch other stuff also so okay like cartoons are cartoons they are like entertaining

but in the end
[a'ah] see
her class [what]
almost everybody got A and A star

it will affect her this what I notice [ah]
headmistress

trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around [lah]
because I think
#tasha# #tasha# also [what]
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop

#nadia# my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this C_C_A thing like like now

no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set [what] knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay [lah]
it belongs to #tasha# or belongs to her
then it should be able to [lah] and #tasha# use
should be [lah] it's kids size [what]
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
[eh] she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
(err) going #bishan# on friday

a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind [ah] if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
but they have they have tuition [what]
#amirah's# fam~ (err) siblings they have tuition

it is our oldest house
ya
(err) I can't recall the exact time the exact year but I think it was when I was in secondary school around there [lah]
mine was like maybe in the early two thousands [ah]
hopefully the smell won't stay [lah]
ya
okay [lah] okay how's your job finding going on

I initially I was also thinking whether I should find a like a full time job cause now mine is adjunct right but then now my adjunct is getting too busy
ya hopefully everything get better
his family had been here since march so my brother has been stuck in qatar for seven months without family
I am not the target audience
ya precisely is what five digit figure [eh] I don't know

because ya we are not the target audience
I I was about to ask halal or not halal
mama very particular [what]
ya I agree
ya [lah] but maybe let mama stay in dorm try
surprisingly she eats #ramen# right but she doesn't eat (um) sushi #sashimi# [kan]
okay [lah] some aeroplane food is nice
qatar flight food is quite shiok
right so like when the flight come like the flight to singapore come so only those who are from that island be at the airport cause to okay [lah] then the singaporeans can go to that island then it helps their economy it sustained from also
ya like that that would benefit both countries hello
(mm) now is hong kong but hong kong got so many riots okay I don't know whether the protest are still ongoing but ya I it's not one of my to go list
I haven't been there before [lah] but if I'm going there is only because just to check off the list but I feel that hong kong will be no different from singapore actually I want to go #nairobi# #nairobi# kenya it looks nice I have been following random people on instagram then they have been instagram #storying# their lives right so it's surprisingly for this particular day was a lot of kenyan people so the location was #nairobi# they have really nice homes you know it's like ya [lah] it's quite nice [ah]

that time I went seychelles I fly from qatar and then I want to seychelles
ya
I don't have qatar membership I only have a brother
he was in adelaide brisbane then singapore indonesia it's like [eh] I thought COVID period you still flying around
(err) he's still the initial part he flew a lot to europe france and italy because they will like evacuating their citizens
they allow a lot of people to come in [ah] like U_S people they can go to U_A_E they don't have to quarantine even people from india they can so what I read [lah] on facebook like these indians they want to come to singapore and
extremely

ya
yes last resort (mm)
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment [kan] so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing [lah] but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
(mm)
[oh] maybe I just don't handle stress well
[ah] like you have that K_P_I where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second [one] so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
like now they are together under M_O_E and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under M_O_E and they are not fit M_O_E so that that [one] I you know [lah]

unless the wig is on the suit
[oh] I know the music video for rain on me

so there's like
what is it is it water and
no no don't touch me there don't this is my no no square square
no no don't touch me there this is my no no square
a random question you know what is like you know what is really out of this world [ah] these questions like literally out of this world
if you
could be
an animal what would you be and why have we
I don't know I'm still thinking of my answer now
a giraffe
that is so unlike your current scale
yes
reaching yes
yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they're like very different than other animals but also elephants are quite different
have you elephants much or more loving detail
ya that what I was thinking
[eh]
just over there
(mm)
I think I want to be like
like a bird but I don't know what species of bird for now
because I want to fly fly like I think the view will be
I mean
it's just the idea of like freedom like you can go everywhere
high fly
bungee jump
I have never I am scared but also I want to try
but I am scared
but I can do roller coasters
you are strapped
but actually bungee jump also [lah]
you are strapped
yes
because like it's
it's not tight in the first place it's only tight when like you reach
the ground
ya
but I want I also wonder like how clouds really feel like you know
so like as I am
what
so I wonder if like if I'm a bird like I can feel it in my wing
slip blowing and below my feathers
they are just raindrops
I'll never know I will never know this
have you ever wondered why must we suck
how
[ah] how
no so like there's I think there's this movie
[ah] about this spy that turned into a
pigeon apparently pigeons can see three hundred sixty degrees so they can literally see
their butt and the front at the same time [oh] !wow! yet
amazing [ah]
but also I think that's like very useful
like for like like
like seeing whether their predators know ya predators around
in survival camp massive human sadness
can you imagine if humans like that
then like you cannot hide anywhere so people cannot back stab you
want to stab yes
[oh] please [ah]
ya
I can be anything I want
I want to break free
!wah! what would I want as in do I want to be a non-living thing
I don't know [meh]
but I guess a non-living thing can also be anything they want
like once they they can be recycled but they don't get a choice
you don't get a choice it's like something else is
(mm)
as long as I don't become like floor tiles in in the bathroom
so like a apple apple tree
I don't know I've never thought about this
okay what do you want to be
what do you mean
like a super super power like a superhero
(um) I don't even have to have a superpower taffy mention
like you don't grow old
(oo) and just excel in it
that would be cool then like my laptop wouldn't be smelling like matcha now
(mm)
that's good
but also like
but also like
ya
ya
yes
and don't see the need to like improve yourself because the first time you do it do it well ya
but if you can choose one important like superpower what would it be
like you only can have this one superpowers (um)
(mmhmm)
transportation [eh]
sure
it's at the back of my head
teleportation

and then she had to tap her legs like
what is one skill that you wanted to learn though

I think it's a cool skill to learn I'm not sure whether it will be useful
but
it's cool
ya
ya ya ya
that I want to learn
(hmm)
I feel like I'm quite talented
but I mean
of course there's a lot of things that I don't know also
I want to learn how to
do investments
no really really that's what I really want like I'm I'm very like because I feel like at this age
a lot of my friends are go~ like doing investments and I don't how they know how to do it I don't know whether is self learn or like they have someone to guide them and I think I have a lot of conversations with
my other friends who also want to learn how to invest but we also like them clueless so I like I just want to know
how to do it and like or
like you know like
what are the right ways to do it [lah] basically right because right now like even if you go to youtube or like social media like a lot of people are saying a lot of different things so you don't know whether like and some more it's like it's using your own money
it's a bit scary
there's like a risk
losing money but they say that if you don't take risks you will never grow
ya
I mean I do have like
investments that I do with like my insurance company but that is they do it
but I want to learn it so that I can better manage my own money don't need them to manage it for me
I want to grow I want to grow grow grow

and then I definitely can't play sixty dollar #karina# anymore
okay wait no I will I will not I have I have to it's sixty dollars
to do it
I think
I will start slow [ah] do you know that
all the players are new right but because I'm not new so I'm actually
wait how do I say
like taking advantage
of the situation
truth to be told there's a nerd under there who knows all their builds
and like witnesses
so
I'm gonna like
I'm gonna rank up and I'm gonna purposely lose so that I can stay in this rank forever and feel like a
like a winner
are you with me
okay okay [lah] if you say the toxic is already lessen
(err)
but since you're a mage or a marksman then I think I will go for those like
I'm close range [ah]
(err)
is it I was aurora
I'm not so sure
(hmm) but
okay ya I think I'll be the tank I think I remember being a minotaur
and I was just going hulk on like everywhere
I got this one new fighter that I rarely use but okay wait I didn't spend money on this this is
all hard work (uh huh)
(err)
I got the premium skin the what is it called [ah] the dragon
the dragon hunter no so bad ass
take #freya# for granted so that's why when like if you see people who know how to play #freya# [eh] #freya# but actually I've actually right actually do not know how to play #freya# at all I think that one time when you did show me play #freya# and like I got eighteen kills [kan]
I know you say I'm good but actually in the truth I was just smashing buttons
go back to ranking up [lah] I cannot stay my chicken lane forever right
okay [lah] I will rank I will rank
and I like I the few times I play aqueduct but man I'm going I'm gonna hang all the way and zero death brewers zero deaths my kiddie is so high you she's the queue depth ratio you know as it
like I
the few times I play
my K_D_A is so high
she's the kill or death ratio
you know what's that right
ya so the kiddie [eh] like shows your survival later but !wah! I tell you when you play [lor] ringing like
ya so the K_D_A like shows your survival rate [lah]
like !wah! I tell you when you play low rank right
like it's so it's so easy so like
but when you play low rank the players are also slow
it gets boring [kan] I need a challenge also
(mm) that's why I'm trying to find new heroes to play I try cyclops but
cyclops have so many weaknesses
but it's okay I I will practise because I did so much research back then
and my win rate right now is like sixty eight percent I think that's not so bad for just a few matches and some more I think back then
the few matches was like in epic
the rank and come on you don't see people play cyclops in epic rank unless
like one of those suddenly no choice you they have to take a mage so they have to use cyclops
you have to take a mitch whose entity cyclops nail kilo but so kilin so long you don't take our ronaldo aruna is bloomberg to good a good idea
then okay [lor] but so long okay [lah] so long you don't take aurora tho
and okay she's good but
but her damage is good but
dude she's too slow man she's slower than #vexana# at least
but okay I'm like try to play fighter and ex cause
my if I can smash button blindly and still win at #freya# if I were to put my hundred percent
I think I can
I'm invincible
okay since you have so much trust in my #freya# I will give it a head [oh] but
besides #freya# what else because you cannot play
dragon tales [lah]
but okay besides fighter do we so need a tank I'm still trying to find the tank that suits me
because I'm someone who
what I say
like have you seen me play #balmond# I went to ulti on minion
I I don't even think the minion took damage [eh]
so like
and like #balmond# is like one of those free [lah]
choose #balmond# [lah] cause I think not many people want to take tank if you really really start so low like you're low rank
then
I play #balmond# and then people think it's a it's a fighter but actually it's a tank so so you have like extra health
so
while I was on the filed playing [kan]
whenever people like it's quite easy to it's actually chase players
with a #balmond#
and then when you start spinning what they don't know is when you spin and you hit
the tank beyblade
you I'm actually gaining health so like what that that's what they don't know so you know my health is going down right but actually their health is going even lower because I'm actually gaining theirs but I only learn this recently cause I
I did my research on a #balmond#
okay [lah] [eh] the eye
(uh huh) ya I did my research on #hilda#
do you know they revamp #hilda# that's why it's actually
(uh)
a lot of buffs from what I read which is
one thing is the health regeneration regen~
regeneration when she's in the bush
so like recall button #hilda# they don't exist you know
she's just like working out in the bushes gaining health doing push ups
[eh] but
it's twenty four K coins and I'm so tempted to buy #hilda# but I scared like !wah! I scared like it doesn't suit me but I like the
then she suddenly just ran out the bush running
ya but I will practise her [lah] if I but I think I'm gonna spend on shortcuts first [lor] cause like I don't want to waste twenty four K coins I don't have ninety coins in my wallet unlike some people I don't know what are they doing with those coins
okay [lah] ya I think if we
well but I don't know [lah] I don't know how to get her I think I need to farm up like farm faster cause I don't know when I'm a tank right I always keep thinking of supporting
other players but players don't support me and I that that that actually kinda applies in real life so
apparently
life imitates art
#hylos# I don't
I mean the reason why I don't like #hylos# cause there's this thing where he does is that he will use his own
was it mana to like like be a
that's why I don't like #hylos# I mean ya he's thick
but
that kind of a skill takes
people who knows how to gauge when
to fight
then when to retreat and then went to fight again and then retreat
then you go into the field full health
why why do they ban uranus though I mean like he's such a
unless
worse [eh]
(um)
is it the ban benedetta
I think
what is the new ban like new players
I thought it has always been three heroes being ban
[oh] [ah] [lah] actually cause I think only the last
two hero last two players of the team gets to choose who to ban is it
[oh] no wonder then
(mm) then I guess #hilda# is might be my next choice in
buying
with my poor twenty four K coins left because I don't have savings in a game account I mean why who would do that
who why why would you [oh] ya cause they don't know how to play new hero
or am I
(mm) but anyways besides
a tank
speaking about a tank
I mean staycation is in january tho
we haven't even plan anything
(uh) and everytime I ask #haizat#
like
his answer with me like always [kan] always always like
till now even I ask him earlier also
his first reply
okay first day (mm)
like dude like all the way
I ask him again like
like I don't wanna keep him out of the planning cause like is a three people thing [mah] but then like I don't [eh] he's not even putting in efforts man
I would rather we
kinda like
maybe go for lunch even though
we are carrying a lot of bags [lah] but then (um)
can manage [lah] we eat
a full lunch first maybe and that's chicken and this okay wait no and there's vegetarian
okay first of all me and #haizal# just talk and he's taking two days leave because he's actually working on a saturday
then (um) so since he's night shift so he can actually
like working on that friday night also because friday saturday sunday
then he can like I mean he disappointed [lah] cause he cannot go school anymore so he got like ten days leave
then he was like saying since he's not going to school then might as well use that ten days leave for staycation [lah]
then (um)
so he don't mind using
two days for the staycation two nights [lah]
[oh]
and do you know that
(um)
on his last
last week before the end of I mean the new year [lah] so like december I think his last week in during december
[oh]
like no need go to work like
just stay home and chill that [one] really like !wah! christmas [sia]
ya
I don't see that happening
cause
okay let's have a meet up point #punggol# #tampines# and #serangoon# and it's one off so we all going one direction definitely one direction
then (um)
he's already boosting my company okay cause like dude he is like always grabbing like he really don't mind spending twenty six dollar on himself just to grab
it's cause he feel bad that I didn't get a grab home
like earlier that was earlier
and like I'm not the one who has to work
at night so I don't know why he so
adamant into
like paying for my grab
so
so (err) we compromise so then he pay for hair he pay all
no [lah] not twenty seven he pay for the
altar
he pay for his ride only then I take bus I mean that's fair
now I'm side tracking the conversation so back to staycation so andes [kan]
(um)
it doesn't have to be andes we just see whichever is the
#affordablenya#
(um)
salad
(mm) good life
okay so weird we can have a lunch first
we go off [lor] to the two one of together
and I don't think we are going to no I'm pretty sure we're going to carry a lot of stuff if I were to be there with a suitcase
you have all the rights to just take my suitcase and smashed my head
do it
and then
buy me a
one of those
one of those what you call that [one] [ah] sports bag
ya put all my clothes there instead
yes
that that's a promise please if I bring a suitcase
[oh] wait
are we bringing a rice cooker
because if we are bringing our rice cooker again I need my suitcase
okay okay since we're not gonna bring rice cooker [kan]
but you say you need rice you need your rice then we have all the
so they have pots and pans then
is it safe to say that we can
cook rice in the pot and pan
like a natural rice cooker we do it natural way even though it's electric fire but still
and then I can
big like the pretty [lah] the pretty pretty
I think okay [leh]
fast [leh]
okay wait wait #haizat# don't eat spicy [ah]
[oh] my god
seeing a lot of negativity about him
ya I feel like I'm just I'm just like talking bad about that all the way
but did I lie
I did not
so
it's facts be [ah] I did sidetracked but it's not like
[oh] and do you know that he is he is
do you saw the who who and the care bear thing right
okay do you know that he's actually
he fully endorsed her to wear both
cause he say it's cute
and then he say can he say he say he don't mind wearing also
I am and I I'm I I'm like
I mean I mean if you're happy if you happy that ya go go ahead
but you want to you want to get the shorts as well then
I don't know I just have the urge to throw a rock at you
and then I told him
if you really don't mind wearing that care bear shirt [oh] my god I'm side tracking if you don't mind wearing that care bear
[kan]
you one day when we and we meet who who
but we don't tell her that
that you bored but you wear you wear both set like the shirt and the pants I will pay
then we meet who who now want to see I want to see these two
these two species in their own natural habitat and how they interact cause like I don't understand
but why would you also spend so much just to wear inside of your house so obviously you'll be wearing outside at some point [kan]
but the shorts you got to go though
the shorts is a no no
okay I'm side tracking back
I'm just letting you know that
#haizat# agrees
and I cannot imagine him wearing it cause he have very long legs so it's going to look extra
extra
!whoa! you're only questioning it now dude you should have been [oh] okay and another thing he he actually also agree that you and him are like two peas in a pod
I don't know ya actually you guys are [oh] my god ya you guys are just that ya different taste one K pop one is like I don't know western artists I guess
why am I the only different one why am I always the one that is just meeting either one of you !huh! what is this can you all please
do a collaboration someday or something !huh!
no [lah] just kidding [lah]
I am the the glue to
what are you two (um)
amoebas
okay wait so
before they I don't know where we're going with this but
going back to our stay cay plans part two
then we meet up earlier cause I know #haizat# won't be sleeping
then we have lunch then after lunch we check in
then we put our stuff
then I'm pretty sure we're going to be like !wah! look at the bed
!wah! look at the sofa !wah! look at the dining table so after we're amazed by literally everything and anything then
(mm) I'm quite concerned because #haizat# haven't slept or rest yet
so I think
first on the first day
then after resting on the first day
the feel of where we are
we can go container gym
but I think I would rather just go back to the container and we just
take in the feel of how it feels like to be living in a container
then because I feel that we're the type of people who actually stay up night to just talk about anything also so can we at least like keep a limit we we keep it like three A_M then we sleep like
five hours no need go gym in the morning [lah] I rather gym at night also I think we're all gymers at night
okay okay so
ya [lah] like you imagine we play
(um) musical chair but this [one] is musical container
then like you run one round right then maybe me and #haizat# play first like whoever we scissor paper stone then one person go out then we chase you then after that one round I go back in then #haizat#
we scissor paper stone and then
okay what I can feel because today we gym at nine A_M right
the waking up is quite a
quite a weight [ah]
and not only that right [eh] how do I feel when I woke up (um)
like quite #ons# to start my day [leh]
is that
did I shower after I gym [oh] ya I did I did I did shower did I I did
I did
I'm a clean
human being
[oh] wait (um) so after after day one what what what's day two
no no I can already tell where this is going
I think it's town area
okay but if we're
just
instead of grabbing there just take public transport [lah] I mean like not that one hour journey and (uh) and (uh) how how much is that twenty six dollars I I I think one hour journey I I mean it's it's okay
(um) okay [lah] I get okay you know [what] how about
I am so #ons# if we're just going to stay in the container all the way so I mean this going out thing is actually #haizat# plan [eh]
wait wait do you want to go out of the container I already ask you that but I feel like I already know the answer because I know you
okay wait but we can we can go outside if we
how do I say if the places are nearby [lah] but if the place not nearby then I can we have a second suggestion cause I'd rather the place nearby
and
I haven't I've never went past gold like I know like I know my limits
(mm) but
I think we can one one place I know is cow play cow moo which is quite near one of I mean [eh] no no that's promenade right
I take it back I don't know where is one-north is what is my workplace all we have is laboratories
I don't know I don't know
if you go by circle line then far [lah] cause like one-north promenade is like other end to other end [leh]
I but I think the journey is like forty five minutes max
we talking about food are we going to cook all the way I would rather cook all the way I mean I don't mind eating maggi
I mean come on #samyang# man I mean (uh)
no brainer answer #samyang# all the way to cook #samyang#
that's like
if aliens were to find me or catch me they open up my stomach they're just going to find #samyang# no those are not my intestine those are my #samyangs#
wait where am I going with this so besides #samyang# what else to eat are we going to eat all the way inside or are we just going to cook
once in a while some more maggi is like
#haizat# don't even eat spicy so
even maggi is quite limited for him
[oh] ya Mcdonald that's like the only cheapest food that I know and it's really nearby
one-north
yup okay
so I think food wise should be fine some of us will go shopping before that
yes and we're going to fight over what movie to watch [eh] if #haizat# were to pull that lady gaga movie I have no words I will I'd rather watch
weak [lah]
you all don't watch cartoon I watch cartoon [oh] wait you watch winx club
I'm so glad I'm not the lowest at the bottom of the food chain
tasteless
[oh] wait I just exposed to other people that you are watching winx club that's right #siti farhanah#
watches winx club and she's twenty four years old guys
[eh] since when I say I watch spongebob I don't watch spongebob I only watch their memes
they are meme materials
and that it's acceptable
I will roast you from hell to back
I can go all the way it's okay no it's it's it's for it's fine if you want to watch my little pony by these people who watches my little pony they are there's a certain
there's a how do I say there's a this weird weird
(um) group there were just (uh) my little pony and (err) I don't think ponies are supposed to doodle stuff so ya I'm judging the that specific group that those they do note that that's not horseback riding right there that no no no no there is something else
no no no it's not the cartoon it's the people watching the cartoon they changed the cartoon and made it inappropriate that's what I was talking about
okay so I guess that's the end
(uh)
[oh] ya we haven't do our staycay
okay
(mm)
what type of superpower I want [ah]
because (err) even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
(um)
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
(um) ya it's not a
(err)
(err) to fight crime
like
(err) and they don't just fight
(err) those on earth
people from
the aliens
both of them ya
how about you
(uh)
(uh)
(mm)
(mm)
bat batman or iron man
(uh)
(mm)
specific
ability is to fly
(mm)
(mm)
powers
doctor strange (mm)
(uh)
[oh]
(mm)
[orh]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
ya hogwart that [one] [ah]
[ah]
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to ei~
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation [ah]
teleportation boring [ah]
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train [kan] you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
~ness
(mm)
(um)
(mmhmm)
(mm) but people need [what]
okay when you are rich you might not feel that [oh] money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
unlim~ when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to unli~ you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million [lah] not not like that [lah]
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
no you should
(mm)
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
(err)
let them (err)
it might be a si~ it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
(mm)
it's a
power
[ah]
[ah] where you can give to people
(uh huh)
becau~ okay because most of the villains in T_V and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
(mm)
but how
I think that [one] is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that (err) no need to work [lah]
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that [eh] why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe (err)
(err)
(err) superman is boring [lah] or maybe the flash
or
(mm)
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
(uh)
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
(uh) superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
(mm) (mm)
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
(mmhmm)
[ah]
okay next
no no that [one] they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one [lah] who will fight
wonder woman
(err) something like that [lah] the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
(err) letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once [mah]
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
stream
apple T_V (uh)
ya right
ya
apple apple [lah] the I
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
(uh)
they'll mov~ new movies will go into
that [one] produce by Netflix that's why they do that
free
[ah]
so
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
[ah] that's how they get their sub~ for themselves monthly subscription
(uh) this is how they fund their movies
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
that's how they make money [lah] it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
subscribe and (err) upgrade their
account
from one person only
(mm)
let's say
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
they can they are they are free to pay any amount [mah] to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
you fast forward [eh] you
(mm)
(mm)
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
[orh]
[orh]
okay
(mm)
superpower
(mm)
very burdensome power
what is the most burdensome about every power
about every superhero sorry
what what's the burden
with
great power comes great responsibility
[ah] ya [lah] what's the burdensome about every single superheroes' superpower
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
what about
what about the batman that doesn't kill people
(mm)
so what the batman need to do from

#thor# has a lot of flaws
#thor# has a lot of flaws

and then he's
he is not a god he is more human
he's not a god of thunder he's a more he's he's more human
that the story is just telling people that he's not a god he's a human
no he's not a god because he has flaws
he can he he can die also
that what the story is trying to say is even a god like him will so god has flaws
(mm)
ya

(mm) (mm)
that's how characters are
(err)
(mm)
the oldest
[ah] okay

on
(err)
the sound that involves in each movie
might not
come out with
the same at every house
some people have surround sound but some people just have normal T_V
so they are the the problem is that sound that's coming out of the T_V
might not be the same setting
might be differ from house to house [lah] maybe that's the only problem [lah]
[ah]
you know

wait the context this is taking place at where again
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (uh) (uh)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
[ah] okay but three A_M (mm) okay
okay carry on carry on
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
[ah] [ah] I need to remember but ya (mmhmm)
(mm)
daring daring
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
#ish# #ish# (mm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
#ish# #ish# of course not nice
three three A_M testing [ah] sometimes sometimes sometimes testing one two three
okay so I'm thinking of another place
I don't know if I've been there you see [ah] (uh huh) [ah]
[oh] the tip okay so for me
the reason I asked about the two storey building is because if you go there you will see the side
so you would be able to see the side of #pulau ketam# from one end to the other so I think your area might be a little further further in [lah] maybe a place I've never been in before [lah]
(oo) that's a distance I think we should I think
I think your end will be closer to #punggol# to O_B_S already
[orh] !aduh! so okay okay now I remember I think this story many people say before you kayak in front don't don't
[oh] here comes the big one and (uh) instructor instructor I cannot move instructor got current
I can't instructor I don't know why I'm moving towards the angler
alright so that's your #pulau ubin# story thank you so almost for sharing
(err) time check this [one] I can say because you say I can say anything it is twenty five minutes in so we are actually (err) after the one third mark
and the ya I don't know if it I think on my end my english is quite a lot [lah] I think your end your malay quite a lot so hopefully can balance a bit [lah] ya
I mean now we can also fix our mistake
[lah] [kan] [lah] [kan] [eh] yeah
okay what else you wanna talk about
my past few months [ah] [ah]
okay so for now the same thing [lah] just keep trying your luck to apply for all these jobs and see which one can can go for (err) I've considered to deliver food
but I think for the time being (err) more of a full time thing should be something I should focus on [lah]
I think slowly [lah] [eh] because we do full time and at least your income is kind of more fixed [lah] I mean I know Grab you will be able to earn more but you need to work more [lah] ya so just (err) pros and cons I think for now really my mindset is to make sure that I can understand what I'm supposed to do
(err) with my life then understand where are what are my interest what are my passion
then work on it work on those skills then #inshallah# when february comes send again this time to all the six autonomous universities to see whichever one is related to sociology or political science
and then just try my luck [lah] then at least in that moment if I already have a full time job I apply I still have a job
then after that (err) it's just whether or not a~ approve or not if approve I #alhamdullilah# I can say okay I'm going to go for my uni thank you for the opportunity bye bye
and then after that that's it [lah] if if if cannot then at least I already have a job then I will just continue till the next application [lah]
(err) !wah! cannot I cannot think that means a lot already [lah]
(err)
okay
so far the the industry I've been I've I've (err) sent for has been
(err) civil service (err) healthcare (err) cleaning (err)
around those [lah] is is just those industries basically industries that if possible avoid phone call [lah]
ya [lah] so that's why if I speak malay I english all the way is okay then the rest all malay all together level out fifty fifty
the rejection is the best part [ah] silence which is the most annoying part because technically [eh] by right the most professional way for H_R is
at caldecott area there (err) more of central macritchie [lah] macritchie reservoir [ah] so it's there
then (err) then
and then she said okay that's very good that's very good then after that (err) we'll just keep in touch (err) within the week we'll call you back
(err) with every passing day (err) when the H_R doesn't want to get back to you the more you feel kinda suck-ish [lah] like are you just playing my feelings H_R want to play my feelings [ah] playing my heart
[ah]
so
so okay so basically (err)
then
ya so so that's the story [lah] the middle person (err)
(err) eventually was someone that I met prior to this so we had a meeting before and he knows that I can do posters based on my blog
my number to this (err) communications officer [lah] then (err) after that
is #fandi ahmad# #fandi ahmad#
forum panel discussion you have your moderator your speaker your guest speaker
ya so that's why I was taken aback by that kind of comment [lah] so okay (err) I mean I try not to make a fuss too much I said okay never mind I will change it I will just put everything in one line
then (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
you know because for my for me (err) the the thing is me and this (err) officer
[eh] not call [lah] Whatsapp me say [eh] sorry #shazwan# we have to bring it down because the people might find it offensive
cartoon is literally the same image that I worked on
(err) so the officer said
so here's the thing
is volunteering because the guy that handed my number to the officer
and suddenly a pause a long message later by the way if I may in future
please consult me before handing my numbers to people and then I just say [lah] (err) it's unprofessional this kind of thing all these then I said I did not know that I was supposed to be involved in this event at all which is the truth
ya [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya
ya [lah] so I think the the thing about this is that the forum the the main theme of the forum is communication
that's why (mm) yes (mm)
the video [lah] [kan] the video
(uh)
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya
[ah] !aduh!
some more if it's free
if you want to pay if you're not paying someone and then you're asking someone to be so professional it doesn't make sense [lah] because the person will give you half ass work because you're not even giving half ass pay
giving pay
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(err) no sorry by by way or the highway but give me your pay
heartbroken everybody is heartbroken feelings feelings tonight we got many feelings (err) time check forty five minutes congratulations we are now going to have fifteen more minute left then after that we will
say our goodbyes alright I hope
(err) the fishing [ah] the fishing mine in the beginning right we already talk so that's why we like awkward a bit now now still awkward [lah] cause now we talking to you it's just
today is not we today we cannot say
(err) we for muslims we start our days
at the at sunset
at night
but our day starts at night yes our night is actually the the the
the beginning [oh] damn
so yes (err) these are all the topics that we like to discuss you know we've been talking with each other but !hey! you are a
listener
best per month [pe] not like the whole internship
yes (uh)
(uh) (uh) okay
[ah] okay okay highest
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
is it is it C_P_F (mm) (mm)
then !alamak!
(mm) (mm)
then you you you the man you lead my country
I don't need to worry too much you you you do your thing I do mine
so hopefully for you listeners out there I don't even know if you will listen or use it straight to the A_I machine the A_I will have to understand cause if they have to understand man [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mmhmm)
I want to say that's what they do but to be honest I only saw the ad on Facebook they say pay eighteen dollars per hour work from home I like
cause ya [lah] we we understand that through the trial we have to go through the trial first if we are successful then we can talk about the next step [lah] like we said as malay
it's been very simple but I think when it comes to the singlish accent will be quite
tricky on our end because for us being malays we will always have the #mat-mat# accent
but the #mat-mat# accent but I think
it's nothing is not like the plastic moved by itself or anything yes alright okay
it's too far you carry on you want A_I no problem no problem you take your time
(uh huh) basically Foodpanda basically Deliveroo
Grab Foodpanda [ah] decent [lah] this kind of job [ah]
[ah] (mm) (mm)
(mm)
(uh huh)
if you if you not malay [lah] if if you really really do the extra step
your outstanding (mm)
around there yes
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya [lah] interview (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm) so if you were to times four for the month is one K your internship
but this time you can enjoy what you do cause your internship you have to listen to people say make changes but for you you make the change you go from one place deliver the food to the other
(mm) per day [lah]
(mm)
speaking about fitness I actually went on a hike two weeks ago
yes yes no no further no
I don't know how to say but I feel like it's further
close change the last part
I walk from my house I cut through #bedok# I reach east coast park I walk along the whole east coast park reach the gardens by the bay
from east coast to marina barrage two hours
because
you start from #tekong# around the area #tekong# and then you walk that extra mile #tampines# to here is your other one and a half hours
that's why it's long just join [lah] that's why I buy this thing

my superpower is to control the cat
like for example they pee or poo I will I will tell them go and clean up
ya that's controlling the behaviour
same [what] control is demand
no my poor babies no way
K my superpower is
or rather the superpower that I want is to be able to read without feeling tired
noob [sia] we will make horrible superheroes [seh]
(err)
(err) I cannot
what
teleport
with a snap
I think so
(err)
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be

why
no I I don't think buttercup will want to be with you
you smack it
like how you smack #alias#

(mm)
good looks or a fit body
for your partner
I don't have both
(hmm)
okay so good looks [ah]
K good looks
ya [lah] I want to ask now [lah] so choose first
good looks or fit body
K
good looks or personality
then
ya [lah] something like #etol# [lah] you cannot say that he has good looks [what]
!siala!
I told you I didn't want that
I told you [what]
there's a possibility that
(um)
(mm)
(mm)
I would prefer
[oh] okay okay (uh) good looks
but smelly as hell
or ugly but smells good
but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K [lah] I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
the distance between each eyes is like right
you can wear mask [what]
okay (err)
the the ugly [ah]
why
hello I'm with one
I rather be with an ugly one
then with someone who stinks like shit like #aman#
okay (err)
(mm)
would you rather
have one million dollars
or
(err)
or a good job
or a job that you really enjoy doing
like everyday you wake up
you just want to go to work
and do the work
and meet your friends at work
okay [lah] one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
!huh!
!huh!
I don't understand
(mm)
(mm) I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no [lah] in singapore first [lah]
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya [lah] what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and (uh) basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya [lah] with the money then I will do that [lah]
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills [what] and then the cats I rescue them and then [what] feed them [what]
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya [lah]
cause I will invest also [what] so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
a non-profit organisation
!huh!
(uh) (uh) I cannot [lah]
volunteer [ah]
then you get to play with the cats [sia] so cute
bring [lah]
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya [sia] like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside
and then if you found the abandoned kitten never
then never tell
[eh] then nevermind [lah] they can be bubbles and more [what]
why socks
no but it doesn't fit
the kind of names that you want
blossom
what do you mean brighter cat
[oh] you mean have what white cat
orange or ya
but even if they are
bright cats you can't even see them

ya like you know like if on netflix there's a lot of avengers movie I I just watch iron man one two three over and over again I don't know what's wrong
but ya
(err)
(mmhmm)
(um) got thor he's rich he owns the thunder
ya exactly
exactly

interesting
(mmhmm) (hmm)
it's very interesting (um) norway
has the most luxurious [oh] my god
it's like it's better than my home
they have a supermarket in the prison I'm not kidding
legit they use card to pay and nobody steals literally like what you see here
like cabbage (um) milk chocolate everything
I know right I know like it's like I know (um) apparently they spend one point two
I would I would I would understand why like there will be like question arise through the taxpayers you know like cause all these are taxpayers money so the ya then (err) that the government grant like why are we spending so much on these criminals (um) but (err)
I I I think it's very
it's it's so humane and humane possible to reshape reform these people because their rate of like relapse it's a very low so like (um) like they managed to bring down the percentage to thirty percent
(um) of people bring the criminal back so that their whatever thing there but it's a bit too expensive though (um) ya I would maybe cut down a bit of budget and you know grant it to give to the poor people or whatever people who has lost their families during the criminal like murders or whatever ya maybe they're spending too much [ah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya true
until court orders they can detain for eight years ya that's so ya
like philippines is already so poor and you put these people forty years in prison
like you were just making their life a hell on earth
like like literally when I watch the documentary the the comp~ the narrator was like
was like saying (um)
(err) the philippines prisoners have seen hell on earth cause it's really it's overcrowded there's no facilities
vulgar ya maybe can (um) ya maybe don't show the norway one it's so nice
ya I mean
but ya of course not all they only pick the
different
because like (err) norway like norway spain sweden they all very big country so they not only have one prison they have a lot of prisons
ya so they only pick one like the highlight highlight one ya same [ah] philippines also very big so they only pick one highlight it's an interesting ya

and she don't have to charge so high I feel like she charges too high like she sells a pendant for about hundred and fifty but to me it's not worth it for a pendant because number one it's not gold

but he's suppose to follow up
he tell me to give him until monday I am fine but ya he's supposed to call me I mean he's not suppose to call me but he's suppose to counter ya because I told him I am going with ashley cause ashley meets
my budget and even though the multiplier is as not much as A_I_A but it covers pretty much the same and for now it meets and then and also ashley said next year I can apply for full coverage if I don't have a relapse
record ya then I told him that then he said give him until give him until monday [lah] ya so I gave him until monday cause I don't I don't mind going to him but you know I need to think more myself cause at the end of day I am still taking the critical illness plan I don't mind I mean I won't want to support you if your budget supports me ya so I don't know what is he coming back with [lah]
but ya A_I_A is generally expensive it's just more costly
like like (uh) if like ashley said if I have the same budget as what adam quoted me I could get more coverage with her ya so like I don't know what's the plus point of A_I_A so I guess that what he is trying to find and can can get back to me
no no because I don't have surrender fees mine is just a basic coverage because I cannot afford surrender fees at this moment
ya so adam was supposed to
get back to me on that but he's not
no no no I

then I already photocopy I need to fill up the form
for (uh) for claim any any kind of dates I need to fill up
I already submitted by end of (err) end of september
the end of september
seven or eight october
then (uh) when I receive my pay in november recently I checked then I ask her [lah] luna I haven't received the claim that I was supposed to then she said [oh] is it let me get back to you and that is on six november
yesterday was twenty first right
twenty first november I texted her again I asked her hi luna is there any update about the claim
and she never reply
she never reply I can show you
I mean twenty five twenty five twenty five dollar and twenty five cent may be may mean nothing to you but
you see
when it come to this [one] she just disappear
ya
I mean come on [lah] I'm underpaid in the first place I know we're not supposed to share about (uh) our pay
but among our my colleagues all of us actually
talk about pay
yes
for me I'm just temporary there so I said I just said [oh] my paid is one point eight only
and then my another colleagues she also another temp staff she said my pay is one point nine
ya
then I said is it
then she just said maybe is your agent don't want to fight with H_R I said I did offer a higher pay but she refused and she said [oh] the H_R rejected H_R don't want to pay any higher
is a shocking [lah]
because
to compare me and her
no her experiences is only from C K
ya
so it's not fair I I have
job experiences
from what retail from high end boutique
from H&M
bridal
so
I don't know how they actually
I don't know how they actually gauge the pay [ah]
maybe but job the thing about it is the job ad put two point two to two point four
and I actually put my expected salary as two point two because that's what the job said what job ad said my previous full time job I get two K [what] so
shouldn't you at least
ya follow up with the same rather than you know paying me lower
and then got one colleague she one year contract so her pay is one point nine same as a temporary staff one point nine [leh]
one year contract
so one year one year contract shouldn't she earn more because she
yes because
their workload is much more they have to do emails and then they have to do sales as well at the same time
maybe
and then there's new guy coming in right the one that replace
the bing for the ya that's the new guy
and then he go and say how much she got paid to my other colleagues that got paid one point nine
more than two point two less than two point five
you I mean
contract one year so same same contract as her so the workload is the same
experience wise ya
she has a diploma cert
he only stop until I_T_E
from
#changi#
yes [ah]
yes
so is he he also worked there for two years sales only
no experience in terms of emailing or what this other colleague she even though
but her past past jobs her intern job are all related
so of course [lah] I understand why she is angry [lor] then
ya she got paid one point nine he got paid like two point four so that's like five hundred more [eh] four hundred more
yes
so one one point nine she brought home C_P_F one point four [eh] one point six [ah] one point ya ya
ask maybe
your ya maybe your trial period pay
even if it's not trial period right actually is by project
yes yes exactly I I mean I also don't know [lah] like try your luck [lah] then she said
no [lah] but then if I said it like that right surely my mana~ the manager will said you never read the contract properly
her fault
[kan]
cannot [lah] [sia] I don't think the manager will even talk talk to us about that like she won't be comfortable discussing this matter cause is not his
liberty I means he's not the one that
gauge how much she should pay
he's not the one that agree
and do the interview
is the H_R right
but that means she has go through H_R
no
sad [sia]
she is
because she's got paid the same as how much I've I've earning and my job is so easy [eh]
is just doing sale
no pressure no nothing
even though we don't get commission [lah] but still we are still doing our job
actually their their pay is is good [leh] for full timer
two point six
email [lah] I mean one thing about about that is
you have to do email while you're on the sales floor
is not conducive
then after that you have to stop doing your email you have to serve the customer
then after that when you go back to your email you forgot what what you want to say already
cannot like that what ya exactly like you need you need a space for you to really sit down and read your email
and during her off day also you still have to do work you know backlog
you have to update the you have to update the shit
saying which one which case or which customer case you handle and then you let's said the customer follow up or the retailer follow up you have to you have to continue you have to update
yes
yes that why is not that I don't want you to have the job but is just it doesn't justify the pay [ah]
yes and is not only that [sia]
the big boss will be
yes
cannot you cannot said that
I I want to ya because I have four days leave [mah] I want to clear my leave
but if let's say
this year cannot applied already december somehow december there's already people on leave already
and december is the christmas period so you cannot already
good luck [ah] I I thought taking leave cause my contract end second february so first second and the last two days of january I take leave then I #zao# already [lah]
good right don't need [lah] for what
come back for what said goodbye
I don't have pass
is just uniform I can give them on my last day all clean ya
I don't need that or probably they ask me to wash after that I come back one full day one of the days to return the uniform
and pins
they don't they don't care
from what I know [lah]
hopefully like let's said I rather not take my leave and get paid
you know you get you can get paid right if you never take your leave
ya ya ya
but I'm sure they don't want to pay the extra
if one hour ten ten dollar
one day eight point five hour
so eight five eight five times four three hundred plus
I rather take that three hundred then taking leave
but if let's say I can applied leave
from
no plan
actually
yes
no the thing is he offered me a
but it's more like I design for him a collection he wants to come out a clothing brand
so ya but he wants me to
right
he wants me to design but he wants me to come out with the brand and and take it as my brand under his wing
the whole collection okay
is not my brand I don't is like louis vuitton
yes that's a beauty director but there's still a de~ designer for the fit right yes and staff like that so I told him that way then he he he finally agree to it then he said okay [lah] we see how we start out with one collection first
so then when I take over it I cannot work with #raki# anymore I don't know whether he confirm or not because there's no there's no update
but yup
ya after this job [ah] then I can focus because I still got another one more commission project not commission [lah] is more like I do it as

he said guys I'm tired of this
(err) uni~ life he he was talking to us like face to face [ah] like guys like
every single time we meet him he would always say !wah! I cannot I really want to drop out but then in the end he really dropped out
like one day before our maths test
and he's so funny
that's not even pulling through it's not even one semester
[oh] my god like
ya ya ya ya
he said like !wah! I really cannot take it
like it's always at the back of my mind he said like dropping out
and like some more he but okay [lah] he's job hunting
but the fact that he wants to work as a swabber
at his own like part time place it's just funny but
no like it's something for him to start up with [lah]
but
let it go just like that
so wasted [lah]
ya I mean that's my motivation that's my only motivation
as of now
I should have studied culinary arts
according to my friend he said that his friend
is studying culinary arts S_I_T right now
in T_P so what they do is that every single day
they have to cook and they have like
like their modules (um) module grades are based on how they perform [lah]
in the kitchen like their conduct
all of that
whose that
#waalaikumusalam#
#sasun# you want
he was out with his friends
cycling
from where
but you get tired from socialising from your boyfriend
being socially present and active
does it mean that it's hard for you to
to build a conversation with them or you rather like you just rather not
there's nothing wrong with that [what]
[oh] it's not a stereotype [ah] it's actually a real thing
I think engineering school is pretty mute
discussions for every tutorial [oh] my god you know
[oh] my god
my tutorials are just paper
on paper it's just assignments [ah] basically
I'm so fed up with my programming group
that guy was really
like putting up a fit man
like his attitude was just [oh] my god
like because (err) one of my group member
like he action do
but in reality he doesn't know [lah] but he's the type of
person who believes that
whatever effort you put in is you all going to be worried I don't care about the grades
then I'm like here thinking no I need the grades because that's the only point I mean that's the only
reason
like why I want to hire someone else [lah] to do the code then he say no he doesn't want
then in the end we cannot like proceed with the hiring [ah] like outsourcing because it needs the
like mutual agreement [what]
in the group
so it's just
me and cheryl against him and another guy
[oh] my god
ya so he said it's okay if we get C
man like at this point
ya
and now he's doing (uh) the code all by himself
I don't even know what's going on you know programming computer programming ya

people beside me and
out of out of like
three of them can see things

in terms of talking or whatever with new people so that was a very good ice breaker like but I don't know if it applies for everyone because some people might not like board games some people might find it boring and that's the starting thing that they do they might lose interest already but I love I love games (err) and this just brought me back to
early times [ah] I guess
(mm)
(um) the game of life is basically
my friends so we went out one day looking for board games
and that happens to be one of them and I don't know how to play snake and ladders
and then there was
(mm)
pick up sticks
ya
why
okay okay okay ye~ okay according to my understanding
different colours have different points
so the like wo~ maybe a cert~ a certain colour has the most point
so
so okay okay no no not one by one it's when it's your turn you try to take as many as possible then the moment the move the next person go
ya
(mm)
ya so the moment any sticks move then it's someone else's turn
back then [eh] ya
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm)
I
[oh] #congkak# yes

ya [oh] my god the amount of money you can get if of that singapore flag
(mm)
(mm)
five two dollars ya entrepreneurial skills
I don't know it's okay entre~ en~
entre~ entrepreneurial I think so entrepreneurial skills
I do want to have
wait by the way I am twenty four currently I am working [ah] full time right now (um) in an office I work in an office job for a business school
(um) so I'm just giving you a bit of context [lah] [eh] (um) I do
think that one day I want to have my own business
or my little my like a small company or something
like there are other goals I want to achieve first
and then when I am a bit more stable when I got a bit more capital and I feel like it's (err) and a time where I'm more comfortable
to
go with the business I would
the company
that that idea is taken away that's true but I feel like one of the essence of being an entrepreneur is envision
innovation and the ability to like
it's not say be creative or whatever it's like
finding the next thing like you know that (err) sometimes being an entrepreneur is not just about the product it's about you and like how you can face certain like situations like for example if someone takes your idea
they cannot take away your entrepreneur skills
but I think for now no [lah]
entre~ SIRI hey SIRI what's the meaning of entrepreneurial
entrepreneur definition thanks SIRI
in terms of business or just in life
business [eh]
okay ya desi perkins is a youtuber that I really really like I follow her for a while already (um) on youtube I've watched her grow from when it was just her making makeup
and then after that sunglass company the collab and then did a few more collabs here and there that's when she started her own company of like these glasses but okay like as much as I love her
(um) like her story
[ah] okay and my respect about the start that company in the middle of her pregnancy which is like both her babies you know like
my number one idol when it comes to business
(err) I don't know if I look up to anyone
so much like I don't have anyone in mind other than for now rihanna
(err) ya ya fenty fenty became
yes yes yes I knew you were going to react that way like fenty is actually her real name like rihanna was a middle name or something like that ya [oh] no no robyn
robyn
robyn fenty
ya okay I ya either way it's not rihanna is not the actual like first name
it's like robyn riha~ robyn fenty something like that I don't know okay but anyway like fenty I maybe fenty was like a very strong family name or something I don't know I don't remember but but fenty became
just something that can be used by everybody and not leaving anyone out and I love that's about it comes from someone who went through that
and like she kept that in mind
no actually it's not even kept that in mind that became the driving force of all her products
like the first brand to have foundation of like twenty plus shades
you know usually it's like maybe half of that amount or like even lesser you know and it's really respectable [lah] so ever since that bra~ that makeup and and I think all the other brands that she's been I mean all the other products [ah] like companies that she made
like gave her so much respect in that
like (err) area of business
so I like that the makeup and then she did lingerie after that right and then she has a li~ Savage Savage fenty Savage fenty and then (um) she also has
na~ (err) like a luxury line which I forgot [ah] I think it's just called fenty ya
I miss her music by the way
when it comes to business okay who do you look up to
wait for what okay yes yes
I okay we we're !wow! this is a good question like what
is success to me when it comes to business (mm)
I I think what success is
is like maybe [lah] for now
is
if I'm if I do something I'm passionate about
and I can earn from it like
like I think to me that is success
(mm) (mm)
boyfriend ya the one with the kids but they never actually got married it's okay don't you don't have to but anyway so you have to follow all the people that scott disick follows so I realise that all the people that he follows are all businesses
ya go ahead
yes
(mm)
following ya correct
ya correct correct for all ya ya ya as in ya that's very true that's very true okay so ya maybe that's it
so (um)
(um) the account was giving seventy K seventy K U_S_D
no it's like they have it all the time like I think account they have all the time so the next one is ten K ten K plus (err) the iphone new iphone
I
[oh] I said I think in the answers I said my mum I said I wanted to help my mum first I said I had student loans to (err) to (um) settle I have a passion for music I want to pursue music and if possible I want to start my own little business so that was my answer like
that's what I'm going to do that's what who I want to share with kind of thing but it was just a brief thing like there's so much more right like I told you right like the plans and shit
ya so
fuzzy wuzzy like
!wow! fuzzy little hearty we should make a song
fuzzy little hearty (mm)
ya
ya
ya
wait so the amount wasn't exactly hundred K it was seventy K but round up
what what what
I might keep like one or two or two or three no be~ it's a lot of bags like like
I think eight to ten bags so I would keep a few I don't have L_V
ya
(mmhmm)
from kylie jenner exactly like it's proven that it was from kylie so that's true that's true that's true
almost luggage size kind you know like really big ones so I think is different for each but I think we can really make a lot of money from there [lah] but
I don't know maybe like I might not sell [lah]
and then let it appreciate value like that value exist
I don't know like in the future when it becomes a bit more vintage or something in the and I don't know I don't know either you're still gaining cause you didn't pay anything for it like you know
but okay anyway like ya so that was the competition
ya why [ah] you you ask me that before
(mmhmm)
okay
it's okay it's okay so ya okay to get a understanding of women who likes
luxury goods or luxury bags or
okay
believe it or not like I have never like okay I think the most luxurious
probably like coach [ah] and coach is not even like
top tier ya like coach is like the bossini or the giordano of luxury brands ya ya ya basically I don't okay my mum use to
they use to work ya my mum used to work at coach
like I would really like to own maybe something from chanel or gucci or versace these three these three I really like
(mm)
ya but that's the thing like I think it comes with the experience because it's suppose to make you feel like
like [oh] I can afford this you know like so it comes with it [lah]
ya
so that's that with the luxury brands
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay sure
(mm)
ya
I don't I think it's more expensive than that ya
[ah] the keychain itself right
me too
but it's okay better times are coming and we will be fine

I don't know banking
banking finance because you know money is still money like
I don't know about hospitals maybe there's no pay cut but they are affected cause they have to work more hours

I believe there are some P_H_D (err) owners here as well how you all get in this [one] have to pay you know like like he said something like that so it's a joke like I think if I think the doctorate one gets you a bit further [lah] I don't know

it's okay [lah]
also teaching you about capitalism same thing
you know work have family
I don't know

capitalism it's just I guess freedom what no no no no no
what
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya we are toning down a lot for this but okay
yes
nice
[oh] well you manipulated me
it's about if you have friends who always judge you for your jokes then it sucks right it's better if you if every~ if if they have similar humour that is great that's kind of what I look for also in a like in a partner but
moving forward (err) ya but humour is humour is a huge thing for me
(um)
no
next time okay then I'll explain further okay so or there are certain food that I don't like but okay to answer your question no like they don't have to like the same things that I do
(mm) food is not like a matter in terms of like friendship
astons
(mm)
ya she also very vibrant
character yes shout out to her but (um) ya really like andes andes is like one of our go to date places
andes
ya [lah] we don't know if he's meditating or what but he was sitting under a tree when I was on the way like you know the car passes by the road sides and all right so that that it's exactly like that so he was just sitting under a tree minding his own business so I was like okay
he takes his breaks outside just sitting under the tree calmly okay so it's an assumption that he meditates or he probably doesn't he just like relaxing
ya maybe
ya what do I do to handle stress I can call all your reference !aww! but (err) I usually would I'm not
I I don't see myself as a person who keeps it all in that's not my kind of person [ah] but I'm very particular with who I share it with as well
(um) like the best of times for me I would share it with the pe~ certain people like my boyfriend like (um)
maybe some like close friends as well so
that
stress [ah] to a certain extent sometimes you don't need someone to tell you or advice you whatever if someone's there to listen
just to be just to let a bit of load off your shoulders [ah] it'd be nice
ya
that is not that is not a main requirement and (err)
(mmhmm)
I
I guess that's like okay like having that friend is
probably would put you in check a bit more
(err) but what if you really got no other choice then hearing that is just going to make you feel more like terrible sometimes you know
(err) I would prefer a person who is down for you who will really really support you (um) sometimes it doesn't even need questioning you know so ya
you do
ya

sis we all struggling here [ah]
at least we are doing something about it right
ya and then like mine will be like birds chirping
ya
ya so like (err) ya so like now I'm like
as a wife or as a as it either wife or husband then you have to like remind each other to so like because if not then that would be you know your your your #taiji# [lah] basically so it's wife
we call it
where's your flaws may seems like whatever that might
what you call the thing
ya then that will be his fault
ya
ya
ya so this husband and wife thing it's it's really like teamwork
I really feel it after a year [eh]
being wife
communication that would be my response
communication is key definitely
because
like you assume that the other person will know
right so right you just have to communicate whether you like it or not whether it will hurt the person you can soften the blow yes but as long as you tell and communicate
and learn it the hard way
only when I met adam there I would I know the positiveness
the value of communicating
what do you mean
ya
ya
that was what I been saying
okay okay so yours is more of physical yours is more of like a (err) a tangible mine is
I would always say mine is intangible but mine is like
(err)
verbal understanding technically its intangible is more of like the vibe that you get from your husband or your wife
ya
boyish [lah] so I I didn't I I sometimes assume and I I I don't know what he wants [ah] so he have to communicate he's the girl in relationships basically [lah]
I think we both know that [lah]
ya so just tell me what you want [lah] so in a way communication works
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mm) (mmhmm)
okay (mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya ya as long [ah] you communicate really because like if you think like you want to run away
ya
Tiktok
ya
there is there I mean there is one
[oh] damn
[oh]
muffin mitten oven mitten
is it the rainy day
its the rainy season
!wow!
[oh] my god I'm so annoyed with this trump and biden thing
cause like (err) back then like like few
ya and then like I have to like nudge him and say like you know like
communicate [ah] if you please wear the stupid earpiece please
I am the president
when he's he's not president
[jer]
okay
[ah]
(uh) on trump (um) surprisingly [ah] quite good looking guy
ya when he was like younger
ya
ya supposed to go to the office today cause every monday is a calling day so (err) but its raining so he I don't know whether he's gonna call at home I mean technically he can call at home its just that when you are at the office and everyone is calling you will be motivated to call right
so I don't know why they do calls on monday I mean mondays got monday blue as a customer as a client would you want to be called on monday for insurance like don't disturb me on monday monday is really lousy
ya but monday
wait he suppose to call you
[orh]
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
ya ya ya
[oh] okay
is it because it covers slightly more I don't know
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
[orh] okay
okay
but if you terminate
[orh] okay okay
[oh]
this is under adam or your own
I know that I_T is doing very well right now so that's why he's trying to get like (um) all his clients to invest in I_T sector because Apple is coming up lots of stuff (um) a lot of people will invest in that and
[ah] (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
side
[oh] [oh]
[oh]
UNICEF [ah]
[ah] [ah] that's the one
what what was the question
did you google
initiate
how do you do
in your essays in secondary school
I know I know
think you should work on your timings
short form
funny though
sorry but (um) yes (err) in twenty twenty four by twenty twenty four all students will get a personalised laptop
yup
yup
so much girl
do you know about the new syllabus [oh] not syllabus like the new programme education program that we have right now
so basically (err) I'm not sure which year
so
will have their common test mid year and the year right
as of now they don't have such thing theory change
it's what we call W_A with the assessment so they have three of them already four of them [eh] so they go by percentage okay some pop pop quiz pop po~ project work
so they only have one major exam at the end of the year and that's really really high percentage which is seventy percent
that's it [ah]
so I do not know whether it's actually blessing in disguise for some people
a stress on kids which I don't know it kind of doesn't work [lah]
because I hear students say I stress
ya adulting
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
[ah]
its its definitely different [lah] cause (um)
it it has its own pros and cons like for both the old system and new system because the old system you have lesser weeks to teach and you have more time not more time you let's say we should because you need to set papers and they have exams you have mid year their contents they have mid year and they have end of the year
this time around I only have one end of the year so technically teachers need to set one piece of the exam and the rest is just like activity and it can be like presentation it can be group work pair work whatever work so all of this it's in to
I don't know whether you actually understand where I'm coming from but (um) for me if you ask me which one I prefer
as a teacher
so it's much more stressful for them
but for teachers its just set papers
if you if you if the way that you set paper is very stressful then that's on you [lah]
but
for me is is still okay cause
ya
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[ah]
ya then they will be screwed up [ah] which is very common in my class
ya especially COVID this year
(um) I'm coming later
okay the thing is like when we wake up as a form teachers you have to take attendance so they will have to be in this like zoom call or whatever and then like
(err) there will always be this one or two people who never wakes up
it's like
ya and its like
(ugh) its still retained there in my mind so annoying
ya and
(um) in a way yes because like I don't have to like teach and I can chill a bit but the fact that I still have to go to work and I cannot travel cause it's the only time that you can travel right end of year to travel to like europe country (um)
that's it [ah] december holidays
I don't think you got book no book
to to to do you have the link
(um) mac birthday is next month she's been wanting to go singapore flyer mac
no no no I mean you can use some of it so I check already so senior citizen is like thirty something
adult is fifty
there goes my fifty
can [ah]
right you should be able to stack though
ten ten dollar vouchers that accumulate to hundred ya
but fifty dollars for a ferris wheel
ya she's been wanting to
[oh] well
(um)

[oh] so it's okay [lah] that fun is the factor that you're looking for [lah]
(mmhmm)
[oh] pretty sure [ah]
ya
ya
ya that's true
but I think not yet [lah]
ya not yet cause I heard that apple is moving towards like
you can you can use SIRI to turn off lights from your house you can turn down the aircon I think already have right
there's a apple home but it's ya but the thing is like all the you need you need if you want use apple home all the appliances you use is has to be like apple certified kind of thing
I think so but like not all no but like not all
products is here I think ya maybe they're still trying it out and then they realise that a lot of people are still buying alexa or whatever ya that's cool I guess
you know
ya
I know right
okay
okay
so
okay
hey SIRI would you sorry I don't want to trigger
(mm)
(mm) make it warmer ya and then it will
it will turn it you know [lah] you need to unlock your iphone first

tchoukball or something is it the one you throw them net they had through at the net
I don't remember floorball tchoukball I don't remember ya I mean we did play (uh) captain's ball a lot I was always the goalkeeper
cause I was great at catching balls I was good at no pun intended but ya ya ya I played a lot frisbee (uh) I played basketball in secondary school then rugby was like my final like touch rugby was my final

okay [lah]
that's why in like you know secondary school I was so fit then the moment I went to poly I gained so much weight because I didn't do the same amount of physical activity I was eating I was still having like unhealthy lifestyle I slept like like irregular eat irregularly also ya it's okay now I can tell people I tried a lot of things that's why I tell people [what] I'm a jack of all trades master of none
but ya I think primary school and secondary school there's a lot of like ghost stories [sia] ya especially you know you go to camps
do you do you have any camps like do you guys have any like
[ha] okay you continue
(oo)
(mm)

one of the the the the guys right one of the army sto~ one of the army stories
no not the not the one that the guy died with the the not with the intestines all over the floor one it's the other one is the the one that he offended the offerings or something then
ya because he mummy boy ya that place [lah] the that that place they used as like the no it was at a camp I don't remember but I think it's now closed is it #sarimbun# is #sarimbun# closed I don't remember it was I think #sarimbun# because I remember sleeping on those bunks
ya but ya when I had those night walks right it was
okay because night walks right what they did was that the line the route with glow sticks [tau]
they line the route with glow sticks then the
the like you are free to walk [ah]
it started out fine but right it's like
like when how say [eh] (uh)
it started out fine but it's like (err) when we came back from like to go back to the campsite right
I was like walking normally you know like you know you walking normally right like are there was nothing for me to trip on or like off or something I felt like something grab my ankle then I slipped
everyone was showered
ev~ everyone sho~ finished showering already
[kan] if you think about it because we took a shorter cut
creeped the heck out of me
#aik#
(mm)
yikes
they just stayed there [lah] so bad in everything smelt then the house smelt
no they say that
LOL
(uh huh) cause I watched that [one]
(mmhmm)
it's not painful
it's not painful and I mean it hurts your soul but not on your face I guess (err) I don't know [lah] I mean #allahu alam# [ah] [eh]
that's why I say I don't know you go Google [lah] I don't know what else [ah]
to stay young
right I I remember I remember a lot of stories where they say that they eat babies to stay young
people correct
ya ya I don't want to talk about it who knows they're talking the thing will I mean I mean
no it's
islam
welcome it I know when you give birth the one who will help you give birth midwife midwife I mean (uh) you hear stories that sometimes inside the
(mm) they see extra people inside the room when they
figure or figures of things like that because my mum said when she was pregnant with me right [eh] no not with me with my eldest brother she was disturbed quite a lot inside the hospital
taking it [lah]
I don't know maybe
but then again there's a lot of deaths in hospitals also so (mm) I guess understandable never wanna become a nurse or doctor fuck no
(mm)
(mm)
can you imagine like maybe I don't know
I don't know
I I told my mum if they're gonna like disturb me at my house also I'm gonna be like whatever I'm so tired I'm too tired I'm not getting enough
I don't I don't have I don't get enough sleep for me to deal with your bush
ya let me let me get some sleep first you come you you set appointment and you come back no because that time during I I
it prevents you get getting disturbed in your sleep but it's not when you are awake
different story it can go into your dream also [what] they say
that's why sometimes if you dream about something I don't know is it a psycho~ like I mean a lot of like while (uh) psychological study said that [oh] it's just like (uh) was it what [seh]
they said that if it's pigments about fragments of life brought into your dream or something then they intensifies it or something but then again some dreams are so wild that you are ya that you can't help but to think
like you said [what] they can (uh) what is it [ah] they can show themselves to you or make themselves shown or something they manipulate your brain so like you think you see them
ya but then again right I feel like
it's because there are it's aiming you
but you know what I hate the most is sometimes right they aiming for you but they disturb someone around you
ya like they use they played other people to get to you
I was sewing at night ya I was sewing for my friend like like a kimono cardigan at night [lah] around four A_M
what
no shit [oh] hell no ya but but I think a lot of the if you
correct correct then why you think who who pull my leg when I walk in the in the jungle what the heck right then all like when they throw things they move things
like the ya the paranormal activity shi~ kind of things right but I mean some of them are they faked they want views but some of them are not scared the heck out of me
with a camera right
ya like come here I'm already here for you come on baby [oh] my god [ha]
(mm) that's why [ah]
then suddenly she she was like she saw the chair move
like spin a bit she got scared she stand up and walk then when she was running for the (uh) door she got pulled back thrown thrown to the wall then like the the chairs and tables all like shifted
it was damn scary malaysia [lah] you singapore singapore I feel like singapore no matter how how haunted right cannot match like indonesian or like in malaysia I don't I don't know I feel like maybe because smaller
but it
the modern the more modern is it the the more religious you are the less likely you are to take over
I think [oh] I don't know I do know there some #bomohs# in singapore I think it's more of because we are more we are more religious like we are more modernise [ah]
(mm)
ya then I guess the mo~ I mean even your boob get~ getting a boob job would like I guess you won't you won't ex~ I guess it won't expo and stuff [lah] but ya
I mean I mean
I mean like okay [lah] it's temporary or unless you like accidentally poke it or you're like what I don't know
is it ya [oh] because it will like corrode or something is it [oh] ya ya
okay
but ya prob~
I don't know some
[ah] ya something like that I'm not sure
some people don't
or like or like or like if the wind blows right I got a I got a I got to brown my hair before my head
but this ya
(err) accord sort is it they show you stuff
like and stays forever
ya boy
(mmhmm)
but
the most people can they say you cannot die right you cannot die when
I don't know
not I think I think you'll be on the brink of death but never die
until you take it out or if you even if you die you are like finally die
you get it ya you like because you know right there's this like they say when you die
just because you your eyes are closed your heart stops beating your soul is not out of the body you can still feel everything
so basically imagine your daughter cries
you can hear everything you can feel everything it's just that you can't react
that's sad that's not scary that's sad
ya I think there'll be so frustrating you imagine your your mum hugging you and crying but you can't respond
I think I'll be sad I'll be so sad
[ha]
I don't know I mean depends on the family (uh) because you are unless
you not supposed to say this [lah] but unless the
pass to you
no [lah] what you wouldn't know unless you experience it
ya I think so it's an agreement [lah] basically you are agreeing [what] if you nod it's a form of agreement [what] no matter
like the thing picks its master
so like and
probably it will probably follow you around
how to say [eh]
I
lame okay and my mum said [lah] my mum said [lah] [eh] she said that the thing picks a master that is like
for real
don't like your slang [ah]

that was like
many many months [seh]
ya
so

[ah]
so like (err) were you affected
I see
so like are you working from home now or what
(mm)
like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring [lah]
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like !alah! online [jer] [pe]
ya
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
like
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya [lah] but now (um) it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] I mean
I'm trying
ya true
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
buying comfort food
and my comfort food is like not those healthy one please is like those what chocolate
(mm) #liho#
[kan]
[eh] but I've been doing this (err) one cardio [tau]
(err) this one channel
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
so
then (um)
video
[oh] no I think
songs you know music so
to me
quite quite quite quite fun also
[ah] [ah]
because for me like
be consistent [ah]
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
[ah] ya
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
(um)
okay [lah] maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
the orangey type or the white one
you you still use it [lah]
[oh]
we met in (err)
primary school [ah]
wait
wait
so if we met serious primary three
[oh] my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
[oh] my
[eh] but actually [kan]
but actually
our friendship is like random
[kan] because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other [kan]
close
yes then
!wow! you know I'm an introvert [kan] then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
ya
[oh] my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay [lah] okay [lah] let's not go that direction
[oh] about my boyfriend [eh]
okay [lah] okay [ah] I think
(mm)
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay (err) what was the last time that I told you about him [eh] do you remember
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
(err) eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because [kan] he (um) because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
[kan] so like (um)
his condition kind of worsen [tau]
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him [lah] got worse
he
something wrong (err) there's something wrong with his kidney
so
for the for the for the appointment
ya but then
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
throughout this whole (um)
so like
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
(mm) ya
ya because
like
(mm) okay
okay actually [kan] that time he asked me [tau]
okay
okay this is very cliche but
like
like like like you said relationship
but
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know [eh] because you know my soft spot for my ex [kan]
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to (err) my friend
that guy
[ah] like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my P_M_S my mood
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
[kan]
actually [kan] to think of it I think he was like my only best friend [tau]
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit [seh] double blow [ah] in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
(um) like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay [lah] I was a shitty person
then
[ah]
we bump into each other and then
keep like letters
pictures
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I basically I tried to flirt with him [tau]
no
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
it's he was my best friend yes but we we both now lead a different life
and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
(err) it was a funn~ not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
[oh] wait no or was it a date
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
I think so [lah] I think I can't remember where but
it was at a a station
ya
ya no
no no I mean like as in
then
asked a feedback
from him about me
I asked him I said
(err) what do you think of me when I was your girlfriend back then
said (um)
because that's me as a person that's my personality
but
ya so in a way after that whole conversation I apologise again [lah]
so it was all cool
at that point of time yes
but
I remembered my two relationship will my two exes
ya then kind of got me (um)
traumatised
seriously
he's just so
ya
there's a lot of things that I really want to change like
serious [seh] I shouldn't have been
playing that kind of game back then
do you think it's a crazy idea if ever
one day
I asked him out for a catch up session
[a'ah] [seh] recently I've been dreaming about him that's why I asked you this question
then (um)
ya
maybe
maybe his birthday is in january [tau]
ya
do you have any plans
ya
okay
[kan] [kan]
true
with someone shitty like me just kidding
okay
ya
ya [lah] ya [lah]
you can like do many many recordings for them
ya but
ya but I think for now
ya man tell me about it
next [ah] next
well I can write like a whole twelve series about you
you and your you and your don't don't get me started on your
your nonsense
okay (um)
you know I was wondering right
would you rather good looks or a fit body because I see like everybody
everybody especially now because we got N_S like coming up soon
everybody are like they want to train and what not
I never really got a difference between having good looks and a fit body so personally which one will you
prefer
are good looking then
you lucky [ah]
cause you because
you will get you will
you can train you can exercise and you can get there
you get what I mean
so to me it's like I would I would prefer good looks
just because
(um)
okay [lah] (err) I mean
make sense [oh] going off of that
(err)
because you were saying like [oh] live a long live long life and stuff like that right
then
I was just thinking about it like the other day
then like
(err)
you know how the emphasis is all about the environment there right so it's like there were some like (um)
note notes [lah] about (err) extinction and all that stuff
then I was wondering how would you how do you think that humans will eventually become extinct
we we will go extinct the question is how and when
that that that last point that you made
you know I (err)
you know the game plague
the one where like you spread the virus and stuff
how easy it was to like spread a virus in the world
(um)
the the the
we're so interconnected [lah] it's it's to the point where
we are moving around too much
not to say is bad because it's just
at the same time it's like too much of a good thing isn't good [lah]
that kind of thing
so
like if you think about it
there are like a lot of viruses in
africa
but
if and when the day comes that people end up a lot more people end up (um)
then
partly because they are used to it
they are used to like this kind of thing so genetically and also government wise they know how to handle it
but then the rest of us we live in like relatively cleaner relatively more like virus free places
ya so I feel like that would be the one way that we would all be extinct
you know that that
in my in my opinion [ah]
(err) too many wants not enough resources
like we want too many things [lah] but
if let's say we have
like like the population goes down to a more to a lower rate I feel like that would be better for us and also for the earth
you get what I mean
we will be like [eh]
food and water and all that stuff so now we can
build back up and all that
that's in my opinion [ah] I don't know
but ya
but to be fair I feel like humans are quite resilient it will be a bit hard for us to go extinct
okay but then
(err)
enough with that deep stuff
[ah] this one is
realistic kind supernatural no supernatural later that one is superpower no no
realistic realistic
that's what I mean
any kind of skill [lah] like any life skill don't need to be specific to soccer or anything
okay
I feel like
second skill is basically about managing stress right
that that's the best way to put it right
then your first one would be
confidence
confidence in public speaking
then your last one is
(err) let me go by one to three (err) first one is confident speaking
second one is managing stress
third one is (um)
the hardest of all the three
okay let me give you mine first mine would be
first one would definitely be managing stress like that one in this world
ya
exam school
just general life stress and all that
if you cannot handle it then you're done for [lah] especially if since you play sports you know
it's like the anxiety before some people get
personally right
I know people who get like adrenaline
(err)
very pumped up very excited
but to me is like
it's it's a bit more challenging because
you go for competition then you are nervous and then
you are worried you start thinking about all the different scenarios and all that stuff
and
like
so there's no there's no really any need there's not really any need [lah] to be very nervous and all that stuff
so that would be that one skill that I would want that ability to
manage the stress manage the anxiety like before an important thing or anything [lah] that kind cause to me in general day to day life I feel like I'm okay
like I'm not very stressful over everything
but when I feel like I've worked some people gain confidence because they know that they work very very hard for something right but then to me it's more it's more like the more I work for something
the more I feel nervous because
like I put in so much effort already I put in so much time
and then if I mess up now is like !wah! all that time wasted all that effort gone
you know
so
ya
that's that's that's that one that's that one skill that I would want
and then number two would be
!wah! actually
I mean if if okay
one one skill would be probably
ya [lah] I will the the second skill I will relate it to my running
like
I mean naturally [lah] I would want to be running I would want to like have that ability to run like all those top runners and all that stuff like ya
that's that's the one that I can think of because
(um)
the the better you get at something
the more confidence you have in yourself
so the more secure you are about who you are like okay
no matter what fails like no matter how bad I am at something I know at at the very least okay this is something that I'm solid at
it's like our safe place [ah] like it not only does it take our mind off work but it also builds our confidence in that aspect
then you are like okay I need to go and like do something else but let's say if you are if you are if you want to do something else but you are also not very good at that something
I would like to be good at some like very very good at something because
I feel that it would help me
in my own self confidence
in that sense ya so number one was (err) stress management number two would be to be very good at
(err) running
then number three I feel would be
(um)
don't be so direct
like like I shouldn't be very direct because sometimes
I just feel like
!aiya!
don't bother [lah] just say it just say it even though like the situation may not be right for it
but I just say what I think
and
all humans got flaws right
so
the thing is
especially older people they don't like it when you point out their flaws
I'm not the kind that will like tell indirectly to somebody then that somebody tell the somebody I will just tell you straight and a lot of people don't like that
ya so those are like my three skills that I would like
ya ya
okay one more [oh] yes
anything like anything in the world
you know
you wish for it and it comes that kind
(mm) okay that's true
anything
(uh)
(hmm)
stocks
okay for me right
I feel like the one thing I would want free of charge
would probably be food
and if you can have all the money in the world right
if I had all the money in the world I would feel like I don't need to work
so sudden all of a sudden you have like all this free time and then they are like !wah! I don't know what to do with it
so in my opinion right
if I were to have one thing that was free it would probably be food
not money or like or like the ability to buy stocks because
like
ya if you had you had if you had all the food in the world
if you could get any single food in the world
you can one of course you can feed yourself you can feed your family but
in a larger like extent
you can
which is I feel would grant me a sense of purpose [lah]
in that sense
so it would really
ya
so
that's for me
then (err)
(mm) [oh] ya just now you mentioned something about superpower
remember when I ask you the skill
so let's get let's get to that question if you had if you could have any just one but any single superpower what would you have
what would you want it to be
I feel like
you know
that's something that I feel so
I wouldn't I wouldn't put that as a superpower because I feel like machines can make that happen
but to me one superpower that I would have would probably be to
would probably be
the ability to
you know how batman is you you read comics
you know how batman is like known as the greatest detective
because of his ability to like
read situations read people and all that stuff
and like look for things and all that
that would be my that would be the one superpower that I want
that kind of like intellect that kind of ability
that kind of smarts that would be the one and that kind of ruthlessness also
then that will be like the kind of superpower that I would want I I can't really find a word for it [lah] but
ya
because with that you can you basically can control everything
ya you would be the one person who know you will know your your
your opponent's moves before they even do it
which is like quite cool [lah] in my opinion
ya ya
[oh] building on that
then what superpower what super since you watch comics what super
hero or supervillain would you want to be
just one
I read both [lah] so
can be any
I mean you know mine [lah] mine would probably be batman [lah]
he achieves what he wants to achieve
and but he also has certain morals that he doesn't
ya
so like in my opinion if you are talking about still being able to stay human
it will probably be batman
because then you don't you you yes you have to face the expectations like
(err) comic comic batman
is that
(err)
in my opinion it will be batman [lah]
ya ya (mm)
they are labelled as
he can be very like aloof
he can very he can be very like distant when he wants to be or he can be very controlling when he wants to be
put on you
I mean [oh] so basically it is that concept of with great ya [lah] like you said [lah] with great power comes great responsibility in a sense [lah] I mean in this sense it'll be
the higher the the higher you go in a certain thing the more expectations people like people expect you to be a certain way people expect you to like look a certain way do a certain way and all that stuff [lah] that's essentially what you saying
okay I mean
that's true
that's very true all of us all of us
okay very true
okay personally I feel like
I mean the most common one for me is
school [lah] like they they
everybody just has this idea that
like
I'm
a very fit I guess same as you
except that it is a
I I run and in the school like I I'm considered to be like the the one of the better ones [lah]
and I feel like
that's
that's not very accurate
and
somehow also place expectations on yourself like okay
I have to sort of live up to the expectation
ya [lah]
so it's like outside pressure but also you on the inside telling yourself
okay I need to make sure like I I look a certain way I do a certain way I
train properly and all that stuff
but
or like how come your muscles not as defined that kind then you are like [ah]
okay I need to I need to go back and I need to work harder that kind
so in a way it can be bad
but if
you you you
if you don't
if you take it in a different light
you feel
ya
that's for me personally
I don't know
I I
ya (mm)
(mm)
what would your ideal day in life be
what would your ideal day in life be
given that you get your dream occupation and all that stuff
I mean okay
the difference is like like in terms of
you want to help like people and all that stuff right
then
like
training people
(err)
it gives me the most joy
so it I don't really think of it as coaching or a job I just think of it as
something that I like to do
like if you are talking about ideal day
coaching
then
while I'm coaching I can also be training
you get so it's like
then I can like go and run with like my my students and all that stuff [lah] we can run together we can talk we can bond and all that stuff
it feels like
to me I don't know about other people [lah] but to me
I'm I as a student would be more motivated
or I as like an athlete will be more motivated if I see like my coach is also doing it you know like [eh] setting by example if coach can do it I also can do it I should be able to do it that kind you know so I feel like
ya
but ya
is is is
it's fun [lah]
okay I mean
okay okay the one part that you said that I felt was important is that you are doing it for like the enjoyment of it [lah] you are not doing it for the competitive aspect of it
ya that's that's
something that I feel
it's something that I would never do
I will always
like
like like the reason why I will want to continue training is to compete [lah] that kind
you know
like maybe because like genetics and stuff I've never really had any problem with keeping with staying healthy
but at the same time
I understand [lah] that some people don't have that part
ya so I get where you're coming from
start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character [lah]
but why can't she the be so why can't she be clear
okay
so new [sia]
[ah] (uh)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
clear about what he's getting
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
okay
(mm) because we haven't even consented to this relationship in the first place
cough up [lah] information
(mm)
(mm)
go into that yes
ya
okay
ya which you you might not but you might not agree [ah]
[ah] [ah] (mmhmm)
ya ya [lah] but I guess baby steps then after that
did you eh~ did you spec~ specifically say that
ya (mm)
(hmm)
[ah]
(mm)
[a'ah] [seh]
okay so
[oh] so just the informal ya
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
you said
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
okay
#dayah's# [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
so fed up [ah] this type of thing
I don't think he even thinks like this [lah]
[oh]
foresight [a'ah]
did you say that did you say
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
are you sure or not #salim# I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover

must take this action
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy

pushed or #zina# will be pulled down
(err) big personality how to say not big [lah] firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right

talk to #dayah#
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with #izat#
!huh! you talk about marriage to #izat# like what
this was before [lah]
seriously
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
ya but #zina# can also ask you the same then why and why you and #izat# is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and #izat# are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya [lah]
ya [lah] because also also #dayah# always clamps her down
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan

ya ya
#hidayah# is clamping her down [lah]
ya ya

not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that [eh] maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and then they no [lah] they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya [lah] but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months [what]

the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again [ah] where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again

they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe #tay# is from my alma mater [eh] she was from #yuan ching# secondary
no she was way way way much my senior [lah] but
it's like the school very proud of her [lah]
yes of course
#yuan ching#
she wouldn't (err) declare
(err) she you know fanfare [ah] because #yuan ching# is not really that you know famous school unless you know she's from raffles junior college or what [ah] then then she'll flaunt it
#yuan ching#
#yuan ching# ya
I wanted to go but you you don't
#amin#
but now COVID don't have already [lah]
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already [lah]
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no [lah] most of them are retired already
I think somebody which
he's a bit a bit bald
[eh] ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression [lah] I mean
they they have to retire [what] once they they hit their sixties
have the energy [lah]
professorship
ya [lah] I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
yes
yes I'm millennial [ah]
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch [lah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
even my brother is millennial
my brother #naz#
so #naz# is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation [lah]
no she she got (uh) she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot [lah] but
but if she can if she can you know (err) ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya [lah] but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation [lah] I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made (err)
make a profit [lah] but the thing is if she
ya [lah] about one point one million [lah] but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
(mm)
how much she bought it
but her one is at #simei# right
during that time
you can get that hou~ that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand (uh)
thirteen years ago
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand [lah]
!huh!
so just just
(uh) amber road
[ah]
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal [lah] because (err)
[oh] so new [lah]
well that's a risk
development
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah]
but her place second floor
what one point
[oh]
her main bedroom
[oh] cause so it's quite big [lah]
ya okay but
(uh huh)
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
#dasha# when she can save more money right
(mmhmm)
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person [what]
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a H_D_B or full
three room
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more [what] if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored [lah] then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means (err) in the embassy one is paying for her living space [eh] if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
I mean now okay [lah] maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya [lah] but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury apart~ (uh) apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense [what]
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people [lah]
say about thousand plus [ah] ya maybe [ah]
okay
if six person ya [lah] if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya [lah] make sense [lah]
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy [lah] one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy (err) H_D_B H_D_B is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya [lah] I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo [lah] so that
they are being sheltered [lah]
fixed condo
[ah]
[ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they (uh) being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but (err) when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference [ah] cause
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes (err) pe~ what drives what drives people
(mm)
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
(err) flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
(mmhmm)
how much
ya that's quite a lot
[oh] N_U_S [eh] so he's the degree [lah]
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh huh)
#eton# what's a #eton#
for who what what
so it's in U_K not in U_S not in singapore [lah]
[oh]
depend on the area [lah] depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese [leh]
he's (err) he knows (err) he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese (err) they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area [lah] maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the U_S so we have that the influence [ah]
(mm)
U_K !huh! russia
but is it recognized or not in singapore
(uh huh)
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
[oh] malaysian malaysia hospital [lah]
[oh] okay and then then okay [lah]
[ah]
[oh] why [ah]
wasted [kan]
medicine also medicine [what]
[oh]
[oh] okay
[eh] [oh] (err) #rundy# #rundy#
#rundy# #rundy#
(uh) ireland or scotland [ah]
ya
one of the U_K
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand [ah]
four hundred thousand
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya most I suggest
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait [ah] can remain thirteen fourteen
most of my friends
in singapore
(mm)
I think the highest I heard is H_O_D [jer] [lah]
so not not easy
but in in in
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback [ah]
(uh)
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge [ah]
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh)
I think ya [lah] because the the guys are not
no no the the
(err) secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
for the girls they
they're they're
[ah] because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which [ah] no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences [ah]
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option
jordan
cairo
#al-azhar# [lah]
then
(mmhmm)
[oh] really
okay then

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya that's actually quite
quite sad [lah]

unfair [lah] but
the amount of effort and they put
but in the end (err) she should've finish already right
(uh) why no good
egyptian arab spring arab
ya [lah] I mean
(mm) but
it's kind of sad [lah] that that #wani# that control all those things and then
let's say if if she's not recognise cannot get a good salary job then it's also quite
quite a pity [lah] but luckily the sister did land with parkway east which is quite good [lah] that you know

(mm)
(uh huh) ashtray [ah]

I think depends on
what's her appetite is [lah]
[eh]
well nevermind let her let her develop see which one she inclined to maybe she likes more sciences
depends [lah] in in the future we never knows because a lot of things also can can change [one]
but

I mean she's okay I mean not bad
but I think her malay is is better [lah] her malay is is picking up
[ah]
[ah]
ya but that one only when the all the [ah]
(mm) ya
(uh) [ah]
I think
work from home
so everything is at home so
that's why [lah] I decided to actually go out to eat
[oh] I didn't know it's only twenty minute
cause I would think that it's like two hours
#muay thai#
is not going to be there all the time [kan]
!wow!
[orh]
it's very tiring [lah]
this is during my secondary school time
I quit choir
to join badminton
and then I was in the girl's team
ya and then (um)
I join competition
but do you that (um) I only
I didn't actually fight with anyone like you know be in a match
and I already secured myself second place
ya exactly
(err) (hmm) apparently it's possible [lah]
!whoa!
that's a very
defined goal
in your life
stand
one other days in this [one] is like what everyday
like do this
everyday or like just certain days
no it's not two K it's very little actually I think it's because
the funny part is [kan]
when I search for jobs they actually want
people with experiences even though it's a
let's let's say it's a intern job
the intern job also they want experiences I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find
a starting job to get all these experiences
in a good company
actually
what I look for in a job [kan] it's not just financial stability
but more of like
I want to be in a in a company that
(err) that actually appreciates you for what you do
nowadays
especially in start ups
they
just literally
if this
job or experience is worth it because you are doing bits and pieces of everything
that's why I like I'm finding a job that actually
values
like
their employees [ah] that's very hard for me to find
my god
can I say something
so [kan]
(err) I was hired
and I have
(um) like a
specialist diploma
(err) diploma girl
her job scope changed her from doing graphic design to digital marketing and you know what's worse
she is the head of my team you know when she is younger
and no experience and I've been in that company for six months
so I feel like shit you know like honestly because
like I have the qualities like honestly I'm doing really well like
teach the marketing
how to even do like a video thing you know like I cannot [lah]
and she's not hired for it but
she's getting paid more you know like I'm getting way lesser and she's
I don't know it's it's damn weird
she's twenty
ya
yes
that's true
let's let's not talk about this topic [lah] let's just (uh) move on because like I find
this type of to~ (uh) topic [kan] like
it will never end
so what do you do now
like
what's your job scope
wait
so
you
telling me that
they don't really get
and then
like
while you're eating all these
how are they going to interact and then like
build on the social aspect
because I think the student care is there is to like
also like help them
not just academically [lah]
but more of like
mingling around with others
then if they can't do that then what will you do
this is going on
ya [lah]
so I guess they're trying to mould them into
being this type of
perfect person
but
because
ya like I said
how is
that gonna help them in a long run because
you will totally be affected by this and traumatised maybe
you know send me to student care
ya
you know
so
[ah] [lah]
my job scope
no [lah] just do bits and pieces of everything
ya [lah]
so
yesterday
!wah!
like she's having a lot of fun [jer]
very sweet [lah] I find
ya
actually
like
this christmas [kan]
anniversary
like literally on christmas
because ya he
he like
ask me out on christmas
like it's on a christmas
a bit a bit weird [lah] like
anniversary
[orh]
[orh]
we every month actually
celebrate the
like we literally go all out like we go eat expensive food
ya
!huh!
that is horrible actually
okay [lah] my boyfriend
okay okay [jer] [lah]
I think he's sweet
clingy
is the word for it
I think I'm the type
who
likes being clingy but I also have
to have the time alone
like to
to just get the energy back
I'm I'm
too used back then [lah] to be alone like being with friends
so when I was with him
when he was clingy I feel like
I'm being controlled
ya
ya that's true
I mean like
hopefully
ya
I agree with that everyone has their own timeline
so
like
how is
you and your family
actually
being the
eldest
you want to know why
they really like instill this list of
a list of responsibilities that I have to follow
then
like
they always me you have to lead
so like everything [lah] like academically wise
so that my brothers can
like follow the right path
ya and then my
brother's P_S_L_E just came out
like
ya
and
like
ya it's it's
different [lah] like you can see
like as the years goes by my parents don't really care
about like
academic
like not as
how it used to be for me
!wow!
(um) you have to take
the scolding
like
just take it with a pinch of salt
like you are who you are so
[ah]
so sweet
(uh huh)
a sign [lah] actual
(um)
ya but then he ended up passing away
ya when I was young
so I think what you can do [kan] is
ber~
[ah]
(mm)
!aduh!
salad [jer]
the nutrition
nu~ nutrition site
is not there
then how are you going to make sure like the money that you spend on is worth
especially if you buy a lot at one go
ya
I think
it's a lot of work
like there's so many things you cannot juggle at one time
and for those who cannot multitask or or like
plan the days where a weeks well
confirm will have a hard time coping
I don't know anything about the twenty two curse
but then
I feel like
everything
it's not free [lah]
in the end
you have to work hard for it even if it's
small little things
even like let's say happiness within family
you have to work hard
to put in time effort even money
like sometimes I feel to have the happiness in family can have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family so really balance everything
sometime I feel
to have the happiness in family [kan] you have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family
so
really balance is everything
!huh!
bus stop
don't want to take responsible for him
that is
really cruel
but I think like
there must be some problems within the family
like rooted deep inside their family in order for this to happen
how you treat your parents is how you're teaching your your kids to treat you
I find that very
like
like when we grow old
like you know because my mum's
mother
so with my grandma on my mum side
I kind of
that we won't even know
so nowadays I've been trying to like
just some simple talks
and she's
she refuse to stay at home
like she's
she has
has she has been going out
like
literally like working studying all these kind of stuff
she's too used to walking out
so like
then she
because of corona then like
the
so she
like weekday she don't actually
but then she still go out
what the heck
like
your leg
actually I
seventy to eighty
around
C_P_F [eh] I don't know how old
which C_P_F [ah]
ya yes
ya she
like
you work your whole entire life
you know
and like not like
for her
I think (um)
then
scenery
you
you know what's funny
even
I find
like you know those bricks
I will take photos of those bricks
an (err) we like !whoa!
like I don't know I I think like
very simple
like
I don't even like
tea is not my thing
but then I I
keep thinking about U_K it's like
[oh] ya the ferris wheel the houses
there's something that is
calling out to me
true [lah]
that's true
now that
economy
depends on them also
and I think
birth rate
we cannot do anything about it [lah]
I mean
I have seen
would this be something I would want
in the future
they look like
they're struggling
like
you look at these families
and then you like
they they really like
like
are they doing well
like
especially when you see them
in public
you wonder about their well being
is it weird that I think that way
but I think
you can see like they're
they're okay
like the kids are like happy and everything I think a fam~ a big happy family is
something
I would want in the future honestly
rely on
maid
I I think like
in the future right okay
the thing that is driving me to work hard [kan]
is that
I don't have in the future if I don't work work well
I can just get a maid
is that weird
like
so I've been living with a maid
so like if
I have that taken away from me
I don't know how to cook I don't how to clean
so if I have kids in the future
hopefully I can get into a university
I have been
financially
ya
ya
hopefully S_M_U [ah] like
ya
actually I have
find all these like
but I do have a
plan in mind
maybe that's why I
you know took a break
I
I took like a one year break
before I start
working
you have to know
so
good thing that actually found something that I want to try out
in that area
ya
I also
that one year right
university
and then
I here waiting one more year to start on my degree
is that weird
that one year gap
like
put in effort to really go all out [kan]
I would have been so much happier
I do feel depressed when I think of it
and it makes me sad
I didn't know you took a one year break also
ya I thought you were studying or working
november [jer] [pe] you know
I
like literally
no
I bet you didn't know that
ya
my savings I used to have savings
yes
that's true
that's what I've been looking at
like to get my experiences and maybe use that as one of the factors to why they should
accept me to the university [lah]
!wow!
thank you
ya
that's the thing I don't know how to look at their courses
like I know what I want to do but I don't know like you know this
honours thing and then what minor
I hoping to get marketing
ya
ya [lah]
like
seriously
just because we have many experiences with different companies
like
okay like it also depends on the company they how they think
you have a lot of experiences
in that sense
you can help the company
the future company
in all these
areas
like maybe to improve you know
better
you know like I don't know like turn over rate
like lesser or something you know like
it's hard [lah]
to to know how does the hiring works
they are not okay with
is
categorised under job hoppers
so how are you supposed to be like a
graduate
with already experiences
like let's say they are looking for
did you see this advertisement job advertisement
they say they want someone in the twenties
but with like ten years of experience
ya that it was like going around in on the internet for awhile like
you expect to be like
ten plus like in your teens
and already start working or something
I have no idea
that's one of my wish
that's one of my wish [lah] in life like
I just want to have a job
that I'm happy to wake up to
I think
it's really hard to find
it's also depends on your mentality
how you have
like what's your outlook of life
which
is hard to change honestly
illegal
illegal movies I don't know [lah] no [lah] it's not illegal it's more of like they uploaded on internet let let's say I come upon to it you know
and then I'll be interested in it and then
you know I've I've watch all the
conjuring series
ya
no I don't
stranger things
it's good
like okay like in in my
in my
it's it's
they're kids
so they're cute
like
like what they do is like something we can
relate to
I think everything is nicer with someone else
it's okay you'll
god has
plans for you
confirm
I can see
I can foresee you being happy in the future [lah]
so
okay back
to stranger things
but
what
caught me caught my attention until like
at first okay I think they will start because of the hype
then you get the fun out of it because
you kind of have this friendship with them so like it's more of like
quit the game because
you have friends
to be there for you already
so like if you cut
the game out your life [kan]
you're cutting
ya
I
on my P_S four
overcome
I
the younger one
youngest
invest
in a game
like like literally okay let's
you don't have to buy a P_S four you can buy a switch
I think that's
the easier way that you save money
eventually if you were to play play nation all the time
the invest on
U_O_B
rely on dividends
actually I not so sure
okay [lah]
currently I haven't get my N_S letter [lah] but
(um)
(err)
like to push myself with my friends so
fit body more important for me [lah] over good looks but
(err)
if I had to pick one then
how about you
(err)
as long as we know diet properly we train hard like we can get we can get the the fit body [lah] but for good looks (err) if your face is a certain way then we we can't change it [what] so it's all down to genetics
(err)
(err) to fit body
(err) hopefully [lah] can you know live a healthier life and (err) not have any like
(err)
!wah! your question so deep
so
I I feel like maybe you know they always talk about the ice caps melting all this
ya
so
but if you look at other countries (um) a bit more difficult to control [lah] especially if the country is very big right and
(err) maybe they are more how to say like social like
could be a reason [lah] if let's say like scientists (err) cannot find the cure or like the vaccine in time
then I feel like
how about you what you think
you know from all this (err)
hunger and starvation maybe like
(err) people will like the population will eventually get reduced [lah] cause
(um)
if if this I mean don't know [lah] maybe if like this in the whole world not just africa [lah] of course other countries also you see the
(mm) ya ya
supernatural kind or it's like a realistic kind of like
[oh]
(mm) (err)
I mean
better like not say change myself [lah] but like (err) how to say like relate to them and like
(err) whenever I have my social interactions with people and all that I can
adapt accordingly [lah]
it takes a while a long time to to pick up and build up at until you are at a good level [lah]
then maybe another skill would be like
(err)
like the kind (err) it comes together with like
(err) performance because I also play the drums right then I have a band so
like (um)
(err) that kind I I hope like I can improve my confidence [lah] I mean is (err) it's not really a skill maybe is more of a trait but
(err) then
it's it's good [lah] in the long term it can help me in many many situations in life
is more towards (um)
like
(err)
because these are things that will appreciate in value and
you know I can I can just (err) accumulate my wealth from it because since like you said [lah] in the condition given is that
so like
(err)
increase my wealth from there [lah] whenever the stock market go up I can just (err) sell it if not I just hold on to it [lah] until the value is a good time to sell [lah]
ya
ya
for me [ah] probably
ability to teleport [lah]
it no matter how we try to maximise our time
like ultimately travelling takes a long a long time [lah] like
even then like
is is not a problem [lah] you can you can do it at your at your like your own time you save so much time and
like maybe their daily commute takes a total of four hours out of their day you know
like
if the ability to teleport I feel is a is a very good superpower [lah] I mean
maybe we don't see it much in movies like (err) maybe people like more of like a a strength or something like
but I feel like this is a small small little thing [lah] that
(err) would would benefit like
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(err)
sometimes when you have like
I mean they always say [lah] with great power comes great responsibility [kan] so like
(um)
(um)
I feel like it's beneficial [lah] because like I can I can still live my life and stuff as as per normal
this (err) insane amount of strength that how hulk has
ya
(mm)
I mean
(err) I play a lot of sports and all that I love to gym you know
but
like
(err) whatever the case [lah] basically
whenever I am down then like or I am not able to perform at my
highest potential highest (err) performance [lah]
I
I feel like because of this label like I have to always like
they all look up to me as this (err) strong fit buff guy then
(um)
from a physique aspect like in terms of looks also like
these so called good label can be (um)
will come after you [lah] because it is like it puts a lot of like high pressure on yourself
is down [lah] like
ya
so when you go into the spiral then (um)
(err) just lay down in bed just like
like
(um) this this this good label of being this fit guy this strong guy buff guy good look [ah] like good like physical look
all (err)
they just (err) placed on me [lah] ya
okay [lah]
that's one but
(um) of course devote some portion of day to the person [lah] like
(err) partner
like
so
I mean
my my day will most likely be like
(err) going to work and all that then like
(err) I I still like to keep fit [lah] as I grow older so (um)
if possible
(err)
ideally if I can become like a private sports therapist then physiotherapist then I can help
(err) athletes who
who like because I was I'm now an athlete like
to help all all these athletes and ensure that they are able to perform at their
when it's fully recovered you can perform better you can push yourself or
it's a it's a thing [lah] I feel like
(err)
very very important to you know (err) commit yourself to the other person
of course it will include cost [lah] but you are you are willing to do
whatever it takes to maintain that relationship with the person [lah] so that would be that would be ideal for me [lah] ya
(err) ya then
I feel [lah] that would be ideal for me [lah] because it's something I really enjoy and it
(err)
ya
but
(err) more visible as a group
it should be it should be fine [lah] ya anyway like
like
your muscle will build up but
(err)
especially if it's like a a decently long ride [lah]
it takes time [lah] so like
ideally if my working hours not too long then I can squeeze these two in (err)
cycling gym and also like time for family and like
(err) girlfriend [lah] ya
my day (um)
then the queue outside to enter is so long cause right now is COVID right like you know
so the maximum number of people to be inside the store is like only twenty five
and it's black friday so
people like trying to get in so even if I tell them (uh) I'm sorry [lah] you cannot
then they just keep doing the annoyed face
but the I'm just saying [ah] not not not really good not a good day how about you

just like
of course like I miss most is like the different
like currency you know like anything it's just anything and everything is cheaper there
like it's in singapore you know the everything is much more expensive so you can't spent that much
you have to be like save save a bit
(um) I don't really
have a favourite like
but I know you're more into fashion [kan]
so actually how about you just tell me like actually what kind of like
fashion you're into right now
like koreans are known for their skin
you know like their clear skin
and it's like actually cheaper to buy there is cause they they sell it like in bundles and like there's always promotion on their items
but I but like they are also known for their fashion but I didn't like I'm not into it so I didn't buy a lot of like their shoes or like clothing
so it was like wasted [lah] I I didn't also visit all their
attractions much

instead of being quiet he he just like get angry that's when like he but he looks cute like I find it cute

it's okay [lah] anime is like a way to like it's a getaway from like real life
(hmm) before anime actually I used to watch K drama like you know K drama

favourite song from who
[orh] if A pink like no I listen to most of their songs like I just keep up with all their songs
there's no like favourites [lah] actually because all their song is nice very catchy
[oh] no no [lah] I just found it inside my wardrobe
like what is even the difference between soccer and football
!huh! food (mm) I'm not so sure [lah] a thing about me is I don't have like favourite favourite thing like
I like I like I don't like I don't like
like I don't know I don't believe in favourite
why you have is it
me
(mm)
I li~ like I say [lah] like I
eat what add stuff is it
[oh] it's not like I don't eat
the go-to is sure McDonald's [lah]
[oh] ya talking about samurai burger right now they they they bring back samurai burger !wah! I was so excited during COVID cause usually they
bring out in like mid
of the year
like because of COVID they have like McDonald was close
so now that they open it they bring back samurai I was so happy like I think I ate it twice already this week
but if like their menu
I usually go for the angus burger
it's like a upgraded version of cheeseburger like you how about you what what is your go-to menu at McDonald's
at the end of the day I'll still go for like home-cooked meals
Jollibee [oh] my god Jollibee is a Jollibee is a filipino
fast food right
Adam's Corner
Adam's Corner
[oh] you suggest me to eat at Adam's Corner there
!wah!
then what what do you suggest me eating there
water chestnut
so actually you go botanic garden what do you do cause personally
I don't really like going there [lah] cause more of nature so many insects
I (um) my sister she used to [lah] she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong [lah]
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch T_V
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
if you not a if you just like (um) afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school !haiyo!
!huh!
!wow! I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try [lah] try to be on time [lah] it's school it's important
me graduate
I started school (err) this year april
so it's only been how many months
(uh) few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
(hmm) looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so [lah]
then [eh] you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
[oh]
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
(mm) I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
C_C_A also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your C_C_A during secondary school
!wow! then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
(uh) that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
(uh) no I take care of myself very well
(um) like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay [lah] since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
[oh] really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
[oh] good [lah]
(hmm) nevermind [lah]
like
right now [oh] you heard about like
(uh) I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
[oh]
it's okay [lah] we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
(uh) I really
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good [lah] you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
!wah! I really I like [oh] yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know (uh)
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
[ah] every month but now
like I heard like ru~ like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
[oh] !wah! everything you want to do with your friend [ah] then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
[oh] (uh) you heard talking about like M_B_S and all you heard about like
(uh) government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure [lah] but like what it can be use for
only like c~ certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or U_S_S you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
relax what you so stress about
!wah! talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like (uh) allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
swim [oh] (uh) have you like you know (uh) #sentosa# also there's a lot of like
(uh) activities to do like the luge or the bungee jumping have you tried before
height I've tried a lot of them that I mentioned actually

it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
(uh) trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because (uh) apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same [lah]
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at U_S_S I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
(uh) I think might as well you just take a train
I guess for you [lah]
ya maybe some things are not meant for you to do but if not you can always go to other country to try and experience it
are you sure
like
K maybe you can try [lah] I don't want to like crush your dreams you know
!wow! that must be fascinating to be as a child to know like every car brands !huh!

enjoy life already
ya I agree

rain before sunshine
but just a bit more let's let this COVID pass and then we can get back our good jobs
(mm) (mm)
ya can't wait can't wait to get like
(uh) like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay [lah] let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much
we just do our part we focus on our
career or our education
then I'm sure things will be better for us
okay
it's really nice like talking to you all about this like
but it's not really budget [what] it's okay [lah]
ya
it's
in singapore
nobody is going to stare at your body [lah]

and then the angsty (err)
no the angst~

but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that #dulan# face
annoying [sia] he's going to give you even more #dulan# face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the (err) I don't know he's tha~ but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know [ah] the person is like the s~ the nephew or [eh] no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue [lah]
ya ya
ya ya
ya
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you be~ from behind you lik~
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay [lah]
we
was it we #dabao#
no before we came before we ca~ [ah] (err)
I
ya ya
ya so is like
(err) what's that called it's nice [oh] but the indo food there is not bad also after
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten K_M (err) ten K_M every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years [lah] so she she scared already (err) ya
so had try [lor] try and walk (err) ten ten ten K_M everyday if not like ya
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age [ah] then you look back at your l~ at your food intake
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food [leh] she s~
no she has (um) (err) high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now [what] right like
last time he got juggle his intake [meh]
exercise [ah]
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty [mah] like th~ the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
(uh) really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that [one] cannot I ver~ I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
e~ but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is th~ it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
(mm)
[oh] he cannot take I_P_P_T because of this but he's fit [what]
[ah] okay okay
ya
!wow! okay that is quite #sian# cause like I see him exercise so much and (err) workout so much and then
ya sugar ac~ sugar level quite easy to maintain [one] as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff [lah] because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar [what] so y~ ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know [ah] don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically l~ lose the chloes~
ya
[oh] shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know the~ without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this ea~ th~ eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first (uh) like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why !wow! there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but [oh] ya [oh] wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was (err) what's that called [ah]
with like I think is a vegetarian meal [lah] so like
no like (err) there's (err) you know like those kind that looks like #mala# but I don't think it's #mala# it looks like (err) it's soya sauce so it has like
ya everybody now want to be in (err) healthy lifestyle (err) why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning s~ names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one (err) ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya and I and then y~ we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then i~ like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like [eh] #bo# #jio#
no when people when people #jio# you you not like you will reply [what]
ya
not you [lah] I mean like other people people !alamak!
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online [lah] it's like everybody
but then som~ some people will C_S_I your life like
crazy it's scary [lah] if you [ah] used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we (err)
(err)
no the dress that I show you the whi~ the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot (err)
!aiya!
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very #sian# because I miss it (ugh)
it is it's available but it's like (ugh)
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like !aiya!
[ah] yes it must not be cause otherwise G_G
(err) so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like e~ for the black [one] can wear when we go out but then for the white [one] maybe wear to like wedding
(err) thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the b~ white and black dress but it's like a lot (ugh)
(err) in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep [mah]
same
not not about options or design [eh] like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb [ah]
ya just
ye~
no [lah] it's not that th~ it's not that #jialat# [what]
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years (err) if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I y~ I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I u~
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one [ah]
for me
I think
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I ke~ can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel [lah] if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
[ha] not so #jialat# like expand too much right (err) then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I~ I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive [one] is like [oh] my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
di~ much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
[oh] let's go see (err) universal traveller the winter shop
w~ I don't know where we can just go [lah] walk down the road are we still going to the rich and good cake shop

this [one] need to clap clap for him cause he just like bring the bike and leave it there I don't know how long already
seriously
apparently the neck still pain [eh] he's like he said there's this weird feeling I'm like what is weird feeling it's like I don't know it's a bit weird I'm like !huh! but it's one week already and it's not even an invasive treatment why would your neck be aching more (uh) like one week after when it's just supposedly an injection
no that's the thing I don't know when is the follow up (err) follow up appointment the (uh) I don't know
anyway now he probably quite #kanchiong# no haven't #kanchiong# yet because he will only #kanchiong# like literally twelve hours before the exam he has two papers one on wednesday one on thursday
that's why he a~ actually he very busy so that's why he say (uh) we go buy cake after your exam I'm like nope I'm gonna go but it today unless the cake don't have an e~ ya if the cake don't have then I said sad okay [lah] then we we we buy another time

really [orh]
[oh] last year
no [oh] ya and also the the other one the six six five
ya that was october ya
ya
I think [ah] everybody must be crazily booking all the tour~ tourist attraction now because of the kids who are all stuck at home and you cannot
is the is your sister one of those #kiasu# people who book way in advance
advance [what]
but she never book like staycay or anything [meh] usually if she cannot travel she will staycay [what]
expensive [leh] I tried checking for new year eve the staycay is expensive
ya
but I thought this year don't have they only have (uh) neighbourhood fireworks
ya it's like you staycay in town to have fireworks in the neighbourhood it's quite
really but cannot see fireworks [what] from orchard
[ah] ya [lah] but you know like
crazy #siao# like the the there wer~ there's this (err) new hotel called laguna work (err) it's a golf club [lah] so it's new
(uh) near EXPO like be~ somewhere behind EXPO it's a golf club [ah] [ah] (err) so I was checking when they first open I think the room rates were three hundred plus to four hundred then I'm like that's expensive right
and then I check again it's six hundred six hundred
I mean fullerton bay six hundred is like okay but th~ because fullerton bay is like in the middle of the is it called singapore river ya singapore river or sea whatever [lah] and (err)
what's that called
but this [one] six hundred golf club also got no view o~ okay [lah]
[eh] but it's quite near EXPO and all the what's that place called [ah] #changi# city point
ya
no it's a ho~ is it hotel ya gold club [ah] ya like resort [ah]
why as in
(uh) ya
please [lah] crowne plaza #changi# is four hundred fifty for normal room
(uh) ya but also now no planes fly as in very little not like you can watch
what
but I wanna see cause the room looks nice you k~
okay I just like then I already see all the hotels in singapore
is like
ya it's nice [leh] but like !aiya! I'm not gonna spend that much fri~ that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong [one] they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia [one] and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in K_L and obviously thailand is a standard [one] [lah] a
a~ what we opening office in K_L but they're gonna use (err) they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like s~ cordon off and use it [lah]
but is
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not [lah]
[eh] I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open a~ (err) an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
above table under table whatever [lah] wherever
ya but once we sh~ once okay [lah] not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
[ah] okay [lah] not immediately maybe you have to wait until like (err) I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so [leh] they say leisure tra~
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's ve~ it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't (um) like if you don't get tested then okay [lah] basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it l~ it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I [ah] you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in U_S [lah] like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the ci~ major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also U_S has about what five hundred and twenty million people
u~ that that day #pedi# said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free [what] t~ to watch so like they (um) what's that called they were saying like (err) please do not travel and to minimise the spread [ah] the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at (err) it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you n~ you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are #kiasu# usually (err) #kiasu# #kiasi# don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
but you will immediately be fined [what] not [meh]
!chey! they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail [meh] like no no jail like
!aiya! whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a s~ more serious
it's like how
the india [one] [ah]
no but look at
i~
isn't it like (err) what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
ya
p~
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small [what] even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five [what]
so you wear mask at all times at your table
[ah] that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like !huh! but we one person [what] what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone [lah] I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
that's true have you seen
the rest ne~ never mind [lah]
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that [one]
[eh] the the the #khatib# new play~ (err) playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
#khatib# SAFRA [ah] ya the one (uh) jason went the vet~ the
HomeTeam #khatib# HomeTeam N_S at #khatib# i~ I told you before
(uh) ya but (uh) maybe not not when (uh) got menses
okay that [one] ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more res~
nope b~ once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you o~ you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
(err) okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different [lah] I think you next time shouldn't
no
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like [oh] you're so caring I'm like what the hell
(err)
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite #kaypoh# [what] no [meh]
seriously
okay cause like if if
is it the fat boy #anas#
see that's why you have all these people writing in on like chinese page about how
not every wife wants to play game [what]
who is asking who like the
[orh] it works both ways
no [what] that's why if both per~ parties have to have their own [ah]
so they
but
they don't talk during the game there but y~ you
ya so wait you can hear you can hear them talking to their kid in the background while they're playing the game
okay
[ah] [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
okay
[orh] ya [lah]
okay
that is like what okay (err)
[eh] but surprisingly [leh] the SIM card that I got in turkey like when we drove for that god knows how many thousand kilometres it work
[ah]
ya
[ah]
ya
!huh!
okay
ya because the turkey SIM card was not bad [leh] I
ya you know what my brother tried my brother mind game with like how you play I don't know what he play [lah] we the a friend in singapore on the freaking van [ah]
e~ he's like okay I'm gonna try and play games see whether the reception can or not I'm like can't you don't be crazy why you playing game when you're in turkey on the road and he's in singapore
yup so I think maybe you might do that if you go road trip
ya and the reception is terrible [what] like it will be unstable so like
ya [lah] you play you play for a bit you sleep for a bit and then you see how it is [lah]
ya
it's like [oh] I schedule a pap smear
I d~ think in december I don't remember and also like (err) what's that thing called [ah]
flu jab
why [ah]
[oh] are they gonna rip me apart
[oh]
!huh!
what
no no I went to the toilet
but then again [kan] when you think about it [kan] (err)
I think
I thi~ I think
(err) you know our body has muscles there so technically it can stretch if you not forcing it like to stretch a~ o~ o~ it [ah]
at your vagina or cervix
okay
okay fine that [one] government subsidy government government paid a bit right
government should pay full not pay a bit
(err) [oh] my god
ya the older people all have [lah] peop~
[oh] ya ya the fibroid

everybody e~ thinks like [oh] this person single mum is it
ya
#siao# [lah] thi~
a spotify or
[ah]
ya
[eh] I talking about this (um)
I don't know whether I told you but (err) so like th~ (uh) I watched Tiktok videos right so tik~ in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
but the thing is
ya I do~ like why would you why would you be preg~ why would you give birth at fourteen okay [lah] but I think the U_S is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
!huh!
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
!ee! but then it has no rubber at the side i~
ya
so it's like
[oh] no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
but it's just like I don't know it
(err) ya U_S is a big country everything is possible not like
not like singapore like you'll be probably damned in like you don't get help and everything

(um)
okay thank you thank you
ya of course I need to make sure that it's all covered
I very self-conscious about my body
ya so the thing is now y~ you have wearing masks right he can't really see how our faces look like all or our facial expression so I think it's fine
no no but (err) okay [lah] that time I order also he he got my order quite well so okay [lah] be~
it's funny how like this is one of our first few time seeing a male
shopkeeper
I I prefer it that way seriously because ya cause if not it's causing inconvenience to other people
no like you eating people starring is fine but if you were to eat and laugh and like [jer] take your own damn sweet time yes you deserve to be skewered
I think that time the first few times that we went was when we were in school and it was no no it was after lunch hour
okay either way is before or after lunch hour it's not during lunch hour so you can still eat and talk ya

(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)

I know right ya
need to rethink my life decisions you know now that I'm going to be thirty one soon

exactly ya so it's really choosing your battles [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) of course ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)

[oh] okay okay
so they have an office there [lah] actually
ya it's true
sure [lor]
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) understand understand
but there are some states just living in denial
(mm)
natur~ [ah] natural selection
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
no no no jail
why would you wanna jail them
you cannot jail people immediately just for that one incident [what]
[ah]
you think these people got no money [meh] to pay
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
screen divider for every table and then when you're at your table you must wear mask at all times
so they have certain measu~ measures [lah]
ya except when I eat [lah]
[orh]
ya so there's there's rules and regulation [lah] it's not like they just say okay maximum fifty do whatever you want no you still have certain things that you have to follow
(mm)
ya must wear in case like people from the other (um) you know rooms come in to talk to you and all that and then you don't have your mask on it's really to reduce the chances of you ex~ [ah] getting that [lah]
(mm)
but the mask is the cause of breakouts
l~ it's like I have really dry skin on my chin I'm so annoyed [oh] my god
the below the eyes cannot make it [lah] [ah]
okay I don't mind going there
of course of course of course
no I'll be like yes this is the time for me to show my skills of climbing away from responsibility
(uh)
th~ then I will avoid like now you see me now you can't
n~ arrow at work okay [lah] it's still it's part of my job but arrow other things in life and I'm actually quite good at it I'm good at manoeuvring my way out of this situations
thanks thanks
I mean like I can arrow out of so many situation until people go back to the person they broke up with
it's it's the same skill
aha
[ah] same man
!aww!
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya accept me for who I am
(ugh)
I'm just saying it works both ways
(mm)
ya
no they don't talk [lah] during the game
no I'm talking about different types of people I was talking about my previous clan
[ah] so they know how to
ya ya ya ya [ah] [ah]
ya
[ah]
then like and then I'll be like
#adela# I
[ah]
it's really a big country problem you know like for us it's just so easy
they also experience bad reception [leh] and then they keep changing because for them is they don't use line they use top up so they can change telco every now and then [kan]
ya
video
#mashallah#
cause I need to know how long is the road trip going to be if it's gonna be like for eight hours long obviously I'm not gonna game because I need my phone to be alive
(mm) (mm)
!oi!
[oh] really when
all the best girl
okay
[oh] my god girl have fun with the pap smear man it hurts like a bitch
[oh] my god it was painful I was like just
[oh] my god i~ i~
[ah]
feel so hurt
[eh] but it really hurts [ah] it really hurts and the doctor
it's everyone what but the good side of it is is once every five years
okay you do it now five years later then you think about it
not fist [lah]
what do you mean by lube
[oh] lube L U B E no no no no it's not it's not about lube
then to open need it is ya so the open part is the one that's painful that [one] they will always use it
do you just like
no no it's once every five years so it's really good like I've checked then they said mine is negative so okay [lah]
ya
it depends [lah] like I have high tolerance for pain and I actually like
ya ya correct
(mm) (mm)
ya so no worry [lah] I think should be okay
ya even my mum did pap smear
no actually pap smear that time cause wanted to check (err) about her the ovaries her uterus
then I was like
and then the lady just th~ the reception's like madam #fadilah# I was like miss
ya single mum or what the husband is just not caring enough to accompany her and all that
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm) and she's really young I mean I was sitting beside
and but I had my ears plugged but
[ah] Spotify off
and
ya and the~ but the the girl was crying and the mum said it's okay we wait for what happens after this and then we'll figure out what we'll do after that okay
ya
so like then I didn't say [lah] I just keep quiet cause I I'm supposed to be listening to music remember
ya
but ya it was like interesting [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya you very common
damn girl
damn damn
[eh] [eh]
fif~ (mm)
seventeen
(mm) (mm)
I h~ I h~ no okay [lah] I I think that point of time I was like I need to get the top five in class you know that kind of thing like
ya [oh] my god
but I feel like for them like sexual edu~ education had to start like really early you know
then throw outside [lah]
not strong [ah]
it won't it's like quite tight so
like if you~ you're not ready to have a child then do something about it like make sure you don't conceive
ya
ya so I think a safe bet would be like after you done that surgical procedure right maybe you wait like a month first and then after that you or maybe after on~ menstrual cycle
(mm) (mm)
ya
o~
[orh] okay
I mean it's good [lah] then she has options you know that kind of thing
b~ catch ball [mah] that's why go~
[oh] my god
[oh] my god
but it's quite worrying [ah] I I think it's happening in singapore it's just that we are not
very conservative [ah] mindset
damn girl where do you get access
(mm)
(uh) (uh)
(mm)
[oh]
[orh]
(mm)
(uh) (uh)
[a'ah] [lah]

(mm)
(uh) (uh) I mean
(uh) I think it was like

I don't think that's going to work in fact
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
good luck to you [eh]
(uh) (uh) I'm like
at this point I don't know whether he's trying to make it funny [ah]
if I can if I can make you smile by making this funny why not
ya that little spark of happiness you know
two so according to ministry of health (uh) we cannot have face to face interaction with (um)
the patients [lah] the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
so ya [lah] that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was (um) they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
(ugh) so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good (um)
so I mean there are different things that we
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined (um)
(uh) how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
you think so
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
[oh] that's very soon
[ah] so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff (um) and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families (um) with their expenses
next year [lah] next year when we can
so
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
(um) they bring in
ya
so
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
okay okay okay now I understand
[ah]
(mm)
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm) ya okay
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] ya ya ya ya
[oh] okay
for the adoption drive
okay okay okay ya
ya
okay ya
okay
okay
(mm)
newborn okay newborn cats [jer] [lah]
like for everything
(mm)
S_P_C_A has a clinic
okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
so only only donations from from people from the public
!wow!
[ah] okay ya
(mm)
like (uh)
P_H property development (uh)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
so what does S_P_C_A have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
that they know
all these (uh) animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
(mm)
where are the pythons
no I don't know
(mm)
ya ya
no it's your skin
(uh) the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
hello this is art [ah] by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a ve~ (um) a a young and
really up and coming artist and
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
the lorries ya so there's
!huh!
(uh)
[ah]
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm) okay
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
[oh] I didn't know that
[oh]
who puts up these these signs
[oh] say
(mm)
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore (uh) even
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while (um) ya
it's just the regular birds the #minahs# the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
yes
(mm) (mm)
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens [kan] not like before
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
like different kinds of otters
okay
what is that what fan club
this is this sounds too
they're so cute they really are very cute
the ones that went to #serangoon# road
(uh) ya
okay
(mm)
sausage sausage
(mm)
I didn't know about that
is do they like
[ah] okay
how do they
#serangoon#
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
[oh] okay
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
(mm)
snakes of course
(um) we had our chickens and
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
okay that's new to me
(mm) (mm)
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves [kan]
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
(mm)
[ah]
I remember this a few months ago was it a cobra or a python or something
!huh!
what
the snake ate the cat
but but
but now we have less and less
so [a'ah]
okay hi #azli# yes and we both of us are (um) married couple
we are partners for our whole entire life as what we know and we wanted to talk about our marriage now
yes
ya so we are here to talk about our marriage so a few questions about one thing about you and me one is like do we have plan and preparation because for what I know that back then
we don't have plan yes I have plan that I want to get before
planning no don't have plannings so when you actually say I say [oh] automatically I said yes [one] so but for you right do you have a plan before you want to get married to me like [ah] because for what they know they say you must have the five Cs
(uh) condo credit card car and whatever the C [lah] but then
when I get married to you right I I really don't think about all those C
I just think let's get married
done
but okay so for you right that time do you have a plan or preparation like why you want to get married to me and or and do you have a plan like (um) like what you want to do when we get married
will be like [oh] no this one [lah]
he cannot I already [mah] so you say that you end up
so when that time when (um) it was my turn right (um) I wasn't really like preparing anything like do I need to prepare myself like (um) does he have a job or stuff like that because that time when you actually (um) proposed to me
you just graduated from poly because the things that our age is catching up [ah] that time we were already like twenty seven I think
because one thing for sure he is mature already he is someone that is mature to me he is someone that is mature like (uh) knows (um) a lot of things
a lot of things know in basic work and also it what he wants to do in life he know to but I think for planning something he still leave it up to me correct like for example when you went to get the house
[ha] decision like for example when you want to get a house I decided that we would we should get a house before we get married [ah]
because of the H_D_B and the B_T_O right that one all (um) we we prepare ourselves yes (uh) I'm more of a person who plans so that time even our our financial or our finance for our wedding things also
(uh) we all all our by ourself [lah]
okay
yes
the price was actually
because one thing is like (um) they say it in (um)
they they actually translate from malay to english through google correct so that's one of the reason why we don't want we don't want to take them [ah] then we tell them so many times also they don't want to listen so eventually at the end of the day we I I was so fed up I just
and then they cannot give me anything like that's it okay nevermind I guess
cancel ya call it a day
ya call it
so that time I think (uh) we we just say okay nevermind we actually spend hundred dollars [eh] I was about to fork out everything [eh] to tell them okay I pay you everything by today but then thank god I didn't [eh] I was actually thanks to
ya because I trust them so much
but then (uh) at the end of the day we eventually we do our own card
she was so not happy with my design you he actually do his own card and I do my own card
yes actually my card looks like a birthday party ya so they don't like it
no I my one is also my one also still the best
well actually my one finish because (uh) it's no longer I mean I got no more cards to give [lah] but that time
[ah] ya but no I don't want your one I don't like
anyways (uh) it actually works I print exactly [lah] that's why [ah] you got extra correct so that time
so (uh) eventually after that we that's not the only problem [ah] during our wedding [ah] actually my greatest fear for (uh)
quite popular in #suria# also and (uh) he's one of the funniest guy [ah] I was like
so happy that I got here eventually I feel I don't care anymore then eventually right on that two weeks before our wedding he back out !alah!
ya wasted [sia] it's like he asked us to go I mean find someone else then he said how much if you want us to pay I say no I don't want to I don't want to work with the the caterer anymore so that's why I want to back out then I was like !walao! not on my wedding [lah] [sia]
but before our wedding there was this (uh) issue about caterer not showing up and there's something like that then after that
the I the D_J actually do it for fee but I contact then I contacted but not asking for free [lah] contacted asking for cheaper price or something cause I told him that my story and all that they gave me a good price
which is way better than that guy price and the D_J eventually become better [eh] best [eh] until now some more still
feel on our facebook and then also (uh) still wish us and he is like one of the best D_Js I feel [lah] so shout out to D_J #azuri# and then (um)
ya our our wedding take place #azuri# #azur# but (uh) the D_J his name is #azuri#
okay
so ya okay so
is that they if the caterer doesn't show up actually the D_J doesn't show up the
ya
is very much (um)
that guy is is is is cool that guy is good very very cheerful real funny guy (err) better than you that's better than our last time you and you are supposed to be there right
ya
okay so ya make it a drive all right so (um) is there any regrets
about the wedding not the marriage [ah] the wedding [ah]
[oh] ya the weather it was nice [ah]
(mm)
ya
one of the regret is that
if I know about orange ballroom
about the same as the point that we actually for our wedding also same
[eh]
ya
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
ya so that was like one of the luckiest thing [ah] for you [ah] for me the luckiest will be the photo [ah] no no not the photography the photography was good [ah] the no ya
photo photo
yes correct the photo booth so photo booth
game what my friend did she's amazing [ah] that time she and her boyfriend she did was an she did was an amazing job
because that photo booth because of that photo booth right there's a lot of
cute funny and amazing pictures the pictures was
picture perfect amazing everyone love it everyone was so entertained by that picture and then
so once we got married marriage life happens
a lot of fights happens a lot of (um) crying and happiness
and travelling together happen you get to know I got to know
more about you
the the most tested
years of wedding of marriage is the five years
five years of marriage you you think about everything like financial
life work blah blah blah and stuff like it's true
[kan] ya so just to ask you again but (um)
we go through like a lot of stuff [lah] eventually until now even though it's
ya
the the thing about like being worried is more than worried like
like recently we we love anime
demon slayer was like one way of my
(uh) marvels (uh)
(um) some like fast and furious I don't like but you love fast and furious
is travelling [kan]
K_L
(mm)
ya
!chey! that was a punishment though
[eh]
I don't know [eh] [oh] I wasn't I wasn't given anger to to me [ah] I don't know why I wasn't angry usually I would be angry [ah] because to me this one is very very particular but after that event right that's where I very
ya of course that time I I know I found out that he actually
he likes driving also [lah]
no [lah] but then but
ya
you always say that next time but we won't we won't go anymore
so and then (um) like okay what is your regret is there any regrets for this marriage for me
like we do have financial issue
we have we don't have things that (um) we wanted to do [lah]
how we portray our wedding our marriage because
after I been I see people in instagram and then after that I see people in friends
real life and after that real events there I see
they do their own way marriage [lah]
[ah] so that's why [lah]
so what about you do you have any regrets
okay so (um)
can I just ask you another question [ah] before I I remember I just now I asked you one question ya the regret so do you have any regret of not married not marrying me [lah]
(mm)
eventually he is like one okay guy [lah] so okay [lor] okay last question
last question [lah] I want to ask you also you know this all interview about me [ah]
is there any what's your biggest fear about marriage not wedding [ah] marriage biggest fear for like for example
for me right my biggest fear will be if you cheating
because cheating right it goes to a lot of questions and curiosity (uh) I'm and confusing and blah blah blah but one thing I know if he cheat it's not my fault [ah] it's your fault but then (um) there's no such thing as #tercheat# [ah]
#ter# #ter# there's no such thing as that one for for what I know [lah]
but for me that is my biggest fear because I cannot live with the fact that if you do cheat on me [lah]
ya correct [ah] then about (uh) then another thing is that I'm also being I'm also very fortunate to have a very good mother-in-law and father-in-law in-laws so eventually my in-laws are good are good people [ah] that one
(uh) never give me stress also because like the thing is that (um) in-laws right
okay [lah] still got we we there was a bond there [ha] and now (uh) we have our own house we we took care of our own house we're happy and then
(uh) we want to create our own family here [lah] [ha]
so okay just just before we end all this finishing
is there any future (um) request
as a husband towards me for
let's say if you want anything that you expect for the next like ten twenty years okay let's say just ten years [lah] we are already in our
[oh] my god do I know this
okay I think (uh) because (um) for the last past five months [eh] five years I have been like driving you crazy [kan] okay the thing is that (um)
okay [ah] I for me for the next like about maybe around ten years before we reach that mark ten years mark I wish that we have
a a small family [lah] like another (um) junior
either junior girl or junior boy doesn't matter that (uh) another person [ah] in our family [lah] [kan]
yes because I want to be healthy by the time I'm
getting older you know I don't want to be like like sixty already and then cannot breathe already you know something like that
okay so (um) I'm be thankful for all these years of meeting you
and I'm very thankful that I actually get married and I actually (uh) know
about you more [lah]
because of the time [lah] if I got time of course I don't mind cooking also where is like parts of the wedd~ marriage can say that because like other people need to eat but the thing is that (uh) to me
I like cooking [lah] not really into cleaning up [ah] he likes to clean up so he would assist me in the cleaning up ya [kan]
okay so (um) that's one thing I like about so that's all about my wedding and my marriage and my life so I'm very happy and I think that's about
if we could eat one food for the rest of our life
what would it be
(hmm)

(hmm)
one food [lah]
[ah] one food [what] it's like one like it's like one dish
see if talking about dish
then
but food is life

like

like if it's a type
buffet I can eat buffet for the rest of my life [ah]
like buffet !wow!

that's why I tell you
(hmm)
what would it be
food

so I don't need to worry about (uh)
(uh) money anymore
I
okay with
because (uh)
but ya
good that (uh) I have a friend like you

(uh) #tamoko# lions
hobby of mine that I can release my stress
and
I can see on my (uh)
meets

so I'm glad that (uh) nothing happened to my right leg
then how about you
are there any injuries
[orh]
(um) when I was young I like extreme sport
(um)
(err) then (uh)
secondary school I go to
(err)
skatepark and I like skateboarding
(uh) hopefully that
(um)
speaking of commitments (uh) I think
(err)
after
work
I hope I find someone that I could marry
what I meant is
I hope that I will marry her and
(um) I think
they are having confusion about phase three
it's hard for me to wear
mask with spectacle can't you imagine
you know how terrible that is
so that's why I wear spectacle
but spectacle and mask is not a
good cohesion
good combination
that's why I keep reminding
my friends and close ones to keep a distance between each other and always wear their mask properly
ya
decided to wear their mask under their nose
I always remind them like you know to cover their nose
ya
because I really want to travel and go out and
spend more time with my friends and probably (err) go out in an adventure
but I don't know whether it's true or not but
I hope is a false news [ah] fake news
so (uh) I really want to go karaoke with my friends [ah]
and for my girlfriend (uh) probably go out on a date
somewhere (uh) and you know
have have fun with her maybe go arcade
[oh]
(uh) anything that's you know that can be used in singapore
[oh] ya (um) actually
(err) go staycation at least
I have never been before so at least
[oh] (uh)
(um)
I thought it's going to be fun like normal days when
so it's very boring for me
I hope phase three comes soon and we
ya the first thing I will do
right after COVID ends
is go #sentosa#
(uh) go beach with my family and
and (uh) you know swim
(um) I'm not afraid of heights
are you
(um)
but like it's different experience from
like r~ roller coaster I don't know why I
afraid to take roller coaster
I'm
of roller coaster because maybe the speed and just and it's like
(um) I don't mind it goes on a straight line
is better than a roller coaster
I enjoy
riding on a car
and going fast
actually
because I like to go fast and then
when I watch YouTube (err) like for example drifting
I hope I can do it in singapore but
drifting
and
make it as my
professional career
yes actually
(uh) I've been
wanting to be a racer since I was young because I like car so much
(err) when I was in the bus when I was young I can name
any car
that's in the road
(um) my favourite car is
(uh) B_M_W
(uh)
(uh) is really
fascinating when you know
more about cars
(um)
my favourite car is mostly (uh) japanese
for example (uh) Subaru Mitsubishi
ya any type of japanese car is my favourite
(um)
#tokyo# drift is one of them
[ah] actually
but I only watch till
and I watch (uh)
way before [ah]
(uh) nevermind skip that
ya the reason also
is paul walker because (uh) he also like japanese car and his favourite car is nissan skyline
and I I don't know how I've been supporting one club for
(err) like twenty years
in fact that
support the same club
man united shirt
(um)
and (uh) the manager himself that (uh) brought man untied to win (uh)
twenty titles
man U
but they are still carrying on with their winning ways
and now
(uh) they have a new manager which like is a man united legend
ya sometimes you need new clubs to
win you you you can't expect
one club to win (uh) all the (uh) season
and (err) what I heard recently
liverpool have won their first title
after like nineteen eighty something
so
while man U have already won twenty times
if
you know sometimes you need a good rest and
(uh) probably freshen up your body so you can prepare for the next day of work
ya (uh) (um)
(mm)
ya I also
(err)
go back into the normal state [lah]
and everybody starts to work normally and (uh) (uh)
ya
stick to the (uh) rules

move on

me and my wife if
so when come to the point that planning there will be a little part like we're getting a house then we see what we can afford or what you can do to our lifestyle [lah]

(mm)
that's good ya they would have they would have a lot of drives volunteer drives because I'm I'm sure I'm sure some volunteers don't stay here I mean you know
[kan]
ya ya ya the S_P_C_A also has lots of volunteer drives because ya one of it is the volunteers they don't stay for too long
so they always of course they always need to have volunteer drives
I mean anyway they have different volunteers
so you can some of them are dog walkers which is very popular because you get to chill with the dogs
(err) and then
critical care means for newborns newborns newborn kittens newborn kittens so they call me but you can always say okay I I volunteer
ya no [lah] fosterer no
what
ya (uh) yes
but I can if I volunteer okay for example if I volunteer for the kittens right so I pay for the food and all that medical I can go to their clinic
S_P_C_A has a clinic ya they have a one of the very few I think if I'm not mistaken they might be the only animal shelter with a clinic [ah] they their clinic is relatively new some more
so I it's should because I'm fostering for them so let's just say [oh] the kitten is sick so I call the clinic and say [eh] your kitten I fostering for you you know it has flu then they say okay come by so I make an appointment and I go to the clinic and then they treat and then they I don't pay [lor]
because it's their fosterer it's their foster kitten I'm just taking care so I don't pay for the (uh) but I must go to their clinic okay so if I decide to go to my own clinic outside which I have done before then I cannot waive cannot claim or anything like that
S_P_C_A is run by
donations they are run they run on donations
ya yes
people who recognise them and and and and donate sizable you know maybe companies or so I guess I don't know how well funded they are but they probably aren't so bad you know
government
[ah] G O V
but that is the problem
no that's rubbish [lah] cannot be
these dogs are still inhabitants of this country otherwise where are they going to go they have to be taken care of
in a humane way [lah] you know [ah] in fact I was just talking about it to (uh) to my grab driver over here
you know like all these developments that we are doing [kan]
development you know all the new new condos new property development sorry the H_D_B is building up and they are raising and they are just flattening all the lands and the jungles
so S_P_C_A and some other animal welfare groups are the ones having to pick up the pieces of these the dogs getting chased out the dogs have no place to go they cannot go back into the jungles they cannot go into a residence into into H_D_B you know heartlands and all that so but who is pushing them out we know who is pushing them out who but who is picking up the pieces animal welfare groups who are running on completely on donations which is like come on you know what I mean [kan] it's like ya I feel that it's it's it's it's it's just rubbish [lah] what is happen there is no collaboration I feel there is no collaboration
first kills the dogs
no they don't both okay
I mean this this this look at
right now there are but the numbers declining is is really this that means eventually the dogs are going to go ex~ they're going to be completely out and what we want is you know can you guys collaborate a bit more no not bit more there's no collaboration can you guys collaborate with A_W_G given if you're going to build and develop these places do something right but they're not
babe wild dogs wild boars and pythons where are they going why why why the pythons are coming out they are all in the drains what why are they coming out you tell me why are they coming out now why are there wild boars coming out now like in #pasir ris# why because #pasir ris# you know all the animal welfare groups the shelters were all there before right they were all there before no #pasir ris# farm way they were all there before the government took the land and they moved them to #tengah# now they are all in #tengah# now the animal welfare groups so they are developing #pasir ris# that's why the wild boars are there now you see them walking around wild boars why because there is a very clear example of this is what happens when you push them out they are going to end up out being visible (uh) to all residents who are going to panic
[ah]
pythons also
ACRES
and also and also the wild boars ACRES ACRES why do have why do you have picture of the snails on your
[oh] !wow!
[ah]
[oh] they are all the same
so what happens is what happen is you call ACRES ACRES will take ACRES ACRES A C R E S they are the animal the wildlife the wildlife group in singapore like monkeys ACRES the wildlife they are in charge so they can come up and take the snake I mean as in they trap the snake and what they would do they would microchip and they would release back into the jungle ya so that the snake is (um) is tagged ya they do that they're tagged then they will release back into the jungle so it still goes back into the jungle exactly where are they going to go right so they go back into the jungle then eventually they have to come out of the jungle again (uh) so so it solves nothing it solves nothing you know
ya they they microchip them they have to tag it so that they know that this is the one we have done before we've helped before something like that cute [kan]
quite a few
I don't like lizard
ya !aww!
is it [oh] so sweet
ya
!aww! bless her !aww! ya
that means you leave the food there and you walk away that one have but feeding I don't think so it's not illegal
right
ya
ya that one we tell people not to do
national environmental agency N_E_A they are the ones in charge of dengue dengue mosquito breeding all of that and the environment [lah]
so water ya it's it's very tough water food you are supposed to feed the cat stay there I mean and then clear you're supposed to clear your feeding you have two hours to clear
you can get ya if someone catches you you can get fined
everybody if somebody reports you can end the N_E_A ya you can you can get
for example if you feed right and then just in case N_E_A happens to walk past then you #kena# fine [lah] or somebody reports you or what ya you can ya
no littering
you have to clear the food within two hours
you have to you have to okay you can feed
(uh) okay for example I feed I feed the cat the cat is here I'll feed the cat I put the food down all right I cannot go home
okay I cannot go home [kan]
you don't have to necessarily sit there and watch
but you have to you go you can go and feed more cats then you come back and within two hours you clear this is what we mean by within two hours
so at the end of the day within the two hours you come back and you clear [lah] some people of course they choose to just sit there okay and then go
that's what we mean by two hours
must clear the cat food yes
yes
all the cockroaches rats and all that ya so they don't want that so it's not illegal to feed but is you cannot litter
which is to me is fair enough [lah] you know like we let you feed then you know because then the cats are hungry then they will go to hawker centres and bother people
you know and then of course it's also a nice thing to be humane right the cats are going to be there they are going to be hungry anyways you might as well feed them
at the end it's littering [lah] I don't know on the spot is a forty fifty I don't know
whatever that is whatever the market rate is
ya but that one is littering [lah]
ya so feeding is not illegal littering is so what we call it we call it (uh) we we tell people to be responsible feeders
re~ they they responsible feeding is what they want
and you can see signs posters you know at the lift no [lah] maybe not here [lah] but maybe other places you can see signs about responsible feeding
which is good [lah] to remind people you know kind of like that [kan]
[ah]
[oh] my goodness
they are copy cats
ya [lah] that's called district cats [lah] they're called community cats we call them
a pet cat
a pet cat some pet cats probably don't get
ya
ya it's their it's their joint
it's their joy
I know
(mm)
ya
[ah]
[ah] ya
[eh]
(mm)
because so much traffic [eh]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya
but it's quite safe [what] this this tree
traffic
(uh) ya
[ah]
okay
ya
[ah]
ya
back to their refuge [lah]
people who work there know where these fellas go (uh) their time table their schedule like ya at ten o'clock they will be here but later they will go that way that way [oh] then by twelve o'clock they will be at that pond
(uh) so funny and it's true right they would go almost every (uh) almost everyday
I guess is connected to the I I don't I don't know where I mean I don't botanic gardens then connected to where [ah] the drains [ah] does it go to I don't know (uh) so anyways they were at the botanic gardens almost a lot I see them twice still the same ya but no when I was there there were also people but (uh) it's just you know the thing about botanic gardens is that although it is busy it's a refuge because
(uh) so I guess I guess in the botanic gardens the otters would feel safe despite
the number of people and visitors ya because it's a you know there are very strict laws right in the botanic gardens you cannot pluck the flowers you cannot pluck anything you cannot touch the animals so because of the set of rules (uh) I guess you know the the otter felt safe [lah]
[oh]
you know there are a few families [ah] apparently
otter cla~
there is a fan club [ah]
okay when I say fan club means the people who are watching they love the otters they are the
they they monitor the otter activity
so they have the okay only the otter fan club [lah]
so and they they are actually very knowledgeable they know [oh] this is the #kallang# clan
so they have identified at least two families
two families which is
this is their territory [oh] then there's another clan which is
somewhere else not #kallang# so that is the one so they have different families [lah] all clans
maybe another clan !huh!
[ah] [ah] so they are very well fed they are you know they are very clever lots of fish
I don't think they look for other clans
(um) when they I I I don't think I think is like when I say #kallang# clan is like is like this is their territory
their roaming range is this is their range you know cats are like that
so for example if your cat is in this block he's he can range from this block to a few blocks [ah] this is their range so I'm sure they have the same
I guess among themselves [lah] I guess but they're very they're very they're very family oriented
so they can see the babies and all that and if fact a few died actually because one got caught
the angler hook !aiyo! so sad [ah] I think that was one was near (uh)
(uh) one of the (um)
so they have a few I'm not kidding about the clan I may have okay I call it clans I don't think it's called clan but you know what I mean
the fami~ the family ya
ya they do there there are a few at least two or three what I I remember in the news [lah] okay so what I remember in the news
(um)
I don't know if they live there
they don't they don't they roam
they roam they'll rove they rove (um) they
they might not they might not be the same clan because it's a bit far (um) the botanic gardens might be the same one as the maybe ya I don't know you know I don't know they don't just when they when they they don't just live in the botanic gardens it's one of their hangouts [lah]
one of their hangouts you know [ah]
ya ya ya
!wah! the otters right
cute right
ya (uh)
[eh] cute
ya but don't forget people are now becoming more aware of wildlife and all that no now
ya
you know ya
I think it's so refreshing n~ I don't think so no (uh) unless they are caught by ACRES but so far no they are not caught by ACRES they don't need to be caught by acres because I told you the fan the fan club they are very active and they know they go like (uh) in fact when you sometimes the news right they can they can say [oh] this the the the #kallang# clan they have had two new babies they actually can know and recognise like there are seven adults and two new babies the mother is pregnant we go like !wow! bloody hell how do they know I guess they know [lah] they're like super fans which is really nice
nice to know right that you know there's this group of people who are just so so in tuned and they are like the the they are the they they walk they care for them it's really nice
you know not the caretaking type [lah] but ya they they the the otter watch group the otter watch group ya
no no no
I think the #ulars# maybe are not as I don't know maybe not as vulnerable and
and well okay [lah] let's put it this way [lah] shallow as it as it may sound but not as cutesy you know
as otters otters is becoming like a tourist tourist the attraction [tau]
but snakes and you know otters and snakes you know the the the whole perception of snakes being dangerous and all that
so no [lah] they don't snakes no but snakes if they are caught if you sight a snake at the drain you call ACRES and then ACRES will come and trap and tag them and release them back into the forest
they don't kill or anything like that that's why we call ACRES ACRES is good they are the wildlife
[ah] then forget it then forget it the cases that ACRES have have caught were the snakes are still there
so we have had we have had cases where ACRES came in and then the snake and then the bulge it's a com cat it's a community cat
nothing just tag and take them nothing just don't kill the snake it's a it's just tag it and then just release [lah]
go back to the forest I told you they release it back into the forest but this is where we when we back to our initial conversation where
back they go back into the forest but eventually they will come out again
[ah] get a job
you
and then after the record like the two hours long session it will be uploaded on youtube then I download the video and then I will cut the parts where I want to use for my highlights video [lah]
in in the videos in the edited videos ya I think I think our creativity will come out more than we are when we are streaming [lor]
something like that ya ya
so besides the highlights so each video will have a particular game that we are focusing on and then we have to create content around that particular game
you need to give like variety like that [lah] ya so we are supposed to be the subject experts on that
ya but picking that game and being good at it (err)
I didn't say any

[eh] how was your job interview
five year plan on what what did you say
I would feel the same
I think if I were to think back about my previous recent job interview you ask me so what's your aspiration
but I think that's not a good good enough answer how would yes I think that last sentence could be
but then you were saying that for the interview you had a follow up
from the same company or different
but I think the company has been around for how long
they are much more stable like not so (err) intimidating
you never know what happen in the future also random questions that you might ask
yes I think for now this time you cannot be choosy with the job offers
but different job different exactly but also it's using pandemic [what] two people [ah] and that there's all this companies wing cost saving also [what] right so I think you choose your job
which is good
(mm) yes
someone depend on you also right
why not
(mm)
yes
!wah! that's that's okay too [kan]
what
five year plan what's your five year plan to get a house for you to move into my new house well I mean of course [lah] once you are married you also want to have your own property too
yes that's another point yes
of course we can make it work [lah] for the brand but just that now during COVID times we are just thankful that we are getting by and people still buy our latest item even though (um)
okay [lah] I think because of the price point is quite okay like for the printed t-shirt is about thirty nine people are willing to spend that much but if the price is like above fifty you know I don't think people would want to spend that money because every every dollar counts
yes
tourist
but what if that four hundred six hundred dollars is equivalent to like fifty dollars worth to them
yes precisely
of his family probably
three thousand can last me for few months of expenses
you will regret spending three thousand in one day I tell you something one night I was sleeping right then I was thinking !wah! I hate to count my calories cause I'm on a diet I need to be on calorie deficit so there's this fitness eating (err) calorie counting app [lah] I used it before but if you want some like extra features you have to pay for it [lah] okay
no no I it's paid for
but it's for one year
I bought that app when I was half asleep I mean if I were to cancel it now
I cannot remember I don't think
I will check it out
refund
really even though it's not even though is like a few weeks
I know right next time I should charge my phone away from me sure like that would work and then he will only sleeping closer to the tragedy so she
did you buy anything for black friday are you sure I thought if you have swiss then then you cannot eat something with collagen or what I don't I thought you have really
your first opinion said I had then second
okay
you bought it already or not yet
how many thingy from per bottle how many clicks per bottle
[oh]
shoes I thought you like shoes
[oh]
[eh] but you will be more at the office part right
!huh! you have to also track just in case they need to run out
[oh]
when when will be your off day what what's your working hours like
the duty area
because you take your off day in the middle of the week
I mean there are other pros and cons [lah] but the thing is
but nowadays if I buy stuff I notice that a few days later I not excited about it anymore so I try not to to shop unnecessarily [ah]
and some more you are recovering from your leg injury are you is your period coming
are you still taking the hormones meds
one pill one cycle is how long one month ten days [oh] okay what happens if you stop
would you consider going for the therapy yes I mean once settled down with your new job [ah]
cause I think you will
I mean I'm on a supplement
(err) there's one for lungs something for the liver and something for the bowel and the sleeping [one] but they are all quite safe cause it's plant based
[oh] okay my consultation I think because I think they charged me double I think is supposed to be twenty five or maybe the first one is fifty and then the therapy was ninety
but okay [lah] I mean I found some recipes online so (err) chick peas they are high in protein if you eat too much I'm still reading up about eating more plant based stuff [lah] so I mean I can slowly start by eating more fish instead of chicken and meat right
long beans asparagus
no because I had to do some errands at home
[oh] where's her workplace [oh] C_B_D area
really colourful what do you mean it's so dead in
salad
their shop is based in C_B_D only
salads actually salad is not a bad thing if you dress it nicely you get a healthier dressing I think it's quite easy to do that's why I wanted to do the salad
yes but need to go shopping first I know right the one at arab street right
what else [ah] yes can request [ah]
there's like meal prep but convenience wise you just buy the cooked proteins or the whole meal itself
or like protein muffins muffins where there is protein in it so it helps with (uh) this with your body recovery after your workout because you need a certain amount of protein
there's also like plant based protein I wanted to try that plant based protein
cause protein this stuff it always very like choppy the after taste
why
you can go home now just like that
like did they call anybody else to come
yes [lah] all the effort
hello
but not when you have a toddler that's what everybody will say
what's that
[oh]
but yes I had this student we had to do something like what do you want as your dream job then he say he want to become a youtuber I was like what do you want in your video
I mean at least have the basic education first then you can do what you want
actually okay
junk food
I hope there's a I hope there's a meal prep for plant based meal really I mean it's supposed be easy [lah] to to cook plant based but you just need to plan first like the ingredients that you are buying how many servings can you cook are you okay eating the same thing everyday for the next few days
I mean I doubt we can eat the same thing only like two days max or three days max
I mean there's always a first for everything
#onigiri# #onigiri#
do you have to like open everything first then warm it up [oh] just put everything inside first
and it was enough to
I mean there's a bit of rice there's seaweed a bit of protein
[ah] we wanted to eat sushi salmon #mentaiko# I think I'll just order that when we go to #hei# sushi yes you don't do anything else just that salmon #mentaiko#
I I feel like there's popular like poke bowls around C_B_D area
yes bring me there
I think they open the orders weekly or biweekly
I think I let you try before [lah] the cuts I let you try before the say #inadi# with the rice inside and then like smoked salmon and #mentaiko# torched
let's go eat that tomorrow [oh] that snow beef bowl yes set meal for two
home based food or outside food
choose one
the exams are like cut off about
exam are replaced with (err) graded assignments
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday [ah] [ah]
you design [tau] like
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
[ah]
(hmm)
(um)
but you know what (uh) I had this one senior the internship was during the C_B period yes so
no
zoom or [ah] microsoft teams
[oh] she is (uh) in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
[ah] work from school even internship [eh] [ah] ya from home I mean
[ah] so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
and like even but then right
but then during C_B period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work [what]
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that [what]
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then (um)
actually diff races okay [lah]
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma [ah] outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
[oh] my god
[oh] you mean secondary school or what
[oh] primary five then I still in the kindergarten [lah]
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay [ah]
but at that point of time I was
I
messenger
true [lah]
eighteen [oh] ya
(hmm)
why is this class not like taking it seriously
not something to be like
like absent for like out of five days [leh]
three days absent and and even if he was present

so far I think they're okay just that the girl is going to primary one now
so I'm not so sure how is she going to cope
I'm actually looking for a tuition teacher now for her do you think I'm crazy
ya but singapore is so competitive I'm just worried about her
!hais!
what do you think
ya but last time you don't have this stress now everything is about good marks good school !hais! stress [lah]
(mm) but I still think like we need
a tuition teacher because my husband feel feel that we should start young [eh] you got any tuition friend or not
tuition teacher
[ah] but I think there are different rates for this
maybe about forty to fifty
I want them to come to my house [lah] I don't want to travel out already very tiring you know
good good thank you thank you
[eh] so (uh) you wanna sit down somewhere like coffeeshop or something

ya [eh] now COVID then how they want to engage maid
can or not [ah]
I think I rather stay home
keep my home clean
(mm)
(mm)
five days M_C
so
[oh]
!wah!
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(uh huh)
[oh] (mm)
stress at work
(mm)
[ah]
[eh] (mm) now got what exhibition over there
!wow! (mm)
but
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so a lot of people (uh) take leave
[eh] you redeem already
(hmm)
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
[orh]
(mm)
ya that's true
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go #johor# at least I make a bit more profit
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya that's true [lah] [eh] you know about talking about government [ah] they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
[ah] then my friend tried it then
well
know
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[kan] the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country [lah] but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go (um)
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
(mm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have (um)
enough people it's about
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless [lah]
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
daily [ah] (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah! [eh] you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(hmm)
[oh]
fifteen dollars per hour
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
expose [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
precautionary order at (mm)
housewife just like me
(mm)
(mmhmm)
they know better [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that's true
[eh] [ah] I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
(mmhmm)
!huh!
is
we'll see
(uh huh)
a few cartons
(mm)
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
(hmm)
ya maybe I should just by those reuse~ reusable ones
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
can [lah] if not you can just order in
(mm)
ya that's true
(mm) but it's quite expensive [lah] but
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
[eh]
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
(mm)
(mm)
(hmm) ya
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle [lah] but lucky he is not using because he's (uh) on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
(mm)
ya that's true
(hmm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched [lah] I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
(hmm)
some of them even went to (uh) try
!wah! it's really you have to work extra hard for this (uh)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
that's long
(mm) maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying (uh) well
(mm)
[oh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then (um) my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of (um) what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive [lah] on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
(um) having that symptom of COVID nineteen
there are may~ maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary [kan]
(mmhmm)

(mm)
(mm) [oh]
(mm) [ah]
(uh huh)
(mm)
all right
ya
so is it we have a muffler
this one forward a bit [ah]
is it
shit
I don't know what went wrong [ah] honestly [ah] honestly I do not know what went wrong
I I think I did everything fine
and I was actually quite optimistic [ah] I was like
even if I was the instructor
so like suddenly when when when you need the citation is like okay those who experience this and blah blah blah
so I went over I went over to the mini circuit [ah]
but yesterday's one okay if he failed me I understood because it has been so long since I ever sat even sat on a bike [ah]
but apart from that
I think
you know I did I did move from gear one to gear two
but and I don't even okay maybe and then he nobody he didn't mention anything about speeding or whatever
the I think maybe maybe that one was just why I don't know [ah] cause I'm not sure there's a speed limit in that circuit so
and I accepted it [lah] ya but today
(um) I started out with the mini circuit
like it was me and it was that that that that girl [lah] so I was like okay I say maybe this is the chance [ah] maybe today I might pass [ah] that kind of thing
but no
I again today in fact I in fact today I didn't even stall
then I said [oh] then
then why I cannot the same ride again [ah]
so
[oh] so that was me and then about that girl
she was (um) she was okay she she also failed
you do you do your morning exercise right you do your whatever exercise the back the back [ha] so she fell there I didn't know because what happened was
I remember at that point of time I was in front of her
and then
because that place is definitely like a corner wall
and there's one mirror there [lah]
so I I I think when I hit even before I hit that place [eh] I already down to gear two already even before that [ah]
no the instructor was there the instructor was standing there [ha] my instructor was standing there so I think probably he knew that she was gonna screw it up or something like that [lah] that's why he stood there
so the next thing I knew was whether it's that I saw one bike on the ground and then she was lying down on the ground on the on the on the other side of the face
then after that (uh) she was trying to pick up the mood
no I was still on my bike
[ha] instructor instructor was there all the while [ha] so she help her he helped her out he pull out the bike
[ha] you concentrate or your bike [ha] you look in front this and that your cornering I tell you already why you drive so near the wall [ah] because she when you're making a left turn you're supposed to sway to the right a little bit then you you know it's easier for you to engage the the the the maneuver [lah] maneuver the the turn but she
so when when you turn on the left side like that
the chances of you going out of your lane after your turn is very high
[ha] cause it's it's a bend [what]
okay so
no I didn't see her fall
so she got up everything blah blah blah and then she sat one the bike after that she sat they were asking are you okay like you know you feel any pain anywhere and then she's like no [lah] I'm okay [lah] okay
then after that like
after that (uh) when that when when when when she on her engine already ready to go
(uh) the instructor tell me he said (uh)
so after that she she he told me to to to just overtake her [kan] he say you just go ahead first [ah]
[ha] prac one
so throughout the whole entire session nothing went wrong
what what what what was his issue
I do not know
when I got the results I was like
the fuck [sial]
ya
prac two is a
it's like the salem slope
no to me
really [meh] you use your foot brake [what]
really
!huh!
it's supposed to be in seven seconds right
why plus two
why must plus two
[oh] class two ten seconds slower [ah]
[ha]
but you but on on on gear one right
ya [lah] half clutch ya actually can [what]
is it
serious [ah]
[ah]
harly from this cafe racer you going to change to harly it's a big difference you know [oh] bobber bike [kan] that one [ah] the mutt the mutt the mutt but mutt is what country [eh] is it mutt [ah]
(mm)
confirm [ah]
[ah]
just jump to three hundred plus or try to go close to four hundred [ah]
ya [lah] that's why
A_C bikes is it was it A_C bikes there was one retailer there was one retailer that sells that bike
(mm)
!huh! who
[oh]
#sanfu# [ah]
#paya lebar#
for the mutt the mutt [ah] how much
excluding C_O_E
machine price
[oh] inclusive [a'ah]
last year's C_O_E was how much
ten thousand plus
[ha]
that bike is expensive [ah]
zontes cheaper [ah]
!huh! the mutt thing
zontes
ya ya ya
the resemblance is there
you are listening [ha]
sell out your bike first
(mm)
(mm)
we've got to
no but maybe also because you are not used to handling a heavy bike
(mm) (mm) (mm)
I think that you should consider that
there are many people who have class two bikes [ah]
but they all stop at super four
don't know
they just don't know they just don't about
it is it is it it
when you see their their their their how common the bike is [ah] on the roads [ah] that tells you how reliable the bike
super four there are people who bring super four which country in indonesia and come back down also also no problem U_K super four quite normal or not ya
no I think it's six hundred (hmm) (mm)
four hundred two to two hundred to four hundred right two A
but but the the the the aesthetic of me to say
[ah]
is it
ya
!huh!
per two weeks
[oh] engine oil to [oh] you change [ah] ya that's about two weeks [lah]
sixty
[oh] ya ya ya (mmhmm)
but engine oil they have to drain out everything and put a new one right
four four
that one S four that's why they call it super four
(mm)
forty eight ya
for every
[ah]
that's why you must get air cooled bike
get the tourer [ah] get the touring bike
get a short touring bike
(uh)
it's nice
it looks like bro
[eh] but do you see the that one that day I showed you or not
it looks like the zontes right
but ya ya the zontes is bigger (uh)
one eight four one eight four is a honda one and because it's the same engine as the as the tourism and the five [oh] but
fifteen I think sixteen litres [ah]
fifteen or sixteen I cannot remember
a zontes is twenty
[oh] #desaru#
it's as good as you are dead because it's not cheap you know to tow the bike over (um)
I don't know how much [ah] malaysia to singapore [lah] but (uh) three hundred always [eh] where you are [lah] it goes by distance [what]
!wah!
then how
the risk is there but that's why I said
(mm)
don't know
[ah]
!huh!

they just there to give you [ah]
[a'ah] [sia]
three minute

ya I know whether you find new job or not
so after I took her number I after she give me her number I went to
I went to level four because one of my friend was taking daily lesson
so when I went up he was still there then I ya
when I knew it was already eleven plus eleven fifteen you know
then okay
so I spend another half an hour
and I mean I would have gone home on my own [lah] but
I didn't want to spend
so I just waited [ah] I waited until twelve o'clock
so by the time I reach back home
I was she was still texting me [ah] I was telling you everything [what]
then (uh)
is that #dino#
and then she said because she's been driving for many years already
then after that (uh) she was telling me [ah] no then
she ask me whether I was in contact with anybody from the deliveroo
then I said I said not really only sophie [ah] and then I don't know about you I say were you still there then she said no [lah] for some time already I'm not there I think she left
in october or something like that last year [ah] last year last year october
but #dayah# ruby all went before her
first round of of of retrenchment #dayah# was the head of customer service [ah]
[ah]
we used to order [lah] we used to order for dinner
after nine plus
per person ya

(mm) (mm)
now

clear cut dishonesty [sia]
terrible [ah]
of course [ah]
[ah]
you told me this one you told me
this one you told me but when was this this year
#dayah# smoke or no
I never seen her smoke ruby smokes #dayah# I don't know
I mean you know honestly what [lah] just she's just
[kan] I told I told #shida# and her off before [what] #shida# and ruby off before at the office I think that from there already they won't come in I say you all you all treat the office like a playground
you know I never saw them in the corporate world
(mm)
but long time ago you still there [lah]
but I think on the day you were not working I I I didn't like #shida# from day one [one]
to me #shida# is just
a nuisance
I don't know how she was in youtrip [ah] but in deliveroo she was terrible
character wise
but ya [lah] that's the that's the that's the whole
and then rational why I I kind of didn't really like
I mean
I took that job because
and I came back from europe I had no job like literally nothing
and then I'm like [ah] then I had to sign the the the stupid !huh! no last time attendance [kan] sign that that paper right what the the one in the hut the hut the hut
whatever [lah]
(mm)
and then (um) I was sitting beside
(um) sophia B
then
ya I don't have I'm like
where is she you also don't know where [ah]
okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap [eh]
the first one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
to eat
then I'm like !huh!
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
it depends [ah] maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
#mee goreng# but you know me and #mee goreng#
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that #mee goreng# taste
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not [lah]
which I don't think it is
this is actually #konjac# jelly kon~ #konjac# you know C O N J A C
[ah] have you tried #mala# before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of #mala# cause actually I I went to #hai di lao# we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to #hai di lao# and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all [lah]
(uh) because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try #mala# they so bad you know like you have to try #mala# I was like what this this this big deal about #mala# [sia] everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too #kaw#
you know #kaw#
yes
like too strong like that
(uh)
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil [lah]
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you [ah]
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K #nah#
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
ya (err) okay K ya ya (uh) it so it's #konjac# jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this #mala# taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious [eh]
you think the conversation is good
like
(mm)
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets [ah] the other two is for my other friend

because I see people change and I see
like
like after a while you be like [eh] a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID

not only people but myself also [lah]
(mmhmm)

know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
twen~ no not twenty twenty is really slow walk [ah] but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location [ah] in the end we loved it [ah]
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop [ah]
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like (um) #sya# was
that's why a lot of things happened
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three A_M people start queuing already
ya which is
too far they were cor~ cordoned off already
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
so I went down at about
ten A_M no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten A_M I was like [eh] the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like [oh] shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like !huh!
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
and it costs five hundred U_S_D I thought I told you before
(mm)
it costs five hundred U_S_D so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
carpet [eh] seriously I need to change this carpet
(mmhmm)

remember
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
or like walk around and do my work here or like
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
everyone needs the money
but
se~ se~ seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
(mmhmm)
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
shouldn't be that expensive [what] to entice people to buy [what] or like rent
downgrade

because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small [lah]
a false wall
then like I'm like !huh!

and then (uh)
(mm) ya
[oh] #angsana# yes
ya
#zhong zheng# or uni~
why [ah]
is it
that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you P_S_L_E grade [lah]
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
!huh!
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays [ah]
#kiasu#
(mm)
[orh]
[orh]

[ah]
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
[oh] yes I forgot that I got one good news today
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes [ah]
ya he's present he's pre~ rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the down~ ya is him
ya not exactly h~ okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
one one more year and then ya I'll leave [lah]
ya see how it goes
ya
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids [lah] also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say (um)
ya
ya
older kids [ah] I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers (err)
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
(mm)
[orh]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
approval [lah]
so who decides
the deployment
okay
you see the teachers but you don't see the
H_O_D people like rarely right
[oh] so they do teach

ya
ya
ya
(oo)
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay ca~ can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's (um)
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
(uh)
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing [lah] just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then (err) depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is (err) cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya [lah] I mean basically you can climb [lah]

(uh)
[oh] then after that the ya
then no after that no more already [lah] right
ya
okay okay okay
okay we see how !aiya! #ilan# #madrasah#
slippers you mean
(mm)
(mm) ya
[oh] okay
[ah] okay [lah]
okay
(oo) ya
[oh]
ya talking about her [ah]
(oo) that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story [ah] because (err)
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing [lah] but the timing is also like (err) odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish [ah]
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early [lah] but sometimes
[ah] they go off or sometimes
when you work late [ah] you have to finish late [lah] you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back [ah]
not that bad [ah]
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back [lah] right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off [ah] something like that or
something like that [lah] alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is (err) I think
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish [ah]
(err) I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know [lah] and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early [lah] to finish
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
then she [oh] then this [one] [ah] I will ask #sani# to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear [ah] [kan]
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out [ah] then after that she like go out [ah] then she like !alamak! !aiya! I like I also don't want [ah] to be leader you know
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything [lah] [kan]
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
ex~
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this [one] because they are like contract [ah]
ya contract not perm~ staff
you can s~ you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this [lah] you put in extra hours [lah] you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing [lah] it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like (err) worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
[ah] ya
ya

okay okay I think your phone needs to be nearer ya okay (err) just now we had our chinese lesson
so (um) like coffee bean was so packed ya so but no choice [lah] we really tried to find a place [kan] ya but I was also very sleepy ya so what do you do in the (err) #sungei buloh#
how many friends did you go with
is it the the malaysian guy that you told me about before
[oh]
then you all didn't decide to grab lunch or something
[oh]
[oh] what did you buy
he was he was singing then I was like !wah! in my heart [eh] is like like bursting [tau] ya so I was so happy to see him singing and like being very cheerful cause like I told you that time (err) he was a bit down and like (err) demotivated [kan]
so when I like I heard him singing then !wah! like I was like thanking the god like don't know how many god okay I mean I only worship one god but ya I was like [oh] my god I was so happy that he was happy then he started walking also like I told you he hasn't gone out of bed for like I think at least one week [ah] ya so today was the first time that he walked and he was walking in front of me also
your face ya so ya [lah] so they were encouraging him to sing more [lah] cause they were happy that he's happy then (err) he even he was like (err) cause one of the nurses one of the male nurses is called his name is #rex# he's a filipino guy
so he was like #rex# I'm going to dedicate this song to you and like all the nurses in this ward for taking care of me and then he was singing the all of me song ya ya john legend I cannot remember [ah] all these names ya so ya [lah] so they were they were like some of them were singing with him also like while they were doing (um) I think doing his blood test and all that
ya so like I think I think as a nurse also if I were if I were the nurse also I'll be super happy like this patient like in a way found their motivation
ya
okay I'm done
(err) what did I have for lunch [ah] [oh] ya because I was talking to #haziq# until so long right my breakfast end up became becoming lunch ya so I ate my nuggets and fries at around like one P_M [eh] [eh] no ya around one P_M [eh] no
no no twelve twelve sorry
ya I that's my comfort food
(mm) true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars #nasi lemak# at those M_R_T are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like (err) but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then (err) the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
[oh] ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about (um) just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya #choa chu kang# M_R_T
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't [oh] okay I remember I went to [oh] cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than K_F_C cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like (um) it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this [one] is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it [lah] so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in #choa chu kang# doesn't have a shower
later like what time
(err) the burger (err) I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what [ah] I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella [eh] no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom [eh] the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya don't know [ah] it's just like I I like it that way [ah]
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in N_T_U
[oh]
where
(mm)
mushroom soup how can mushroom soup be salty
what as in like is too clumpy
[oh] okay okay okay
[oh]
[oh] okay wait what is this cafe called again
is it is it like the
but is it like in a mall or is it like in the middle of nowhere
[oh] !wow! that's interesting (um) so why did you guys want to go there
(mm) [oh] ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
[oh] and that's enough for him
(mm)
(mm) [oh] ya I saw your friend before he's like a teddy bear
(mm)
then after that you all didn't go for dessert or anything
I think so ya [oh] I didn't know there was a drive through there
you and your mocha
(mm) mcdonald's drinks are always sweet
(mm) that's nice so so he pick you up from N_T_U
!aww! that's nice
ya yesterday I just went to the hospital [oh] like after I gym then I went home to shower then after that I was feeling pretty lazy [lah] honestly so I just (err) ask my brother [ah] [eh] can I take the car or not then he say can go and take ya then I took the car I drive to I drove to S_G_H
so I was super scared about that so like (err) when I reach there right it was quite empty like quite a few cars parked there [lah] to be honest so like I was not too worried but then to be safe [kan] I just parked right smack in front of the lift
#nasi# [ah] sorry I ate the #lor mai kai# then I ate the then I order three #siew mai#
ya it's damn nice right for some reason that #lor mai kai# got the like the wok !hey! taste ya [oh] my god ya so that's why like !wah! I think if I go there again right I'm just gonna keep buying the #lor mai kai#
I didn't see anything at the #ulu# car park [ah] parking lot exactly so ya some more hospital [kan] ya so I was super scared then I just like okay never mind don't think about it
okay let me let me look at the other prompts
[eh]
I hope that we can play badminton later [seh]
ya
ya too windy I think too much but I think
so that (err) they all evaporate faster something like that [lah] I have no idea how the science works [ah] ya okay let me see what are the prompts (um)
okay if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
damn ya that's super deep I I didn't expect you to think of that
ya you know mine on is like super shallow
damn what who who is that celebrity
[oh]
ya that's true
that is a very is #hyorin# right that is a very P_R response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
(mm)
[oh] damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how [oh] !chey!
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy [oh]
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor [kan] but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
(mm) !wow! that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay (um) do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
(mm) stereotypes [ah]
ya I get what you mean [ah] ya is a bit (err) a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that [one] it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is [oh] you malay [ah] you in uni [ah] [oh] so you are one of the what [ah] a smart malay [ah] they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before [lah] but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya [lah] I know I know recently also like especially during (um) the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so (err) !aiya! don't know [lah] I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like [oh] okay okay okay but ya like like quite #sian# [ah] to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that (err) everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say [lah]
he's on what on the ship [oh]
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for (um) youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths [ah]
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up [lah] because (err) even though to me [lah] like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe [lah] #inshallah# like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did [ah] I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to (err) I_B and then from I_B go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like I I don't know [ah] like I just cannot cannot handle it [lah] ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like [oh] don't worry [lah] I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is [lah] ya cause (err) one of the mentors was telling me that like (err) he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
[oh] damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
[ah] [ah] okay let's look for one more question (mm)
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free [eh]
that's true but technically also isn't it like
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing [what] right ya
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that (um) analogy [lah] ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more [lah] ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that [lah]
ya [oh] my god my throat
!hey! [oh] ya okay then for me what was the question again [ah]
(um) my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free [eh] food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer (um) if something was free [ah] can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya [lah] like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya !wah! it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored [leh] if I were immortal
no [oh] my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy [ah] okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just (um) and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them [lah] basically
aes~ aesthetics ya [sia] okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift (hmm) will the werewolf be the shape shifting [one] maybe will be quite fun
okay no I think I will still choose to be a vampire I think in general vampires are a more accepted society no breed more acceptable breed in compared to (um) the werewolves ya cause werewolves is just like literally animals
ya damn okay then (um) I don't know would you rather be like
[ah] I'm good I'm good
okay everything is normal but then
(err) yes (err)
like one of them (err)
is now doing the parking the parking
and then (err) #anas# is
doing (err) more of for farming

so how how is the quarantine in singapore the S_H_N people a lot people complain [lah] facebook [lah] they say not nice [lah] some of them I I I don't know but how how is it is it easy to come back to singapore from from #batam# or is there any requirement that you need to get

[ah]
[ah]
[ah] okay okay okay so you you
#batam# from #batam# you take from harbourfront right you stop at harbourfront

talking about COVID no COVID
now already fifth december already another few more
days three more weeks [dah] end of the year already !wah! very fast man correct or not [ah]
!alamak!
[ah]
this is a new beginning [ah] they call it the new norm for now for I have the feeling that most of the people will get used to it and then by
don't know [lah] [ah] I just feel that this COVID thing is moving very fast I just feel like
it just happen like one month ago but actually now almost end of the year already almost one year finish already
correct
sixteen march [eh]
but but very fast [ah] nine months
then maybe january twenty twenty one I not sure I don't think can still travel in twenty twenty one [ah] that's what they said is probably two two [lah] so
so good thing cannot travel save money for this one year so twenty twenty two a lot of people will start travelling again
correct correct
(mm)
okay [lah] spend money in singapore [lah] staycation now government give [ah] hundred dollars voucher you take already
but you cannot book directly to the hotel [lah] I think you have to book to those but five platform only
the places that you want to go (err) places of interest or staycation
you have to book through this platform book online
before you finish your process of payment then you have to
click under redeem vouchers then it will redirect you to your singpass [ah] and then from there then you can use [lah] you can either you have to use a whole hundred dollars
okay [lah] they want us to spend money in singapore spend money in singapore [lah] but where to go I also don't know
I mean if you go because is until july twenty twenty one [lah] so there is no need to rush because
I believe people are all rushing for this december because is school holiday so if you are talking about using the vouchers during this period [ah]
[eh]
correct correct but I not sure probably COVID I not sure whether water cove open or not but then if you ask me to go zoo #jurong# bird park #sentosa# I don't want [lah] so all these places went already [ah] so I need to go something different [ah] maybe
use
use one one voucher to stay staycation two days one night [ah] maybe those hotel that you really want to go but you know but you don't have chance to go there but hundred dollars how much cannot
unless you go to smaller hotels [lah] you want to go those like U_S_S hotel [ah] of course you need to come out still same price [lah] not much difference [ah] anyway
ya
[ah]
serious [ah]
government give us [ah]
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] okay okay I understand
[ah] so at least singapore is
so call we are lucky in a way that government is still taking care of us giving us some some rebates some help some assistance in terms of finance rebates for house rebates for electricity but other countries totally nothing [lah]
!huh!
so meaning for example if let say they government for example government say promise them one thousand rupiah [lah] example [ah] one thousand rupiah but by the time it reach them left maybe five hundred rupiah only then that five hundred go where along the way so that five hundred consider from one place
be quite too expensive or what
no
!huh!
so under table
so meaning
so meaning like how
!huh! I don't get it so meaning okay let's say now I I I go to hospital but I do not know my result
and then (uh) hospital just to get money from the government
they will say that you are positive then this hospital send this positive patient to where
to the quarantine area
just to refer one person to quarantine you get money what's the purpose why why
is better to refer a negative to a place to say that you are negative that means you are helping the economics or you are helping the country to lower down the cases rather than every person you say positive then if every person goes to hospital without checking you say positive then the number of goes up [what] then what's the point of
!huh!
bullshit
!huh!
I don't get it funny look I mean if if if hospital get money to inform the government that this patient is negative it make sense but if they hospital without checking inform the patient that they are positive and then get money ya
but it's better to get
more negative numbers in your country then positive [what] right so why is the other way round
what the
really happen
until now [ah]
how much how much they can get for for for for one person
[oh] that that is wasting your money I rather then you waste rather than you waste your money to just inform and get a referral to refer a patient to a quarantine area might as well get that money to help your medical in terms of
medical things or medicine to improve your medicine better [what]
funny [ah]
why [ah] like that
anyway
ya
[ah] [ah]
[ah] and then go and then he video call and then he wave at the wife using binoculars [oh] my god so cute
very the romantic lucky never go viral maybe [ah] maybe whoever pick up that story [ah] and then share share share share [ah]
I do not know [ah] shared that video of he waving at his wife both of them using bino~ binoculars waving at each other in opposite one is #johor# one is #woodlands# so cute you know but
do not know haven't go viral yet [ah] whoever pick up that story [ah] go viral [ah]
no [lah] he I think yes he no [eh]
this year ya correct correct because right right right
I think one is it one month or few weeks
before the actual (err) wedding then it comes out into regulation that singapore is banning people from travelling that's the part everything cancel [kan] for him
ask his wife to come singapore [ah] bring in
he is going back to #johor#
so he's
then after that he's
[oh] he is going back #johor# now
then
no pay leave two months [lah] singapore no pay leave two months [ah]
[ah] then after that bring in the wife come singapore
!huh!
[oh] ya if he bring his wife back to singapore not only him have to pay two thousand for
for two weeks he also have to pay for the wife two thousand so almost five thousand already
then going malaysia
how how long you have to stay
in malaysia if we go malaysia #johor# you have to stay two weeks staycation so not say staycation [lah]
but singapore
the the the cases zero [what] community wise why go there still still need to
subsidise [lah]
I mean if if if now (err) the malaysian cases went up from seven day if let's say from malaysia to come singapore you have to stay before was seven days right now because of the increase in number then become fourteen days make sense but if singaporeans wants to go #johor# knowing singapore cases community cases are zero now
funny [lah] they all anyway
it's okay [lah] at least happy for him [lah] at least you know see his wife
(mm)
investment [lah] it's good investment [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
the two weeks
that one two weeks S_H_N two weeks you stay worse
you never join the apps [ah] they got apps like zumba [lah] exercise [lah] yoga
[ah] then
I also do other things also at the same time I also helping my my
friend doing this (err) food

[ah]
[ah] I see okay [lah]
[ah] so call like a whole set [lah]
[ah]

so he did that also [lah]
but now because of this COVID thing [lah]
so for me nowadays you you see my new family A_J #cusina#
[oh] ya ya ya
no no I'm I'm doing okay now what I'm doing [ah] because
I already moved to a new house already correct so now I'm doing a bakery
food halal filipino food
now I'm doing this halal because right I'm I'm looking at in this in this situation [eh] whereby if let's say you go to
thai vietnamese
since you can cook well why don't we do filipino
halal food because
there is no filipino halal food except
one company
jollibee
ooh
[ah] is a niche there is only halal filipino
cuisine from philippine there is jollibee even there is this called mexican and (err) gerry's grill is also not halal
so why not we do halal filipino food so it came out into the ideas what we now we are doing it like
filipino kind of place [lah] be it bakery cheesecake are all cheesecake muffins are all muffins right but
we put (err) (err) (err)
different taste local of a filipino taste [lah] so yes we did that already so #alhamdulillah# there's a few orders coming in for our cheesecake for our muffin and now being you know now end of the year december right so we are doing roasted chicken lemon pepper
home made [ah]
hopefully [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
correct
[ah]
[ah]
but for now haven't ya so I want to hopefully be the
hopefully [lah] [ah] be the first one to go and open of course restaurant wise still not yet [lah] because capital not not not there yet so now do stuff on home base first (uh) (uh)
ya because why I was inspired by this
by this lady they call it (err)
if you go into this I_G that it's call
thai thai I t~ thai ice tea okay
very simple what she she does is a she's a thai
of convert [lah] then she's thai she convert and then what she did is she sells crepes
okay [lah] good [lah] I was thinking
correct
true
ya [lah]
so ya [lah] so now I'm I'm I'm looking into these areas hopefully [lah] hopefully can can go into this small little corner to to to get something after you know all these
COVID thing a bit of loss of income ten percent pay cut no pay leave some more for days then it's like really like still need to survive being in singapore correct so I think hopefully it it it does helps a bit [lah]
so I I I I will add you don't worry I will add your F_B I know who is this #toklang# right should I accept should I not this is a scam later somebody I also do not know then after that add already [ah] this one [ah] could you give me money this one transfer here !oi! so many nowadays so that why I worried since you say that is your account I will accept and I will add you

he's always on the ship ya travelling I don't know where but I think (err) that kind of job is is quite it piece very well especially if you start from young and I don't think he (um) he is he intends to go uni [ah] because from what I see his career is pretty much set in place ya so
it will be a very rewarding experience
education [ah]
ya so I feel like if everyone has equal opportunity (uh) to have to access (err) to access (uh) all these various (uh) resources I think it will be nice [lah] for everyone ya not saying that (err) the elite schools are better than the neighbourhood schools [lah] I'm not saying that I'm just saying that it will it will be nice if
have a deep interest in school ya because we provide them with all the resources basically resources that they can do [lah]
(mm)
ya
in their head ya
equality versus
equality [ah]
ya I get I get I know ya ya
equity
ya so like if you need more then they give you more if you need less they give you less
everyone has the same amount ya but you are different starting points
[oh] if it is if it's something in that you could wish is free what would it be
time
(err)

(mm) (mm) I know
ya you probably get stomach flu
(mm) staple food [lah]
[orh]
ya ya ya
this interesting interesting and disgusting but ya
(mm) yes
to speak more (err) (err) fluently (mm) you also don't get
to ask me much questions ya ya
ya (mm) sure sure
ya so like
(mm)
I don't know like (err)
like I see that
you have the latest iphone [lah] no [lah] wha~ what phone is that [ah] [orh] [orh] expensive
ya I know apple and their expensive products
(mm) ya actually okay [lah] I mean like (err) it's easy to use but camera wise ya there are some issues some set~ some setbacks the back camera back camera [ah] ya the back camera [lah]
because like certain (err) photos I take like the lens [ah] I don't know why it's not wide or something then it will like zoom in
ya I think I'm not so sure about the others though but I didn't have this problem with my other phones [ah] my samsung and sony I use to use I use to use a sony phone
[ah] I like that so much ya use to be it use to be about music then now they change to camera [lah] ya
they have quite good
camera lens
on their phone ya so ya not bad
but ya but
samsung is like already way way ahead so that's why I
kind (err) drop
like jump ship [lah] samsung [ah] ya ya ya ya ya ya but I don't know is for me it looks it feels weird
or it's just me but it's it's it's it's like weird because
(err) the middle part is like split ya and then when you open it up it becomes like one big tablet or something right
then (uh) I don't I also don't really like tablet as a phone or
things like that [lah] ya okay [lah]
ya
but I see iphone twelve already but I heard what iphone twelve don't have charger [lah]
(mm) ya
the cable [lah]
ya ya you know I think what they use micro U_S_B or something right ya ya
ya so it's been a great time ya
(um)
[ah] so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
(uh huh)
so other than
when you
[ah] yes so is so now when you see for yourself [eh] actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
[ah] I enjoy eating it which is something good [lah] [kan] hopefully
you can cook [ah] more things [lah]
[ah] exercise more [ah] exercise more in the imagination [lah] in reality I won't exercise
[ah] yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
[eh] this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya [lah] ten years ago still can play [lah] but now I think it'd be better
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play [ah] maybe
[ah] if I play football with
[ah] I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become [lah]
doubt so [lah] I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it [lah] don't want to waste my energy [ah]
during the malaysia cup [ah]
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over [lah] first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
[ah] whom is like
and the passion is just not there [lah] I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities [ah]
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
[ah] football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
for the money for the fame [kan] then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
[ah] in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
[ah] I can just [ah] imagine myself to be #ronaldo# or #messi#
on the screen
[kan] if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers [kan]
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
you can basically
contact with the with the people
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things [ah] (um)
(uh huh)
yes
ya so that is the different [lah] people change
[kan] so maybe certain things will be left behind [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time [lah] [kan] cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
[ah] impossible [ah] [kan] [ah]
okay (um)
yes
[ah] behind [kan] then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
[ah] just nice for his [ah]
or his or her development
in the future [lah] even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
[ah] [ah]
yes correct
[ah]
(um)
[ah]
ya [lah]
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
[ah]
[ah] but in terms of travelling
[ah] malaysia [kan]
[ah] [ah] maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia [ah]
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
[ah] (um)
[ah] favourite place [ah] favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay [lah] our singapore dollar is strong [lah] then
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe [kan]
but it's a really complete
(uh) shopping [lah]
for the clothes only [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay [kan] but of course there is there different [lah] when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new [kan] but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is [ah] is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
our kid also will enjoy it more also [lah] [kan]
(uh) but
yes [ah]
[ah] ya [lah] you will set the goal when you go [ah]
[ah] [ah]
[ah] I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part [lah] [kan]
I mean
ya [lah] I think certain things you are more
[ah]
comfortable in handling and
[ah] certain things I am more comfortable in handling [lah] I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
[ah] planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
ya [lah] [ah] when authoritative-ness then
people don't argue with you
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
[ah] then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
[ah]
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay [lah]
[ah]
we are realistic [lah] [kan] what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over [lah] I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small [lah] but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it [kan] so that is the difference
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya
I think for the #jakarta# [one]
when we reach
there we were like [eh]
first thing is the airport [lah]
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
(err) shopping centres (err) in the eighties [kan]
so okay [lah] that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
(uh)
[ah]
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
[ah] something being kept for so long
it's not rotten [ah] it's like the carpet never wash for so long
[ah] [lah]
quite enjoyable [lah] in #jakarta# the
different way of life

the prime minister then even though they are from opposition
when we are inside the van [kan] we can see the certain places which was
[ah] damaged [lah] due to the due to the flood
[ah] then one thing about #penang# ya I remember which is interesting is that
they like to conserve the old buildings
they conserve so they make it part of the building [kan] which is [ah] a bit
but
conserve for the sake of [ah] conserving [ah] sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them [lah] cause they did conserve their [ah]
upside down museum [ah] (um)
singapore rediscovery vouchers [ah]
hopefully it's worth it
life go back a bit more to normal [ah] then we can start our travelling plans at least travel plans doubt so [lah] other countries we cannot control [kan]
but hopefully in singapore we can can do it [lah] [eh]
at least meet up so we won't be so

I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
[ah] maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated [lah] trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
I will go with the majority [lah] and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue [oh] then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can

so we were walking and this guy just make a sharp bend
[eh]
(uh) okay [lah]

and then (um) eric ordered waffle so it was like maybe twenty plus
is [ah] I guess because I think we ordered egg
okay [lah] if you if you think about I can cook this at home ya [lah] it's expensive [ah]
because it's fishball soup and egg that I ordered
like you waste money for what [kan]
COVID right then cannot go
cannot go (err) our neighbouring country
#yishun#

no it's like in the dam it's like not in the dam [lah] like but it's a
smaller reservoir and then it's next to the home team #yishun# #kranji# or something like that

Nerf
paintball paintball
!wah! we should be paid for the information that we've given in this project also

ya
ya
ya unless it's like going to the what ORTO park
[ah] how do you spell it
ORTO ORTO park
okay
you when you go there wasn't anything much [lah] but when you do it at all you know
ya
ya ya ya ya ya I think that is a really good idea
and especially if it's (um)
like evening
would it I think it's better to go in the evening [kan] cause it's not so hot but I think afternoon also it works [ah] [eh]
[oh] ya so we have
we have about three minutes left of this endless
chatting I think we can go on and on but because we are limited to one hour we shall complete our obligation
to complete the one hour for this project
but we have definitely shared a lot of things with you all
ya next time if we get selected next time
ya
talk about hair talk about market
aunty aunty uncle uncle topics [lah] you know but
it's still worth it because who knows when you grow old !duh!
you know we will not thinking of all these things until
until we're what thir~ I dare say thirty plus [ah]
when I was in my thirties then
I'm drawn more into plates and pots
what kind of ladle to use for what
don't buy anyhow pots
rice cooker big small
I still haven't step I still haven't step into a gold shop yet to buy my gold for bangles and
chains and what else not that [one] not my department yet hopefully not yet and ever
ya so we are still a lot into food
into kitchenware
into kids stuff family stuff yes that's something that we are very interested in with
ya
yes while we are still but okay [lah] I think forties is the the the start of
of
appreciating a lot of other things in life
ya man
lifestyles at forty
ya ya ya ya ya
is ya
you see things very differently ya
you appreciate things differently you appreciate different things
that you did not appreciate before
which is which is kind of cool [lah] so no forty is not old forty is just the start of you appreciating life
yes
exactly
ya what used to be ek~
ya
you're right so thank you so much for having us (um)
okay testing
okay [lah] can [lah]
so I think one of the
requirements is that you cannot speak
to the extent of (um) hitting the red waves
yeah
[ah] but it has to be that means twenty C_M apart from each other
no no as in your phone has to be with you my phone has to be with me ya that's one of the requirements [ah]
take this as a the centre marking [ah]
so how was your prep
an obvious day I I kept stalling or like [ah] (um) what about midway but I kept falling at a plaza on you know you have to stop and then you have to turn right then stop again so in between I think my hands too aggressive or I keep releasing too fast or something like that [lah] so the bottom when moving then the stall those told you do
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but what what was the instructor's comments
(mm)
the same instructor
I think they they they want more money [ah]
it's the same bike
(mm)
E brake [eh]
[oh] okay okay ya [ha] ya it's there [ah] okay wait it was on the straight road
ya there's one mirror there
ya
(mm)
behind [ah]
[oh] okay
secluded [ah]
okay
(um)
of course [lah]
wait you went you you stop to help her
[oh] the instructor went to help her
ya [lah] I mean he has to help him help her
just ya
[oh] she
ya correct ya
(mm)
(mm)
what so she crashed into the wall
skid [ah]
by point of time you stop [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
kill switch
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
[oh] you get you got number one [ah]
(mm)
bandana
(mm)
(mm)
the other side [ah]
then
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
but he was in charge of your class [ah]
prac one also [lah]
[oh] okay
(hmm)
no [lah] maybe maybe they they want you to practise more [ah] before even going for prac two because I think prac two is
slope
plank
plank easy I mean no [lah] some some beginners will have quite a hard time to balance
class two ten seconds
okay [lah] I mean with practice you can [ah]
you technically don't need to even throttle because half clutch
no you need to brake also because class two B half clutch ya can go up to fifteen already [ha]
that's how fast a class two bike is [ah]
which is why I can't wait to get to get my harly [ah]
highly harly can bobber [ah] you know those bobbers bike mutt is expensive [lah] [sia] (uh) U_K I I I tested the bike (um)
I think last year during (uh)
so when they they they open up their their booth
people [lah] so I tried the the two fifty version
so that is two B version one two five
there's a two five zero
you gonna end up the same as riding a
two hundred C_C bike
whatever what you see is what you get [lah]
I don't know is it
I I'm not sure what that retailers that brings but
(uh) #sanju#
#kaki bukit# #sanfu# #sanfu#
(uh) and I think the
for a two B bike you know much the is the cost price
seven [ah] seventeen K
[eh] sorry sorry two B is fifteen K two A is seventeen K
four K
four plus [ah]
expensive [ah]
definitely way cheaper [lah] I mean it's a if it's a continental bike but it comes from china so
no no no I mean (uh) zontes
if you look at mutt it's almost the same as my bike [ah] brixton
but of course [lah] mutt is mutt is
I mean way better [lah]
[eh] (um) if I trade in my brixton for your mutt
can we make an arrangement
[oh] I'm sorry because we are just we are just dealing but
(uh) brixton is is is a europe bike [ah]
if if you really want a mutt then I think it's best if you can try to sell it out ya
(um)
you should upgrade to two A first
then you you take your class two
not used to the the no not only heavy the high power
but waste money [ah]
you upgrade
(mm)
[ah] [lah] of course [lah] of course [lah]
no [lah] I mean I'm looking at my options
why [ah]
ya but super four is (uh) quite reliable bike [ah]
it is
ya no problem
they bring down the the C_C of the bike
put a
(mm)
but the one thing about super four
it's freaking expensive [ah] [sial]
my my bike one bottle that means one litre [lah] so doings
no no no as in the engine oil every two thousand click to three thousand click
no [lah] one month [ah] I mean right now COVID one month [ah]
back then [eh] no [lah] back then when I was working in (uh)
when I was working in office
I travelled about sixty click everyday
that it took me about one month [ah] to to to reach two click two thousand click
going back to super four
you know how many bottles of engine oil they need [ah]
four
four bottles of engine oil four spark plug
four
I mean some some bikes have like we just okay [lah] harly's have okay harly even harly
would only require three bottles
and maybe two spark plug
four bottles of okay [lah] let's say if you use the most basic engine oil but if you're riding a Super Four I'm pretty sure you want maintain you probably get the medium
motul (uh) ten fifty or ten forty that is about twenty four dollars twenty five dollars so that's times four that's about a hundred bucks already
and then spark plug if you get
the good spark plugs N_G_K [ah]
normal spark plugs is about twelve dollars
so twelve times four
that's why [lah] I mean one of the reasons why didn't want to get a super four
like what
is it
it's nice [lah] I mean it looks bigger than the
ya
capacity
(mm)
[oh]
ya [lah] and I mean if you think about it a zontes is way cheaper [ah]
no the furthest I went with this bike was (um) #desaru#
the furthest I went with my R_X_Z was (uh) #muar#
ya ya [lah]
(um)
tow [ah]
they will go for the
the dangerous way [ah]
this one I I never tried [ah] I tried I fail I don't know how it works so imagine you were in front of me imagine your bike died
so I'm the one who is pushing you [ah]
so you've lift down your foot rest
my left leg
(uh) power to push together
[ah]
[eh]
they went up
I don't know but a few delivery riders [ah]
so this guy what was a cyclist
he passed his two B
so when you are you are running I mean it it it's the same for new bikes so when you're running in your your new bike or (uh) a new overhauled engine
(um)
you're not supposed to exceed a certain R_P_M and certain speed
your speed has to be less than ninety like I mean that's what I did for my bike [lah]
so this guy
I think chances of you surviving is
very little
jammed brake
you're just depending on your depending on your brake
bike off
just put it to neutral [lah]
speaking of bike accidents
(uh) my father's friend [ah]
eagle is it
and then I think he was riding an R_X_Z
so this the rider
my father witnessed his friend died [lah] [sia]
so so
before this guy died [ah] he told me [lah] then he was very different
[eh] you know forgive me [ah] if I ever sinned towards you [ah]
so on that day they went to J_B
but same case [ah] he went under the truck
it's dangerous [ah]
[oh] speaking of dangerous riding [kan] I think one of their simulation lessons [kan]
they will simulate
you drunk
but it's damn stupid [ah] [sial]
no pass no fail
is just car just swerve in front of you
cannot
you turn using your handlebar
handlebar
you can [ah] but then it's stupid [ah]
it's just stupid
your leg on your bike [ah]
everything it's like a normal back
it's like a real bike
it's a fonex
I think when when when it comes to your simulation lesson I think
can
but you will hold the bike [ah] no need no need no need
you driving in india is it
!huh!
he mounted the kerb in the mini circuit where is the ke~ kerb [sia]
that is far [sia]
(mm)
ya ya
!huh!
!huh! serious [ah]
[oh] the bike was lying on top
where were you
at the starting [ah]
he went home [ah]
it means quite quite bad [lah]
old guy [ah]
but big size [ah]
#hazriq# size [ah]
it but your class good
they they they there's this one small bike [ah]
I see that bike [ah]
!alamak!
what the guy is small or big
why [sia] why would he buy such a bike
no [lah] I mean if you scared I mean don't ride [ah]
maybe [ah]
but if you talk about those small bike [ah]
those those similar those kind of bikes [ah]
(um) there's this bike it's called (uh) honda monkey
but that bike is I I've seen this guy he he modelled his bike [ah] he'd turn that back into a chopper bike
like legit I had to bend down
because cafe racer is a racer is a racing bike
I mean for the olden days [lah] which is why it's it's called a cafe racer
so
I don't know [ah]
(mm)
go back to office [ah]
so you're gonna take you bikes [ah]
stupid [eh]
!huh!
you can book everyday
legit [ah]
[oh]
if got two days later
(mm)
(mm)
then you exceeded the line [ah]
[oh] exceeded the line means fail because if you are too fast also if you you stop in time they shouldn't be an issue [ah]
that was your last [ah]
assessment
fail [ah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
[oh] S_A_C_C
(mm)
if there is a car you need to stop [ah]
[ah]
serious
(mm)
(mm)
bike instructor
[ah] serious [ah]
what if you hit into a car
who is the !huh! then the the damage all S_A_C_C cover is it
(mm)
ya
no no no you have to okay so back then when I took a private [kan] the one I failed
so you will
as a start you will drive on the road
so it's

speaking of which
because back then (uh)
deliveroo APAC office was beside youtrips office
in (uh) robinson road
so whenever they had trainings they don't have to go there where so at that point of time me and #shida# was was still okay [lah] and then you know we were talking and stuff

!huh! serious you said that [ah]
when was this
is it
youtrip slightly toned down [ah] but
same
so it was just nice when I call you [ah]
is it
you had to think [eh]
ya correct ya
(mm)
ya
okay
legit
the contract
[oh] ya ya ya ya
so you went to work first and then you interviewed later kind of stupid shit is this
(mm)
[oh] okay okay I get it I get it
who ask you
then
(mm)
I don't know I I I've lost contact
subtle
(mmhmm)
because because I mean how I find out was I shared with her a lot of things she go and #pao#
there are things I didn't like about the the whole how they
I'm fine thank you
how's your family
[ah]
ya second one is a boy right
[oh] I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
[oh]
(uh) I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it (um) you might know them because some of them are our former [ah] schoolmates
[oh] you're into baking now !wah! that's nice !wah! must try some of your cake soon [ah]
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
[ah] movie but [ah] during this pandemic kind of hard [lah] because I think with the crowd control and all
!wah! net~ netflix and chill [ah]
(err) I don't know (uh) only so far only a few have confirmed but (uh)
I will update you [ah] on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can [lah] (uh)
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
[ah]
(um) but is it too young for them to start
(um) going to tuition at this age she's only six years old [kan]
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that (err) everyone is competing (uh) so
it's
it has its pros and cons [ah] like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
ya but
slowly [lah] but surely (uh) I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important [lah] they just try their best [lah]
and
I I do have other maybe (uh) I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
[oh] [oh]
[orh] okay okay I understand I can ask for you [lah] then
(err) we'll see what we can arrange
(err)
!wah! you sit down at coffeeshop [ah] I thought you #atas# [one]
[oh] you you full time housewife [ah]
good [lah]
actually it's better for to me [lah] personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
(um) like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore (err) I think (err)
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive [ah] then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day (uh) some owners also like abuse their maid [lah] so that's not right [lah] I feel
ya there's (uh) the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse [ah] think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news [lah] but you just have to be updated [lah] now with the
COVID nineteen [ah] I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that [lah] before they are cleared to do cleaning [oh] (mm)
[oh] must take care of your health now [lah]
like but I think if now if you go to any
(uh) G_P I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days M_C and ask you to monitor
ya [lah] for those who are working [lah] they will give you like
to check on yourself
(err) so that that because they don't want this to spread
a~ around right
[ah]
(uh) #alhamdulilah# so far
I'm okay [lah] maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest (uh) because of work [ah]
(um) politic [lah] then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what (uh)
safety measure measurement at work (mm) cause yes
now currently we have this installation (uh) of #doraemon# at the national museum it's interesting [lah] but
unless I'm there [lah] then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
[ah]
(uh)
(uh) claim it
[oh] usually you go to #johor# [ah] and do your shopping
I think so far our government has done well [lah] to control ya ya cause if not think like in the U_S like getting worse
(mm)
[oh]
[ah] so it's like
(uh) they have different sizes [lah] and
(uh) they cater also for kids
(mm)
(mm)
ya true
ya
ya but surprisingly
I think they are currently
preparing [ah] for phase three to roll out but ya [lah] depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert [lah] it's important [lah] for us to be on alert
[ah] foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
you know
stay home notice ya
and I think (uh) for those who are coming in I think
(uh) they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure [ah] I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required [lah] [eh] even when they come in they have to do the swab test [lah]
[ah]
ya thankfully
a
(mm) yes yes
(uh) I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the (uh) the con~ conduct the test
was (mm) asked to leave I think he got a job as a security [lah] (err) and considered is also a high risk because (err) he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm (uh)
but actually they're paying quite
high [lah] is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the P_P_E the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that [lah] because they don't want to
be in contact [ah] ya don't want to be exposed to this (uh) and even when he he's finished his job think he ask (uh) his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can (uh) remove his clothes outside his house (uh) ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace [lah] so it's just an
additional steps [ah] precaution ya
[ah]
ya you see
[ah] so it's not easy [ah] it's quite
ya I think ya the government
our government com~ has taken like
a few cartons [eh] I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe [lah]
got some quality is not that good [ah]
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask [ah]
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but
no [lah] I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last [lah] (err) for a few months then but you have to
wash [lah] I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse [lah]
(mm)
(err) according to the
safety measurement I think
(mm)
ya can okay [lah] that's an idea but
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
(mm)
[ah] three [kan] (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
feels also quite sad [lah] for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something [ah] but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad [lah] but it's better than not having no job and all [lah] ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya [lah]
ya [lah] it's tiring [lah] even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now (uh) doing grab but grab is also affected (err) think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he (uh) took back the car ya but still it's not doing well [lah] he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental (uh)
to the family [lah]
(mm) true [lah] I think
the government implementing a lot of (err) help for those
whi~
need them [ah] they also I think they have set up this (um) S_G united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need [lah] ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march [ah] I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya [lah] things will get better [lah] think I think for singaporean [ah] they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases [ah] that can affect us
#prata#
(uh) there's a #prata# at #sin ming# I think it's quite nice it's run by a family (uh) father and a son
can can (um)
can [ah] maybe I want to try eat the #briyani# [ah]
the #briyani# is quite nice [ah] I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best [ah]
(err) what do you want to order I help you order
the #briyani# or the #prata# coin is also nice
and it's
I think just the right
taste [ah]
can
(uh) I think I eat #briyani# with (uh) fried chicken [lah] (mm) because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking [ah]
then what drinks do you want
#teh# #peng# #teh# #peng#
#teh# with ice [eh]
ya but I think is not that good to always drink #teh# with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better [lah] at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health (err) and also see what eat we eat
[ah] and also see what we eat
okay
can
(uh)
anything else
!wah! there's a lot of people in the queue
ya
digital
(uh) you order [lah] since you are very good using app
(um) #briyani# chicken
bir~ ya fried chicken
(mm)
[ah] yes
[oh] so we have to pick up or
[oh] okay [oh] that's
ya I understand but (err) I volunteered with (err) an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food (err) to buy groceries so that they will minimize (err) their movement outside [ah] so they can actually (err) contact us and have like medi~ medication
(uh) you can buy for them and then send it to their homes (um)
ya [lah] I think it's a long way to help our seniors (uh)
because I think if they are exposed to this I think (um) probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is (uh) I think done by government agencies [ah] they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors (uh) so that they will not be exposed much [ah] so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies [ah] then we will be there to send groceries medication (uh) food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer [lah] through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask [eh] for more information [lah] ya
(um)
free [ah]
(mm)
ya
communication
is
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
data
(mm)
[oh] the air bubble for hong-kong ya I also heard that but ya
think it takes a lot of effort [ah] to go back like we were normal I think this is the new normal [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya think
when it gets better I think we have to follow the
safety measurement ruling ya there's a lot of new policies that they will come up with and we just have to abide [lah]
[ah]
the social distancing [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
[ah] social distancing ambassador
(mm)
[ah]
[oh] main~ not maintenance [ah]
[oh] ya that's true I don't know but last time got the
[ah]
then you just like !woo! like that
[oh] okay okay okay
shortcut

ya
carousell for at like two hundred dollars
a new wardrobe
!huh!
[ah]
it was okay [lah] (um) they ask me a lot of question I think it's like very normal questions were only there they ask me like so what what caught me off guard was that (err) they ask me so what's your five year plan
you know like you know you don't think about it so much until you are being asked the question and then for a moment I just sat there [jer] !siala! what is my five year plan
(err) there's a position that opens up in a different department and (um) my manager thinks that I would be better in that then that is also something that I can also kind of move towards to [ah]
cause inspiration and aspiration is like what then I was like this needs time because I will not on that day I was a bit like sleepy for the interview so I just like okay (mm) answering the question never then they ask me something like what's your aspiration I think I said something but it wasn't that clear he ask me again and I said the same thing then he say okay nevermind
okay nevermind
I think it's how you phrase it if like my aspiration is to be able to be a role model when trainees [ah] sharing my knowledge and empower them that they too can be just as good or even better so it should be your it could be like [oh]
but it gives me a very nice (err)
[oh] long time like super long time well I'm not sure how long but definitely very long [oh] they are very stable like but I think I think it's a nicer I I feel that is a the whole interview kind of put you at ease you know so it doesn't make you feel tense outright so the way you answer also is not so formal
so it gives you the idea of okay you know I can (err) I can say a bunch of things but at the same time also it's like [oh] I'm not gonna penalize you for how you say it about like [eh] so what you want do you for five years [ah] [ah] you know like you like you could say like !huh! five years [ah] !wah! I never really think about it [eh] and and that's that's fine because you are being honest right but you know but but it's also (err)
you also answer like [oh] never really think about it [eh] but I also feel like five years I want to achieve personal milestones that I have set for myself in example like I want to take up a diploma in five years I wanna see myself radiating from it
I know five years for a diploma is long [lah] but you know you are working you could only part time you know you could fail a module also whatever but at least you can besides this coming to the questions I answer [lah] so I actually googled I usually before my interviews I would google some stuff yes just to prepare yourself and also it gives you an idea it's good to be prepared anyway
so give you an idea of like okay what you could use as an answer so and it was just because it's COVID right during the COVID pandemic period so I say [ah] [oh] [ah] I actually I never really think that far because in this COVID situation it's difficult to foresee (um) so far ahead because everything is still very cloudy
but I also feel I want to be able to achieve (um) more things
which is true I I think it's also like (um) I I feel like you you can be choosy but it has to be to a certain degree like I'm not saying that [oh] (err) in in example that I used to earn five K I only want to look for jobs for five K what if there are no jobs for five K [oh] you know what if there is some other jobs that
if you [eh] I give you three point five [lah] you want or not you don't want because why you because you wanna you wanna pay me five K exactly but also during pandemic [what] so people are if there's there's all these companies doing cost saving also [what] right so I think you choose your job
then how are you I mean yes I know it's during a pandemic but how are you going to like you know gain experience in this tough time how do you want to gain experience in a different (um) setting it's all about how you make it (um) you make it work in the in in this stuff [kan] [lah] fourteen december
it has been like what five years and if it's another five years it will be like ten years
I mean my part~ my my business partner always ask me like so when are you going to come back to do the brand full time
of course I said for now it's a bit difficult like because I have other commitments to to juggle with maybe and then yesterday when I met her she ask me so how do I like the job yes I do like the job like
I mean like I have a new colleague so it's it's better now and I'm getting used to the job demand just that (um)
I don't want to be too greedy [lah] like to always do like different side projects is quite tiring yes so I just focus on my plan and this job
and I'm applying for house the B_T_O so I don't know if I if I would get the sales of balance flats or if not cheaper ones if not have a resale like buy buy a resale !wah! that's that's okay too
yes but if you buy a resale then if it's like an older block the renovation costs I mean if the previous owners kept the house clean and decent and there's nothing much to pack [ah] but if it's sales of balance flats as in like no one has lived there before not that bad I feel cause it's a brand new house but it depends on location
yes I know your work right (um) about your own brand so she will your business partner ask you in a way whether you wanna do full time then it's there
(err)
you know it's funny when you you talk about that so like my current
it's the same people who say that kind of things to me at work and yet
billing up to like five six hundred dollars
yes you don't say [lah] hello you know your five hundred dollar is equal to like five thousand dollars to some people you don't hello exactly a part of me is like !wah! you say this kind of things [ah]
but you can spend five hundred dollar in my store and five hundred dollars sometimes it's just like two item three items
and and (err) we are on we are on the third floor right and then we can also see the crowd in the first and second floor so the first floor is two iconic brands like in every single household there would at least be one item I mean not every single household [lah] but you know on an average
(mm)
they are big paper bags that means they are handbags and you know the value of handbags is in not small amount okay we put minimum say three thousand !wow!
!wow!
I could spend three thousand in one day but I don't have three thousand to spend
okay
how much was it so did you not cancel the subscription
why wouldn't you want to cancel if you don't have sixty dollars to spend
in things that requires subscription there's always a minimum of seven days for you to unsubscrbe before it gets charged
dude that is why they have the terms and condition that you need to read yes and you woke up the next day did you hello
has it passed seven days I mean if you can read up [lah] I'm sure they give you the invoice right then it will come with the terms and conditions right but for subscription you can actually cancel [lah] but if you have paid for the one year and technically you have just use like what a few weeks so most to most they gonna charge you for one month
then there is that possibility of they refunding the last eleven months I don't know or what you can do so you remember when I was looking for their french company we were also doing subscription right so you know what they do they they look at their bank account [eh] there's a there's a transaction of this amount they call up their bank and they say it's fraud and then the bank will automatically (um)
do a a charge dispute to that company so that means our company so we have to refund them
yes yes yes yes so people say why am I getting charged for this I didn't (err) I didn't I didn't I didn't sign up for this so what they would do is they will call the bank hello there's a fraudulent transaction on my card then the the bank will say [oh] it was charged to this company do you remember signing up for any sort of no I only went to their website (err) can it can I request a charge back I want a refund
and then they will do it they will say okay madam you will receive your refund in the next fourteen to to how many days and the money goes back to your account [eh] you should do it really you you laugh it's actually how it is how do you think I do the charge back all the time I'm not telling you to be a cheapo but it it's not a necessity and in this trying times you should save money bro
see that's why you shouldn't play with your phone when you are half asleep sure like that would work later you will only sleeping closer to the charger
well I'm thinking of getting (um) this collagen I don't have swiss I thought I have doctor say I don't so I don't
(err) it's the security
yes yes yes I went for everything for the scan for the test the cancer cancerous test the basic test and all the test that is required so
so I can take collagen
[ah] yes
so what I'm doing now cause it's black friday right black friday gonna be friday saturday sunday monday cause cyber monday but so I look at the website and then (err) #kinohitmisu# and then
the website is selling like sixty bottles for ninety eight bucks
the first when you start the first six days is one bottle a day then subsequently it's once every two to three days yes so it's kinda like a two month worth [lah] or three right
and then (um)
yes I do but my new job requires me to wear safety shoes yes
even so everybody yes so you know when I enter the office right everybody was in uniform and in safety shoes
so that's why you have to wear safety shoes for safety reasons
monday to friday yes
yes duty area is different [ah]
but my for me it's office hours [ah] [oh] my god yes four years I mean okay [lah] I think is okay yes and then also like like
you know sometimes when you afternoon shift then you come in the afternoon then the bus and the train is not so not so
definitely
that is true
then weekend where you want to go go out [lah] with your kid go to town don't want to shop also you shop see see look look
(err) doctor say to take it once every three months
but it's it's not wise to take pills on a regular because then [eh] it's only functioning because it was induced not because it's happening naturally therapy yes actually
what supplement are you taking (mm)
so after ten days cannot
#satay# mushrooms [oh] my god
so it's like indian milk tea [ah]
can you imagine if you went vegetarian (mm)
yes but because we grew up with that right yes
but they can also make you broken
same we also we have been practicing that ever since then
and then I took the train and then because my sister my sister-in-law had to go to the office today so I ask her [eh] I'm going to take train you want come with me then she left so we went together her workplace raffles place job street
I miss working in C_B_D [what] it's so colourful you know colourful because it's so vibrant you see lunch time all these people going out for lunch and you see that so of course C_B_D [what] right and then I say it's so different you get to see so many people and I love to go watching during lunch time
so you get to see locals #dabaoing# their food and then we have the #ang mohs# you know eating salad and then (err) [oh] I remembered this really good salad place it's called platypus
!wah! it's so good it's like you you have (um) you choose your main it's either spinach or romaine and then after that you get to choose your sides meaning you get to add your pasta or cream meatball or something something you know and my go to is always spinach and cream meatball
yes then it's good bro I tell you
of course [lah] there's tomatoes so my mains are like spinach I don't like romaines no I think at that point of time they had like two outlets in C_B_D two outlets in raffles place itself but I don't know I think they close down now
yes but nice [ah] I like it K so that that's where my love for salads yes it's not
yes chippy reminds me of home mousse we very long never eat chippy [oh] my god what is wrong with us

that's true
I remember #mook# was doing his blood his meal prep [oh] my god

you know speaking of that right there's one tag so this lady this was when the first few first few I think the first few years of month after my mum passed then she invited me over to her house
so so she was so she was doing this M_L_M thingy yes and then she was telling me (uh) good you
you should try and and venture into this and I say !huh! what's this then I'm like !huh!
I meant that during that time I was busy with my work and then I had the moment I'm done with work I have to come home to make sure that you know the house is clean there are that I cook dinner for the family or whatever whatever right where got time [sia] want to go do M_L_M meet people all you think I'm not tired or what then after that she tell me you know she just looked at me

but portugal ya
!hais! whe~ when can we travel [ah]
(uh) exact date I'm not sure but I know it's
february (um) coincides I think with chinese new year
yes
so when is chinese new year
I don't know [leh]
no I think should be
I think (err) mid [eh]
should be mid right
ya I think so
who who getting married
but all in like (um)
you shouldn't have made that statement
yes I'm from griffiths primary school
come on
o~
[ah] I don't
maybe if I see the face I can somehow recall [lah] but
seems familiar
from griffiths primary [ah] thirty years old also
I need I need to open my primary school year I don't know whether year book or
(mm) okay
so then the like like you ask like part of the questions you you guys ask is like what's what primary school you are from like how you all know
ya [lah] griffiths (uh) primary is the one next to my place [ah]
[ah]
no no ya now renamed to #angsana#
ya
but is it ya the enrolment
#angsana# griffiths I mean that location is always very low as compared to
ya the other two schools
because they are better schools I guess
ya
may~ maybe like past years like
I don't know maybe or or the teachers there are better I don't know
tiger parents
tiger parent
yes
[ah] speaking of which
[ah]
[ah]
then (err)
ya
okay [lah]
ya
so anyway like that [ah] so I don't know what's the arrangement for her
wha~ [oh] how much is your battery percentage
are you sure
if it's red then you need to quickly get your charger
!woohoo!
!wah!
so the kid
but he's not present [lah] for that two months or he's still [orh]
[orh]
ya
but is he like going to like another
school
nearer [lah] in that sense
yes I think you should maybe it's going to be it definitely it will be better [lah] because the only considered like the
the trouble is is him right
very good inclusivity
but on~ ya
ya
(mm)
ya
I think as long as it's kids
you deal with ya
ya
(uh) ya
[oh]
[ah]
ya it's like like you can actually at towards the end of the year the school will actually send us like a form so we can kind of like indicate (uh) like what's our preference like what subject we prefer to teach
I think I think the head of departments and also I think should be the s~ the principals [ah]
ya H_O_D (uh) head of departments usually they have lesser teaching periods
yes they do teach ya but lesser because they are holding a
leadership role right so theirs it's more like like like helming the
ya
like timetable before it's like one day is only like
maybe three four periods
ya
then the rest all like I don't know [lah] what they do
you know settle some like don't know [lah] some urgent stuff
what they will do like they will be tagged for relief teaching [eh]
ya
I think like H_O_D can earn up to five
ya
because like normal teachers
[orh] [ah]
I think (err)
normal teachers like around three K four K
depends on again ya because I've seen a payslip before did I told you
ya because like like we our printer at work is like [eh] I mean my previous school [lah]
it's a common printer
so and then is like because my current school the printer works as such that you send a printing job then there's a common printer you key in your password and then you will see what's your printing job then you print
[ah]
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
so so what's the ranking actually for for early childhood like
like
teacher
(mm)
so tha~ I mean like there's
!wow! so deep [sia]
where you at what you at what you're at now
yes
[ah]
okay
[ah] [ah]
so priority a~ according to priority
okay name me three
s~
!aww!
#inshallah#
okay
no
so it's like practically
so
ya
(mm)
I think so I do not know maybe
no [ah] no
ya
ya why I look different
ya [lah] it has always been this ya but (um)
ya
but (um)
something that I need to tell you about this spectacle
no I didn't buy specs I buy something cheaper I buy super glue
so after that ya ya but [eh] I think is that [one] is reading glasses maybe
ya
[eh] it has this listing [eh] it will stick
[orh]
[orh]
[orh]
then then
(hmm)
fun~ [eh] that's the functional light right
you buy that all the way from
so the switch is there [ah] the one
ya
okay [what] nice [what] so when you sleep you will switch on that light
[orh]
ya ya ya I know
I know I sleep with you
!huh!
[ah]
!huh!
wait
[orh] yes yes yes
[oh] my god one A_M
on a working day
then what time you woke up just now
then you should feel like
when you're surely
so you know they do it [lah] now
ya
ya
cause somehow when you're in that situation you know you have to do it you do it right
yes
[orh]
but because I think you got a lot of things already is it sometimes is the
[orh]
okay [lah] ya [lah]
but uni
ya
because that time I think (uh)
whether like (um) like
actually I don't think it's two I think it's three you know
ya
they do the editing and stuff is the third floor
ya
so ya [lah]
that's the thing
but I think I kind of know where's the new location at
ya I think there's a pool and there's a gym right
ya
so I think it's somewhere in the east side I think (err) central port
it's (err) #geylang# #geylang#
I think [ah] I think I may be wrong but I guess that's the location
ya maybe it's there or around the area
but I think it should be
east side
because he stays in the east
ya
east coast plan [what] east coast plan
ya
I think I think #bedok# area
[eh]
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya I was like !aww!

(mmhmm)
[eh] [eh]
!wah!
no [lah] okay first few times he asked me
I mean I don't want to say his name [lah]
but ya
then like after that people keep asking me
like we exchanged stories [lah] and then turns out that he has been asking around
and then like he has never bought his own pack of cigarettes which is like weird
[oh] no
until a certain while we all stopped giving and then he like go to another group of people to ask like
like
and like the cheese is there
ya
(um) mostly like indian malay food [lah] know the the normal kind
woodlands [eh]
like
make you put on put on weight faster
okay
(mm)
#satay# [eh]
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
google maps says that there is a bus
high S_E_S [eh]
(mm)
!wah!
I don't think I can make it [lah] if I wanna go venture into that kind of industry
(mm)
straight ahead
okay so
turn left here and then we got to take the overhead bridge
[ah] okay I can see already I can see the lights from here
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
the night is still young [seh]
you know that I have oversized shirts right
!wah! grabhitch [eh]
very lucky
ya grabhitch very rare you know people get grabhitch
I mean I feel like it depends on your luck [what] because like let's say the driver is going wherever you're going
and then the driver happens to be in the same area as you
then you will get it [what]
(mm)
[ah] okay [lah]
(mm) (mm)
!wah!
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
#az#
people say
don't cry over spilled milk [tau]
for my birthday but then we cannot go #bali# right so I want to eat indonesian food
(mm)
okay [lah] that's like
soon in six days
but we need to
save some money for dinner [lah] if you want to plan for dinner
(mm)
do you think that our generation our malay language is
sort of like bad
because I think our generation don't use malay words
very often
at home okay for myself [lah] in my opinion at home also
I mean I think for my
household situation I speak to my mum to all my family members in english
speak
(mm)
no okay do you even okay maybe you do [lah] but do you think that majority of the population know their neighbours do you think that they like everyone would actually
talk to their neighbours nowadays
not really like what if they close their doors
and windows
ya
(mm)
(mm)
I think we grew up differently [lah]
[ah]
I wanted to watch a movie because it's been a while since we I don't know about you it's been a while since I last watched a movie and then
(uh) wonder woman two
it's coming out soon
[eh] wonder woman [seh]
that's the villain [lah] for this movie
I don't think you need
I don't think you need to be a fan [seh] to watch a movie a movie is a movie just appreciate what has been created it's like it's an art
you have to appreciate what has been given to you
it's gonna be so
(mm) (mm)
money makes the world go round [eh]
ya [lah]
but
(mm)
(uh) maybe we do something different [lah] you know that they have this like
you know those (uh) escape rooms
in the room itself they have this new one
where its virtual rea~ reality
world [ah] through the eyes
ya anyways those V_R (uh) virtual reality rooms ya we can consider doing that I think
I think it's about
forty five minutes [ah]
okay [lah] if you calculate it's like one minute one dollar
you have to accommodate to (um) all the group who you know that (uh) not all our friends like to LAN right
(mm) (mm)
but the future is bleak right now bro
that's why we are balanced
!hais!
[eh]
(mm) (mm)
and then my next pay probably is twenty twenty one
new year new me !wah!
(um)
ya
so
!huh! that's a I think this topic of like what to eat
it's like
a deep dark hole you know
because like
so much difficulties thinking about what to eat
what to eat nevermind you you need to think about whether you want to order in and then like there's the delivery fee and all that to consider
context of
having the difficulty to
choose what to eat
(mmhmm)
catching
(mm)
okay
so
ya
!wah! !wah! !wah! !wah! !wah!
ya [lah] because twenty dollars divide by six people
(mm)
too emotional sometimes
it's true
(hmm)
okay [lah]
I mean it's just like A_S_M_R to some people
and
the booking for the staycation
wait so need to let them know [lah] tomorrow morning
no because we never talk about when to tell them
so we need to let them know tomorrow morning when we wake up on the way to work
[eh] just message the group [lah] we have a group
[ah]
wait is it
I was looking at the finan~ furnitures [lah] to like maybe buy I don't know I haven't make any decisions yet
but have you seen the loft bed
the linie loft bed
I mean ya the our website [lah] bedandbasics our company website then after that I was looking at this linie loft bed
and then I mean the price is on the higher end
but the bed looks so good the black one
wasted
why
the what
what promotion
how much was the promotion
!huh! spend six hundred doll~ wait wait wait wait wait spend six hundred dollars get fifty dollars off you can use on the spot
so that's five hundred fifty [lah]
but okay that doesn't matter [ah]
because I didn't have money back then so
but ya now I have money and I'm looking at the furniture and the furniture looks good the black colour one
like
the the I don't know [lah] maybe it was the picture the the whole aesthetic of it with the T_V and the nift loft bed
ya I'm living for that like
I want that kind of
design now in my room
because
I would from the from the plant by the side
I want it there also
I mean the T_V can be different [lah]
because I wanna buy a better brand better quality T_V
then buy like a a sofa bed and then like that will be used as a sofa
ya
I've seen the reviews
and like
on all the
e-commerce or like startups from like bloggers vloggers or whatever
a lot of them give good reviews
and another one was the
[ah] LUMOS aura projector
and then [ah] projector
ya and I but because like I don't know I can't decide whether I wanna buy a T_V or the projector
I don't know because like there's pros and cons for both
because let's say if I move out with a projector is easier
then with a T_V it's more bulkier but then if I want to play games or anything
like
cause ya [lah]
[ah] adulting is so hard sometimes you know
ya
so
I don't know
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
[kan] I also had that concept
money is a big factor
can you imagine we find the you know there was this mouse hunt recently
the ten thousand dollars mouse hunt by the squeaky (uh)
[ah] the concept is like that you find
the winner who the winner who finds it will get ten thousand dollars
can you imagine the amount of money
and then we still have spare
we can (uh) I mean
divide [lah] the money then I would probably wanna buy like a lap~ a new laptop
for school
(mm) (mm)
#alhamduls#
(mm) all the best for that
like that's the thing about humans [lah]
when you get extra
complain when you get shortage complain it's like our culture
!hais!
I would prefer to spend that money on food then on grab
ya [lah]
[kan] the first few music we won't be sleeping also
cause like we will get comfortable
what [lah] you don't want to watch like this
(mm)
so come come up with a new idea [eh]
munch nibble on something
it's cool
thick and juicy
[a'ah]
(mm) (mm)

(err) ya of course I prefer (err) advanced planning so I don't like it when (um) (err) for me that that is also one thing that annoys me ya
(err) but it's okay to me things happen I'll try to be more understanding ya but the real thing that will make me feel (um) annoyed is when

our tastes ya
correct
ya
ya
you know she might not like it and she'll object to the place like for example I want to
ya so it's all
depends
correct
ya
okay previously [kan] (err) I was studying overseas [kan] so (err) it was such a
still prefer to (um) to the winter season
how about you do you like autumn spring spring
ya ya it's it's like
[oh] okay
ya
autumn okay
what's the point of you wearing in singapore but that's the only time you get to (um)
ya
next few trips ya hopefully hopefully
[oh] okay
ya
(mm)
okay
[oh] ya
okay
have you tried
bullet train okay okay
I see
but ya
but it's okay (um)
so maybe you can bring me you can be my tour guide tour guide
okay
but okay (um)
(uh) does it feel does it feel like do you feel like it's like an interview
I think I'm too used to (err) having conve~ formal conversation so it sounds like an interview to you sorry
(err)
secondly is the fear of height I I am not afraid to ride a roller coaster but then what makes me scared of it is like because it's quite high and then
(um) ya I just
ya I can still look through the window I still ya
okay
okay
(mm) ya
a new experience and I thought that I wouldn't be afraid or I won't like you know
(err) you know I won't be scared of it but apparently (uh) ya I was having a hard time so I didn't look down so I was like looking in front but
but how about (um)
I mean for you I mean what is your what do you fear actually
really you look you look like so manly
really
(mm)
a bee stung [ah]
[oh] okay
[ah] okay
sponge then you touch it is it
then
[oh]
did you shout
can you can you try to (err) you know like reenact I would love to see your expression
[oh] okay
went away ya
I I don't know the the name of the spider
hairy next so what kind of spi~
ya ya ya [oh] no
speaking of spiders ya I
don't quite like insects also
yup so
that's interesting
(mm)
ya
so (um)
ya
carry (err)
okay okay
okay
you tried
[oh]
!huh! in thailand
okay
(mmhmm)
cocoon
okay (mm)
because (err) some people always say that okay obviously (um) the
(err) obviously is like (um) the the the insects that is sold (um) for you to like can be consumed they say that it's (err) clean but you know it's clean (um)
but I still find disgusting even though like (um) they say it's very crunchy ya ya but I'll even if someone were to (um) to offer me like maybe one hundred dollars or something to eat it I would still say no cause it's disgusting but I've actually witness a couple of friends who ate it in front of me and they said that it's it doesn't taste like
(err) you know it taste like some white crackers or it taste like chips or don't know what it's like very crispy crispy kind ya so it's like I wouldn't I wouldn't taste it ya
maybe like rats like rats for example
[orh]
ya
ya ya ya
[oh] ya maybe probably ya but (um)
very interesting to see like (uh) maybe you you know (err) like like even when (um) when when you see in in videos all the cambodians right when they cook something that is traditional is actually their dish but when I look at it it's kind of like
(err) is it clean you know like where do they get this from is it even you know like because eat literally anything everything ya so I just like okay
is it even safe but but you look at it they look like they have like a a (um) they don't have weak stomach you know like they can eat anything I think if I were to be there probably I cannot adapt to them [kan] the way they eat ya correct correct
ya so they basically (um) I think cambodia is also one of the countries that it's very hard to get (um) halal food because mostly (err) they eat like
yup okay
so I mean (err)
this is this is very interesting you know ya y~ you know one thing that (um) I enjoy about having a conversation with you today it feels like we have (err) been jumping a lot of topics but it actually (err)
you know connects us our conversation to to speak (err)
ya and also because because you you are a introverted person you're always shy so this is like a way for me to ya usually when when we (um) when we we we talk is always on (err) whatsapp so now that I get to meet you and have a better conversation like I can see how you express
you know by your actions which is good I think we can (err) do it more like maybe in ya we we don't have
have to like just keep texting I guess it's very hard for me to see how you express
ya
(um)
any any other questions that you want ask me
because I know you are a very curious person [kan] so probably you might want to ask
[oh] so you have you have been eyeing on my phone you you've been peeping is it [oh] it isn't the latest [lah] the latest [kan] is iphone twelve so basically mine is like still eleven pro but it's not the max also okay (err) ya I mean (err) it's very expensive compared ya
ya right
more to the back
ya
[oh] okay okay
but how about other android phones I mean android can be like samsung (um) (err) like (err) nokia you know all these
sony okay sony is (um)
the music (err) have good quality
camera okay I'm not quite updated I've been an iphone user
okay
okay
that's that's (uh) that's good
[oh] ya I think (um) ya that's quite ya the downside of it [lah] I mean we we've been paying
quite a hassle because usually the normal U_S_B [kan] but then ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(uh) it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's (uh) the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer [lah]
then (uh) I have there's a whole checklist of things [lah] that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
(err) groceries she have to go to a few (uh) supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing (uh) all within her area
so it can be like anything [lah] depends on the product they are doing the survey for
to actually (err)
(err) do a survey on the product pricing
(mm)
(mm)
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result [lah] responses [ah]
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
but it was just like say (uh) one retailer then I think two three diff~ usually it's three and more [lah] three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred [lah] is only but it's the pay is good [lah] for that time
outlet [kan] then (um)
ya
(uh) price about it it's the same [lah] because it's the same retailer [pe]
and then (err) I had (uh) my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper [lah] like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience [eh]
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything [what] at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so (err) it was interesting then after that (err)
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them [lah] then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya [lah] but then no choice [what] and then is this this is like (uh) you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also (uh)
they they know that mean their their company already inform them [lah] like
maybe informed the manager [lah] not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
that kind of thing [lah] they don't say like mystery shopper [lah] maybe surveyor [lah]
[ah] they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one (uh) su~ (uh) a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
(mm)
then too bad [lah] then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know [lah] that this week (uh) got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
(uh) customer service you know that they can give but then (uh) other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that [lor]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
one year [eh]
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
it's like part time [ah]
[oh]
!wow!
okay
(mm)
(mm)
just nice
(mm)
ya [lah]
that's why
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah]
(mm)
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
(mm)
ya but
!wah! that's nothing new [lah] because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
and then like (uh) my friend was saying [ah] like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good [lah]
ya [lah] no it's more than ten I think
(mm)
true [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
(mm)
[oh]
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance [ah] like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only [ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[orh]
ya [lah]
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift whenev~ I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
(mmhmm)
!huh!
[ah]
!wow! lucky [sia]
(hmm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[oh] ya
ya [ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] like they have to save cost [lah] if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like (uh) reduce the
the
the rental right ya [lor]
(mm) (mm)
why
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so interesting
(mm)
[oh]
[ah] okay
(mm)
[oh]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah] that's smart
ya [lah]
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outside~ outsiders [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah] ya [lah] true
(mm)
[oh] he's staying alone now is it
(mm)
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
(mm)
ya [lah] true
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm)
but it's good [lah] I mean ho~ like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also [ah]
and then (uh) we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in [eh]
and
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see [lah] like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then (uh) don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking [lah] but
yesterday I I just brow~ yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin [ah] so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and (uh) and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel (uh) travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know [lah] but my whole company is like they freeze travel [lah]
like E_A for to do travel booking [lah] visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing [lah] basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter [eh]
from like head~ [ah] [ah] head~ headhunter agency [eh] no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[kan] I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight [ah] I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got (uh) really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya [lor] makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is (uh) four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can [lah] #wei# cause (uh) like more senior level [lah] like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky [lah] they get a very easy boss
with
[eh] you never know you know my previous company there's this one (err) (uh) E old E_A she's not just senior she's also old
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do [lah]
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
[ah] yes yes yes they say golden handshake [lah] but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department [eh]
because obviously you are being paid too high [lah] and people have eyes to see [what] so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall [lah] like too bad
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every (uh) I think september october period she will go
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
(uh)
[oh] my gosh ya [lah] she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive [lah] because she's such she's so rich [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah] that's why I was like (uh) [oh] my gosh like so some people are so lucky
[oh] she's been there for a long very long [lah] usually those (uh) E_As who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
(mm)
(mm)
really [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya that time my friend got told me the (uh) one of her experience [kan]
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the P_A or something then she was then the but she already got the authority [lah] the the boss will give her the sup~ supplementary card [eh] but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever [lah] whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her (uh) [eh] later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like !wah! so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool [lah] like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
(uh) ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's (uh) he already ask me to pass you I was like
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) ya
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
!huh!
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] at least can just must tell him right
ya [lah] irritating because usually when they travel it's (uh) company [what] so but they can accumulate their own points
!haiya!
ya [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing [one] then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one [ah]
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right [ah] okay then we can get the cheapest [ah] like more less less risk
ya [lor]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
cannot [lah] cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because (uh) it's I think [oh] that one is because the name
the name is (uh) typo error or something typo
but it's so irritating [seh] because we went back and forth then I was telling them like (uh) when [oh] no the
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
back button [ah]
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one [ah] the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name [what] I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly [what]
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like [oh] shit
auto fill so (uh) I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill [lah]
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
anyway so I still have to pay [ah] I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited [ah] no show [ah]
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
(mm) luckily like promotion and cheapest [eh]
[oh] I go and book I go and book because it was like so many people travelling [eh] and then I like I get so confused I think at that time I was doing like
seven eight people from my team then (uh) after that there's like three other people that it's not from my team also I have to do
three others [lah] (uh) there's no three of them supposed to be travelling from that night right from vietnam to singapore three of them supposed to take the flight the same flight [oh]
from the company (uh) book for us and the three of us supposed to travel together [ah]
for tomorrow night instead of tonight and did you know that three of us are really at the airport and two of them is waving goodbye to him now because I'm stuck at the vietnam airport
he cannot leave as per what I've already booked for him
panic [sia] but luckily like
to spare for me because when I called them they say don't have
she she ya she book for me the wrong date and I didn't check and now I'm stranded in vietnam and I can't attend the meeting which he the day that he was supposed to be back in singapore [ah]
ya [lah]
[kan]
ya [lah] true [lah]
timing as if you take the next day afternoon flight which is much shorter time in the plane [eh]
I was like no I just inform the finance (uh) girl accountant
vietnam airlines I think ya [lah]
then die die also want to travel the next day but must be earlier must be earlier
#ho chi minh# #ho chi minh#
like coincidentally that day really like everything is like I mean that I really have no other seats [eh] no seats at all
crazy
five star and must be really according to his type of room and must be smoking room he's very particular [eh]
two colleagues is waving goodbye at you and you are supposed to get on the same flight and then
and they are leaving you at the airport and you are stranded without a hotel and a flight
but actually they they pass everything to me then I was like I cannot you tell me at five P_M on a friday and you want to fly I think some of them flying on saturday some flying on monday [eh]
[ah]
(mm)
[oh] ya [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so he take ya [lah] [ah] that's why some is his people her people some is my people right it's like different team [kan]
no !huh!
after that he we can still like laugh about it that kind but when work is like he's very serious [ah] but okay [lah]
after that my friend was like [eh] I cannot book then I was like [eh] I got two I still got two rooms you know at hotels dot com it's still (uh) showing available
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] no wonder
(mm)
(mm)
[eh] like like can't you all like plan earlier is like so painful so I I'm quite thankful that it's COVID now so no travel
but once COVID is over I'm like !wah!
every time I do travel like so messy [seh]
ya but it was very funny (uh) but now now that the travelling stopped for awhile right I think when once it start again I need to refresh refresher courses
(mm)
ya [lah] (mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
[ah]
(hmm)
you mean I can just call them and ask
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then I buy [ah] urgent visa [lah] which cost like I think four hundred over dollars [eh]
I think #hong kong# or somewhere [lah] that is a chinese coun~ (uh) I mean a a locals asia PAC [ah]
not china [leh] we seldom go china [what] it's #hong kong# not
philippine
(uh) this type of country (uh)
[oh] vietnam maybe vietnam U_S passport

(mm)
and he doesn't need to like I think it's quite recently that they changed the countries [eh]
the countries that (uh) can my must apply visa cannot apply visa on arrival he say last time when he when he go there he straightaway apply visa on arrival it's like no issues
[kan]
(hmm)

!haiya!
(hmm) but it's fun [lah] I mean I mean it's it's quite nice [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah]
that's why it's like but I'm just very thankful like so far up up till now it's still okay [lah] but I'm just say I'm just
counting my days [lah] I won't be lucky forever I'm just wait~
ya [lah]
[kan]
(mm)
ya [lah] whether I can sur~ whether they will survive or not if they survive I survive [ah] but like suddenly if they ask me to leave then how
(mm) local
that's why it's bet~
so should I find a job or not should I apply for a new job or what
ya and then maybe if something comes up

you're welcome
bye
if that day right I already start (uh) applying for jobs on this (uh)
fast job app online then a few of the jobs [ah] like very interesting
have you ever tried that before
but (uh) because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
they will see your feed~ they will see your feedback and then after that they will (uh) record and then they will see then they will pay
(mm)
(mm) but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
(mm)
[ah]
so basically you just have to rate the (uh) display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
[oh] my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy #paiseh# right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come [lah] it's just that they don't know who only right
[oh] my god
but imagine [ah] if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then [ah] another job I tried right is the N_T_U_C
then they call me actually they said the (um) it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
be to commit long term because I was telling them
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that (uh) she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company [lah] but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya [lah] an~ anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good [lah] it's three times a week only
(mm) permanent part time but they need it (uh) long term
(uh) shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
is so con~ it's quite convenient [what] it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
(mm)
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work tw~ twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already [mah]
(uh) the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff [lah]
(mm) (mm)
so just anyway just send [lah] just see how
but some of them [ah] don't even bother to reply
one six months [ah] six months to one year you know
and then (uh) they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose (uh) the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar [eh]
the one
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that (err) also I think it's mondays to
[eh] mon~ it's alternate days [eh]
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week [ah]
actually they will give us (uh) every end of the month for the following month
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
[ah] rather than your part time job
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit [lah] and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
the qualification [lah] I think
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
then my company say cannot because (uh) according to the M_O_M rule you cannot do that [lah] if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
so basically [ah] you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard (uh) my ex company
some of the pinoys [ah] they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
rent
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
so these (uh) factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra (uh) I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms [eh] and then I think there's (uh) three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people [lah]
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
day time he's at home he's working remotely [lah]
and
so he said (uh) sometimes they #dabao# then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part [lah]
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean [lah] then I'm like [eh] but you are using the toilet also [eh]
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent [eh]
good money right actually
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also [lah]
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit [ah] that time he mentioned
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent [lah] you cannot (um) anyhow spend
that's why
ya
maybe have [lah] because (um) they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and (um) I think flights also not regular so you have to
they have to go means they have to go [lah] I guess but then
ya [lah] like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for E_A or P_A you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the (uh) advertisement right or the job (uh) post on link in linkedin
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency [lah]
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best [lor]
but then six thousand [eh]
I didn't know that (uh) all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K [ah] I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks [ah] sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure [ah] when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo [ah] is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental [ah] can
give her like four five K per month [eh]
because I have friends who married #ang moh# right so expat [ah]
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month [ah] you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already [ah]
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses [lah] I mean like (um)
as male bosses are okay
ya they can de~ demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
(err) the husband is paying [what] why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
so what the they did is they always [ah] book first book a travel first
then got one time [ah] suddenly the the secretary call me and say [eh] how come my boss [ah] the krisflyer point is (um)
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this (uh) relocation company
the wife redeem (uh) free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part [ah] they didn't even (uh) say anything to me you know
then after that (uh) until I ask again [ah]
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also #paiseh# [ah] I said [oh] ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the (uh) points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim [lor]
and never even bother to tell him
ya
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only (uh) get like fifty percent of the mileage
very flexible [one] [ah] that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
I always get like you see [lah] you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket [ah] you must tell them this one [ah] if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
then in the end what happen
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay [lah] not that much [ah]
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot [lah] because this is obviously your mistake
for us [ah] the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault [lah] because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright [what] how can we just you know
but it's actually very scary [ah] especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
and then the new flight that you take for him S_Q
ya
but he's from which airport
it's either #ho chin minh# or #hanoi#
so in the end I think you must have booked him on S_Q [lah] because only these two fly direct [what]
ya
ya [lah] very scary especially the hotel bit
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
you do this batch I do this batch [ah] it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date [lah] so at least [eh]
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means [ah] the person that you cock up is your team or
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel [lah]
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate [ah]
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already [what]
you can always book (um) through
all these third party from the website [lah] no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes [ah] hotel themselves even though they give (uh) they sell their rooms to all these third party
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in [what]
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course [lah] right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people [ah]
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least [ah] you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one [ah] family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because (uh) booking from third party [ah] I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday (uh) sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
then how
but #hong kong# U_K passport don't need visa [what]
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival [lah] always (uh) tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
(mm)
otherwise you will waste one day
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes [ah] you just
can you imagine [ah] if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then [ah] I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company (uh) U_S based right
[oh]
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity [ah] anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it !duh!
ya just put out your resume first [ah]
(mm)
(mm) just rerun of friends and big bang theory
(mm) not yet why is it good what is it about
sounds like a good show [leh]
maybe I give it a shot
what else do you think about often black
okay thanks
I see about that
okay [ah] thanks
(uh) by the way (uh) what do you think I should prepare now while waiting for a full time job
okay I guess I'll prepared that where do I find this kind of sample
okay sure then if I prepare interview outfit what do I need to wear blazer and tie
okay
maybe I'll try find
thanks but
ya [lah] hopefully something will turn up [lah] after the after all the application
o
okay [lah] okay I take note [oh] ya by the way then that time (uh) besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix (uh) what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a U_S show
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
[oh] ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see (uh) who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated (uh) hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and #raquel# finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my [ah] two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out [ah] but are you buying anything
[eh]
[oh] serious [ah] are you buying
[oh] ya then (uh) #alesya# be~ belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
!huh! but #azam# isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay [lah] if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase [ah]
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what [oh]
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it [lah] I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true [lah] degree is important I'll think about it [lah]
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just (uh) rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree (uh) sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in (uh) in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored [lah]
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company [ah] I mean
(uh) usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he (uh) when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with (uh) a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
(uh) he is under maintenance side and technician (uh) if I'm not wrong (uh) under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know [lah]
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under I_T so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any I_T specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know [lah] I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as (uh) prison warden ya (uh) he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
(uh) the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace (uh) at just besides #changi# prison so
in a way beneficial for him [lah] don't need to stress about you know buying B_T_O bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place [ah] for him
if I'm not wrong [ah]
[oh] (uh) he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent (uh) not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they (uh) they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy B_T_O flats but then (uh) they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the H_D_B they they bought if I'm not wrong [lah]
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years [ah] that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then (uh) she told me about the benefit (uh) when she just join full time they even (uh) give you (uh) benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even (uh)
another friend of mine (uh) she works at adventure H_Q if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new #khatib# home T_N_S ya she told me about it
they also provide (err) you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to enco~ they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct [lah] but and all ya
(err) adventure H_Q no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of (uh) fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company [eh] not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that (err)
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya [lah] just help me out if I need
fourth december he
(uh) fourth december [ha]
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
(uh) she told me (err) what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because (uh) she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated [oh] she also she also has degree by the way
(uh) chemical chemical science meaning I think (err)
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya (uh) right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while [lah] ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like #jurong# island that kind of thing that share more of like
(uh) exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from N_T_U if I'm not wrong
ya
okay [lah] anyway
my bike what what you mean
(mm) my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
[ah] that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
(uh) tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
A_S_A_P and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation [oh] my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two P_M it became
up to four P_M so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
his job is basically [ah] what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now [ah] ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
(um) maybe [lah] I guess see how
I mean first choice would be
P_U_B second S_M_R_T then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the H_R cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same [lah] but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small (uh) M_N_C company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me [lah]
[oh] ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
(uh) engineer but ya [lah] I mean wouldn't (uh) wouldn't know if the company needs I_T or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
(uh) if you want to O_T you can so ya when I heard he
it's just another few more hours so okay [what]
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
!huh! I thought it's under your name
(uh) there are demo too young because
[oh]
[ha] chain
chain adjust
[oh]
!alamak!
[oh] that time he ask me (err) he he asked me that (uh) how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
so I told him like roughly [lah] how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as (uh) much more than his monthly but I told him [lah]
I told him [ah] that time I I hit about (uh) four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked [ah] my pay
was higher than him then tell him [lah] but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him [lah] the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him [lah] to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him [lah]
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure [lah] because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
then I told him [lah]
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him [ah] I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it [lah]
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride D_R_Z so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
(err)
then he was he was shocked [lah] I say no [lah] because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked [lah] he he he judge but whatever [lah] I mean
I mean you just want to try try only [what] then and then I told him [lah]
like it's all up to individual [lah] I mean all
I I tell him [what] all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
(uh) I told him (uh)
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face [lah]
(uh) was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
#roo# is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket (uh) add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable [lah] because
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
[oh] okay [lah] maybe I see about that
but okay [lah] I mean I wouldn't complain already [lah] I mean as long as the market is good already [lah] because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
(uh) now (uh) based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to #hougang# mall
plain clothes the act like they are C_I_D but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I (uh) she she ride but she put under but (err) bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her [lah] [ah] they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me [lah] what's the logic behind this grab enforcers [oh] I mean I'm working [what] but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the H_Q and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say [lah] like
[oh] is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair [what] I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly [ah] !wah! that sucks
okay I'll take note [lah]
happy new year sis
it's okay life has to move on the then what is your resolution for twenty twenty one
(mm)
but what I mean it it is achievable [lah] for a year achievable
so for this year because last year is it is a transition for me from a student to a working adult and it's very hard situation actually and I don't think the ya
surprise delivery [a'ah]
[a'ah]
[ah] healthy food
[ah]
yes that is very good product for your resolution to lose weight

(mm) (mm)
(mm)

[a'ah]
ya [a'ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(err) save money [kan] I think from your resolution to eat healthily and to grow your own food you can actually monetise from that
maybe you can make YouTube channel
how ya how you how you grow your own food from scratch [a'ah] then we'll see how it grows then from the products that you plant then maybe you can make a channel (uh) on how to make your own vegetarian food
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(err) want it to be
I want it to have plot twist
in a good way
after twenty twenty one [eh] twenty twenty one ends I have then one hundred percent that I will reach
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
yup that's nice
because the last year the whole year is me just working my ass off like everyday you know when back in two thousand nineteen I was still a student [eh] ya I was still a student then
(err) I have my student life which is very interesting
I
(um) I involved in so many social program clubs and all
then when it comes to twenty twenty I started to work
it comes with costs [lah] which is I don't have time for myself anymore and ya I I went to work at eight A_M then
(err) more me time
[ah] I want I want to in a easy way to explain this I want to upgrade myself
that's that's my own definition of me time [ah]
yes like personal skills that is not is not related to my work at all
ya this is something that I really want from
from like twenty years back when I was young
I don't have money and I don't have the effort to actually to pursue that [ah]
I want to enroll in piano class
to be a guitarist
yes I'm still keep it I'm still want to live that ambition you know not [lah] not to be like professional guitarist [lah] no I want to be something like more elegant which is iffy I know
when I was (err) in primary school I actually learn how to play the keyboard [ah] and I did that few times I made performance in front of the school
playing keyboard
(mm) (mmhmm)
ya
[ah]
(mm) yes I think that is one of the reason #kot# for the shift in preference to
(hmm) maybe
but I still I still like to play guitar actually I feel
(uh) I like to listen to people playing guitar and I still have the interest but for this time
I want to play I want to learn to play piano first [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] is it I don't know about that but
(um)
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them
(err) instead of english
(mm) (mm)
this is good for my networking [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(err) and
I remember that
(err) I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
(err) sadly only one language is (err) permissible for for for a student (err) we can only choose one additional language to learn
japanese [a'ah]

ya I think
for things that are going to cost me myself is okay actually to procrastinate even though it's it is not good but if I I cannot prioritise that then it's okay but when it comes to something that involve others I have to
get up
and do it
like right away
(uh huh)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya (mm) [kan]
[oh] that's very weird but interesting [lah]

cause there are so many bad people out here
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
which is supposed to be secret but you expose publicly like for what

so that's what I'm like telling my guy he said okay
[ah] supposedly there is [lah] but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad [lah] ya
what
!huh!
!hais! can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here

so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
but that [one] starhub T_V [what] I don't know
[oh]
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to [lah] have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the T_V can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my T_V is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy [lah] you have to but this [one] because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
very actually laggy [lah] the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this [one] but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software (err) no it's in english
of course M_I_O of course it is still on I mean cable T_V cable T_V in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch T_V per say when is the last time you watch H_B_O
or cinemax or

you want to take it up is it free really but is it one year course I mean like one day course [lah]
so you have to go down C_C to go to the thing

but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
it's in
latin form [ah] so

[ah] no because in october
so because the people the colleagues M_C so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if M_C for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so

I don't know [lah] but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply [lah] said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't [lah] cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see

peranakan day [ah] so I think ya I have to go there early

ya [lah] and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding [mah]
okay
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
(mm)
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause (err) lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
(mm) okay

then after that all the way there and then
[oh] then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again [ah]
then everything finished at twelve thirty
[eh] wait [ah]
I remember is a eleven to three [ah] ya
okay
[ah] I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
(err)
that is the main main core concept
[oh] I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
she don't care
yes
[ah] that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about (err) one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty [ah] then whole lunch [ah] then in between before the one thirty starts right (err) we have the walk in [lah] then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans [lah] some activity [lah] so for about ya
#katong# and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
[ah]
okay
hopefully [lah] okay
so I thought of what you know get some emcee or what [ah] ya
okay
really [ah] actually I don't want to but because I don't want to make it boring for them and I want to have like unified (err) unified
okay
okay
ya I want the like (err) formal one simple one
true also
I see
okay
photographer photographer really must be advance [ah]
okay
half dead
okay
I'm worried now I haven't booked mine
serious [ah] photographer so
what
but you all know because very popular [lah]
[oh] okay
!wah! I have to do that now [ah] ASAP [ah]
(mm)
okay
I see okay
(mm)
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah] okay okay
I think is the emotion [ah]
ya the usual [lah]
good job
you want the photographer will lead you [ah]
what is the importance of a (err) groomsman is it very important
!wow! mine is louder
K can
K ready
okay let's start
[ah] yes
ya [lah] we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya [lah]
ya so I think what we can do we don't go (uh) we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual [lah] we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in [ah]
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay [lah] (uh) we can take the the voucher [ah] you want to buy the voucher [ah] meaning we have to go (uh) the
(err)
you have to go the four att~ attraction
ya
of course [ah]
no [lah] the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before [what] just like the night safari
the four items [ah] the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
(err)
think eleven plus [ah]
[oh] (uh) wait I know is until
nine P_M or ten P_M for the night luge [ah] seven plus to nine P_M
two you (uh) ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this [one] right
(uh) we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going [what] you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go [lah]
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also [lah] can
the three of them
but if #affaf# don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two [lah]
then it's two two each
Subway
(mm) ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough [lah] don't know ya
have to
is the camera (uh) waterproof
don't have [ah]
can
her studies finish already [what] her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
(err)
#affif# I think he doesn't want to go down
[eh] what
twentieth right
the following week [lah] after christmas
can [eh] no cannot
yes (uh) (uh)
cannot
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have [ah] not open yet [ah] okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups [lah] so the kids
all the children
add up (uh)
it's just nice
force [lah]
monday
that's why first person to check is #aisyah#
but if you I I don't know whether
(err)
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
then you ask her
then if she what he say [lah] you ask her for her opinion and all
get the ball rolling
since
so my family side I can suggest
(uh) ya [lah] there is a few suggestion [lah] one is
(um) we split into two groups
so one group is maybe (uh)
ya
go to the one that is more [lah] [kan]
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there [lah]
so #affif# #affaf# #shafie# three
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
and I think they don't mind [lah] because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya [lah]
but I think if it's like just cousins
then
you have how many (uh) eight plus four twelve
twelve children
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
then they
K if it's a red line [ah] and it's too (um)
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
[ah]
#amin# I mean we all have been coming over
we [ah] #mahir# because the other time his family come over #amin# come over #amin# the whole family his whole family come over
okay do how [ah]
(uh)
ya [lah] (uh) we can give suggestions and then let them think
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest #amin# would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
(uh) at one time at one go
and then (err)
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay [lah] then after that
of course [lah]
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
[ah] apply
just that maybe #amin# (uh) only
the two older [eh] #umar# also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if #umar# is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
K so
(mm)
right okay so what else [ah] do you want to talk about (um)
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya [lah]
very difficult
ya cannot [one]
the night safari
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
twenty
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
or jewel
the
ya
we we also haven't gone [what] we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options [lah] so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
no
so okay [lah] at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that [one]
no the problem is
all others in singapore [lah] unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to [what]
P_S_C academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at M_D_I_S
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
(um) the problem with all other (uh) uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's (uh) and her lecturer one whom she took the last course [kan]
then she the lecturer actually say (um)
that
a topic module not on in these two uni [lah]
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
you have to write [ah] [ah] correct
so she's (uh) worried about the that part [lah] that's why
(uh huh) ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya [lah]
they actually have it [leh] the last time she say they the
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants [ah]
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
(err)
(mm) more working people are opting for that course more working people [tau] meaning people who are
let's say they (uh) they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us [lah] she (uh) or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student [ah] so she will be like considered as an adult already [lah]
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say (uh)
(err) income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
[ah] but actually that [one] not much [lah]
of course [lah] because she is [ah]
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
(uh)
ya [lah]
like that [lah]
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have (uh) all these other
unis [ah] which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
[oh] my god that's why I was
ya [lah] because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
it's very frustrating [lah]
ya so that [one] actually I thought (uh) I want to sit down with her and go through all the
ya [lah]
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
all those things [lah] so and she went in they were all telling her [oh] you know (uh) this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like #affaf# are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop (uh)
K so
we need another
ya we need another (uh)
round of her checking [lah] ya for her to check
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
ya [lah]
that's what he wants to do
so
ya [lah] she
N_A_F_A [lah]
N_A_F_A
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based [lah] so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics [lah] right that's physics right
so more about physics
[ah] so you learn how to make
the photo~ (uh) you learn what is the because
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya [lah] you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
(um)
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application (uh) by this person
who wants to (uh) (uh) okay because I put up (uh) a post
[ah] resale
ya okay so two [ah] one is about the
(um) recruitment
(uh) I put
teacher coach (uh) at SAM [lah]
so so far
(uh)
two person submit one is a malay girl who
the other one is an indian lady
used to teach english
so she (uh) she apply but we are maths [kan] so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
[ah] that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because (uh) we already signed up [what] it's for free at that point in time [lah]
(uh) when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say (uh) this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
(uh) about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer eng~
[ah]
switch her [lah]
ya
ya [lah] paying the teacher only
correct [lah]
so okay [lah] so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
(um) a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
[oh] my god
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run [ah] let it run [ah]
so the partnership confirm don't want [ah] so I will message to say don't want [ah]
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya [lah] the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
[ah]
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
the worksheets for P three right [ah]
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue [lah] from there [kan]
okay so
progress report I told #ira# to do that already
[ah] the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
that's what you said to #ira# right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of #ira# you said to #ira# directly
I was there so I think it's okay [lah] let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out [lah]
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
can't be bothered to
and then we message the parents we have passed the
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
july right we're supposed to give (uh) first week july then we didn't give
so this [one] at least we give [lah] everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya [lor]
but then
buy over then he buy over [lah]
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
(uh) for (uh) the person who takes over is a full time
owner
[tau] so he was saying
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved [lah]
(uh) in
ya sort of like that [lah] ya correct
but I was thinking actually no [lah] (uh) #yang# was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his C_V photo looks clean cut [lah] so I think he can
ya [lah] he cannot speak chi~ the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said [lah] a bit
you know I said (uh) (uh) in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot [ah] then I say during N_S and all ya ya ya
(uh) I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only [ah] I can understand a bit but
(uh) chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say [oh] because
(uh) nearby our place (uh) it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so (uh) a lot of (uh)
P_R_C (uh)
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
[ah]
then then (uh) because of that
(um) we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
[oh] okay okay but now got Google translate [what]
can just v~ (uh) tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear [lah]
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say [oh] but the children can speak english [what] so the children can explain I say yes
(um) we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had (uh) chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy [lah]
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just [oh] okay
[ah] [ah]
[ah] that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct [lah] ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be (uh) with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to H_S_B_C
(uh) (uh) he's a graduate
[ah]
so he was working
(uh) but it was only for a few months and then COVID
last to come it first to go
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
[oh] okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe [lah]
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like [oh] okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this chi~ this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better (uh) candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
[ah] so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
(err) do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well (uh) and and starts in his course [lah] so he was saying
he understand children (uh) who have difficulty in maths [lah] he can he can relate so he knows (uh)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
ya [lah]
ya [lah] so no matter what at the end of the day I still need to be with them
to see how they do like what you said [lah] give them maybe one month to try
if good enough then we can continue if not
ya
the fit [lah] sometimes it's not a good fit
like sometimes some of your your method
is more suited for a big classroom you in front of the class
ya
ya

tell that to the

(um)
okay thanks I don't know what to say honestly like it's for pure research like you just want the language right
(um)
I will like bro
ya no actually actually right
the the only thing good about it is just like the programme like the programme like you get to you know meet other schools and then after that you make friends you have lots of different activities especially if not right
there's not much difference
because in the end you is still just about M_N_L
like when you graduate right
at the end of the day is just a piece of paper
[oh] damn
like it doesn't help also right in uni and college unless you are going to like malay studies
ya [sia] think now
I mean okay no no if you are like middle class right
or like something like that or lower income low
working class not the work sorry sorry okay like middle class or like lower income something like that like what's that
if you become like
stay at home wife like a bit boring [eh]
that cause you need to usually you have children you you need to take care of them all those things all tiring but you can become a #tai tai# you get married to someone rich
(err) if have no children your life a breeze
you get to go for all the like painting classes [lah] flower arrangement then go for afternoon tea go for spa massage and then you get to
no
you
honestly I would quit cause ya cause like I mean like
if I have a baby then like I would want to you know make sure that they get a proper education like you know I do like those little brain games for them
at home I'm not gonna like send them to class like all those stupid brain gyms seriously you know like they send their children to like brain gym classes you know what they do there
they would be like [oh] this [one] will what's that retain their focus things like you know what they do they'll like [oh] they have like these children they follow the teacher and then after that they teach her wear apron and I'll be like look (err) what's that I have this little card walk walk walk
I put inside my apron spin around where is the
card ya this like it's very easy and then the thing is all these parents damn fool like classes actually you can do at home ya that's the thing and then like what's that like you're wasting like what seventy or hundred plus like for one hour
when you can do it for like free at home like you have a lot of like
come on [lah] you can just put a card in like your shirt like that right like you don't really need to get an apron even if you have one good [lah] right but like what's that those things you can do at home I mean like I would want to like you know like really
like give them like the proper education things like that ya like really take care of them cause like
if I were to just send them off to the infant care [lah] like send them off to my parents I mean like
it's okay I guess I'm not going to shame those who do so
but I personally would want to [lah]
make sure that [lah] you know ya
early years are like very
(mm) ya
like their sec one sec two
ya
ya if I have one child right I want another a second one because I don't want like to have an only child if not later that thing become spoiled
ya you're not spoiled but like was there like
also cause I'm scared like they might feel lonely ya
I mean for me like if I'm a mother I would take it very seriously [ah] cause like
these little being which are so annoying like it's dependent on me like bro if like
if like suddenly I leave it for a day right like suddenly that thing will die like do you know how annoying that is like how selfish are they you know like they're leeching off of me literally like they're literally sucking milk out of my boobs [leh] like why
ya and then after that like like ya
ya [oh] annoying but actually you know like babies right you know like teach them how to swim you just throw them into water
float can [lah] but swim they can by themselves [meh]
like you just keep throwing them to water as they grow older
okay don't throw [lah] you just put them in water ya you just put them in water then they'll automatically like
[eh] you learn how to swim since you know how to swim right [ah] you don't know [eh] you look like a swimmer [eh] [eh] then last time did you go for classes I mean primary [eh] primary school
[oh] ya we had swimming classes right then
then
ya and then like [oh] I remember like we bought like their swimming gear [lah] goggles [lah] eye bolt and stuff but then we still don't know how to swim
no
I will just I will just use the paddle board
I bought you know I bought the pedal boat like like last year I bought the pedal board
and then after that now whenever you go swimming pool I just put it underneath me then I just like that
can
okay actually you know last time I was supposed okay you know okay but then the thing is for me right
I started
like actually really trying to like swim is when like
I went to like snorkel
and then when you go snorkeling is the open sea right and then the thing is like what
four metres deep or something like that ya and then after that like I wore like
jacket [ah] and then I was super scared you know so like
and then they just like push me off you know like (uh) but of course I cannot drown because like I have the life jacket with me
for me so I just cannot drown even if I wanted to you know so you need and I was like super scared but then not like I think like okay okay so I wore like the snorkel gear and then I was like I was trying to like
look inside you know cause that you have to like really lie down like
but we end up what's that I was like super scared I was like
after that but then end up like after awhile then after that I got used to it so now you have that was just like okay snorkel let's go let's go so after that like when I go to swimming pool and all that like
[oh] so you can snorkel [lah] without learning how to swim
you can I mean like if it cause your life jacket is just to keep you afloat [mah]
no [lah] that [one] is like when you dive that it's diving ya snorkeling is like basically you just on top and then you know like those little like cute thingy so you are supposed to just like float on top and then you just submerge your face
underwater and then you just see what's going on underneath that's all
I want to do so [sia]
cause it's like committing suicide without their commitment
I okay that went deep that went very dark
but like okay I I really want to try bungee jumping and skydiving [oh] you can go skydiving at #langkawi# (mmhmm)
[oh] #cappadocia# I went before very nice I tell you
honeymoon site because like what's that like turkey itself has lots of things like lots of activities and then like you
lots of culture and tourism so like when you go there right like you are always out
you are not always like in the hotel room things like that (um) so if you want to go for honeymoon I will prefer like you know like somewhere right
more private like (uh) like ya like like that's why like maldives something like that it's like okay cause that you just stay in the room or ya adjustable for you
jacuzzi and then after that you can shower outside but like no one can see you (mm) ya but then I also like nothing much you do just cycle by the walkway there
but I mean like over there like it's just for you to spend time with each other if you know what I mean
that's why if I were to go I want to go to maldives
of course [lah] of course I excited you know I I
my virgin self cannot wait
[oh] okay okay then what's that like what kind of cancer she
then what the hell [sia] then like
you know like
ya [sia] damn stress [eh]
stewardess
[oh] okay okay
so what's that
every afternoon we can so that means like the whole week
you will be with your uncle [lah]
ya
okay [lah]
okay [lah]
like alcohol you want to ask need ya exactly then like my family was worried that
ya ya that's why
so easy for like
it's so sad cause like some people who like actually like deserve to be parents are not parents and some people who don't deserve it [ah] parents like
R R
on what on Twitter
(uh) I I never follow her on Twitter but I think Instagram you know Twitter is what the juices is there
okay cause she deactivated her what's that Instagram [kan]
ya
(um)
(mm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
[oh] okay ya
(um)
(mmhmm)
ya
!wow!
okay
betul
(um)
(mm)
and (err)
yes
sorry okay intermission
ya sure
I see
would
I guess it also based on the composition of the racial communities there as well I see maybe it's just we are not familiar with the malay food in the west but I'm pretty sure there is I remember the story we saw our grandfather stories it's like the lady in the west
(uh) the lady in the west who's doing like a private dining so ya it's quite interesting because I think there's a different sub set of (err) like
malay in no like indian muslim food
yes
ya I find it super interesting
I mean like going to people's house and they cook or a private dining but I think now we COVID maybe it's not like a thing ya ya ya true true
anyway (um) so right now today we are what are we going to do later
yes like they did in our friends' houses that's quite funny actually
hammers orchid
and be quite interesting
like a tradition
interesting yes
ya so what do you think about the campaign period this election
it looks like a every gathering comes in their thousands and thousands
well there
well I guess the results today we just found out that like the (um)
the putting has gone is gonna be extended till ten P_M tonight so ya so the elect the results would definitely be delay they're gonna start counting ten thirty onwards
!wah!
quite tiring [lah] to wait
!wah! I'm pretty sure election period also is like when they're totally sleep deprive (um) maybe you can tell me about your experiences in last time when your lifestyle
[ah] ya ya ya
what's a door stop
(um)
so that's done at the end
I see so I I just realise that (um) it's already thirty four minutes ya so
this is also a very interesting experience what I'm doing right now recording or conversations
I know do you think you're up to doing this if you don't have work this next coming week are you up to doing this for nine hours a day that's the maximum you know
but maybe we can keep it to (um) extending our conversations outside like for example when you and eric talk to each other outside and I can recorded it and I won't say anything
yes it's quite windy outside [ah]
in the room is a bit okay [lah]
okay but like what amount are you comfortable with if it's nine hours makes a day how how many hours you think
but I think we can do it if we say do it for like four hours a day I think it's totally feasible
I mean
but it is an interesting project and we're getting paid that's what I'm like interested about
maybe there's a you know maybe the singlish part is a pretends to it but it's actually like for like psychology like department or some thing like that
there's quite while nope we gotta go on to one hour yes yes
we can do this we look at our phones too much this is an interesting project and the fact that you have to do it on your phones to me is already something that
you can't you're not allowed to I'm just looking at the marker
ya you are looking at a marker right
of course we can't do it but what we can do is
just kind of like talk to each other
which I think is what is interesting about this whole project is getting people to communicate again but using their phones as a tool
but you're actually like
talking to each other but there's that
gambit of a phone involves you know what I mean
mean the incentive is getting paid [lah] so
there's something more to this definitely tomorrow saturday yes
damn fast right
(uh)
you are still gonna be calling out for work right
when [ah]
of
(um)
of july
!wow!
how many months has it been since the lockdown
yup
ya
phase one as a space for alfresco
phase two has been like a month
like going to be a month [lah] now is a month I think
how has life change for you
stress
but I think work has changed at the beginning right during phase one
like did you feel any sense of panic at all because you didn't have work
ya you mentioned it yesterday
but I feel like regardless of COVID
(um) I think for all cameraman after you reach a certain age you kinda have to reach that phase where you have to lock down
like really permanently clients and have that stupidity if you're gonna keep doing this your whole life ya I
(mmhmm)
hard sell
ya that's kind of wild
ya ya it's kind of ridiculous [eh]
ya I think so much of your work also revolves around checking out what's
in the now because video is a ever changing medium even how things are short you know content contents another thing [lah] but like so much of our lives revolve around screens so and I feel is although we've
ya ya
but money jobs put food on the table K
(mmhmm)
shocked value
what's that mean
ya ya cause you want to see who you're talking to what ya but if you notice my child porn film so for example we watched fire blood sister yesterday right ya I didn't see the ending it was really good movie anyway
ya I didn't see the ending
(mmhmm)
ya
like like focus
I really like how five bloods was shot so cool I thought was okay it wasn't me interested the sprightly or we should like that
the spike only shoot like that
like that style
I know like the what the ratio the filming ratio (mm)
what other movies [ah] I don't really know
I don't think so
I really like the movies a day
how did they end
should you tell me no I think you should watch it back in and noelle and I liked that he with the entire
but if you realise a lot of them netflix shows and stuff that we saw always has to do that because it's been areas from
the modern media landscape so they have to cramp everything
like the kenya (err) T_V show about his reality T_V show the rich guy like they talk about these kind of things also like they talk about the black struggle in like
their whole culture or revolution and all that
ya ya
who is the white man who is the white man !aiyo! [oh] my god
ya
his stick [ah]
(mm)
okay I should watch it it's not netflix right no as long
okay
I think another series or genre of (err) or show that I'm really into is just like white trash series
what do you mean so
it just feels authentic
it feels it feels it feels like a very genuine representation of the americas
rather than the you know like (uh) glossy sort of shows like you know ya I don't know what this word trusted news also
ya I don't know
stereotype
ya true
my god can't wait till we can travel again feels like forever
feels like we're never gonna leave the island somehow
no you are just focus that's good
but that's not going to happen here but even if I don't give me twenty I know like an opportunity we're gonna we're gonna that's why I'm like I wonder what will change for journalists I mean obviously they are given priority to travel but I don't think so eating so I don't think so
I wonder what will change for journalists I mean obviously they are given priority to travel but you think so
you know
no I mean like
but now the priority will be to get more local people to cover local storage is just good also right you know cause like and and and just doing things internationally
you know cause like
remotely
I would love to go to nepal
maybe one day and it'll happen
ya
I don't know [lah] ten days ten days is like my magic number for travelling
[eh] so cold you know I am not good with cold countries
you miss travelling with me am I your best travelling buddy
how [ah] how so
I'm gonna get this on audio so that if you ever forget we can listen to it again
yes yes I do
I love
I really hope that my sense of
paranoia about the world will disappear with all of this do you remember the waterfall we went to in
(um) #chiang mai#
and then you ya
it was that was fun times it was also raining really heavily your weekend fifty one minutes long it has to be an hour
it has to be an hour
!wah! are you bored already talking to me
wait [lah]
maybe (um) we can also do there's two ways to record this next time
we can do it
(um) it can be somewhere else but we just have to be talking on the phone but you you have to be in a controlled environment
okay let's agree on how many times you can do this but how many times can we do it a day
how many hours be realistic
I would I think this is a good experiment right if say we did this like say [lah] three four hours a day and we can do it like different markers to the day
and then we can cover different topics so like when I want to do one hour you afternoon lower ya
ya
I think it will be a good change from waking up and looking at our screens because that's a habit that I'm trying to break also
but lately I've been waking up and checking if anyone has replied my job inquiries
do you think that's been bad for your mental health
how can you say don't care because you read news with the apathetic view
but don't you feel overwhelmed by the world
like
ya I feel like a speck of dust sometimes and nothing I do matters maybe that's why I've been feeling so sad lately
sense of self and sense of (um) belonging and sense of you know
feeling like
there's some direction in my life
I think not [lah]
ya
maybe [lah] who knows
I also actually speaking of mushrooms I bought this interesting looking mushrooms you can fry them for dinner
or even awkwardness
I don't know maybe like not tempura can can wait the pan
but you have to use a lot of oil and and I don't wanna be unhealthy
I am so piss at the air fryer doesn't work I would love to try tempura with air fryer
no we have to save the money I think we should just fixed that [one] for all you know it could be like some very minor faulty situation order of the
I think it depends if we go see someone that's like
you know
honest
and if we see someone that's like
it has to be as usual
okay (uh) you doing great
four more minutes what
!wow! I realise that fee
actually the weird thing is
up the af~ the aftermath of this will made me realise that we're actually talking more on this project than we are
I_R_L if we manage to cover like
five hours a day or something you know
that's why wish can also have like guess stars
you know what I mean what do you call our podcast
sweet angels (mm) be beeps in buildings
shit talkers
but like
I !aiya! if anyone that hearing this enjoys it
please give a thumbs up man thumbs up man
you think they like
so weird right if this was a podcast we literally started talking about food and then we talked about
K why are we recapping our podcast
ya but this suffers and we didn't even practise so this is good [lah] to practise I know [lah] but like all my interviewees because so you you you get some nervous interviews and the tribe tend to want to read off right attempted though whatever ya we just tell them like it's just like having a conversation with
no [lah] but like
paper ya
(um) but I like direction I mean most interviews if you do with a reporter is not like this long podcast you know like really
that feels like a while
I have to if I can wear braces for twenty two hours a day
I can definitely do this for four five hours a day
I believe it I believe it
it's possible it's possible you
ya sure
did did did you did you get some of what you saw from the show in the movie yesterday do you get some like information based on what you saw like you relate anything back to the movie from the book
yes I agree (uh) they were very graphic also the movie we are talking about the movie five bloods
the movie was super intense and talks about mental health at an old age which is something I grapple to
with crazy and all my god
I really like really hope there's more scary thing that happen in our lifetime
it's true I mean back in our world ya it's kind of scary to think about
what kind of world you will be bring your kids in what if there's war in the future do you know what I mean but like
you not like
physical war but like cyber wars
scary scary times we live in in
what do you want show me in the book
okay
is it just by one guy !wow! I wonder how long
ya
they do a lot of stuffs noam chomsky
he is still alive in kicking [ah] that old guy he is cool he is cool cool guy
so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
[oh] have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction [lah] television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
(uh) the other twin his ukrainian
(um) she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised (uh) she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress (uh) tatiana ma~ mas~ maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
(um) (uh) who is one of the clones [lah]
then she always (uh) live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming (uh) compared to season two and season four
(mm) I don't feel so emotionally attached to a T_V show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones (uh) usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this [lah]
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember [lah] because this is the current show I'm watching now
(um)
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it [lah] so you won't get (err) you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil [lah] because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the T_V show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended (uh) without spoiling it for you
(err) I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes (uh) actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's (uh) probably safe to check out [ah] because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
[oh] okay okay ya I'll keep a lookout [lah]
I think you can start to read up on top ten questions and answers in an interview and start to rehearse (uh) them usually they will start with tell me about yourself question
you should start to like (uh) draft two hundred words to describe your experience so when the time comes it will be natural for you
I think you can google but I can help you [lah] I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your (uh) interview outfit
(um) don't need tie [ah] I guess (err) maybe just a formal wear including (uh) smart shoes formal shoes
okay
ya be positive (uh) and also be open [lah]
[a'ah]
(mm)
okay
[oh] I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's [ah] creepier and more real it's (um) it's not is not a comedy like orange orange [kan] orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent [ah] ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for (uh) (uh) why you like
[oh] (um) I mean for me (err) I'm waiting for money heist (uh) wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons [ah]
ya [ah] ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya (uh) my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show (uh) I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
[oh] ya
(mm)
ya ya
[oh] so you think you like a professional critic [ah]
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about (uh) about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident (uh) ra~ #raquel# losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real [lah] if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season (uh) but it was very entertaining to me [ah] also quite compelling and way better in spanish (um) ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
(uh) (uh) the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this (uh) money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions [ah] but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated [lah] anyway so today is twelve twelve (uh) sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full (uh) a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
(mm) I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at (uh) ASOS or maybe J_D sports they got a lot of (uh) sneakers on sale
(mm)
I am looking for air fryer
(uh)
no I'm busy (mm) I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding [ah] strider balance bike for #azam#
second
(uh) carousell so I found one (uh) (uh) that can deal at #buangkok# but (uh) he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
[oh] okay [lah] why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay [lah] firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand (uh) second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but (uh) the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly [lah]
it depends on his father's (uh) interests and free time
ya so have you thought about #azri's# suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
(uh) if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in (uh) government sector uniform group like (uh) prison service (uh) (um) I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive [eh] but you need to read more [lah] you need to do more research (uh) but there's bond [lah] I think (err) since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this (uh) uniform group then you should (uh) still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself [ah] that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
(uh) I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya (mm)
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
[oh] so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
(uh) their degree are sponsored by the company [ah] ya I mean like for example (um)
(mm)
so rolls royce pay for his degree
[oh] that's good so (uh) as he get as he [ah] got the degree right so did his salary also (uh) goes up went up
[oh] okay that's good can I ask what is his position
[oh] okay five years [eh] (mm) so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his (uh) recommendation do you don't you want to work there
[oh] okay okay
(mm) interesting rolls royce okay
[oh] so so you already have a friend who's working for the prison service
the way beneficial for him [lah] you need to stress world
so does that mean he lived in that means that thing is called a workers' quarters right okay so !wah! when he joined what was his (uh) education (uh) certificate diploma so so he join (uh) it's a guy right so he he joined with a diploma so that means sergeant
so staff sergeant (uh) then he gets to stay there with his family
(mm) ya I think they stay in the quarters but they they can rent out their own house [lah] well that's good that's good so so he so he's (uh) he told you that he signed bond for five years with (uh) S_P_S
five years okay so (uh) is he still a diploma holder already upgrade to degree [oh] okay I think (uh) singapore preserving also one of the company that will sponsor you I think they have this kind of scholarship right
ya
really
ya
that's good
what was the brand again
so it's like north face [ah]
[oh] it's not retail
well that's good so did your friend take the offer degree
but [ah] but who will pay for this (uh) school the company or the company will reimburse
[oh] that's good
if you have to stay until the company
(mm) that means (err) work and study [ah] ya ya that's good you should get this kind of company still looking ya
[oh] really you think so
yes which is next month so don't worry about ya okay that's good (um)
okay so all the best to you
so about this mark guy so exactly what he say so (err) for a wait
when when did when did I said (err) when (err) I send you send that resume to him then he replied on the same day send to him so that's a via whatsapp okay then (um)
then after that there's no use for me ya okay then how about your friend that is connected to him
okay
okay what degree you want
(mm) so what she working as now [oh] searching
almost a year so until now no job
[oh] okay so did she graduate from N_U_S or N_T_U
okay okay I see then maybe you can just wait for this mark guy cause normally they will take a week so one week has pass right ya so (uh) maybe monday can email him just to ask what's the status then (uh) then can just move on [lah]
anyway
so (uh) what's the status about your bike
(uh) the R_X_Z so when is it going to change the
(uh) cover set what's the plan

okay okay okay so depends on what is it [lah] ya also not choosy right for now okay that's good then so for uniform group I_C_A S_P_S okay that's good okay (um) okay let's see
(err) then how about those kind of factories that need like (uh) (uh) engineer assistant engineer like seagate far my my or my friend would just be our house and his is just five minutes away from [ah] so that's okay also ya

then
so
[kan]
cameraman slash videographer slash director or photography yada yada
shoot [lah]
so
can we speak in english now
ya let's switch
(um) ya food wise
there's a difference in culture I feel like in the north south east west
there's more standalone stores
you know what I mean like a must [ah] you type situation or you know rather than this places being integrated into a hawker centre I'm sure you can find like
good
one of like malay stalls in hawker centres but it's not like
in the east where
you can go to a hawker centre and there's gonna be good malay food ya but there's a lot of malays and the west there is I'm not saying that isn't I'm saying the
quality
yes
[oh] is doing what [oh] right right yes
indian muslim ya I I really don't mind going to one of her classes and just exploring (um)
the culture of food that they have
what do you mean in this area supper club
alright yes yes everything's changed now
a few friends are coming over
for to watch the polling results
on C_N_A and I'm really looking forward to that you know what I wish I wish I had decorated the house with like flag political paraphernalia
a bunch of stuff [lah]
well like lightning bolts too
I am really looking for I I feel we should make good it's (uh) there's (uh) (uh) no more like a a culture food
or
a tradition exactly
yes well what
I feel it's weird man I
I really miss rallies
I really really miss rallies
it really it makes me feel like a singaporean like so much like a singaporean like I I
I feel the singapore spirit really comes out in and rallies especially opposition rallies
like not every I mean you got to be a premium rally inside
but there
(mmhmm) like the polling closes at ten [lah]
yes
maybe later than that
yes [lah] if you're the
!wah! and I saw
report there (err) news on this year [oh] ya totally but it's fun [lah] I mean is once in what five years [kan] when I was covering the elections now the last time I covered the elections wasn't that fine [lah] it was like
for bloomberg and we were just parked outside a school in shooting life crosses from there
it was a bit dull
and then we interviewed some ministers at
you know the bridge opposite canvas ya so we we did that
(um) but
ten years ago that was fun I was a new cameraman who say any like
but just join
and it was a culture shock for me [lah] I didn't know what the door stop was and then you suddenly have to fucking hold the camera
like for what fifteen minutes treat the door stop is when they
so
okay here's a few terms that's walkabout so walkabouts is when
the politicians would go walk around the neighbourhood say maybe visit house to house visit [ah]
after one year of the markets and after that and after the whole meet the people see you they would then have a door stop for reporters so door stop is when they stop somewhere
and collect questions from media
that's done
is usually done at the end but
it depends what the P_R person tells my reporter [lah]
but it's almost always done at the end of their walkabout
(um)
cause (uh) I really you really do this or what
the is like work for me you know I I do this for quite a lot like clapped to say
nine hours a day no I'm not
for what [sia]
(um) extending our conversations outside
can [lah] but you have to
have a controlled environment right yes
so can defeats the purpose
I think conversations
well that's the thing of conversations lag is meant to be organic and if you can replicate that feeling of or
something being organic yet
being aware that you're recording something that's a trick to it
because it's a paying thing
I feel that's the incentive here
(mmhmm)
if it wasn't paid would you like
to record yourself talking to someone for like
I I don't think it will matter again you know what's interesting if this entire project wasn't about singlish but about how you communicate with
and you love do what something like that
yes yes (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
it's quite well
are we done with this must [ah]
must be one hour #swee# #swee# is it
(mm)
are you browsing anything on your phone right now I'm not
I have never brows my phone while
during this entire conversation [lah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
tomorrow is what saturday
okay
I
wonder how the next few weeks would be
ya ya well what and I just have one job coming up [lah]
seventeenth
this month
so how about the
the locked out was what march
and we got so lockdown also [what] one month and a half
ya there's a phase one then phase two
no [lah] less than a month ya
(um)
I think life
right now
how is life changed for me
it's a cumulative of being married
going through COVID
(err)
I I wouldn't say it stress man
what would life be without stress right but I don't think I'm in this position where I am really stressed about
what I'm doing like who I who I am I don't have an identity crisis
(um)
I'm just
going through life day by day
(um) doing what I was doing before this entire COVID thing
(um)
no I didn't to be honest with you
there was anxiety but I wasn't panicking with regards to that [ah]
I
was covering my bases and doing all
making sure
like people still remembered me and like
people would still call me right after this COVID thing like I mention I thank thankfully I'm working and (um)
like this documentary and new kinda genre of filmmaking right so
(err) when
(uh) COVID times or an election times I mean work does come in
you but you you know what's interesting now did I tell you about this (um)
like people are panicking [lah] I guess low key panicking and marking their territories
(um)
ya ya I think so too
I I I don't know like I okay
I feel like I want to do it organically I want to do it in a way that
people respect and recognise me for my work (um) my personality and what I bring to it rather than guilt people into hiring me
I I I don't want to be that person that like
[oh] he use to be friends me he gonna hire me you know that kind of shit
I guess is an ego thing [lah] that's what I'm saying but like
I I guess that keeps me in check also in culture shock being able like
sharpening my skills making sure and relevant in how I work can what show them that kind of stuff [lah]
(um)
ya ya ya
ya and I feel is also with
your collaborators who you work [kan] people who get your ideas and concepts (err) I feel that's even more special than say doing
(um) money jobs or whatever [lah] like
ya ya ya definitely I'm I'm not denying that but
at same time
I I don't know [leh] like I I watch so much diverse shit right there
I mean like putting a camera down and just filming something and letting the scene play out that
art form of filmmaking is already it's a a miss is missing you know like
you learn from
orson wells like forgot foreground middle and background and how everything is playing out at same time
I I feel that art is missing in how we
(um) film today like everything is really fast pace or like
everything is
so the cameras over your shoulder so right now when you're talking right the cameras like just behind me here shooting the part of my shoulder and showing you and that shot
is everywhere if you pay attention to food like films or T_V series or whatever the head shot is everywhere
okay it was really good movie anyway (um)
she didn't shoot
that many oasis it was like he had the balls to just maintain a camera on the white shot
and let the scene play out which
you can see everyone's body movements like
I guess facial expressions isn't it isn't that out that like isn't your
what do you call that ya
it's more body language and stuff like that [lah]
I don't know I like (err) I I miss the art of
foreground middle ground and background
that that like that this obsessed me actually did this what I'm obsessed about actually you know
you know
I thought it was okay it wasn't like fantastic ya okay
what do you mean
[oh]
right or like four by three and angles to sixty point nine no it doesn't
[oh] like four by three and then goes to six to nine no [lah] it doesn't
(err) do the right thing
(um) twenty fifth hour like I would
categorised spike #lee# movies from like his nineties work to like
his post ninety stuff (uh) it's quite different
have you seen twenty fifth before
you that's really powerful man
no [ah] I think you should watch it (err) way back it ended well and I liked that he with the entire black struggle
the historic black struggle into the vietnam war and into current this current situation
ya
was that
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
right
(uh huh)
but but
so spike #lee# does that a lot like almost all his movies are about
some form of blackness in it like I mean he did malcolm X right that's
and it's early like say the nineties movies were all about predominantly predominantly black protagonist and antagonism like the drama that they go through
(um)
and then you have twenty fifth our where the protagonist is a white man who's about to go to jail and even !huh! edward norton
your like and you know you remember yesterday there's this one scene where the guy was talking to the camera and like you know so that's kinda like a spike #lee#
persona is like is like that
style a lot (uh) in his movies
like and my favourite
(uh) montage or like like that one on one thing is twenty fifth hour
no it's not
ya ya you are you really into tat shit
I mean if you like it you like it [lah] not dissing you about it
it feels authentic
like new york #khalid# type thing but this white trash thing is also
just new york L_A it's like the whole fucking country [ah]
I don't know like that's not my priority [lah] but I guess
I I guess I can be quite selfish in that way also you know because I travel a lot for work
no because I travel a lot for work
so ya but even if I don't leave the country I know like an opportunity like that will come up that's why I'm like
I don't think so I don't think so that's why you have like correspondents [what]
(mm)
hire someone from overseas [ah] that's why I joined that network thing
ya ya
I mean everyone just doing things internationally like
tibet if my story in like nepal or whatever I I will hire straight in nepal to
like shoot and report whatever's going on
ya it'll happen
how long would you want to spend in nepal
!huh! okay
can you do ten days
(err) it's just nicer
ya
loaded question
actually you are like you are
cause
well ya because you like to eat then we do enough research
so it's fine [lah]
and you like looking at new shirt so
we went to few waterfalls
(uh)
[eh] can we end this already it's fifty one minutes [ah]
I'm not bored I just
I can do other things also what right now
how
no [lah]
no [lah] you just do it like this [lah] it's fine
how many hours you can do this a day
(uh huh)
so like one hour in the day one hour in the afternoon one hour at night
okay sure
I've been waking up and reading the news every single day do you think that's been bad [ah] honestly I don't care
(err) honestly I don't care
no I read news to be informed
no
(um) I wouldn't say the like I wouldn't describe myself to be overwhelmed by
what's going on in the world [lah] because the world will always overwhelm you because like you are an end in this universe you know what I mean
I think you should take mushrooms
how you gonna cook [lah]
okay okay
so you know you can just buy an air fryer right
what if the
cost to fix it is more than buying a new air fryer
okay [lah] okay
(mm)
(err)
no
no
I will think about it [lah]
I hope they they everyone hearing this is enjoying our conversation is just like work for them also and I think I think their grading like because you are getting so many different (err) candidates or but people participating in this and they
their grading people based on right
ya
I think we liked direction in that sense [ah]
I don't think you need to practise
this is what I tell al~ all my interviewees like because so you you get (uh) some nervous interview the same day try hard turn to what to read of like a script talk whatever and we just tell them like
it's just like having a conversation with
my reporter or someone [lah]
no it is this long ya an hour plus
average interview away an hour man
[eh] you want me show you my vietnam book
ya vietnam ink I bought this in vietnam did you get some sort of an issue for him in white show
what do you mean what show
get get what
(um) ya I mean like certain atrocities are well documented
like
ya ya ya
ya based on P_T_S_D ya
ya it it already is happening [lah] we just don't feel the effects of it
there will be war in the future
it it it's all encompassing [lah] it's like from financial to cyber to
[eh] it's like
a photo essay by five down press
if you take the time to actually read the report says
pretty interesting as like
an american talking about how
america fails
ya ya
and it's by (uh) fight on press which is where my favourite (um) publishers and forward by noam chomsky
ya ya he is cool
[eh] cannot ten seconds silence
continue
okay

and then eat
eat whatever it's nice then don't have anything to do then
okay
(mm) three six five days just kidding any show that it's nice money heist is that how you say it

(mm) how do I overcome it [leh]
(mm) just try my best [lah] if whatever I do
I mean you can't you can't really get rid of it unless you do something that addresses the root cause of that fear
ya
root cause of
I think
expectations

caring too much about what other people think
(mm) [ah] this feels like
therapy

ya ya ya there's there's one thing
two is not bad right by one guy
if I mean the the like staying at home to take care of your kids is a
it's a good thing [lah] is a valid point but then
won't feel like
I don't know but if
if like let's say I'm a mum then I don't work then I take care of the kid it's quite like
they really know how to swim
it's just that like whether like you retain that
what's that natural ability or not ya so that's why like from since young right you must like just throw them into water they need to like you don't need to care one literally they will automatically just like learn they'll they just know how to float and swim
can
abuse [sia]
once you learn how to float you will know how to swim [ah] confirm you just show them video this is how you swim do if you don't do you don't do you you see what happen joking joking
ya primary three
like we go I mean I also went for it I mean we both same school but then I still don't know how to swim [ah]
do you plan to learn
then you can [ah] you can move [ah] with the pedal board
!wah! I just like that
I cannot swim obviously so I won't go to like anywhere that's like you know
like that's like deep but if I have the paddle board or if I have the life jacket right when you see me I go everywhere
ya you can you can snorkel you just have to use the life jacket [oh] then you just like move around when you where you go ya cannot control [ah]
noob
[oh] [ah] okay okay !wow!
ya [sia]
like place to go with the sunset or
!wah! legit
(um) okay then got your private pool ya
jacuzzi
!wow!
[oh] my god
there of course [lah] of course they're excited you know I I
ya sure virgin self
alright alright
ya okay got like
breast
I think she got ask him [lah] say like [ah] you will stay with me right you won't leave then he say ya ya then after that end up he cheat
like girl there's like a red flag
and also like that [lor] actually why did I tell you that [ah] how do we get to the
cause he he really cannot like support [sia] the kid
ya like throw those skunk remarks
so he will so that means cause there's like what
four weekends right in a month so two out of four weekends he will be there [lah] so only what four days then he will spend with that
ya ya right it's just
[ah] that [one] I don't know I think
but it's just very frustrating [sia]
and like
it reminds me of our (err) dear old friend
[oh] my my boyfriend just left the house so !huh! one hour
ya she did
M
[oh]
(uh huh)
right
can
[oh] okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
your wedding date will be available then (um) you can
choose
[eh] I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically (err) when you
what's that called where he lives is also (err) stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just (um)
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance [lah] ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
[oh] then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is [ah] amendment there is [ah] basically (um) when you choose (err) your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things [ah]
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to #lina# everything [kan] send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire (um) all the details so that (err) being a typical singaporean [ah] we #kiasu# [one] so (err) once (err) once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to R_O_M if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
ya is it ten is it [oh] okay
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller [lah] basically
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay [ah]
that's one thing also but
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that [lah] but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
cause okay
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like (err) like they're they're very busy [lah] so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
so included me and #alina#
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different [lah]
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday [ah] you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you [oh] close the window
ya things like that [lah] but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
(um)
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot [lah] ya but for me it was I chose the [eh] no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
(um) ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different [ah] (mm) different [ah]
!wah! I don't remember whether there's any charges [eh]
okay okay
don't need [one] not necessary [ah] they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
like what is (um) it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
ya so I told them (err) I I've got work [lah] they will they will still will pressure you then [oh] but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of R_O_M_M
ya so then you have
you can ask the mother
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
but that word everybody thinks that [oh] it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end [what] ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch [oh] now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a wed~ a wedding cake make sense
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point [kan]
(mm) dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say (err) like
it it defeat to me [lah] it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it [lah] like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends [lah] ya so
all weddings there will be time time de~ time delay
really
ceremony there will start at one thirty
then she's like I think we should move off now
[kan] then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing [lah] cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding [eh] eleven thirty she said we should move off now
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location [what] how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully [lah] it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live (err) a #chendol# station [ah] everything like in the mosque everything [lah] quite quite nice [lah] he paid for everything
then ya [lor] then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is (um) itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
for me [lah] is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible [lah] in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
yes transportation is is the problem to me [ah] that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
how no no no no yes they their [eh] they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way [lah] you know that they want to save your money and
different person different [lor] ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing [ah] they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
(err) I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at #bedok# reservoir
ya
ya
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to #dewi#
like for me I leave it to #alina# like for me I leave it to #alina# on how you want to to but the thing is like #alina# also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research [mah]
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like [eh] I cannot be splitting it right down the middle [ah] right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like [eh] our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like [eh] I want fifty dollar my problem [lah]
I pay myself [what] that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have (err) chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that [lah] ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
(mm) salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
(um)
(mm)
(mm)
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding (err) expo and everything [kan] so it's a bit different [ah]
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography [ah] ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing [lah] ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photo~ photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
(mmhmm) can do that also
(err) I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place [lah] if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled [lah] I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
(mm) can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take pic~ to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us [lah]
ya it is quite nice also over there (um) on the wedding day itself [lah] ya
as in your wedding day [lah] I want to book the indigo room over there [oh] no need [lah] ya we we we we can because I I am a I_H_G member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points [oh] no need [lah] no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel (mm) no need no need no need
(um)
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well [lah] I would say (err) okay so basically
you have to see
(mm) yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and #alina# did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
!wah! she the that that that girl is amazing [ah] ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
but
ya it's all it's all my cousins [lor] all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early [kan] ya
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues [lah] basically my S_I_A colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about (err) the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important [lah]
we didn't walk in
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your cere~ your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
ya
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
I was like
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
things like that [lah]
okay
(mmhmm) I would say you don't need to worry about the activity [ah] people will just take picture with you [lah]
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing [eh] no one no one cares [lah]
my the recent one with my with my (err) sister in law's brother we did at (err) malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
ya no problem [lah]
no need [lah] okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know [oh] but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
no but the two weddings I been to also
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's !wah! you got a lot money
to me [lah] personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me [lah] personally
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements [what]
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
yes
yup we we make our own [lah] (um) cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early [lah] cause it's it's not fast job [mah]
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like !wow!
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
(err) my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
(mm) but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know [one] when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very #kiasu# game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like #alina# throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be [what] then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes [ah] and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks [lah] the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important [lor]
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right (um)
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff [lah] I would say but I like him because (err) he listens to what I say
[ah] then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional [lah] he listens to me [lah] ya
yup ya so I just walk around [ah] I told him to follow me ya no [lah] I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked #lina# to go inside then she like
I don't know wedding then she okay no need [ah] ya

the son work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive [eh] and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's (err) very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them (uh) checklist (err) time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time [lah]

correct correct
ya ya
people think like you don't do your (err) revision or studying beforehand but it is what it is [ah] sometimes when you're stuck you have to ask for help
(mm)
ya
[oh] this is new
this is new for me I never hear that term before
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
(mm)
ya
(uh) ya ya ya ya ya
but it depends on the person itself [lah] but for me personally I think a a balance of the two is nice [ah] ya whe~ when you are when you know how to get your points across properly
but at the same time you don't like come off
ya
ya
[ah]
[ah]
(mm)
correct correct
but I guess I still have some traits of that sensitivity but I try my best [lah] cause over time like you have to
(um) adapt [ah] I I guess that's the most important word adapting especially during COVID now out of all the stuff that's going on ya
ya
yes yes yes
(uh)
(err) for my
past exams I think this semester I only got two exams so I'll be honest [ah] this one I haven't share with you before (uh) so (um)
I kind of (err) didn't sit for my paper
ya so (err) thi~ thi~ this news right i~ I'm just telling you this (um) okay so my school right what the policy that they have is that (um) if you don't sit for your paper
and then (uh) if you have (err) I think the requirement for the assignments is like (err) forty percent and above that means your over [ah] there are two components (uh) assignments and exams so for each component you must get forty percent forty percent so if once your assignments you get forty percent right you have the liberty to sit out of the exam and then we retake it the next semester without (err) redoing the entire mod
but if you fail your assignments and then you didn't sit for exam right you have to retake the entire mod but it's actually once you fail your assignments right you have to retake the entire mod [ah] so
for me
okay [lah] for me since I'm new to it [lah] like I I just got into a relationship so like I'm trying to
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh]
like withi~ like
[oh] range [oh] okay okay okay
ya
correct correct and it's not easy seriously seriously uni is not easy already get ya so when my friend said that he cried right I thought it was exaggerating but then like now I know what he feel what he's feeling but I I cannot en~ entirely relate and I don't have the right to [lah] cause I'm part time then they're full time so like for me right my expect for full time students are way higher even though they say like for us part time then have to work and all that is harder for us to balance right [oh] for me full time is harder cause like even though you got all the time to study right but you really have to manage your time like for the different modes and the different [ah] assignments and projects ya so because your school is (uh) assignment and project based my [one] is [ah] exam so that's the thing you all also have (err)
intermi~ intermittent exams right
math [oh] my goodness
don't have (err)
(uh) n~ not exactly math but I think (err) since your mum is a english teacher she should know also (err) there's this thing called (err) phonetics and (um) what is it under [ah] it's under
something like that ya exactly my goodness I hated that ya because it's more of like (um) if I can put it simply right like everything you see right there's like a structure to it like in a sentence right like there's the subject verb a~ like there's a lot of that object complement and all that so
(um) put simply in every sentence in every word you utter right there is a (um) sort of a structure to it and then like for every structure there's a term for it
that's the difficult part [lah]
(uh)
a~ a~ the~ the~ there is one ya ya there is (uh) the (uh) what mod I took I think they taught us about (err) there are some similarities (uh) between (err) varieties of a particular language or like how a a language different from the other like how the structures
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya something like that
ya correct correct
ya
(um) ya [lah] because essentially
(err) they said that like for french
like the verb or the subject comes first and then for english is the subject then the verb comes or something like that
ya so like like easier like
post office [sia]
[oh] ya but okay [lah] (uh) that's the difficult part then another aspect that we learn is about (err)
language and society like how people use language and all that tha~ that [one] is more to (um)
I would say (uh) you're studying english in a
geographical way
in a way ya you you learn how [ah] different regions and how different countries use the language ya like
[ah] dialect and culture ya so if I can put it simply it's (uh) i~ i~ i~ in the course I'm taking right is the technical side which I really don't like and the more of (err) analytical type of a more research based type ya
tha~ these two is okay the one that really
headache now [eh] I wish I I don't have to take is (uh) literature
but they rebrand it so like no choice [ah] I just stayed [ah] cause I have to defer for (err) one semester
ya

because it's quite mentally draining [tau] if you set the bar too high so you must slowly find the small things that make you happy [lah] ya and and I heard this phrase before like (um)
(uh) sometimes the things that makes us the happiest right doesn't require money [ah]
ya that's that's that's the most priceless thing tha~ that that that that is a golden code [lah]

(mm)

ya
correct (uh) there's one prime example (uh) I think a~ is everyone's favourite
wait is he is M_C_U not right [ah] Marvel cinematic universe [ah] iron man [ah] he don't have any powers but like he he's (uh) drive to make the world a better place and too (um) I think in age of ultron he said he want to like (uh) have a iron barrier around earth (uh) to like s~ sort of protect [lah] but (um) even though there were disagreements on his style right at least he got the intention to like (uh) protect what's what matters to him the most [ah] so like (um)
get the power from your own (uh)
(err)
his ability to (uh) be a genius
and like (uh) construct new things like his suits his nano tech in infinity war so that's the beauty of it [lah] like people always look at the (uh) powerful heroes like for example who can you think of thor
how
(uh) thanos
but then like the ones who are more normal right [ah] and don't have that much power I I guess they are the superheroes [ah] and truth be told iron man really was the truth hero cause like for me
I think she was like (err) (um)
(uh) assassin or some sort then she got (um) (err) close combat (err) training and iron man is just (err) a man with a suit [lah] but the proper intentions so like
it's really quite (err) touching [ah] if you think about it no power [tau]
(mm)
ya
correct
yes
(mm)

it motivates you [ah] in a way

ya
it's very tough it's not it's not that easy to reach out to people [ah]
(mm)
yes
ya like you mentioned even though it's difficult right it will be rewarding for you in the future because like I notice (um)
in the S_G traineeship or the S_G united jobs right cause like since I only part time now [ah] [eh] I'm working part time [lah] ya I am working part time studying part time sorry I'm correct sorry sorry sorry [ah] but my job got suspended because of COVID so like (err) I cannot work for the meantime so (um) I just have a look in the website right and when you mention about programming right it it is very useful cause most of the jobs that required programming so what you do is you you are technically on the right track it's not that easy [ah] but it's you're on the right track [ah] so it is relevant [lah] it's a good thing
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes

so so so so technically they are like you but they they because of the (err) pre-judgement that they might get they just keep quiet and they don't want to approach anyone
ya
ya
yes
ya
correct
ya
(mm)
ya
[ah]
ya you need to (um) get the answer and then like you have to analyse it and then like tune it in a way that it suits your current situation

it's very useful

but even if you can right for me personally I don't want I I'm scared cause like (err) I I heard there's zero gravitat~ the zero gravity ther~ why am I stuttering (uh) the zero gravity there is quite (uh)
quite intense [ah] so for me for someone who has motion sickness like I don't think I can manage ya ya but then that's quite an achievement that he wants to achieve (uh) being buried in mars so ya I wonder how his body is gonna like stay unless you like strap it or something [ah]
ya cause if he want to be married [eh] buried in mars so like I don't know how he's going to go about that
ya
(mm)

that's why

ya but how many light years away is mars [ah]
I never thought about it [eh]
ya
[oh] it's not light years
years
[oh] to~ but the toil you will take on the human body if you do this travelling will be quite tough [eh]
I don't know how they do it [sia] seriously
ya ya ya correct
(err) ailments so you won't get sick or something ya
ya when you get you're born and then you live through your life and then you die then like the cycle continues so like it will be stuck there you'll be alive [ah] then you wouldn't die [ah]
it's really it's really the beauty of it I guess
(mm)
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm) (mm)
that's right
ya ya ya
ya
correct correct ya ya ya
ya
because you don't have to drive to progress [ah] then like you just stay stagnant [ah] like (uh) because it's not affecting you [what] and that's the thing about humans [lah] like we are selfish that the moment we think it doesn't affect us right we don't care about
ya that's the that's the number one thing
change [ah] the [ah] sorry the upper moon sixteen they don't get change [ah] but if you think about it they remain stagnant but I haven't read the #manga# or the watch the (uh) talk about season two personally I feel that in the end
the the humans will try my I don't know for sure but but the desire to keep trying and even though you fail a lot of times which I feel that there's gonna be a lot of (um)
drama in the anime itself but the if you keep trying right eventually you triumph [ah]
apart from the people who remain stagnant
and don't progress because they feel that they already good enough
(mm)
(mm)
ya
yes
ya
correct correct
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
that's the sad thing right people only recognise people when they die unfortunately
that's a sad thing
ya
(mm)
ya
ya and they look to you as a way to (err)
is #bangkok# the correct word like a way to (um) set the bar like I I (err) do as an inspiration [ah] in a way
ya
so that's the good thing
(mm)
undertaker
yes [oh] my god my favourite wrestler then he retire
(mm)

[ah] #diego maradona#
that's quite sad [ah]
[ah] ya
(mm)
ya
I guess when
the rule of thumb is there a rule of thumb [eh] I guess [ah] when people pass on they look at the good things [ah] and they try to overlook the (uh) bad things that they've done ya cause they remember him for his skills for his jubilee for his achievements
(um) his negative aspects (um) (err)
even though they were quite drastic but (uh) the achievements overshadow that [ah] but in the end when everyone passes on right is (um)
their it's a normal human nature to like honour them [ah] recognise that even though like how bad they are right everyone deserves a proper (um)
what's the word [eh] passing [eh] no (um) [ah] final respects I guess ya so that's the most important
status (err) for awhile then like (um) at least you (um) go in peace [ah] like ya you don't feel like [oh] (um)
there's anything left
[ah] ya ya ya you you feel like e~ (err) a burden off your shoulder [ah] in a way
what's why
(mm)
making one of the best anime
[oh] my goodness
ya
(mm)
that's why it's amazing how this (um) shows like Marvel anime and all these right like they teach us more
than what we are taught in school it's really interesting right
ya
okay
(uh)
okay so the topics that we will be talking today [ah] it's (um) firstly
if you got if you could go back in time or forward to the future in ten years where or when would you go maybe you want to start first
for me [ah] I like science [lah] so maybe ten years in the future [kan] I would want to have
and I would like to live with my my family members
and I would like to have my own lab so that I can do most of my research and [ah] whatever there is [lah] so
there will be one and like to
to work on research and another thing also (uh) ten years time probably (um) I would like to
(uh) I would like to be in
in a safe place whereby I can
I can have
can have my own fun time like a playground and I like it to be very secluded like maybe in the woods or something so or in a cave
so that's that's what I will I will I will like to go and
focus on my (uh)
my computing whatsoever [lah]
yes
so
alright
so moving on
so maybe (uh) so moving on maybe we will let's
okay so (mm)
(uh) you were in your future house
and then (um) maybe if there are like a few drama picks that maybe you you can watch
what what genre or what kind of drama or what titles
would you actually like to have in your home
to watch in your free time
and why
(mm)
mind is stimulated [ah]
(uh) more to like action thriller
(uh) okay for for me (uh) I really like sci-fi and action so probably all the genres which I will like to watch probably star trek
star wars or black mirror cause I think
when you are in technology and there are several different things that you can encounter there
and it gives you (uh) in-hand situations about (uh) about issues that could surface in the future [lah] A_I (uh) technology areas or
something to think about
ya and and make you like [oh] it helps me to
solve problems easily and (uh) see things in a different perspective so tonight there's this one episode [eh]
the reason why she was trapped is because (um)
(uh) her her boss took a D_N_A of her and other of her colleagues and the boss actually
the boss actually had to so so only the boss can control the game
and very interesting [lah] how they plan to (uh) get rid of the boss cause
but the boss itself he he portray himself as the captain
and then [ah] sometimes he can [ah] turn this beam into whatever he want to or torture them in a way so technically the people itself hims~ them them self were were were were shocked [lah] cause their D_N_A was extorted and they were like stuck there so they had to in the end (uh) some of them still got to plan how to
how to throw him off so (uh) he was actually very surprised when they managed to escape from them from him because it was a black hole and (uh) there was a wormhole so they went they went into that and then they manage to escape [lah] so it was quite surprising interesting [ah] how they plan out the activities and how they hack into the current
ya
okay so okay so apart from that [eh] (hmm)
if you can become an actor
(uh) what
(hmm) if you can become an actor [eh] and like any actor [eh] do you prefer (uh) do you prefer to have like good looks or a fit body
ya what what what will you what will you prefer actually if you can become an actor but then
if you can become if you can ask no if you like can become an actor right what
what would you like to focus more good looks or fit body
ya
no as in like no as in no if you can become an actor usually actors they can focus on
so you are saying like having a healthy lifestyle
keeps you keeps you going
(mm)
I think I will
medicine is getting medicine and healthcare is [ah] not getting cheaper these days
so I think (uh) focus on health and inter~ in~ and interv~ intervening myself from any diseases [ah] correct I can you know feel the best of my life for the next few years
I think
so what do you think about that
or how can mental health be
be (um) how can mental health be (um) what's that addressed
and how can be (um)
how can we (uh) better improve our mental health area general
(uh) projects or work or something which like humans itself has a limit and they actually
very rigorous very very broad and very
things that has yet to be addressed like maybe like mental health support I think mental health support is very important to see how children can take care of themselves
(uh) rather than you know focusing on grades and rather for rather than focusing on how to get the best result but most ultimately they find whatever they are interested in and whatever they
can do on their level and if they can't do it the the the schools shouldn't push
well you know I think schools should given [ah] should give them ample time or and or the flexibility to learn
what do you think
depends on the capacity [ah]
(uh) off them from whether you like to learn or you
you enjoy it because if you don't enjoy it I think they won't see like a point of doing it
I think that's a blunder in our education system [ah] like they make everyone else do everything but it's not really what it's not really suited or
but like the education system is still there I think that that there's a there's a you have to not trick the system we have to improvise the system so that
(um)
(um) how many one point two grams of (uh) phosphorus is needed to make (uh) I don't know cyanide or something
you can think of how to (uh) not only educate people but training their mind how to think training their mind how to accept new ideas how to make use make full use of the time to learn new things apart from you know just studying for exam memorise then vomiting everything out I think it's really futile in the end they don't know what they want to do then
okay so (uh) moving on maybe let's talk about
so technically if you were if you can go back
to the past okay like any year or any time period or wherever [ah] where would you want to go
and why
ya
and you can just enter whatever year
place period and date you want to go where would you want
why
[oh] when you were a little child
work studies stress [ah]
we play
(mm)
cause our childhood is like it's it's somehow
(uh) memories in child somehow sticks with you for your life
(um) shape you and how you are today
[ah]
probably (mm)
I I think I would want to go to
ya during the dark ages were a period of time whereby (uh) in the european universe or the western part of the world
[ah] there were so many diseases and plague
so
apparently during that time many people died most of the population less doctors about one third or I'm not so sure about the statistic but (uh) there was a really huge plague and there were a lot of
(um) ya there were a lot of wars and it was a very bloody time a really bloody time there was there was there was a lot of deaths
during that time and [ah] people were killed and people were died from (um)
(um) unknown
and unprecedented diseases so
if I could go back during that time
and if I could travel the world then I would see that I would find like solution on how to like you know
how to counter the illness or whatsoever but apart from
(uh) the west side
I think I think during the dark ages also there were there were the golden age of inventions because I think during that time there was a lot of inventions from muslim scholars ya like you know #sina# [ah] #al jazali#
(uh) #mariam#
#abu sayde# or something but very very they just it was it was a golden age of islam [lah] I think it's very interesting to see
inventing the clock inven~ inven~ invention of the scalpel
so there were a lot of inventions during that time which actually
which actually benefited
this
generation apart from like medicine
medicine engineering
I think there was a lot of things it was a lot of discoveries and inventions which are untold during the golden age
I think it's even
it's it's very it may it may appear far-fetched during that time but I think
it's very interesting on how they manage to combine it's like
things and how they manage to become a poly math
a lot of other things rather than focusing on one so that you know you can expand our knowledge
yup
ya
is it in my job plus for too long
you [ah]
so apart from like
(mm) going back in time
(um) what do you think would be three wishes that you think you would want
to (uh) have
for example you come across a lamp then you can rub it and then a genie comes in front of you what what three wishes would you actually like to (um) to ask him
you like here
it looks like a normal [lah] you particularly the elderly man take
the third one
[ah]
(uh) I think first [lah] I think I'm really content in life but if I could ask for more I wish like
(uh) I wish
(uh) I wish that (uh) world hunger can be stopped [lah] cause
and they went in first world country
(uh) no access to water even to not not even water like they only have access to like polluted water or or like urine from (uh) camels or
cattle so
it's it's very sad [lah] so if I can if I can have wishes if I can have one wish I'll choose the first wish if I have three wishes one of them would be I hope [ah] nobody would go hungry [lah] in this world
and [ah] the second wish would be [ah]
I want to have my
own space shuttle so that I can travel in the cosmos or in the space
so that I can be with a job for life I think that's very safe cause (uh) we don't have the technology
because even from (um) the nearest to~ got small century to earth is like four point two light years away and one light year is about three hundred and eighty thousand
[eh] three hundred and eighty three point eight times the power of
kilomet~ metres kilometres kilometres
so (um) I think it will be very hard but I think it
working good effort to actually wanting to telephone us
so I think having a space shuttle and discovering life
and helping out (um) others or venturing into the cosmos studying about stuff analyse black holes it's very interesting
and for third wish (uh) actually (uh) I think I
I wish to have my own family one day #inshallah#
maybe next five ten years or so
really helps me to
(uh) have a more positive outlook on life where I could learn from my spouse
I think for me learning is very for me [lah] I really like to learn
not like I want I want know
I'm not even dating but (um) just hope to you know
(um) get married one day
okay so (mm)
so maybe (uh) cause since we had three wishes that we have we we can would you like to add anything like any wish that comes to your mind so far
I eat right
I think (uh) I think
is not really essential [lah] but apparently
(uh) you want your friend or anything
how can I contribute better to the society
cause when you like have a good attitude in life and
I think
(uh) if you have your own character you have your own good moral values
you can actually be (uh) be taught to the world
but (um) having good character actually
have you succeed in life not that you
were great and good attitude to do something really helps you to
move further in life [lah]
yup
respect
won't look down on you [lah]
bad reputation
and apparently we want to be we want to be remembered as someone who's
who's actually who's (um)
who's who's of good nature
okay
I I will agree with you [lah] that (uh) having a good moral virtue is I mean good moral is very important in a person
so maybe you move on to next question
flash
speed [ah] speed
#inshallah#
(uh huh)
I I like to teleport [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
what do you think of like robots doing the work cause technically like what we are using now even phones
I think
(mmhmm)
you know is is very easily easy [lah] I mean everything you could wish accidents like
know when to use it
cause I think phone are just available everywhere internet is available everywhere so
then it it seeks like entertainment but I think if you really like put a stop to it where where we feel like [oh] [ah] when we have like other other priorities to do like if if we have priorities
to do like (um) we have (uh) we have to maybe cook for the family or do laundry (um) some more if you need help you cannot still adhere to (um) playing our phone okay there are several things that we have to keep in keep in mind [lah] that there are other priorities that should be done
cause right now even learning learning is through phone is through media
(err) is through internet okay most people use google as their teacher
so I think ya it's a very different generation [lah]
I think phone also like you know serve like as a better communication with with others
but I think we we need to learn like when to use it and how to manage our time
so back to the question what do you think of A_I do you think A_I is something
which you could expect in the future
human touch
I think (uh) (uh) this thing
trait between A_I and humans probably (uh) A_I they don't have the emotional attribute
they don't have (um)
I think A_I reduce human labour or give companions companionship cause nowadays you can see that some
(uh) some (uh) some pioneers or some older people they they they they feel lonely so maybe having an A_I to talk to would be like
(uh) for example labour like A_I being a waitress I think it's okay but at the same time
humans they'll be stuck of like where to learn where to
how to learn and how to do a job even a menial job like
let's hope things could do things work out well and they don't use A_I to like weaponise or do something [lah] something bad cause technically we want something good out of it
need deep thoughts deep thinking
deep thinking
(um) especially with the global climate
imagine if you will be using a lot of electricity
to power things where where are we gonna get these sustainable options
and humans I don't think we're gonna live for very long maybe left one thousand years like what to
probably will be (um) probably will be diminish or whatsoever but I think
(uh) A_I like what I said can serve a good purpose or a bad one
it depends on how we look at it [lah]
but not
like from like some the like there are some movies or dramas like
I find it very like perplexing but still very interesting [ah] to actually think about like imagine imagine A_I will be teachers it'll be very scary because
I don't think
the I don't think students will actually
I don't think they're able to learn as much as how they actually learn from (um) human beings and like imagine A_I they become teachers they will learn how to punish teach and they don't know how to engage the students it'll be very difficult
even if A_I has an appearance of a human being nowadays there are so many so many (um) so many notions so many ideas that A_I can be used as like companion dolls
like for I think it's very
very interesting
(uh huh)
my god
okay so
my name is #kazali# and this is my niece her name is (mm) (hmm) okay so today

lie there then after that I say okay so (um) it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody

up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course [lah] that
(um)
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why [eh] [oh] I know why
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get M_C you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got (err) theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
planning to be~ working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful [lah]
and I wasn't doing very well in chemis~ [eh] no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry [eh] no physics physics and bio~ I wasn't doing very so well you know is it bio~ I like but I don't know why bio~ I didn't get A
(uh) attended this [lah] you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
like that [ah] so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay [lah] give you more job [ah] then now I started learn
(um)
(uh)
like other skills [lah] like I've got to learn more about it

(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
ya I mean I I love the show [ah] really I really help her but then
!wah! this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more (uh) but ya got big issue [lah] that [one] until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that i~ like in a way I have to give advice [lah] it's really about you say [lah] your marketing
to win your audience (um)
the how whether they can the au~ whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
(mm) then how you guys do it
(mm)
(mm)
let's try one of these prompts [lah] [ha]
(mm)
okay

they always sell the #masala chai# in (um)
very tiny cups but I think is less than ten cents if you think about it in singapore dollar in sing~ dollars
the #chai# but in that cup the big cup !huh! can I I say ya ya ya

(um)
#chai# basically is tea [what]
delivery !alamak!
okay
is it still continue it's not it's not (uh) okay
maybe
one food
and meets all so all the health requirements something like the vegetable
(err)
something with protein and carbs enough all
I mean if it's for survival
if your if your if I think about if you think is probably for survival [lah] but if I for indulgence
what would be the worst buy one get
!huh! what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
I just say for one is for one right buy one get one free
what would be the worst idea for that kind of sale
what about fringe
why would you need two fridge
buy one get one [eh] washing machine actually maybe one for whites one for coloured can make sense it can make sense
no [lah] but it's it's it's buy one get one free [what]
[ah] okay okay compare compare
okay okay okay
(uh) okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would they be
(mm) if you can
master three new skills what would they be
then
[oh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
on purpose
why [ah]
[oh] [eh] okay okay
[oh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill (uh) I want (uh)
(um)
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will [lah] [ah]
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one M_M_A move [ah]
ya in in uni~ I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie [ah] a fighting film [ah]
cool [lah] but (mm)
and I don't like to fight [ah]
ya but then no [lah] I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
[eh] you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no [lah] just (uh) (uh) (uh) generic
(um) a lot of the but (uh) just basic ones [lah] very introduction to all the different therapies [lah]
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
okay if you can like you said okay can [lah] you ask me a q~ you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay [lah] two weeks right
but some people they might say that
[eh]
dare to ask me we're not even that close (um) you know
you know
(um)
we take that example is not a very good example [lah] like one (uh) like so basic~ so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
(um)
the cou~ they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that [lah] but then
in the end (um)
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
so I'm learning about that [ah] so it's very (uh) and I rea~ (err) so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
you clothes around [ah] you know it made me feel un~ (uh) like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel (um)
that
(uh) you feel [lah]
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I u~ the request is that [lah] I
if you could pick up your own stuff
(um)
would you be doing it [lah] am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well [lah] okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay [lah] you ask me then I can say yes I can say no [lah]
ya it's like a demand [kan] to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how [ah] how to
balance that out I try to figure it out [lah]
ya but won't
(mm)
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
(mm)
(mm)
ya I see hard [ah]
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
(um)

[oh]
lame
speaking of travel
of course [lah] I mean it's so nice the weather is cold

okay
but when you went that time it's not the cold season kind of is it summer !hais! that was
global warming
too bad
okay [lah] but at least you went out so still okay
okay [lah]
then like that
(hmm) more or less it's
sort of confirm the staycation
the when do you think we can travel back again
[oh] ya
where where's the tunnel
no they say that (um) what britain is going to be the first or something to try out
(mm)
!huh!
[ah]
then what's the point then like that like
will there be constant people but anyway
okay [lah] probably
it's gonna be better
!huh! but then if like not everyone get vaccinated then what's the point
when you were young [lah]
yup
ya but I think also anyway like when twenty twenty one come also like I mean even when they lift the restriction
I wouldn't really want to go travelling
ya I mean besides being the safest [lah] is like
is it really
contained or like their measures are very
effective and strict that kind
like so funny cause
[ah] I was looking at this youtube (um)
the youtube is from america [lah]
yes
so it's like (um)
she
went to a nursery with
so it's like
then like that don't need to wear [lah] I don't know [lah] it's so ya it's it's quite mix
ya
ya
but anyway it's a very interesting youtuber because
she already got a truck load of plants at her house
there's a lot of different plants that (um) she feature [lah]
and then (err) the like this the latest episode I watch when I went at the nursery she bought like really a lot of plant
and it has thorns
it's like quite tall and like got the mickey mouse
no the normal one is
the succulent [what] no [meh]
no it's like
[ah] it's like a
(um)
I don't know
it's new to me so
ya then after that she bought this plant called cardboard plant
ya it's like (um) apparently when the leaves are young
like
ya so it's quite interesting I haven't google what's the cardboard type
but these are all tropical plants though [ah]
ya
I don't know it's quite interesting but it's
ya it's quite tall
yes
(mmhmm)
they say that got more
I think it's more
it's true what they say like
cause I think it's like (um) you see
in a
and like the
kind of like the flow of the
it's
I don't know okay like some places is kind of like sud~ I think is majority sudden kind like they don't like say it two months earlier that kind at a candidate for a week before ya
ya
so I think (um)
(um) and there's no leeway [lah]
that is for business that's like I think for personal
lives wise
I mean I was really enjoying the C_B period but I think
for the personal wi~ lives wise
in a way the problem is in the sense of the old people
it like I think
it's not so healthy because
in their own way of keeping healthy [lah] so I think in that sense (err) that is that problem because once you enforce that rule of lockdown then it's like
their mental health is also at stake
they actually force them to actually
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
okay is okay [lah] but I think before
like
the government should be able to understand what the what other main points first before really trying to go to the next step because like the solution to everything shouldn't just be digitalisation [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(err)
burnt cheesecake
okay
true true true
(mm)
(mm)
I think
besides the domestic abuse also there are also like those (um)
like definitely their family size can be big for the space that they have
and then like
(um) minor the kids want to study and you know like there's not a lot of (err) amenities for them to study which are like the laptop [lah] the wifi all these things
so I think that was also an issue that they brought up then
girl in S_U_S_S
[ah] [ah]
see I think like that and she's also quite mature so she's able to find ways to make it work for her [lah] but for like elders other younger kids [leh] then how
ya
(mm)
then there was also the scramble for laptops for the primary school kids and secondary school kids for those underprivilege also that was one big issue and
lot of computers then after that how are your studies are definitely going be affected
then
how so I think that is a problem
yes
ya
ya I agree with that because I think that time like
the grass is already on the paper already yes
ya so there is definitely a good time today [lah] I think there were also reports plus (err) like
the air pollution all these things
but I think maybe the better way to do this is something that should be
(um)
thought of
like
okay [lah] the lockdown is to really curb the spread
ya
ya
but then also you also went up because of the
there is also the downside that it should
be like it shouldn't just be
actually foreign workers are also singaporeans [what] just because
they are staying in living in singapore but they don't own a singapore I_C
it's just a work permit I see but they are still considered as singaporeans [what] so it should be
(um)
encompass in all this care [lah]
but I think like
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya even (um)
my grandma also is staying on her own
ya and then
iphone ten
but more physically [lah] so
(err) that
could be a huge toll and I think it's a huge toll
on their lives
(mm)
no [lah] I don't think so I think it's more on like the focus was to bring down the number of cases why like what you say
ya
so I think that is definitely what
they didn't think of [lah] I guess
ya who be it because the number of cases were like
social worker
[oh] is it
[oh]
ya I think that could be something that could be worked on [lah]
case rising so
definitely that is not being taught
but
okay [lah] I guess
it is a little bit better now
ya cause I think to be honest if
ya not expecting more definitely
ya
that was so cool ya
I don't know I think it's been a very weird
ya
!aiyo! but twenty twenty one though like how many more days only
!hais!
don't know what's gonna happen and
(mm)
I think
how can nature be a problem
that's
how to collect the water on the leaf
never
okay okay [lor] if you say so [lor]
[ah]
then there is a big issue [lah]
but I think like
ya but I think environment got not much of an issue it's more of a plus than a minus
ya
but doesn't mean like
but
ya [lah] but I still think [lah] confirm under black market so it's not that much [lah]
for wildlife wildlife got nothing no issue wildlife always win against everything [one]
really [what]
(mm)
ya [lah] but
in the whole like
natural life pyramid we are at the bottom [what]
ya no
technically if a lion goes berserk and escape the zoo at it and we dead already [what]
I don't know I mean like
we are a predator but I guess
if you compare us against the animal kingdom ya the animal kingdom ya
but they have more than that [what] they have like
ya
ya so definitely we are at the losing end
so our left will win no matter what
meanwhile I should cancel my contribution to world wildlife
yup
ya
ya sure the dolphin can walk using the tail
ya I think no [lah] I think
then animal go home [lor]
take the bus [lor]
no [lah] I think definitely got a disruption in the ecosystem
but then again where
then like when put it back
wasted
but I think maybe they could just
kill the animal
buy one get one free
I think they kill it [leh]
[ah]
no what no no
ya but I think also to be safe they I mean since this
COVID is a new disease also [what] and that point of time they couldn't identify where was it from or how they
right like it could be a bat or whatever and how can it transferred to humans so definitely that farms closed
monstera
you know there's a monstera adansonii
then the normal monastery the breakages are at the side of the leaves right
[ah]
you have seen it before [what]
swiss cheese plant ya
not bad though
can consider
no I'm really taking out together
surviving
it lacks the tough life
anyway I have bought a new plant it's kind of prayer plant
what
should google it up the prayer plant
and (err) it's an indoor plant
(err)
not that fussy like monstera so it should be okay [lah]
technically not really [eh] it's not like a little sun only cause
indirect sunlight
(um)
but in awhile monstera are the
lower
eleven okay like for example the forest right you have the big forest you have the tall trees and then you have ferns on top of the trees that kind
ya weeds but monstera usually grow on the lower level ya so you have been blocked by the trees right I appreciate that
[ah] [ah]
really [meh] I thought ferns are like that
it's not hamster
ya
but
yup so the prayer plant is quite good for indoors
it (err) refreshes the air [ah] NASA say [one]
really
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
true [lah]
trustings
ya
I mean it looks nice
!huh!
I feel like don't know
this this one don't need sun and when you have your stuff
can
the snake grass plant snake
mothers in laws the tongues
the plant is already very hardy like you can just
put it somewhere and then like ya
the one that my room is quite
ignored nope
still healthy I don't know whether got new shoots I don't I don't even know whether these things can have new shoots or not because
shoots [ah] shoots
[oh]
okay [lah] but I think it's still alive and the prayer plant is something that
you should probably check it out it's quite nice it's like a zebra stripes like that
ya and it's easy to take care so
in the christmas tree plant that you got from me
okay wait [ah]
the next plant that I wanted to get is actually the hudsonia
actually not bad
and I don't know but I scared like
okay apparently like these plants in an aircon room okay the reason why that monstera is a will thing right is because of my aircon room ya
that is true [hor]
but anyway
the the prayer plant that I I think the wrapper two three nights in the aircon room
still sturdy and strong (um) so
what sort of plant got [meh]
coconut tree but it's not
does it look like a pandan leaf
I guess I know
[oh] my god my head
I cannot understand
okay sure but then there's also another plant called the cast iron plant
because it's very like
no like apparently like if you
practically put that plant in your cupboard for some time it still survive
a bit different [lah] the milkshake
ya but anyway it's quite (um) it's quite a journey
but like the the place where I bought the prayer plant and I saw them (um) water the plant
like it they pouring into the side [lah] not from on top dirty fingers cause her bodily so they're like you just poured directly inside better at the water will drain out man
and it's like a lot of water
I'm like !wow! like that [ah]
but if you like that means you are also putting the plant at risk [what]
scotch tap [hor] it's not plastic wrap
cause I never see my mother already take the whole
so I was quite amazed like [oh] okay you can actually do that
ya
so I think maybe
I mean definitely for the monstera also
I really hope I can get their items only I I was also thinking to buy the variegated one
the two hundred dollar one
I mean
once I know how to take care [lah]
once it's the one at home the
the fenestrations fenestrations
ya then maybe I can buy that
but then I don't know where to put
my room is quite small
no one [lah] not the standard issue plan [lah] and then like that one at
what is that
I don't understand
(hmm)
tomorrow I got dinner
it's quite
he wants to eat #jinjja# chicken
I don't know I haven't ask him where where to go
ya
ya
then twenty fourth you all got the christmas thing going on so that's also another dinner which is probably
(err) our christmas gathering [lor] exco base
ya
like cauliflowers
right the cauliflowers
ya I'm gonna do it at scott's house
chill [lah] whatever [lah]
I mean not whatever but
at least if it's a
outside location ya true
Q I don't know that's why we need to wait for the food
it's more comfy
I haven't buy present
I got two
okay good
!hais!
what's the theme
more than thirty
[oh] I thought usually if not more than
ya that's why really helping the economy good job though
ours is
buy something that starts with S
so I'm going to buy scott but my secret santee is fanny [ah] charlotte [lah]
but
I think I want to buy each of them a smaller present just to include everyone so
for scott I went to buy a packet of salt and the glow in the dark stars sticker that one
and I'm going to give him last
then will be like don't so salty here's your present
ya then therefore shanice I'm going to buy
school supplies she's also going back to school
(err) ya S_I_M R_M_I_T [ah]
doing comms [ah]
ya she was a victim so funny like I think she's not even a year at a new place then she quit already
then she was asking me about like the school life and stuff like that then I'm like okay [lah] not bad [lah] then sense a different [lor] different vibe here
ya but she's not that far off [lah] if you think about her age and the people there
youngest in amongst us

achievable
friends [lah] I I know it's important but then (uh) friends that can can I think I mean can really together sit with you (uh) (uh) I mean like you can share things together
[oh] yes (uh) I'm more like want to have a peace of mind [lah] just want to have a peace of mind that that that I think (uh) because (uh) we have been through a lot you know for the past year
you know we have been like rushing through things so I now I think this (uh) the ten years time is to whereby I would like (uh) you know (um)
(um)
relax myself there is no rushing to settle down
[ah] [ah] [ah] like for you how
there will be new one I let go
(um)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
so meaning that [ah]
that means if in ten years time you will be thirty [lah] so at that age you
you still want to like (uh) you know pursue your interest
(uh) in science
okay
(mm) (mm)
okay
(uh) if there was a drama [kan] (um) I mean I like to watch action movie [lah] actually
ya cause action movie
working but then you you
you really like (um) awake that means you're really awake and you are like (uh)
you are you are really amazed you know amazed
ya stimulated and you are really amazed by their their skills [lah]
[ah]
yes correct (uh) correct
scenario settings (uh) you know once in a while okay [lah] once in a while ya
how about you
what kind of (uh) genre did you like to watch
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay okay
(mmhmm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
how come got become an actor choose body or looks
if I become an actor no [lah] that [one] is different question
(mmhmm)
(uh) I think fit body [lah] better rather than good looks I mean I no doubt good looks is important but then fit body is actually got to do with stamina because if your body is fit meaning that you have a better stamina (uh) you see if you are talking okay I mean not only about actors [lah] okay I mean like everyday life also [lah] we are talking about everyday life
I mean fit body is most is the most important
you know you don't feel lethargic easily you don't feel tired easily you see
so you are always active but imagine that if you don't have a fit body only good looks
right I mean what can you do I mean
what can you do you know I mean fit body is the the most important [lah]
yes correct correct
ya correct of course (um) of course we want both we want fit body and good looks you know because usually people say that if you have a fit body you have a good looks (uh) you know [ah] people say you have it's naturally
it is naturally [lah] like that
so what will you think
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya so you see [eh] like nowadays generation you can see the different generation [eh] how they are very (um) they spend a lot you know to buy makeup for their own looks
but then they they they always [ah] you know
that is only external but not internal you see [ah] this is what they they forgot [lah] so I think (um)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) okay because I think about mental health [ah] it has to be
(uh)
[ah] that any friends that you think that (uh) that support you and any friends that you that (uh) you know can give you advice to go to that type of friends you you cannot keep to yourself [lah] whatever so that it doesn't tre~ when you have a problem you don't bottle up
[ah] at least at least you have (uh) somebody to help you on how to solve the your problem
you long stem from under you know really overwhelming
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
correct
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)
I think ya it's true it's true I think that (um) okay when you talking about the schools [eh] (um)
not everybody can actually cope okay cause human being [ah] they they have their own limitations okay their their own limitations
can take the stress so you cannot push them further [lah]
[ah] because [ah]
correct
correct
correct
ya
correct correct
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
where would I want to go
(mm)
children days are really a a days that memorable days [lah] I mean
I I know that it maybe may be sound like (uh) like not not many people maybe not many people also have that memories children you know fond memories of (uh) like childhood memories [lah] childhood fond memories but like as for me
(uh) as a kid [ah] ya like work studies stress like so much you you know you eat you sleep [ah] that's it play around that's it of course always scolding from the parents but after that you find that
ya but
ya correct but I know that not everybody [lah] have their own good childhood memories
so how about you
[oh] okay
(mm)
(mm)
the theme
within a floor think you can it you mention long term
(mmhmm)
(um)
yes
it will do money like you know let me near grew from a nuclear war they're gonna company I think it'll be grateful
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) three wishes [eh]
(um) okay
okay the first wish that I can think of is (uh)
a healthy life [lah]
ya I I just want to have a good healthy life
and then (um)
people oriented ya I cannot see people especially children [eh] when they are in need children in hunger [ah] you see at some countries right where they are being left like you know in in a war by their parents
dead and all that so I think (um) a bit sensitive to their situation
okay then the third one the third one the third one (uh) the third one
what is it [ah] third one [ah]
(mm)
like for me right I think the other wish is that (mm)
but (um)
you you you you always want to see that your child is also healthy [lah] healthy body and healthy mind
(uh) and then the the best part is (uh) good behaviour because I think there is no point if I wish that my children to be successful in life
but then they do not have a good (uh) behaviour they do not know how to respect old people they do not know how to
(um) respect others
(uh) yes then (um) the their they do not have the love you know or compassion or what towards each other you know so the the behaviour that value is the most important [lah]
(uh) to me I mean there's no point they succeed in their life but then
I I just hope [lah] that my children are not like that and then (uh) I just hope that whatever that my children do they must (uh) always think that life is really temporary
(uh) in this tough life it's it's all temporary there is there (um)
[ah] that is my my wishes [lah] I I think for my for my children
for my children
(mm)
yes correct no I mean (uh) of course when you have money and all that people don't look down on you
I mean ya bad reputation and
correct
yes yes good nature correct
ya
yes yes yes yes correct
[ah] you see
ya no
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
ya
ya
there is (uh) good and bad [lah] we are talking okay let let us you know talking about phone first [eh]
see [ah] there there is a good and bad [lah] when talking about phones okay (uh) cause when the good part is that
the the information is at your fingertips
[ah] you know nowadays try you want to find like okay eateries okay you just google google and see you get eateries
you know it's it's it's it's very it's very easy [lah] and everything information at the fingertips but
this is what we are afraid of that they get hooked into it and then after that they forget about other things they forgot about doing things you see like nowadays
the I mean it's difficult [lah] to control it is more I think challenging
[ah] now you know for the parents of the now the the younger generation cause they need to foresee them they need to control [ah] you know their children so it's I think it's not really easy [lah] it's not really easy
(mm) it's not really easy
you know maybe you got for you it's got an educational purpose now
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
cause because I think everything is being programmed in the A_I
[ah] so that means like they only know and they only create this based on what is being programmed
(um) you see
ya I mean mean of of course
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah] then after that
ya
ya
!wah! I think [ah] I think with this A_I right people will have develop more mental health problem
so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
(uh) it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
[ah] kids also starting school soon
(um)
when
march [eh] [eh] march april
I I think so
because (uh) now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised
and (uh) we are in phase three
and I think some of the regulation and (uh) rules like (uh) have lax a bit [lah]
so I think they would allow us to do to (uh) the visiting this year what do you think
ya I think so too probably (uh) direct relative
and
ya
I don't know the the government haven't
ya issue any notice yet about
celebration
the thing you have been doing (uh) quite a bit of research these past few days and I've been
reviewing your proposal
so we can can consider some of (uh) the ideas that
we share in the WhatsApp
WhatsApp group
so I ya I think we should we should (err) you know
find some I (uh)
find the I_D to get some quotation
what is (err)
what is your i~ (uh) your your ideas for the renovation
(uh) minimalist
[oh] I
(uh)
I think con~ open concept I I I'm okay with the open concept
(uh)
[ah]
you are my (uh) private
cook
ya (uh) I will buy all the ingredient
and then (uh) I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter (um)
you want a you want to put like a gla~ (uh) you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
(uh) the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because [ah] ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better [lah] because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and (uh) moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food [lah]
ya
and then
ya
(uh)
to to (uh) depends on (uh)
(mm)
[kan] [ah]
(mm) ya I I think you you think that concept
(err) I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack (uh) (uh) the what you call that the the wall there
(err)
and then you (uh) you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
[oh] okay [lah]
ya [lah]
you think because (uh) Facebook and I_G have been
spying spying on your on your your search
so I think
what what you are searching
they they know what you are searching so they are trying to match what you are searching
right
ya ya I think
the (uh) ya ya can
can can be done can be done
so
(mm)
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the li~ the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
(uh) multiple attempt to
(uh) kill them
they (uh) they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
(uh) it (uh) spraying the the lizard repellents (uh) spray all over the window all over the house
I've been kill~ killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too [lah] the our our house here I think
(uh) the it's there's a lot of (uh) lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient [ah] even though I've tried to to to hit them [ah] is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
[oh] my god so (uh) I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
[ah]
(err)
ya
ya
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time [lah] it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners (uh) I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity [lah] it's a it's a need [lah] more of a need
necessity because everything has (err) you know
wears down you know
and (uh) our our kitchen looks quite dirty and (uh) rundown and (uh)
our our the (uh) you call it the flooring starts to (uh) wears down
[ah] ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and (uh) they feature a few (uh) I_Ds [lah] but (uh) so far three D contractors (uh) in terms of
the the the outcome [ah] it it it suits our taste [ah]
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
I_Ds in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
[eh] very nice [lah] we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but (uh) ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that (uh)
not not not the sink [ah] kitchen tap
quite a few [lah] and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus [oh] one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
to finish off the [ah]
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
!aiya!
I don't know [lah] it's both it is both (uh) frustrating and funny at the same time [eh]
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then (err)
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
(uh)
self guilt [lah] I think so I don't know [lah]
ya
cement
[oh]
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship [lah]
ya
ya the W_C was
(uh) ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the W_C but behind the W_C they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the W_C
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him [lah] probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain [oh] ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery [lah] but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
(mm) ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare [lah] how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how [lah]
which one we we want to choose
[ah]
so
(mm)
ya
major major [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
[kan]
one kit~ (uh) so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package [ah]
[oh]
ya
[kan] might as well [kan]
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
roundest seri~ I think thousand four or thousand five around there
do it
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay [lah] thousand five [ah] [eh]
so I think ya [lah]
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can o~ overlay with it now so when the tile
in (uh) (uh) in the future we have (uh)
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
[ah]
ya
send me the one
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring [ah]
I think that [one] is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that [one] the the more expensive one
(mm)
but have to
you have to ya [lah] everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water suck~ water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
if we have the ex~ the budget can consider [lah] I think that one's quite expensive is around
!wah! but I find it like very good [leh]
and it's wireless
(mm)
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
(uh) brands (uh)
(uh) have that those type of (uh) two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that [one] very good [ah] (uh) I think
can con~ can consider [lah] if we have the means
but now we !aiya! we see how for now we just use manually first [ah]
use the sucking mop [ah]
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no some~
(uh) sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive [ah]
ya that [one] really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence [ah] because like I told you earlier on
(err) ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the I_D the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the I_D
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence [lah]
ya
(mm)
the specific (uh) ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the I_D
ya
[ah] ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different I_Ds
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the I_D who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well [lah]
ya that specific
I_D okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
(mm)
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally [lah] ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya [lah] ha~ like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) I think this saturday we we settle (uh) #akid's# (uh) school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare #akid# (uh) school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
(uh) the the the the renovation [ah]
(mm) so actually we K we we need to ya [lah] we ours we we are the one who should
direct them [oh] we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration [ah]
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but [ah] ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want
it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot [ah] too risky
okay
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
(uh) how about this month I think we should start to meet the I_D or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but (uh)
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the I_D to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
WhatsApp
you know like the english one the contem~ not contemporary [ah] english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like B_T_O style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
(uh) (uh) [lah] okay [lah] then I I have to agree with you [lah] we go we put the partition that means
[eh] ya [lah] correct [lah] when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like B_T_O that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like (um)
[ah] like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
!chey! private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt [lah] all that [lah] so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny [ah]
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya beca~ like (uh)
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
(mm)
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the I_D will
(uh) mistook it for the open concept like those B_T_Os did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
(uh) or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
(mm)
[eh] but the other day I went through (um) this hard zone or something [lah] the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across (uh) this person
(uh) he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else [lah] then it's already two K
just the platform
(mm)
I put (uh) under
(uh) extra budget column
in the planning [lah] so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then [ah] the service balcony you know the
the doorway (um) between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills (uh) window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it [what] so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay [ah]
(mm)
actually not bad [leh] you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that (uh) different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
!wah! I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
(uh) came to real life you know really [eh] so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like (uh) extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this [one] is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
[ah]
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else [oh] ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
(err) like the window grill I don't know
so but then that [one] I haven't research (uh)
but (uh) ya
I think I think it's because [ah] it's already old [lah] that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not [what] it's supposed to be tight [what] like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the (uh) the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this [one] capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical (uh) wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our M_P
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya [lah] that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that pho~ like phobia [lah] because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
(uh) recipients
[eh] but [eh] but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back !yay! belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house [ah] you watch the host [ah] hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
[eh] but the new season (uh) the other day I was (uh) randomly (uh) looking for I_Ds right
and then I saw (uh) one of the I_Ds actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
(um) the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was [ah] what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this [one] this time round is this company !aiya! I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually (uh) watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this I_D [ah] if not actually I_D (uh) three D innovation is good [leh]
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
(uh) what do you call that low income families [eh]
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them [ah] because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget [lah] maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what [ah] you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper [lah] okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back (uh)
[oh] we didn't even say anything but he himself say that (uh) we we call
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years [eh] the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the (uh) what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that [one]
(uh) wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman [seh] to install our this [one] the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only [lah] that [one] okay [lah] but even so (uh) remember the
the W_C also not proper
hollow [eh]
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask [what] we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
(uh) and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to #hafari# right
then [ah] then after that (mm)
either that or he know that he never do correctly [lah] he ne~ maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable [what] right because ya it's a expensive tile
(mm)
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time I_D you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the I_D right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope [lah] we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet (uh) I_Ds already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
they give us a quote at least we know (uh) like we compare with other I_Ds
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the (uh) is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more I_D we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for I_Ds is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
hopefully that [one] will reduce the cost [ah] cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist (uh) off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have [ah] that [one] already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
[ah]
[ah] package ya two standard
(mm)
(mm)
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
[oh] double
[ah]
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if (uh) whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same (uh) the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need (uh)
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own (uh) contractor for the vinyl right
[ah] when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
[ah]
ya it is the newest click function that [one] right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own [one] but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
[ha]
[ah]
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in (uh) kids room
[oh]
ya
[eh] (mm)
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company (uh) he mentioned actually the more we do the bet~ the cheaper they will give [what] remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
(mm)
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that [one] cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know (uh) overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that [one] also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is (uh) I remember is they say it was fi~ fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean [eh] you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
(hmm)
vinyl
(mm)
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this [one] remember this [one] got two option we this [one] is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move [one] without lesser groove
ya
maybe that [one] cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser [ah] grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more cle~ kitchen has to be the cleanest place
(mm)
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop (uh) water sucking mop [what]
that [one] that [one] you won't go into the groove
ya [lah] it suck water the mop suck water right
wat~ wat~ [ah]
okay water absorbing mop
[oh]
[oh] that [one]
that [one] very expensive that [one] is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but [ah] make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous [eh] that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old (uh) [oh] now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M [one] but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
!huh! difficult N_T_U_C have [what]
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home [one] you go and find no
only that brush [sial] no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
[ah]
okay so (uh) actually [oh] I forgot to tell you I (uh) I sign up through Renopedia
and then (um) through there there will be I_Ds contacting me [ah] like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even (uh) ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection [lah] so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the I_Ds that instruct interest interested
then will contact us [lah] through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the I_D companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia [what] right
so is all go back to our own research [ah]
actually they say (um) doesn't mean the I_Ds very the company [eh] very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual I_D so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the (uh) company but I must also research (uh) and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the I_D also may
[ah] hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then (uh) also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then (err)
I already sha~ shortlisted the I_Ds that like
I don't know like maybe we can go (uh) down and (uh) have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give [lah]
ya (uh) but I haven't show you then I I even I even (uh) wrote down their names the I_Ds
(uh)
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
[oh] ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down [what]
(mm)
it must be a balance [ah] we don't we don't want I_D that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those I_Ds who only one they're designed to be
[ah] to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house
what you doing
what game are you playing
what you want to do for your birthday
you want eat seoul garden
but I don't want [ah]
I was thinking should we go back to the
that that wakuwaku restaurant

stop it [lah] [sia]
and I actually tell you I am busy
my hands are like filled
the worker is not the common worker that I work with right
[ah]
[ah]
both of you are of the same size same height [sia]
but ya about the same size
I don't know whatever [lah]
I mean I just take the pot and just want to place at the location [ah]
that really is so funny
there are fun moments really there are actually there are many fun moments [ah]
(uh) if we say anything wrong or scold you or what right we sorry [lah]
(uh)
like that so just now I know working very hard [lah] but this one little bit thing for you like make you happy [ah]
(uh) (uh) [sia]
then then after that
(err) but sister if if eat late right later the food spoil [lah] then not nice to eat already then problem how sister
so okay [lah]
I want to buy #biryani# I even ask them you know like
the first few month of COVID
[ah] bulk [ah]
(mm) which [eh]
as long as you are happy [ah]
of course [ah]
when I was in school that's what I learn myself [sia] B
nobody's gonna teach you this kind of nonsense [sia]
(err) I don't know [lah] they they they I think they don't believe in it [ah] but for me is I believe in it because build rapport you know why you know why I say this thing is good or not
yes
(err) I'm fine thank you
ya
(um) I ya I I feel like this battery on this phone is is not gonna go well so
hopefully can record for one hour already present but it looks like it's twenty percent
it looks like it's twenty percent
I don't know maybe like talk about (um)
how our day went yesterday
how's your day
okay for me okay so for me (um)
(ugh)
I work as a social distance ambassador so
in this COVID period you have to tell people to like you know stay one meter and all that kind of stuff and then there was this like (err) couple
[ah] redirected to me and then like I I I ask [lah] hi sir how may I help you
(um) and so (err)
ya then then the wife eating the wife started eating her hot dog then after that will like
hopefully
ya okay hopefully ya
at your you're risking yourself [lah] to exposure to virus so
no eating in the store at all you know
rude [lah] so it's like my wife is eating not me you know that kind of stuff so we have this kind of difficult customers coming in and they're just like fully self entitled and they feel like
you know like (um) like we don't have a like (um) like we are like lower than them
correct ya so (err)
ya then the day before it was quite funny because (um) there was this (err) couple they went out
and then they changed their mind they came back in the thing was that so many people pass by you wouldn't even remember hard what their faces look like most of the time unless they are like outstanding in terms of their their clothes or hair right so this plain looking couple they went
back in !hey! but they're plain
so they were wearing like just normal t-shirt and shorts and then (um) ya so they were they came in and
(err) I was like hi ma'am have you taken your temperature upstairs and then she started like !hey! why you so rude you're not doing your job you know
damn like what because in my head like if I don't stop you from coming in from the exit I am not doing my job I'm doing my job simply because I'm stopping you right now you know so
you're very rude you know like why are you talking to me like this like like I'm stupid like that after that like it's like you're not doing your job you know you want you want me to show you my entry pass but the thing is that
even you show might if you even if you show your entry pass right you can scan it anywhere
before even entering the store so the only way I would know if you actually like enter the store in the proper way is by taking a temperature upstairs so if you take your temperature upstairs and you come in from within the store that is fine you know it's validated because like
you already went through the process but then you exited nobody notice you exiting and then came back in
from the exit and then you insisted that I'm being rude because I caught you
from entering the exit place then it's like (err) she was like [oh] like I'm educated you know why you so rude the~ the~ the~ I was like piece of shit like
bloody bitch you know that I have graduated with honours
mother toot
so it's like what the fuck this happening
(mmhmm)
okay you know why because we are having this kind of job it lead it seems lowly that like you don't have education or you low education that's why you get this kind of job you know what I mean but at the same time [ah] they never considered that this kind of people
I even have like air stewardess air stewards (um) crane operators (err) tour guides all these people are working with me and they are having this kind of job as a security guard or as a social distance ambassador simply because
their industry is closed you know so like you're trying to find a job to put food on the table
(mm) (mm)
correct so how how how was yours how did it go
(mmhmm)
!wah! that is late
(mm)
my alarm [lah] [oh] my god
you know that's a typical (um) an (err) reaction from old people the audience be like
your mum's friend
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
correct
(mm)
!aduh!
(mm) (mm)
that is right
correct
(mm)
I think I'm still lost but
correct I mean even until you die I don't think you'll find a way actually
(mm)
(mm)
#alhamdulillah#
an example but in that but at the same time to mature this is my my share [lah] we are we are we pick out of job because of question unless you are already
if you put your personal check with you if you want to be educated the person you would not help the person all the way to that at I not go or any other person does the same thing as you and only you [lah] as of now [lah]
ya because like I mean like for
I would try not to because at the same time like I feel that I'm putting sometimes [lah] like when I do things on putting myself too out there that like (um) I don't think about myself I don't think about my own welfare and I don't spend time with my family just kind of stuff
I mean it's great that you're helping but like ya I mean
there's a there's a limit to it [lah] in terms of like
like
it's like it's so rude of you to say that because why I'm helping you because you are my family but at the same time I do not (um)
approve of your behaviour even at your grandmother's funeral you are busy with your makeup
and like you know like
you know they're breeding this kind of inconsiderate people hopefully not but you know like
like you know like what we say before [lah] like we're not breeding because because because of our preferences and at the same time we also don't want to breed this kind children you know what I mean
I'm not saying that we're bad people but because we are we're thinking about it responsibility responsibly that's why we are not breeding these kind of people you know you mean but like [oh] my god there's so many people breeding and they all not really good people
and (um)
(um) for me because (um)
like currently the industry shut down right so I'm doing freelance that one can do at home [lah] which is editing video editing and then like the social distance ambassador which I do like five to six five two eight hours a day kind of (err)
ya correct (mm) and then like
is like you know like you love your father but you can I don't like my father you know
like you you figure your shit out [lah]
my mum know [lah] that he doesn't work [lah]
that's why she divorce him [lah]
you know
when I was in (err) primary one primary two
ya with that was like eight years old
I'm if I'm eight years old she's like twelve
ya so
ya ya
my brother one year younger so ya so
ya this quite long (um)
since I was in primary two [ah] I don't know eight years old (um) now I'm twenty nine so twenty one years old twenty one years ya but I mean
sorry
no [lah] she remarried and then (um) she divorced when I was in M_I ya
(mm)
ya then like #alhamdulillah# like long time [lah] but my step mum also at one point wanted to divorce him because
he simply not working and not trying to provide for the family [lah] and then the other day he had the audacity wiki because my my younger brother my youngest brother he was talking to my father he said [eh] (err) I'm going to I'm going to the food court [lah] to meet my friend because my friend just got his heart brokenhearted like
I mean re~ literally all he does at home is watch videos and (um)
and like he's working
sometimes I really like
like just (err) pray to god [lah] #alhamdulillah# my step mum is a nice person that she like you know that she is still wants to stay with him and provide for him because she did thought of divorcing and then like you know (err) one funny day (err) my youngest sister told me she's like
which is even I wouldn't want I I I love him as a father because
when I was working my full time job [lah] I would say I give like around one hundred and fifty and then my father I gave him hundred I put him in his own bank account that one what the fuck he wants to do it whatever the fuck he want to do is fine
but whatever I give my step mum you don't touch so (um) ya I mean like that's how I usually give my and then like the thing is that my father's attitude is so bad he likes to take money from people he likes to wait for money to be given to him
so we re going up up somehow you just like he likes to compare and power that [lah]
was to like maybe set up a (mm) maybe he shouldn't even have set up a family
but like he already done it and he already like
put her name inside the house you know because he doesn't want her to get the ownership
then he was damn lucky that my step mum will stay with him [lah] even though because at one time [lah] they wanted to divorce then we we advise them [lah] like as the older children we advise them to stay together [lah] if they if they can
why are we born in a poor family
ya because he he's he said like I triggered I triggered I triggered why are we so poor blah blah blah
then you triggered you fucking everyday you have food but you choose to eat mcdonald's
you triggered everyday have food but you waste it you triggered but now you have a fucking laptop you know what I mean it's like you are privilege you are just like it feels just like those (err) chinese people in society where they say [oh] I am disadvantage blah blah blah all that shit
but you have all these privileges if you are truly poor you don't have much food on the table you will eat rice and egg maybe everyday if you are truly poor you you wouldn't be able to
(um) on the fan all night long all day long everyday sleep in
(mm)
ya so ya I mean I'm s~
and I just like like what the fuck man
like you feel like they they would be better [lah] or you can benefit
ya I mean
I want to be productive as well that's why I'm like working but then at the same time I'm not earning much from this like S_D_A job you know and my freelance doesn't come all the time
and the education system for me is too rigid it's like bloody like you're not teaching kids to think you're teaching kids to be book smart which is wrong because at the end of the day right
I already go through university I even finished university
what the hell ever I learned in school right most of it I don't use
correct so
(mm) which one the gri~ the guy [ah]
ya that bastard
that is true
ya but like (um) so like you were schooled in singapore and then you school malaysia now so like (err) what do you feel like what's the difference in the school curriculum the total atmosphere
then you can talk to about it [lah] until the time is up [ah]
book smart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
correct
(mm)
(mmhmm)
that's great
ya you can tell from
correct malaysian and singaporean you can tell how they talk and the way they dress our fashion style and our the way we articulate things is very different
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
it is
(mmhmm)
ya it's so fast right your time like [oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
correct because the thing is at in J_B in
in K_L all these places are where (um) a lot of tourists come so the rates down there are definitely higher things are definitely more expensive because they want to rake in all the foreigners' money because foreigners will be like [oh] I convert
of course
(mm)
ya because you you typically like you like other people also go to malaysia thinking about the exchange rate but you should never think about the exchange rate because you are spending in that currency per se
(mm)
[oh]
lol
and then you can can with friends to baby gear dealership
I would think that you will like that kind of girl
ya
[ah] of course knowing you you would have dressed up
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya is your acts right
(mm)
(mm)
correct
(mm)

whether she want to consider that

and
ya I did know
[ah] he applied to two [ah] company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
[ah] it was an unpaid job
for
(um) until I was maybe
(um) nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
(um)
by their apparel
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like (um) the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
(err) when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
tell me [lah] like [oh] you need to start
(um) charging these people because you are having a lot of (um)
and #alhamdulillah# it also went well
[ah]
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
(um) sell their products [ah]
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
(uh) and it didn't work [ah]
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because [ah] her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one I_G story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales [lah] so I was like okay (um) actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and legit~ they (um) they really spread the word and tag you know
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
other companies ya
(mmhmm)
usually (um) before we post something right for the company we also like send the
what do they call it
okay [lah] the context [ah] the context of the post [ah] we
ya the description we always like (um) send it
[ah] on our post
(uh) it's our post because we are like (um) ya
usually is like that
[ah] no that that's the thing that's why I don't (um) I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like (um) they told me [lah] like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
(um) is very difficult
(um) and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle [lah] but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve P_M
so I work Starbucks from six A_M opening to eleven A_M
and then I go school and then after school (um) there's a photo shoot may~ maybe that lesson (um) end at three P_M or four P_M
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night [lah] something like that
ya it's like it's very bad [lah] is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up (uh) my own company [ah]
(um)
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
!alamak! we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
(mm)
because all of this (um) of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
(um) creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well [lah] and
(uh) (uh)
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
their customers like
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face [lah] when I'm opening this (um) Kamash
(um)
yes
and
out first what [ah] [ah]
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
eight colours already sold out
ya
[ah] we manufacture ourself
[ah] no (uh) we liaise with a factory in #jakarta#
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
(mm)
no [lah] I mean like obviously (uh) when you grow up
[eh]
[ah] my god okay it needs to switch
naturally (um)
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
cons about being a nurse
and then [ah]
some personal reasons [lah] for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a S_I_A
crew
those type of
incident
car crash [eh] plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee [what]
and
ya [lah] exactly then I was like okay sure
so [ah] basically [ah]
so I'm like okay [lah] since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
(um) ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor [orh] an acting
[orh] okay [ah] clown doctor

so
ya
but it was good though
(mm)
[oh] I see
[oh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
ya that's that's the thing
(um) usually people are afraid to set a price
(um)
we calculate our expenses [ah] and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see [lah] (um) like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like [oh] we can sell it from this price to this price no low~ (uh) no lower than that
if it's lower than that (um) means
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya

but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in [what] and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
and then like I was training at

ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's (um)
so ya
(um) how to say [ah]
they hold their respect [lah] towards their opponent
like are ready to like [ah] I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman
ya

[oh] like to ask if you think like it's rude

I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
but to them I say [oh] okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
so something like that

!huh!
[ah]
that's why
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
we need to have a balance of our life and work wait work commitments from time to time
consider of (uh) finding something else [lah] like what you have done which is good
we have to be answerable for our own actions
same like when you go to your new work place you have this kind of situation whereby politics comes in
[ah] consistency how you want to keep your consistent [ah] status
making sure that whatever you have done
[ah] you do it you must know what you are doing you cannot affort to just like [ah] do something without knowing what you are doing correct [ah]
kevin you re~ remember kevin from covalent aircon [eh] kevin
yes correct [ah] you are right I spoke to boss about this matter I told boss we need to give a waiver
!huh!
[ah] so it's fair for us to ask him to quote but hopefully I think he can quote for the motor no issue but to quote for the air issue he may not want to quote
you want english you want malay you want english or malay or you want korean
do they have muslim in korea
tomorrow they are coming down right to see the exhaust thing [lah] correct tomorrow you follow me [lah] help me eleven to eleven thirty

so you can assure victoria that you are also come down and check your due diligence
we left already fiona told me [eh] #rasyidi# you say wrongly this one not by landlord this one by tenant tenant tenant tenant
she will send an email to the tenant to say that those who install are tenant so tenant have to maintain
the faulty E_M full meter sensor right I think they have to get
their own contractor to to repair I mean at their own cost [lah]
whatever they do is all at their own cost correct including T_M_C for J_C_S right correct
not yet but this lady is is very fast this new tenant she is very [ah]
very fast and she really wants the the so called this
cylinder part outside you know the gas part outside later I show you outside
later I show you [ah] the units half right half the unit they going to do that that means [ah]
if you see halfway through right from the glass entrance
people will go there just to buy food and go away [ah] and maybe just a few seats and tables and chairs [lah]
then after that they will have a raised platform right because we they we raise the height right correct for the for the for the pipes
no the you mean the cement [eh]
the cement will be the second half of the unit [what] second half
it means it's not the for the front [tau] the front will be rental it would not go up !huh!
maybe they have to put some
they can go to the level one toilet
(mm) so
they are not going to be easy to handle they are very demanding
[ah] a lot of submission concern about this then she say you know what know she say that [oh] the sprinkler worse [ah] don't need do submission
her consultancy [ah] the sprinkler actually bring down right the sprinkler for the kitchen hood all don't need do submission
you do modification you need to do submission to S_C_D_F correct
and then she's using fire to cook of course must
[ah] to S_C_D_F but that is for the gas installation
now you have your kitchen hood you have all your whatever right
you need to also do submission
they want to make sure that whatever you are doing is you know going to be safe correct

(mm)
debate and then eventually you will become unhappy again
like become such a cool mum [ah]
having disputes [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
(mm)
yes
grow up
ya
tense up [ah] [ah]
ya ya
fight [ah] ya ya
ya ya
like always imposing [ah] ya
ya ya
ya
[a'ah]
[ah]
probably probably ya
(mm)
you know the the thing that that grown ups don't realise probably we might be the grown ups in the future you know but but one thing they don't realise is that you cannot you cannot apply the same
technique towards everybody like for example okay ya ya ya because why some people you talk nicely it will work some people you force them it will work but maybe maybe she didn't identify that okay you are the kind that I cannot force probably she has to do it subtly I think for you right you are the kind of person if if I based on what I hear [lah] [ah] if I'm you're mother I would actually act kindly so that you will feel bad eventually you do it right
why [ah] what what's the relation bro
okay
ya
ya
but you don't look hard outside [leh] you look soft outside and inside you are marsh~ [eh] fudgemallow you look like a nice guy bro
get hard about it [ah]
adamant [ah]
[oh] okay okay okay
ya
(mm)
ya I get it I get it I get it ya
ya
probably it's her her adamants her ego also [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] you know what dude actually what right (uh) one thing you should actually I recommend [lah] you go and download this google podcast and then you listen to this book how to win friends and influence people but by right it's a book [ah] dale carnegie dale carnegie so that actually taught me a lot you know you know why bro because I'm a lot like that I used to actually want to force down people's throat my ideas you know and then I realise that [eh] no no some people actually (uh) you you cannot straightaway just jam it down their throat you know different people you have to apply dif~ apply different technique [lah] then that's when I learn and life got so much smoother you know bro it's less there's less fights it's less bitterness it's more positivity you know you learn to compromise and it's such a !wah! dude my life has been so relax bro for the past few years even though we're going through like financial difficulties or what [lah] but I don't feel burdened you know I feel like a everything is still good [lah]
you can listen to the audiobook bro you know remember that time we if you saw the article I was doing foodpanda for awhile it was during the cycling moments that I always listen to the audiobook [ah] and the other one that I recommend right is the subtle art of not giving an F [ah]
very rude you know and I I sometimes wonder why can't you be nice yes so apparently it's because it's a psychological thing it's if people naturally in life they just wanna feel accepted important or they want to feel (um) wanted ya so that is how you know like girls with daddy issue because they never had a proper father figure they just want to feel love like in like a man to love them and that's another another might be because they've been bullied all their life you know so now when they walk the streets they want to walk like there are some gangster like do you know how sometimes the #mats# can walk like that or the #bengs# they want to walk like they're so fierce there's actually we should pity them and empathise them you know because they are the ones that actually have issues inside you know
like !whoa! so big like they as if they got like big triceps [ah] that cannot close there arm like that
no but it's pitiful though bro because they actually have issues within you know so when they that's why they give a F about these things that doesn't matter like so we should actually learn how to channel our energy on what matters most what matters more what can help help us grow because I also do partially sometimes I help do life coaching also [lah] ya so when when people spoke to me I will just shift their perspective a bit you know because I can relate you know remember that time I ever spoke to you about you wanting to be a pilot
[oh] really [ah]
ya that's why I don't remember which one you're talking about
ya ya ya that was the first time [lah] [ah]
opening [ah] ya and then you told me about your eyesight is it
[a'ah] then then then
I I think so [ah] why [ah] recall recall recall help me recall
[oh] ya okay okay then then then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya then then then
!oi! my memory very bad [lah] bro very bad bro (mm)
(mm)
what do you mean what do you mean I don't understand
[ah]
ya
ya
okay
something new [ah]
(oo)
okay [ah]
ya ya you can like transfer [ah] ya
okay
[ha]
flying [ah] (mm)
[ah]
okay
okay
okay
ya
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya because in the sky there's so many thing to look out for like a lot of cars what you mean correct there's nothing in the sky what do they need such clear eyesight
look if a plane can crash in the vast sky [ah] that person should never have been a pilot [sia] but I don't think this is a matter of eyesight anymore you know this is a matter of how dumb that person can be
ya
[oh] eventually they change [lah] when did they change
okay okay
(mm)
(mm) ya ya ya
okay
!wah! motivated like crazy [sia]
[oh] very young [ah]
[ah]
okay
okay then after that after that
okay okay
(uh huh)
okay okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
(mm)
[oh] okay okay
(mm)
okay
okay
let go [ah]
so so ela~ okay bro so if let's say somebody say if you have one superpower what would it be you will choose flying [ah] you would not you would not take super speed lightning speed
but when you have super speed you can flap your wings and fly [what] okay
okay
okay okay
what
okay okay okay [ah]
then what do you need
ya but why is it a mistake wha~ how did it became a mistake what do you mean
okay
okay
okay
alright
strength [ah] ya ya ya
[oh] but but you mean the mistake is not not a mistake in the sense that it affected your career [lah] it's more of like (uh) okay okay not not so much of a mistake [lah] not so much
okay okay
okay then then after that after that after that what happened
which is
which is
[ah]
okay ya ya ya
holy shit okay and then
holy crap
okay okay
but how does that affect you flying
okay
which is
okay
[ah]
okay
[ah]
(mm)
ya
ya
okay
okay so is that something permanent
okay
holy c~ okay
ya
ya
[oh]
[a'ah]
okay
this year you how old
so have you have you started flying yet
you you you did tell me but you never elaborated on that
okay
(mm)
okay
this was when [ah]
how you afford all these things man operation [lah] go U_S [lah]
you loan [ah]
okay
okay
okay
so are you still in that
are you still in debt
in debt
ya
okay
!oi! okay
so you have to top up three hundred so you may have to eventually rent out one room [ah]
but you're
ya
[ah] who knows maybe one day I rent with you bro who knows
[eh] that's not too far
ya ya ya
I I think I know [ah] it's on the way towards the industrial area right
no [ah]
just a cross [ah] [oh] okay
no you know why because I don't know [lah] it depends on my future [lah] because for now there's a lot of changes [ah] okay okay wait wait
wait wait wait I have no I'm not done about your your story so okay so so after you finish in the U_S so did you manage to fly yes right
#dubai# right #dubai# airline is it
[oh]
so did you really like become a pilot for awhile was it doing okay
experience [ah]
okay
okay
ya
okay so did you manage to get a local
okay
okay does that pay well
okay okay
that means the pay about four thousand like that [lah]
[ah]
then what do you mean drone thing what is this drone thing then
ya it definitely destroyed the plan for a bit [lah] ya
ya bro ya bro it's one of the worst hit industry [lah] the airlines
so what what happens to the metal the parts [ah]
(mm)
graveyard what happens to the metals they don't try to recycle the metal [ah]
what a waste of resources isn't there any technology that can actually made use like melt everything or something
(mm)
!wah! how many airplanes [sia] bro like that
!wah! I never knew this bro if I never spoke to you
so so wait just to recap a bit so you mean the the part where I I spoke was basically just giving you another avenue [lah] like from steward to be flying [lah] okay okay
ya ya ya ya
ya ya now that you tell me everything right everything is (uh) my my memories coming back I remember you did update me about the hernia thing actually ya you said you ya ya you told me you by right supposed to get the job already but then ya
[oh] you went through the three months [ah] [oh] it was supposed to be that stage already [lah] [oh]
!wah! dude that time if you fly [ah] your inter pretty stable and nice [ah] bro four to six K easily [sia]
there will always be a road there will always be a road
just waiting for the right time to strike [ah]
ya ya
!walao! I don't think that's anywhere close [sia]
I know but the feeling that you know remember that when you say you fly that feeling you I you totally not there [sia] on the drone
okay
that's relatable [lah]
[ah] okay okay so it's just a matter of time [lah]
ya man ya man it's like a movie beginning you know like I visit you at the hospital and then this is a story of #mumammad salihin#
ya then eventually when people see the peak [ah] [lah] it's because he cannot become a pilot his obsession [eh] but okay [lah] but you know what what thing I I respect about this right what okay okay you know normally people always say they want something but everybody wants it you know but nobody is willing to put in the effort like crazy because I think what you're doing is really really
ya like for you you are like [oh] crap I cannot do this nevermind I find another way you know I find another way cannot I find another eventually asylum [lah] so ya but but but no [lah] I I wish you all the best [ah] brother I'm I I'm sure I'm sure eventually you gonna get it [lah] it's just a matter of whether you become a commercial pilot or you know it's just a matter of which field [oh]
(mm)
ya ya and they're not they're not containing it well right until now
you mean trump
you know you know one the the only silver lining I see right about him being in power it's the war in middle east is not intensified like he didn't press on it too much because before him [ah] ya like before him right you see bush !wah! everything he attack clinton no time also they have a bit here and there obama got nobel peace prize but he also did a lot of damaged in middle east you know but trump like when you hear about him [ah] the U_S like almost not involved in the middle east man
he's a selfish businessman [lah]
ya
ya ya
but but that's the thing though his his narrative always make people become violent for example ya ya ya
ya that's true in fact there's more racial attacks ever since he became president according to statistics [ah] in the U_S ya in the U_S
he's he says without filter
unwise
no [lah] bro
I don't know to be honest if you really look back [eh] okay obama is a cool president I mean in terms of it's swag his charisma I'll give him that [lah] but but what do you mean substance I've watch his speech he just basically speak things that are vague like all presidents do his I mean presidents they don't really they don't really talk about policies you just say things like we will do this way we will and now I know in the united states you know I mean dude he has charisma but substance wise is definitely better than trump but but
I mean like every president at the end of the day they're just a figurehead [mah] like democrat or republican they're controlled by those who pump in money to campaign them which is that eventually the banks [what] the corporate world you know it's the it's the ones that are really ruling everything is the one who do the lobbying
you know which is the the rich people [lah] the the the government doesn't matter whether you're a president from their own credit or republicans it as~ because why they work in the congress level the senate level like even if let's say the the president's a democrat if he cannot get a bill passed the republicans the the the bill cannot go through you know so so eventually nah honestly okay this is my take people might think democracy right is actually the best system you know what's my take my take it doesn't matter whether you're monarchy you're communist your dictator your democrat or whatever as long as your leader is corrupted net no system will work because why bro you wanna talk about monarchy at one point of time we have empires that are great bro that the kings and like cleopatra and there's julius caesar I mean they're great huge empires
you want to talk about dictatorship that kind of concept we have #genghis khan# you know of course they were violent people you know but they were strong as as as as a nation amongst them [lah] you know and then you have communism you wanna see communism is bad china is the strongest country right now you know I mean the only plus point that I see when it comes to a democracy is that (um) people just have space to voice out things
and she's damn humble bro damn humble you you see and the vibe is I mean we don't know them in person [lah] how political game works you know they say politics is a dirty game you know no doubt I don't know how she managed to pull it through but she definitely does not give off a vibe like she's means bad things for people
dude I planning to do that but the thing is not now [lah] because if I go there I will die of boredom [sia]
don't have don't have but I'm half new zealander so I'm trying to I'm trying to get my my father there or something [lah] but I'm not in touch with him that much [lah]
ya but I I only met him like once you know so I never really I don't know how to get this through but retirement only when I'm old [lah] I only plan to go there when I'm old
ya like maybe when I'm above fifty right or fifty five where I just do not want the concrete jungle anymore when I just what nature grasslands or fountains [ah] then maybe I'll migrate but for now bro I cannot handle the boredom [lah] there's nothing to do [sia] there
like what bro like what imagine you have to drive one hour before you go to a place that has any form of entertainment which is closing at five P_M you tell me what you wanna do
ya you you when you get that kind of money you let me know [lah] okay
you know or not so we it's not I mean it's doable I'm not saying it's not doable but if you ask me to do now how [sia]
a plan [ah]
you know so and and lately I've been going into a lot of the I'm going back into the financial wisdom I'm learning a lot of the all the money matters things so
the current business [lah] [oh] I I with edudebt you can google edudebt so edudebt is basically a com~ is a debt solution centre we do not we do not administer loan we do not touch your like your money to your loans or whatever no [lah] basically okay whenever client come to us we will present to them the all the possible means for them to clear the deaths in singapore available in singapore okay right so for example okay [lah] I will just give you a brief verbal presentation [ah] people we will educate them on bankruptcy okay okay like for example [oh] bankrupt people so scared but when you ask them why [oh] why okay like example you suddenly you why you why you scared to be a bankrupt
[ah]
but when you bankrupt you don't really have to pay much [mah]
like what
okay assume you're somebody with a home already
even if you use bank loan to buy H_D_B under H_D_B they have a different law to protect your house for bankruptcy
they will just cut your utility [lor]
ya
so if you times that by five years sixty months he ends up only paying like less than twenty K for his debt of hundred over thousand alright so within that five years yes you five years plus another five years cooling period you are not allowed to take loans and credit card but okay [lah] you already in debt what for you want to take more credit card and that exactly so for people like say the ideal bankruptcy right is you already got a house renovation all done everything all done you know
do not be surprised
bro what if the okay okay okay these are these are that these are bad people [lah] okay you know why they use they they they manipulate the system which is not good it's like what you know it's like a legal loophole it's not a it's not a crime but if they play it right it's like a loophole [lah] which is why the the the whole stigma if you go to website right they will try to get you like okay bankruptcy is terrible
okay I give you I give you a scenario I give you a scenario okay let's say you have a company for a few years the company does very well and then you apply company loan so it's under the company right the loan you are you are the guarantor [lah] okay so now because of the good track record the better track record you have the the more loan the bank will have you because you're low risk [mah] you're good you're good pay master credit take over okay let's say you get a two hundred thousand dollar loan [lah] okay and then we get two hundred thousand probably you buy like other assets [lah] you know you buy Rolex [lah] you buy a car but when you buy you don't buy under your name
you buy under your wife you buy under your mum for example you you register their name when you purchase right okay so imagine now now the money that you have been using is disbursed everywhere anywhere except under your name and then you apply bankruptcy the assets are still there [mah]
they can trace but it's not a crime
ya
ya bankruptcy they will pull your assets registered to your name which is why which is why they they there are people who are cunning out there you know so of course we cannot condone these actions [lah] your your you know banks they might be banks they might be rich but this is ethically wrong [lah] but there are people who does that bro
so they like for example [ah] they get like two hundred thousand they put some amount in the alike something that they can sell back for a good price probably invest in gold under your wife that kind of thing you know then when that they apply for bankruptcy they end up not paying two hundred thousand they pay less
you just have to pay the monthly that the one that the government (uh) supreme court order you to pay [lah] like three hundred a month five hundred a month bank about five years to nine years five to nine years only bankruptcy after that the five year cooling period
that means you cannot take loan your your credit rating is under nega~ under the the negative zone [lah] that means you cannot okay you see if you are a good pay master you get double A rating that means it's easy for you to get any loan it's easy for you because you've been a good pay master if let's say you skip once a while you get double B so there's a whole rating system the moment you hit H_Z or bankruptcy right
they have to stay in singapore [ah]
cannot [ah]
their their their passport is blocked [what] they cannot
ya so but you can travel if you pay your monthly and you submit your form to your O_A
but you have to do it ahead [lah] you cannot like ad hoc suddenly you wanna go [lah] you know
ya
and then the third thing they said cannot get a job cannot get job subjective mo~ most probably government will not hire you M_O_F (uh) M_O_E S_A_F they cannot [lah] they will not hire you and probably if you a~ a~ apply for executive job okay [lah] they also don't wanna hire you
because they you remember when you apply job they will have to tick yes or no bankruptcy [ah] so for executive level okay for example let's say they want to hire you as a general manager you can't even manage your own finance you wanna manage company so the H_R will do their check but if you let's say you want to work pest control you want to do Grab Panda or you know you wanna you wanna you wanna (uh) work in production houses if the company feel like [eh] there's nothing wrong with hiring a bankruptcy then they can hire you [lor] private entity [what]
[ah] so at the end of the day now you understand bankruptcy better
limited limited ya because some company they are very particular for example right a financial adviser once applied for bankruptcy he lost his job because he's a financial adviser he cannot be bankrupt
[ah] like this kind of job [ah] the one that is got profile [one] [ah] they normally will not hire you [one]
ya ya so now now okay people don't understand but these are the things that normally we try not to tell people because we don't want them to manipulate the system [lah] ya and then second then the second the second mode of payment how to clear your debt is you pay the minimum sum
ya interests [ah]
ya [lah] for example okay I give you a scenario [ah] let's say you owe ten thousand [lah] the rule of banks is normally three per cent minimum you have to pay so in the case of ten thousand you pay three hundred [lah]
so now balance supposed to be nine thousand seven right but don't forget credit card or bank loan standard is about twenty four per cent parallel which is two per cent per month [lah] okay
exactly which every year about sixty to seventy thousand singaporeans fall under this trap they call it the financial (uh) the debt trap [ah] okay so the second way is to pay a minimum [eh]
#mariam#
ya
cause I want to make
I want to make brownies but I don't know how
