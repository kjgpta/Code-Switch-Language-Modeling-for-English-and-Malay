okay

this is less still shady [ah]
I don't know who
thing is
what
whether
damn
ya
ya
ya
basically like he was caught in the crossfire [lah]
once in the
[ah]
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
you tell
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
last month last month not a lot [lah] close to one thousand
yup that's it [ah]
at least that's the only thing I know of [ah]
(uh) his credit rating is bad
I think he needed money A_S_A_P [ah]
ya
[oh] that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
don't do this [ah]
it's not what but
you
you didn't really
you know right not the end of this month next month [lah] cause our initial agreement was six months [what]
(uh) next year
friend [ah]
no one listens to me [kan]
the voice of reason
ya
now I have problem
I have solution that fixes the problem now but later got problem I don't care [ah] that kind of thing [ah]
ya
I have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems
doesn't matter as long as it as it fixes my problem now
ya
actually by end of this month
but
like I did tell
ya just say just say
ya
but
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed [ah]
rightfully so [ah] to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
you have a place to go but you rather not [ah]
that kind of situation [ah]
ya bas~ basically [lah] same thing [ah]
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it [ah]
but
now seeing this
you know
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend [ah] rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
I have
I have
C_C_A [eh]
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know [oh] but
you know people are driven by greed [what] some people do not know how to control their greed
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you [what]
(um)
ya he left
(uh) some cash cause I don't know [ah] he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
alright
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap [ah]
okay
so
(mm)
sort of
#fahim# no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know [lah] whether
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl [lah]
I mean technically there is a plague going on [ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(hmm)
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably [lah] [eh]
(mm)
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does [tau] maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
[ah]
ya ya like it it's inside [lah] and so it's called what you said is right correct [pe]
ya
why you were there [lah] at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
be a part of it [lah] cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend [ah]
(um)
in a moral dilemma every time
that
you know I don't feel good that she's there
it doesn't feel right [what]
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that [oh] I'm approving this [ah] it feels wrong [ah]
so it puts us in a tough spot [ah]
back then [ah]
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical #farid# [lah]
like shadow boy shadow boy
I think eight years
[oh]
okay
(mm)
what the
okay
(hmm)
#loco# [ah]
I wouldn't
know [what]
she's gonna be there
it came to a point where if #riz# there she's there
so we knew what to expect [ah]
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
(um) from what I see [eh]
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs [ah] maybe she fulfils both not sure
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here [ah] [ah] the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him [ah]
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks [ah]
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all [lah] definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
not saying that it's super common [lah] no [lah] just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
[ah] recklessness (um)
probably lack of ambition
[ah] ya privilege [ah] ya [lah]
usually
usually [lah] generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things [ah]
generally speaking [ah]
so based and on that
(um)
scenario like you always quite common [ah] for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible [lah] I'm not saying that
bad point would be
or fittest [lah] even
not not even the fittest man alive [ah]
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
[oh] did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already [lah]
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist [ah]
it's nonsense
ya
[sial] [lah] brunei
ya
(mm)
[oh] is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
ya ya ya
okay let's just call them government [eh]
if the government invest in their infrastru~ infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism [ah]
for investment
attack tourism [ah]
yup that that's the thing
country
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia [lah] but still quite bad [lah]
if you look at the [ah] if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free [lah] it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or P_R I think
[ah] then uni isn't free
ya it should be [lah] or very heavily subsidise [ah]
but it's not okay [ah] let's talk about
[oh] so just now you wanted
to ask about
[oh] #khai# right
ya
anything [lah]
ya
[oh]
more
when it comes to that and
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her [lah]
too trivial [lah] to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
you know how we talk [kan]
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
something like that [lah]
[oh] mistress
well he consented to it [lah] so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know [ah]
then she slimmer
ya
if you want to do this
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out #wai# was the one who needed help
so ya
I mean that's why he deal [lah] him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant [lah] rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married [lah] if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her [lah] personally
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
ya probably yup
[oh] six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
fifty percent is fine [what] it's both of your kid anyway
ya
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it [lah]
the rest I have to iron
yes exactly
[oh] okay [ah]
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
#safwan# told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
his name is #saifuddin#
then #zafran# I think #zafran# has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her [lah]
so I don't know
[oh] when life is good
[eh]
I'm on a
the frequency of how how I eat
let's say if you only want to eat twice you can eat once a day but then that's quite difficult [ah]
!huh!
I ate at four
so eat something light at night ya
it's
sixty one
ya
when we started going to the gym
[ah] still very very slightly above average very slightly
and based on B_M_I [ah]
healthy [ah] range
but [ah] same [lah]
a
ya louder that [ah]
true

I think
(err) more variety
really
[oh]
[orh]
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
the best [ah]
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
I
ya [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(uh) short casting the (err) portfolio [ah] so I don't see any harm in it I mean whatever we get from it right screw it anyway because we are going to have a (uh) the weekend is pretty much free anyway just clear up a weekend and then just
ya so but at least we find out what in the universe is wrong and for this one right (err) maybe the ones who organise this upcoming D to D league [kan] they obviously didn't foresee that you know they they they banking too much on the people's (err)
because why would you play so many games just to get like a hundred bucks when you can play weekend league and then earn like [ah] you're in game players you don't get anything out of the hundred dollars [what]
it's a really long tournament for really very poor pay off [eh] if he eats half of it no
I I mean if we pitched it right no no tournament sponsor or whatever right it's going to say okay you can take half of it
ya because most of the it is is a is a norm right like seventy percent or whatever goes to goes back to the players
pay for our refreshments or whatever ya
people people will be and and then and then we get pitch it like like
and I mean ho~ honestly if you want to be completely benevolent and make it selling point [lah] hundred percent of the thing so I honestly think yes we don't make money but if if it won't suck too badly if we didn't take anything out of it to be perfectly honest
ya but but the most important thing is then we get the numbers then we can go and pitch with numbers
and if you can sell it to many people to go and watch it right then those numbers should convert into dollars and cents later on in our other planning for the bigger things [lah]
ya so might as well try and organize one soon
(mm)
(mm)
stepping stone or showcase [ah] we gotta we gotta think of it that way (uh) because if you don't put anything out then we won't get anything back in
correct [lah]
okay [lah] then I think maybe we can we can work it [ah] then after that the number of players right we just need to use the standardized [ah] the thirty two sixty four will be nice
then break it down cause it makes it it is a direct number right because it's like thirty two sixty four hundred and twenty eight right
ya but I don't know if we're gonna be able to get a hundred and twenty eight people
(um) next to every single cent back into the thing if we making a hundred and twenty eight with a total of a thousand dollars worth of prize money right
as easy we can we can make some there also honestly little bit [lah] not not not a lot [lah] but we can make a little bit for ourselves also [lah] so with a thousand dollars is a is a nice number [ah] if you can see a thousand dollar price part
cause everyone loves a a thousand dollars it sounds like a nice four figures [ah] like sounds big enough for one day event but then it's only con~ contingent if we can get a hundred people [lah]
[a'ah]
okay so
(mm)
ultimately you know put in to get out [lah] (err) in my opinion it's like I I I don't see any other way
because we cannot straightaway get (uh) sponsors to do anything
(mm)
(uh) show some sort of (uh) viewership numbers then after that maybe (err) people will start to see and then will like okay we will chip in with some of some part of the
the prize pool [lah] like little bit here little bit there then hopefully we can get some people to help us [lah] but that's why I say [lah] like if you don't if you don't kick off with something we will never start
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm) more
(mm)
okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) you once you get the the quarter final [kan] then you get something back [ah]
okay can
top four ya [lah] ya [lah]
also it increases the amount [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mmhmm)
twenty
yup
(mm)
the amounts that we need to be at [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[a'ah]
[ah] so this one is a bit more [lah] so the numbers may be smaller but I think they'll be more invested in trying to actually play in the damn game [lah]
ya
I don't know I think I think we can start with thirty two I think it's a good it's a good idea
and like breaking it down
then we we if we work on the premise of thirty two open then obviously we have (uh) a number that we can
but the the numbers then become bigger because the end prizes become bigger we we need to gauge I think initially the first (err) the first round [lah] is to is to gauge interest and to see how many people we can drag in on by sheer force of personality heater
(mm) that's that's the one thing I think
to others
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
that SCOGA event [eh]
(mm)
so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I I get
sometimes it
I I it not keeping keeping the idea is one thing [lah] like is there a way that we can some sort of legal binding thing where this idea is our idea like we can't copyright an idea either [what] to be perfectly honest
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya that's the thing [lah]
ya
that's the that's the thing [lah] that's why like right now my my confusion is every time I I kind of mood ideas to people then after that people will be like okay who else do you are you gonna get or who else can you get
ya
it's it's a that's the thing
(mm) (mm)
that's the thing [ah]
ya [lah] that's the best part [lah] (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] that's true [lah] I mean my my initial idea is that if I come in later on with the thing right then after that it makes a lot more sense I won't mind like topping up and getting making it bigger
ya
ya true
and
ya [lah] I I get that but my like I think ultimately right I still don't want to be the first name in there
(mm) (mm)
J_F_S
football school
no problem no problem
[a'ah]
monitoring board [ah]
(mm) (mm)
ya
like I mean okay we keep that we keep that as a as a possibility most definitely
you have to do it I guess ultimately it must be done [lah]
okay so this is the thing we need to go and extrapolate the viewership from a previous
V_P_G
nine hundred and ninety ever
how much is that words to people I don't know
(uh huh)
(mm)
one point two
one point two K
that's not bad

ya
[a'ah] [seh]
[ah] yes the wrestling
[ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and and we can get and we can get #sekaiichi# to come and help us out
that's not the easiest thing in the world [lah] to be honest
(mm)
you can try I can try and pull whoever I can possibly pull also [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) that's good
I I think in my lesson our burden in things that I think we can
honestly spend less time on cause our value comes elsewhere
the best use of whatever is my ability you know (err) our ability as well cause like
I I can't even get a headway into anything right now I feel so defeated
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
understandable [lah]
that's why the the the logical play in my head right is SCOGA cause SCOGA's only aim
is this
okay

ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
alcohol
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
segregate your assets [lah] so I think one good (err) platform to that we can use is

so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
(uh) forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside [lah] of of using
#wahed# invest
(um)
how to say [eh]
what (err) things you have to face [lah] if you want to go through the halal way
ya so you have to put up [lah] with this all these service charge [lah] when these banks
new way

[ah] correct
[a'ah] deep

and then (um)
because #johor# has (err) strike up the numbers has strike up so and it's a red zone
so I don't know whether because (err) the last that I heard was that the our government will allow
both boarders to be opened only if #johor# (um) numbers demote back [ah] but I think after a week it does in its red zone
(mm)
ya I still have my dirt bike to go [oh] my god

I always buy the standard shake with nata de coco fifty percent I now member [mah] so like I can the nudge you know so like when you collect the you buy the drink [ah] you collect the point then you can like off set when the next time you buy then you know last time during circuit breaker cause last time mister coconut and bubble tea all close right then you got see or not the trend they got buy the handmade LiHO then they make it at home you got see

I got try [eh] Playmade but I don't really like Playmade [eh] to be honest cause [ah] their pearl is a different [ah] it's not tapioca pearl it's not like the normal pearl it's a different kind of pearl [lah] then I don't really like the taste [ah] then the I know everybody like Playmade [ah] but like I find their pearl a bit a bit a bit questionable not to my taste bud [ah] probably probably you can try then you see then you tell me [lor]
I
no [eh] I never but like cause last time my sister same poly as you [ah] she also say she always buy like McDonald's only like subway I got try your school subway that [one] once only but then I also know your school McDonald's is cheaper then outside McDonald's right
I saw their McDonald's cone is seventy cent
actually (uh) I never really properly by iris only follow my friend maybe I should try one day then you [leh]
I think standard [ah] I think all poly also got subway and cheers also if I'm not wrong you school got cheers
I also know your school quite big then how [ah] if you late to school or like you #swee# #swee# you just [ah] you know five minute before school you reach then how [ah] you confirm late or not
actually not really [ah] honestly if I late to school then my my my my class at the end of the school [ah] only take me about ten~ five five minute to reach there so I can like speed walk then I can just reach earlier but it's quite quite space [ah] got a lot of big spaces [lor] but better [ah] than it being cramp I guess so like not too bad [ah] but still small [ah] but like spcious also to say the least if I'm not wrong also my school the smallest poly right
no [ah] #nanyang# #nanyang# bigger then then then then my school
honestly right (um) my first few days of school [ah] my first few weeks I cannot make it but then but then like afterwards like okay already [lor] (uh) but then like (uh) how to say [ah] your my school (um) some food court they two different lifts must take right specifically that [one] I a bit confusing [ah] and then the one behind my school is just the sports C_C_A centre so that [one] only if you got like C_C_A if you got like P_E like that [ah] like S_N_W then you go there [lor]
(hmm)
(um) honestly cause of COVID right people will kick you out even if we are students right they don't allow us to like stay there so they like they say got one time the I saw the security uncle tell the person you you over here what you want do you got school or not then the person then the student the student was like no I want study then you should study at home [ah] the uncle was damn rude [eh] then cause the person was taking quite some time to pack right then he was like what you waiting for christmas is it !wah! like this security uncle cannot say nicely [meh] COVID already then like be understanding [ah] we understand you got superiority but like
(hmm) cannot [ah] I think they will be stopped at the entrance I think like cause they wear uniform already [mah] then I don't think so they can go in so like I don't know I don't even think so they can cause nowadays when I go back to school some times I don't see them like coming over also then like I think it's (um) a a rule for them to go back home afterwards I don't know but either way also the place is crowded [lor] cause got student want to use the wi-fi for H_B_L [mah] ya
ya but like our table not so far apart (um) like they put us five people per table but like how to say [ah] (um) they so one metre one metre also the table but then now five people per table without the one metre ruling [mah] that [one] a bit [ah] cause my teacher sometime don't know if it's true or not so they ya but then also cause of the five people per table one metre away right my teacher also a bit more careful I guess but like [ah] don't know [ah] it's just a bit [lor]
(um) sometimes it cannot be helped [ah] because like M_R_T is M_R_T [mah] then everybody need to use it need to take it for for to travel to paxes cannot expect them take Gojek and all the transport [mah] so like (um) sometimes cannot take it [ah] cannot be helped so like M_R_T public transport cannot be helped [ah]
a bit scared [ah] but like I said cannot help it like I a bit scared cause I live with my grandmother so it's (uh) the thing is more contagious to them you know more higher risk for them so sometimes I a bit scared [leh] but most of the time so you just go home you straight away bathe [lor] don't interact with other people I think that's the best ting to do [lor]
see uni cannot go out she every time got chance she go out you know how old people are you know how they are they cannot sit still [one] the always want go out like that then like most of time we tell her cannot [ah] cause a bit far the places she want to go like her sister's house at #bedok# [eh] a bit far then her sister also want bring her go mall and stuff but then my grandmother also a bit [ah] cause she you know got the safe entry all right then she like she like a bit lazy she don't know how to do the safe entry [mah] she find it very
ya [lah] typical she doesn't like to take bawa~ unless like she late [lor] then she take Gojek [lor] or she take grab
no [ah] it's actually me I help her book then she just pay [lor]
nowadays got not much work from home [ah] but then rest of my family members all work like my sister now she in camp [ah] then the rest all is (um) cannot work from home [ah] so my mother my parents they go to work physically to you know earn the bucks
(uh) I actually don't mind [ah] cause she make food [mah] so I just eat whatever she cook [lor]
ya cause fast game [ah] just touch and go so I just go there then come back then like that [lor]
if I go school right I just buy something for breakfast then I go home to eat my grandmother lunch I don't like you know (uh) eat outside so that's the good thing [ah] I I get to save money like that
!wah! then especially are especially [hor] they tax you see what they could !wah! kung fu aunties anticipate at their excited one ya [ah] anyways [ah] I think it's time to let go I think we I think we are done catching up I think
nevermind give this person some time [ah] cause COVID [mah] then the business never go up at least at least give them some some some money you know
ya serious [ah] whatever [lah] okay [lah]
[oh] world of married
what is it about
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
[oh]
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like #Syamsul Yusof# right
I feel very sad for him [seh] cause like he's like my favourite
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life [seh]
(hmm)
but I don't know [eh] cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then (um)
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
(uh) children I think one of it
(uh) is a guy one is a girl
then (um) I know #Puteri# (uh) which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
(uh) divorce right
it really shows that
maybe #Syamsul# did something [ah] but I don't know [seh]
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like (um)
marriage and everything
and then actually (uh) on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick [eh] but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
!wah! if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
[seh] like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than (um)
like #Syamsul Yusof# all right
I also remember got this
I think
you know #Alif Aziz#
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like #Alif# is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
of loving someone who is
toxic
why but then bella was saying like [oh]
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
I feel I don't feel (um)
(um) scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
(mm)
but I think it's also because (um) he
I mean the other girls were like not even
(um) saying sorry or anything
[oh] your hair
(um) I don't know [seh] I think you should just
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya so you should just go for it [ah]
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
[ah]
from ten to to ele~ [eh]
ya
but I have a lot to do so
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
(uh) okay [lah] but like I feel like S_P food is nicer
[ah] which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
foodpanda or what [ah]
ya
[oh] my dance classes [eh]
(um)
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
(mmhmm)
then isn't it better
[oh] ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay [lah]
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
maybe but like I feel that everyone
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they #chiong# last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I #chiong# last minute but they all very studious like
three
or week four
I don't know [seh]
but ya and then
[oh] did I tell you I met
(uh) our soccer friends
[ah] our captain remember
ya
ya the same place as me [ah]
[ah] my our campus is
[ah] Dover
ya
ya [oh] my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
is like a
a website [ah] where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review [ah]
ya and I thought of buying it [ah] cause like
I feel like
(mmhmm)
why fifty dollar quite a lot [what]
[oh]
but I think in your con~
because you only receive like nine hundred [ah] spending money how to save
ya
[eh] I feel that the money that you have
spend for the month
but like maybe okay [lah] not that
direct nine hundred [ah] but like
those kind of thing
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
(mm) I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
[orh] for #Anas# [eh]
ya I mean I feel for #Anas# right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple X_L [eh]
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
because
ya you can buy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even #Dakshah# had to ask him out
(mm)
ya that's true
depends [ah]
(uh) a bit of physics but other than that no
[oh] did mama tell you that
[oh]
(mm)
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also [lah] I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
(um)
doesn't work that way you know
[oh] he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
[oh] he did !huh! what did he do
[oh]
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
[orh] but how much were you paid per month
!huh! fifty [jer]
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
[oh] my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya [lah] you can say like [oh] you want to help the child everything but !wow!
that progress and also the time spent right
but P_S_L_E really marks where you can go
the place where you
make it or break it [seh]
ya I mean
#minahish# and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
it's really scary
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
(um) the
scary [ah] that how young and how brave are you to do that
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it [seh] like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever [seh]
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then they just (um) try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
secondary school
[oh] but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
[oh]
[oh] my gosh okay
[ah] why he like that [seh]
you reminded me of our netball coach
how old was she [ah] when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
!wah! early twenties then she act until like that
[oh]
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
[oh] when was I there
[oh]
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with [seh]
(mm)
[oh] my god ya it was during like the
(um)
exam [kan]
I mean how we've been overworked
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
[oh] I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her [oh] my god
(err)
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma [lah] to be honest
(mm)
so supportive and stuff
ya
I
I don't know if you know this Instagram [ah] it's called Sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
ya
ya
wilt wilted [eh]
wilting [eh]
ya
and
ya but the anti is spelled as A N T E A
ya
but it's not I don't think it's halal [lah] but then
they brew their coffee [eh] no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
[a'ah] Singapore
!huh! why you ask me that
[oh] (um)
!haiya! for me
(hmm) let me think
actually
I know that
like if especially if my husband wants a child
ya
I mean like you can always say [oh] I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
that's why
[ah]
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head [ah]
[ah]
ya
I I don't know [ah]
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
you love cats
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
(mm)
that's why
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment

spending [sia]
big land to
to play around to to run around
[ah]
and the road was empty the whole street was lonely
[ah]
till it go into phase one
and then yes
(um) lively [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
but ya
but I think during cir~ (err)
!wow!
(err)
[ah]
ya
ya
I think it's okay if we are younger
but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have (um)
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then (um)
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown [ah] and then ya
perspective you can be
right I mean
but we we are alright with that we~ we've we've
we've done that with our music life we've we've we used to be isolations
ya
ac~ the effects are there [lah] you know
(err) I don't think
[kan]
more of (err) like going through a war
not not like before this you know
constantly (err) doing things
be it (err)
(err)
you know all being (um)
stopped I would say that
ya
or or or the environment
of going through [eh] (err) things (um)
[ah] the things that we do
is (err) not doing very well right
they had an industry and the thing is
and kind of stopped or or or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
(ugh)
ya ya ya all the big (err) bars club
(um)
chill a little bit and them (um)
see what's going on and then from there
(err)
come to a point whether
and what not
time (um) everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
(uh) for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not (um)
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if if you look like really really close
(um)
it was haywire napster coming in you know
[ah] it was for for for consumer they will like it [ah]
but people who produce it people who
who you know
(mm) you know big (err) movie affected by
whack or or or
or just like (um) be part of
this you know like just come in and slide in
ya I mean
there will be light there will be light
(um)
apart from that probably (um)
share it because ya
ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
[ah] ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
okay [ah] I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use [ah]
like you can't really copyright that shit
[eh] fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if if you are not monetised right so you know
(err) ya I think that's different
(mm) fair
(oo) ya okay I get it I get it
is it not bad [sia]
I mean I mean at that price range quite affordable already [sia] considering like
okay [lah] okay you you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
[ah] (uh huh)
(err) it's like P_S five in india
somebody copy [eh] copyrighted [ah] ya copyrighted [ah]
somebody copyrighted P_S five so
P_S five they Sony can't release P_S five as P_S five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
th~ I mean there there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony Sony will try to
probably [ah] I think
probably will try to buy it off the person [ah]
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
P_S one two three four
[ah] ya and it's Sony so like you know he's you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
[oh] P_S four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya [lah] you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create [ah] create [ah] you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay [ah] it was rocky [ah]
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better [ah]
I mean it's just a brand name only [ah] at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like (oo) look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive [ah] but then it's like
[eh] [ah] no I'm not about that life man
man
no [ah] not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya [lah] I mean it is a gaming peripheral [ah] but still like
at least limit it [ah] like at at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like [oh] Razer
and then it i~ you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that [one] by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
[eh] that kind
[ah]
with my current night shift
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this [one] is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like [oh] my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay [lah] like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the [one] that you are looking at this the second [one]
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit [lah] like
whoever [ah] whoever say something right then (err) or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job [ah] and then like cannot [ah]
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring [siol]
ya but then
true
but okay this this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya [lah] no [lah] leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
(uh) I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can [ah] but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay [ah] depends on the company [lah] but this is this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense [ah] but
the travel expense though it's free
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right [ah] I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance [ah] you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything [ah]
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can [ah]
let anyone use the thing
[sial] [ah] I have I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me [ah]
no [lah] it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like [eh] there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like (err) if you exit
the quantity that the the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
(uh) all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras [ah]
like I'm just saying there's
there's (uh)
hidden thing to it [lah] like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply [ah]
no [ah]
like where the hell am I supposed to go [sia] if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can [ah] can is can [ah] like the
I mean the
no [ah]
anytime ya
and then there's no there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the off~ no you eat there in the !oops! room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
(uh) I mean it's true [ah] I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that [one] then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously obviously you eat after and before [lah] but
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this [ah] job
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like [sial] [ah] where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town in town
(uh) ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is [ah] but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days als~ a few days ago also
[ah] zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
because they they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya [lah]
[eh] no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
S_H_N is
fourteen days [siol] I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
okay [ah] not really okay [ah]
it's not it's not a fine it's more of
something like that [lah] like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what (uh)
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
(uh) I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay [ah]
[eh] but then new zealand that time got (uh) recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive [ah]
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah blah blah all that nonsense then you see [lah] what happened now
three hundred thousand already
(uh huh)
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three thou~ three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see [eh] go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
[ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like [sial] [ah]
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit [sia] like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
(oo)
you you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest [what] so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya [lah] I mean late payments but like if you're if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only [ah] I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything [ah]
ya
okay
really
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
ya #borat# is #borat# [lah] so
I wonder if they edited that out
(uh huh)
I mean to be f~ okay [ah] no [ah]
no no then it's it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is [ah] but you know it's fucking video proof [ah] like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
(uh) they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know [lah] which state [ah] one of the judge [lah] they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is [ah]
[ah]
no comments no comments
in othe~
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for #taiwan# soon
I think world war three should start soon
(err) china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to #taiwan# right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit #taiwan# [ah]
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
[eh] ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
#taiwan# is part of china and then
I mean ya [lah] like
and they could have just let #taiwan#
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of #taiwan# like no
I think they call them (uh) D D C P right [eh] no D C C
[oh] !wow!
I mean #taiwan# is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay I mean
okay let's be let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay [lah]
that [one] no comments [ah] ya
it has it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
legit [ah]
[oh] !wow!
(uh huh)
!ee! [ah] ya
that's malaysia
that's the issue I mean
ya
you all busy fighting each other also [lah]
[kan]
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
[oh] speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay [ah] it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
[kan] I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
[ah]
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that [lah] but okay [ah] there are the backwater parts [ah]
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
[sial] [ah]
(uh huh)
it's basic human nature [lah] what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you mind you [eh]
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya [lah]
okay
(uh huh)
okay
!wow!
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions [ah]
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is it is what it is [ah] it's his style
either way it [eh] no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe [eh]
we might as well be
#kim jong un#
[oh] my god I don't know [ah] [sia]
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
and that that is trump in a nutshell [lah] [eh]
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what what what business are you in your what are you doing [oh] I do (uh) money money money lagging
[oh] !wow!
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care [ah]
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the C_B period
that [one] terrible [siol] like
only essential workers [what]
me [ah]
then like yours truly [ah]
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
they got
it's not even that much [sia]
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like [sial] [ah] they can [sial] [ah] that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the C_B period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during C_B period [sial] [ah] how to earn fifty [sia]
okay [ah] not not everyone can [ah] but that's why that's why during C_B I had the same driver a week straight [sia]
he live somewhere [ah] there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book [eh] same guy tomorrow [eh] same guy
and like okay [ah] ten minutes only [what] not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
like unless on that day I overslept or something
rare [ah] but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no [ah]
it was at #boon lay#
don't know call call message
everything no reply
[siol] then I like what the fuck [sial] wait here half an hour already [siol] then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing [sia] cancel
no [ah]
it's justified
anyways okay you you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already [sia]
[kan]
just cancel get a new [one]
but then the thing is you don't
you you you don't directly
(uh)
okay [lah] ya there's there's the more apt way to say it [lah]
you collect the food already
then you put delivered
like you wait already you wait and wait and wait
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya
or those people in P_M_D I mean the disabled people
(hmm)
[ah]
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift [what]
like rare you find
that that [one] is dorms
[eh] well
service industry [lah] [eh]
the woes of it
you get you get that kind of shit [ah] you get that kind of shit [ah]
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then C_B start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it [ah]
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night [ah]
cause
(mm)
[ah]
okay [lah] I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
there's only one entrance and one exit [lah] so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell [ah] got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell
then the person will come
ha right
then provided you got exact change
I'm helping do your job
but ya I mean that that C_B period [ah]
the the one that people were all in panic
that got one customer order until like fifteen cartons
of mineral water
mind you [eh] not the six hundred M_L no
one point five litre
we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
[ah]
like okay [ah] if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand [ah] but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like [eh] !siala!
this thing [ah] like that like that like that
then like
free masks don't know how many times already they updrage the mask some more
okay I'm recording now

like ask [ah] like the great old city they want people
converse

I will be so early there nothing to do
right that's why I need
the job
sixty dollars no I cannot I I cannot I'm saving that money to book the to activate my account back like for my grab stuff E P
I mean like that is what I have been doing
I mean like it works for a little while I mean like it works like when I had
the K S P money the government money the government grant it work [lah] I keep my
my money all there
is like I don't think I want to show my face [lah] you know the korean pictures like the
should I put my phone here
I mean I don't think I want my legs
like this
I am
okay
I don't I don't want a lot of greens actually
not really like maybe like see the
H_D_B or something like
I don't need to be full [lah]
I just wanna like because I don't have make up
ya but like
you know how the korean pictures look like
like singapore but not singapore you know
you know I know you know
is it okay !duh!
(oh) okay maybe nearer ya
so like black and yellow black and yellow you know little bit fuck
okay
so funny
okay like this it's so hot
okay I should try editing it with light room
[oh] look like
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
(oh)
okay
no no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
but you can learn [ah] it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so H_D I love it [sia] no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much how much filter how much (um) you edit [ah]
the higher your
your saturation (err) contrast and all that right
the worst the H~ the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the qua~ the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less H_D
ya
that's why that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of (um) effect and then like the effect you put how high it is [ah] technically
[kan] and that's what my photographer friend said [ah] and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's ri~ that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
[oh] is my card with you
okay
(mm)
ya same as you right
[oh]
[eh] wai~ but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take M_R_T [what]
like if I end before eleven forty five
(mm)
but will that minus off like my pay
(oh) okay that is nice
(mmhmm)
it just enough time for me to take M_R_T home [lah]
so like can I have to go back to orchard
[oh] [oh] the stop the bus
then I stop at #dhoby ghaut#

[ah]
[oh] my god
[oh] my god [ah]

in some ways tiktok is like the wild wild west
ya

thank you
sexual health
there's like sexual health plastic surgery you know personal finance take stock is a treasure trove if you know how to use it well
okay so the you know the (um) with a song that I showed you just now is it's it's basically (um) it's a K pop song by shinee
(um) ya so (um) so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny (uh) K pop humour the the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
it's I never heard I never heard
[oh] okay okay (uh) maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
I recently learn this term it's called (um) (um)
kissing my teeth but K_M_T if you've seen it on twitter K_M_T stands for kissing my teeth
so like for example (uh)
what what's the [oh] ya ya ya ya I know it's so true [oh] my god
[eh] #nasha#
[ah] I mean like that number [ah] the number the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so (um) like on on on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling F_Y_P and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's that's the tea
I got into
(um) because I saw quite a bit of it on on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily (uh) loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main (um)
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for for instagram it's it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like (err) an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on (uh) any
(uh) any any app any social media app
like like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
[ah] tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your F_Y_P page cause it's well curated [oh] I see it is on your F_Y_P page
what have you been watching
right right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on on on your F_Y_P even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to act~ bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize [eh] you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once (uh) once it realizes that [eh] this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the prior~ priority
correct correct yes yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin> to see you
[oh] !wow!
[oh] [oh] !wow! amazing !wow!

hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
wha~ wha~ what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching #anime#
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know you know anyways but I'm I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got #saiki#
the disastrous life of #saiki#
[oh] that's good
but it's very very promising and I might start on it
okay okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like (um) slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called #saiki# (um)
like exploded
strength [ah] yes yes yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also (uh) teleport (um)
he he can he has pyro~ pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole #anime#
ya it's just him
the whole #anime# revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep (uh) people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole #anime# he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
(um) you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
(um) I don't know it's about twenty three plus
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like !wow!
right right I should have finished like one season
ya ya
[oh] ya ya ya ya
I'm starting there
ya you really have to get into it
[oh]
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a #gundam# series on kids central
[oh]
ya
(mm) (mm)
yes yes
yes
(mmhmm)
ya
okay okay
(mm)
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact #gundam# I all I all I remember is I I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
(hmm)
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into #gundam# and you're like no
#gundam#
[ah] it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now (um)
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet [lah] correct
(um) so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't she wouldn't fit into the jacket
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
[ah] no I think it's still with #aisyah# okay nevermind that's fine
ya so (um)
I I told her like [eh] sorry [ah] I really cannot bring you because N_C sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would (um)
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is N_C sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch (um)
but some countries
she knows but some countries its P_G thirteen I saw [ah] I saw on re~ reddit she's on fucking reddit
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya (um) it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze (um) there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends [lah] or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is (err) E_L_I five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really (um) topics that you don't understand like (uh) explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because (um)
I like to read like I like tea you know to (um)
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really really fun because like you know you get to see like
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their (um) comments is always [oh] this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
correct correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really really bad [lah] I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most R_Ts therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
[oh] ya so back to [ah] so (um) so I asked her like (uh) can you give like (uh)
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere [lah] and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
#izz# can easily catch up [eh]
[ah] okay [lah] not bad [lah]
[oh] yes
not bad
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the N_C sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
[oh] okay okay okay
all right all right okay okay send
[oh] my god okay okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
(um) this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with #sha# it was after A levels
(um) I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about (uh) this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
(um) came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian (um)
colli~ okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this (um) spies
no no it's not jesse mccartney
but
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
!wow! really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was (um) a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and (uh) so he was videotaped right and then the spies exec~ executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like [oh] I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you (um)
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
(uh huh) like nudity or sexual references (uh) ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending [oh] it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
(mm)
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like [oh] okay !wow!
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it [oh] my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
ya !alah!
[ah] right right right
ya
ya ya honestly like I mean it it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
(um) this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya #wey# or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if if it's like this like okay it started out with #haikyu# she was really into #haikyu# her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that (um) but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance (uh) series
when I was younger [lah] when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
[a'ah]
it really impacted the way (um) I saw how relationships or is
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no no no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
ya
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a pre~ a celebrity preacher
wrong wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so (uh) so he's a very popular
preacher on on T_V and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like (uh) thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out (um) it was from this girl
and it turns out to be like a a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial (um) like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like res~ respectful the person like
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like [oh] my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have (uh) this kind of like
(uh) ya ya ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
(uh) fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like (um)
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
yes it is idiot
so okay so #tup# #tup# they ended up getting married
yes
I know I know done with the question about everything so (uh) he was looking for her
[a'ah]
ya ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like (um) like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like [oh] my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay [lah] when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything (um)
but the the ridiculous part was when they got married
[ha] it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean (um) the way that the mother
the mother mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
with (uh) starting #mira filzah# and if you know #adi putra#
so okay okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first #mira filzah# was twenty four seven
ya
and I'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult [lah] logically
yes yes
ya that's why like
it's it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head [ah] [ah]
the instant [ha] instant I'm like okay I get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid (um) commercial shampoo commercial
what wallet
then how
so is like phone casing bag
same [what] this [one] also have [what] but this [one] cheaper
I think so is (um) twenty nine dollars
ya

A I S A R
ya like I never heard that name before so unique ya [lah] ya
what if
[eh] what [ah]
ya means can give full bottle already [lah]
I don't know because because only until six months you can give milk then after six months you can give food already
ya
ya but the thing is that then like this [one] is I don't know
ya how [eh] when to increase milk
too much I don't know
you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce oun~ oun~ is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty M_L per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty M_L ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pedi~ pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can [eh] as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty [ah]
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can [ah]
ya
!huh!

my cousin who went to korea before he said that [ah] it's super duper cold he went there during winter so so it's super duper cold so if you want to go there during winter better get prepared like

happy family you mean yes
[oh] I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of (uh) you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends (um) she suggested me this [one] at at that point of time of the year [ah] the title was boys over flowers
it brings me back so much [lah] like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like [ah]
they I mean they have a lot [lah] but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
[oh] I like
we watch the same thing ya [ah] kitchen nightmares
[oh] those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on M_T_V right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's [ah] go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like !wah! like !wah! you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
(err) how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say [lah]
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like [ah]
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
[oh] ya ya ya
movies
(uh)
[oh] movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one [lah] I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting [what]
[eh] it is so good I wish I wish (uh) I could you know get that that kind of (uh) if it was to exist in singapore [lah] or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you
[oh] no okay okay I know
[oh] okay okay alright alright
yes bec~ that is
how [ah] you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good [what]
!oof! cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had
tinky-winky is the purple one the first one with the red handbag
I think of I don't I don't

[oh] sesame street
[oh]
I get it
[oh] no if me it will be

(uh) [oh] [ah] (err) I think it would be ya like I say it's boys over flowers soundtrack that's [ah] same like you when I got into boys over flowers that's where I get to know K pop that's why I get to know certain groups form because of the O_S_T
ya that's ya I mean like ya
of course of course yes yes
[ah] titanic
(err) it'll be money health and food
I mean [kan] it's important in everyday life [what] you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
ya that's just a wish [lah] but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us [lah] as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all [ah] ya [oh] I have another question for you
[ah]
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
ya for me it will be (err) read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean [ah] you know
[ah] food it's always about food [ah] in the end it's always [ah] it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too [lah] what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
alright so how about [ah]
K got another question for you okay (err)
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya [ah] okay what is the one thing that you wish was free

(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's true
(mm) I get what you mean
what was [ah] the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
(err) [oh] I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found (uh) if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful (uh) peaceful what do you call [ah] called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
[ah] ya yes
hobbies actually !wah! hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me [lah]
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now [lah] I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like [ah] I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
prac~ I mean it depends on the person practising (uh)
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like [ah]
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do do whatever whatever
stuff [lah] ya
of course yes
pop malay they call it ya how about you how about you
[oh]
I go with my sister I go with my sister (uh) to this to this con~ to this concert (um) concert
eye-opening experience for me cause like you experience them singing live some more is like
they are the iconic band that people recognise all over the world like it's not only it's not only the singaporeans were there were a lot of [ah] other people from countries who came to singapore to just watch them westlife
so it's like it was really I remember it was really fun that day and some more it falls on my sister's birthday so ya how about you
I know it's always it always happen ya ya ya
[oh] it really happen in front of your eyes [ah] I know okay
I decided to not recently I think last year I decided to purchase a lot of accessories I'm in I'm I started to get interested in accessories so especially in earrings
you can say like (err) laces you know lace there there is one lace earring where you like
need to sew on it and you know you create and stuff so for me I'm more to like very simple and very casual nothing not so dramatic and all and of stuff ya I'm curious about yours how about you
brown [ah] brown red call it [lah] orange (uh) this kind of colours that I'm more to
love talking about love I suddenly so shy no [lah] kidding love at first sight
(um)
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us [lah] but love at first sight
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like [eh] [oh] my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically (uh) ya very interesting how how what what do you think
[oh] I understand K K
[oh] my god okay
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got [ah] another question for you
(uh) [oh] you talk (err) [oh] okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
yes correct
I would [oh] wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our !alamak! this also very hard [lah] I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting [ah] country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that [ah] from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard [lah] to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of (err)
different type !aiya! basically it's culture [lah] but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
[oh] no (uh huh)
ya ya correct correct ya ya
[oh] no okay
[oh]
ya of course me too I won't I I I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore [lah] like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only [what] what for we will go like [eh] let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya [ah] what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
[oh] of course of course
any sound [eh]
when you see sunflower for me [lah] for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I I ya
yes
if me I know I I I I heard stories that [ah] rose rose is hard
like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you [ah] much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
make us forget about the busy life in this [ah] singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from [ah] from that side that busy [lah] that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these [lah] I also really agree with you on all this cause it's
K
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one [lah]
so I think you can start first [ah]
why batman and iron man s~ specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
[ah] kinaesthetic
kin~ [ah] kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility [ah]
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective [lah]
batman
can help others
but like for me is basically
[oh] so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
(mm) [ah]
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
harry potter there's this
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot [lah] what's the the magic spell
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing (err) port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish (err) irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
r~ robert pattinson
ya that [one]
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers [ah] wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
[ah] if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
K but maybe
[ah] specifically to children [ah] because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard [ah]
like
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
I think also works for [ah]
adults [ah]
(um) but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
ya [lah] but
teleportation [ah]
but it saves time it's very quick
(mm)
ya [ah] but the thing is
you are saving time
teleportation
please [lah] don't cut me off [lah] the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this [lah] but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it [lah] [ah]
ya okay
so that's teleportation
(err)
(um) if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
ya
but money to me do it is not everything [ah]
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
[ah] your energy your smile and your
sorry occupational hazard K [ah] teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son #aydin#
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
!wah! you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
(mm)
(mm)
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited [ah] okay
[orh]
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective [eh]
work hard themselves
okay
(mm)
okay
(err) but I okay [lah] maybe for you [kan]
K
but I [oh] something came across my mind [lah]
ya I know it's just
a superpower
ya
(mm)
showing
the other side of ya
(mm)
okay
that's you were saying superpower
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
(mm)
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome [lah]
yes no the thing because I was thinking
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
[ah]
[ah] the bull's eye of medicine [ah] [ah]
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
but also
subsidised
subsidised
then that [one] you have to talk to the experts [ah]
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
[ah] not everyone
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
okay so
[eh] so that's about superpower [lah]
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me

and then after that they say okay within two weeks [ah] give you we will email you your training dates

rather than swensen
choices ya
[oh]
then got kid's meal meal then there's also the
[oh]
but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then I'm like shit

!wah! means you reach work #swee# #swee# [sia]
I no time to this one know
cannot no time I know [lah] every time go work
from here I know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the M_R_T that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then I usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace [ah] that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
[oh] then you can walk
you quite smart [hor]
I've never thought of that [leh]
!wow!
shit
okay
(err) my day today was okay it was quite a slow day (uh)
because I didn't do much (uh) today
(um) I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work [lah]
I haven't actually applied for anything
(err) I was there was this (err) job link that #adli# sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone the phone Apple
(err)
(err) annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly [lah] but then there was an addendum to the title
that said (uh) it was (uh)
malay language specialist
basically just listen to
and then
transcribe them into
words [ah]
then I think I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
(err) natural language processing
feel
which is more concern with (err) A_I and machine learning
where the
the A_I itself
actually (err) learns language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then (err)
so
so ya [lah] the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
[ah] yes I will be part of that
[a'ah]
soon [lah] in a few days [lah] I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
so like
I got no results
the
(err)
so far no (uh) except for a few that I saw (err)
(err) wherever [lah] I think there's a few locations
no like (err) I I meet the requirements ya
(mm)
okay [lah] the exam was
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and (err) second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy (uh)
the best [eh]
probably second language learning
!huh! why
no (uh) because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory [what] so it's more difficult to screw up
ya ya I just want to pass
(mm) ya
your leave
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
wait pause they made you take
a test
[ah]
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya your boss's boss
ya
(mmhmm)
!huh! how come your computer shut down in the room
[oh] so the
so basically the zoom thing crash [lah] nothing wrong with your computer [lah]
okay okay good
!whoa!
okay (uh)
I sat in the chair
but it's okay [lah] I mean I managed to
(err) get the most out of my studying
no no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was (err)
that [one] maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want [ah]
I mean
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
[ah]
then he suddenly appears
but what
jaden smith
your your crazy midnight shift [eh]
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
so
so basically there was no person in charge [lah] for the thing
!wah! co in charge [lah]
on the ups
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
after six A_M
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] okay okay
ya
(hmm)
so he's new
[ah]
(mm)
[oh]
wait
cannot say cannot say
confidentiality
[eh] to whoever's listening
confidential okay
(mmhmm)
the what thing
[oh] okay
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
(mm) (err) on the days you're schooling
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya
okay N_E_A shift is what time to what time
you
[oh] you cannot request for shift change [eh]
[oh] for your class [eh]
[eh] I think I destroyed your chair
[oh] okay
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
(mm)
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
(mm)
ya
(mm)
I think you felt the same way in that
take a break if that makes sense
(mmhmm)
[oh] shit serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
justin bieber
[oh]
[oh] they are not big fans of justin bieber
(mm)
have different workflows [eh]
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
[oh] ya [lah]
you better do it
ya
serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit (err)
weird
like
there's no
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you (uh)
the previous shift
comp~ complacent [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
I don't know (uh) I think
honestly to me
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send (uh)
in what sense
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
(mm)
wait
okay
(mm)
(mm)
[a'ah]
ya like you
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
[ah]
[ah]
jaded
(mm)
[oh] okay
I was actually going to make a joke
[ah] okay [lah]
(mm)
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
!huh!
ya ya they know we we also know
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
no there's like there's like a
like home wrecker [eh]
no no there's there's
ya there's
no now that one person has more (uh)
voc~ malay vocabulary to transcribe
ya ya
I don't know (uh) but see like the the the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
[kan] it is
I I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine [ah] it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable [lah]
!aiya!
[ah]
[a'ah] [sia]
[ah] ya [lah] of course [lah] it's their job
just anime like
are we allowed to swear no right
okay okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching (um)
(err) Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no no spoiler because
(err)
(err) there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
maybe add three or four months
[ah] ya
in japan
[oh]
but (mm)
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file [ah]
cloud
[oh] ya ya
but wait
there are no more there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one [ah]
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
artefacts
but but then again
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
ei~ either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands (uh) two thousand one to two thousand and four
the actual film
like
(err) like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they they filmed it most of it on film
or like something someone would draw in paint
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the [kan] the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write I write the script
I write the script
then
(err)
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be you be
no you director of photography
basically
!huh!
I mean you have an eye for the frame [what]
and then after that you will get like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things (uh) like
behind ya that kind of shot [ah]
(mm)
A U T E U R [eh]
[a'ah]
#auteur#
ya
but
(err) anything [ah] can also (uh)
just just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think I think can can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
flexible
in what sense
(mm)
okay ya
(mm)
[oh] to get [ah] ya ya I mean I mean
it might
no no
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and (err) location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
but with
a
psychological (uh) age not twist [ah] like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what that's what movies are all about [ah]
that looking into the
(err)
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay [ah] stimulating [ah] but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like (um)
like you know Annihilation
nata~ ya that that that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
telling you to to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and (err)
jurassic park also is another one
no but the the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not it's not nostalgia the thing the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
(err) J_P three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya ya correct but like
it it
through
(err) power
you know and like
a display of real fear
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
(err)
let's see
[ah] the wailing
the wailing
it's like
you are like the the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
ya and then like like
are they are they just what you would like to impose on them
(mm)
I think I think they shou~
go to the house
ya
(mm)
[oh] ya ya [a'ah]
(mm)
I don't know I I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail [ah]
all the gloomy gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
I don't think you were with me
was it was it the
[oh] ya that's okay okay we watched that [one]
we watched that [one] in the cinema (uh)
nevermind [ah]
I think that [one] will I probably will have to watch with #rehan# lights off speakers on
[oh]
(mm)
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just I can just wing it [ah]
[eh] I got A you know don't play play you know
director of photography [ah]
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
[ah]
no you know no
no [lah] we do it we do it properly [lah] but I I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from (err) getting
(uh) machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
[oh] ya
no need [ah] low budget [ah] indie
live what
no [lah] it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no [lah]
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free [lah]
ya no no no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
[oh] ya correct correct
okay [lah] then when we on our off day then we do [ah]
I think can can no worry can be done
[oh] ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive G_P_U
not anytime soon [lah]
like next year
(uh) my G_P_U hot [ah]
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or [what]
[ah] whatever game you can try you try [ah]
(mm) you never try Borderland three
buy [ah]
for the for the release price [lah] the release price is sixty bucks I think
then then this black friday [eh]
what you buy
[oh] ya
[oh] ya later [ah] later
masks
yes
compress
okay [lah]
[oh] okay
!huh!
I want to I want to take one
#nezuko#
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation [ah]
ya [lah] so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the #weeaboos# it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
then I'm like bro you don't know what the #weeaboos# go through
I think
(mm)
ya
ya ya like it takes it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic [ah] in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
[oh] no like like I am no longer special
ya
ya
(mm)
(uh) #haikyu# is not that
(mm)
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
#oregairu#
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
grounded in realism
ya like it was well thought out and well written [ah]
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season [ah]
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
(mm)
how it works is usually
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
ya
so that's basically how it works (uh)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
(hmm)
(mm)

(mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya

[oh] okay
(mm)
[oh] okay
[a'ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] yes yes because they adopted it from the
chinese archipelago
(mm)
[oh] yes yes yes
to speak it better than you're writing
ya
and I think speaking
(mm)
it's the case it's the case for almost everyone
the stages of (err) child language development
ya I learnt that
[ah]
#koreaboo#
but [oh] ya the key caps
!wah!
ya then it was like seventeen like that
[oh] okay
it dropped down some more
ya one O four key
!huh!
(uh) most of them use the same stems anyway [lah]
so
mama
but I think
K_F_C's one is nice but
(err) the popeyes' one has a lot more things in it compared to K_F_C K_F_C is just like mashed potato and the gravy but popeyes is like gravy mashed potato then got like the vegetables and everything
ya
(mm)
[oh] ya you know (err) starbucks right now cause (err) christmas
starbucks right now it's christmas right so

the one that I painted all cannot use because the paint smell very strong then if I tried I tried wearing it but then
like he did like that
ya
ya cannot
ya even after washing cannot wear cause it's very (err) smelly and all
so I've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles [one] but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often
ya like that [lor] don't know how see first
I also don't know we see how we have whole month then we have school we also don't know how then ya
I don't know see how like if I can get into uni then go into uni [lah] if cannot then see how start working first or what

ya
I also don't know see what have [lah] what you cook or what's in the house

I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
ya
ya
no [eh] no preference
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
(um)
bake it
[oh]
the old #chang kee# one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the #ondeh-ondeh# and the red velvet one
ya the #ondeh-ondeh# one
but it's like
the #ondeh-ondeh# one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the #ondeh-ondeh# because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was (uh) on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
ya
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the #briyani# with the potato also can
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the #bhatoora# like in the morning eat very nice [ah] but also like really oily
I think they fr~ like I ya they deep fried or something
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
[ah] got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like [oh] maybe can make hummus then we eat with hu~ we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying [ah] so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first (uh)
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
#kunafe# is which one
(mm) I don't think I tried #kunafe# before but I think I've heard about it before
the bak~ is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first (uh) I think like
[ah] cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
[oh] ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at #joo chiat# right like (err) that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
!huh! #ang mo kio# A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W [oh] no that one is shake shack
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
ya but I think I like it [ah] cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
ya
ya
and (uh)
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know (err) during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for K_F_C you know even their K_F_C right the K_F_C each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
so
ya
ya during december then (err) I also meeting like some of my (err) like
I want (uh) we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how [lah] because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed [ah] because like we all thought like (err) we all planned already and then like that night last minute (uh) that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her [mah] but don't know how [lah] see how
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel [oh] the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at #jurong# point anymore I only eat the
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
you guys can eat #bingsu# or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat [lah] but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things [what]
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it [seh]
if not
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
then
that time also
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people [lah] but you cannot like hund~ (err) four hundred dollars
ya
I think
(err) if not you can go #bugis# like the #bugis# #haji# area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to #bugis# street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's (err) like it's like affordable (uh) not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
(err) ya and then if not you can go to the that time the #joo chiat#
#changi# area
around her area
#choa chu kang# area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite #ulu# [mah] so ya
ya
that time I went with her at #jurong# east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like (uh) the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad [lah] but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
[oh] ya cannot refund right
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
!huh! if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go #bali#
indonesia
I don't think will have

ya but
ya that one that one the mango #lassi# very nice
[oh] ya
why suddenly got a lot of face wash [ah]
[oh]
I suddenly like I go back home right I like shower and then I was like okay and then shower shower I looked at the face wash area I saw like [eh] a lot of face wash then all the face wash was like the brand that

ya for me today was okay [ah]
today today was my off day
of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) I've been trying to clear so
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
a bit
ya
ya a bit skew~ skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's tech~ it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
I went first in that group and when I went first
I took like I think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which wa~ that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the sh~ zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
[oh] that sucks
(mm) do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure #bo#
sure #bo#
[ah]
!huh!
can like that [meh]
ya
then why you take
[ah] okay okay understand understand
ya [seh]
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but
(err) because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three A_M shift correct
so it wa~ like his first day was just me and him
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
I may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was I_C [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just I think (err)
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six A_M S_M_S
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
I don't know [lah] I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
(err) okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] I told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on N_E_A or like our other client
(um)
!wah! damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not [lah] but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait wait wait [ah] !walao! !walao!
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three A_M shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss [lah] I feel bad
(um) hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
(err) I requested to go to N_E_A
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
[eh] no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this N_E_A shift in
in what day [ah]
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to N_E_A this confirmed movement to N_E_A because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to N_E_A shift
in december
same timing
three A_M to twelve P_M
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty A_M to twelve P_M [eh] twelve thirty P_M
then now it's like (err) three A_M to twelve P_M
I can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but I'm going on this N_E_A shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
I'm
my sleep is deprived
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
(mm)
it's like
if I were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this N_E_A shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for N_E_A
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what I mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good [lah] I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
like this current shift that I'm on [lah] I've been too complacent
(um)
I don't know I I just I
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
like [oh] because we have to we have to make like attend~
a clock report right every ten A_M
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers [lah]
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then I realised [oh] shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
reserve
ya
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm undeci~ indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it (uh) when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
jaded ya
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
no
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
this whatever A_I can pick up
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)

no but I just
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a H_D_B you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya

flexible
project
in terms of you have to be able to be flexible if things don't work out
so if let's say you will have like you said you had a certain shot in mind right
sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your
ya manage your expectations [ah]
to get that shot you know what I'm saying
calm down

ya [lah]
yes
yes

ya [sia]
exactly
!wah! you know when he went through the house
was he supposed to or was he not supposed to
like you know how they say like the
I hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
like the family will die or something like that right so he went through right
but was he supposed to or not
I forgot about that
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya
(mm)
you're also insignificant

(mm)
(uh) then who did I watch with
this indonesian woman
(uh) can watch online if you want [eh] you want to watch today
ya
why
(mm)
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that [one] will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know [ah] movies are
just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah# #blah# #blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your mon~ and not all your money
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
(mm) I try play on Borderland [lor]
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
(mm)
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train I bought the demon slayer masks
semp~
I I I I I only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
I ordered four
of course [lah] but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
I feel like when everybody watches it
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
it's so easy to find
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what I'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because I don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
(err)
she's very she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] I just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics I think
(um) I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
(um) like during high school and all that
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm ver~ I'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID [ah]
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
very nice [ah] they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
[ah] I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
kidding
(um)
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
in the thousands so like
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
!wah! I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech [eh]
say it's for Logitech
!hey! how are you
almost two months ago
[kan]
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] [seh]
[ah] [sia] like a blessing in disguise [ah] [eh]
okay [lah]
you heard
but
I was not affect~ as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now [lah] but (um) you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done [ah]
ya actually I am most of the time only like (err) two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya ya technically yes because
cause there are some like letters from (err) the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time [lah]
a few hours at least
in a week
ya [lah] I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
(mm)
!huh! as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
ya I know you always do [lah] you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere [lah]
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
[oh]
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you [ah] like I stress eat also most of the time I think I think it's not just us
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age (um)
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one (um) app away or one call away so
(mm)
is it I never heard of that before
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
[oh]
(mmhmm)
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
(uh huh)
ya
(mmhmm)
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good [ah]
as cliche as it sounds [lah]
(um) healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to to to lock down my (err) to get my workout in [ah] on a daily
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] is it
(mmhmm)
what's the average [ah] what's the ideal B_P
that's normal [ah] [ah]
that plays a part [ah]
ya (mm)
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
(mm)
ya [lah] it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more (um) you know invested in your in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad [what] I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face [sial] babe
[oh] no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
I've always like you you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
okay [lah]
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on [lah]
it's like that
ya
[oh] yes it's right there
you know me too well
how how long have we known each other
primary school yes no no no
is it [eh] is it K one or nursery [eh]
(err) K
there seven
[oh]
primary five [eh]
primary five ya
[oh] my gosh wait primary five
and then now we are like [oh] my god turning thirty next year so how how how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
even during school we don't really talk to each other [kan]
they're they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know (um) from what you're telling me
like
the effort
is only at your end
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times [lah] but
you know like (um) in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow! that really open up like
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay [lah] (um) being in a relationship of friends [ah] like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this (um) saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like (err) people come and go
and especially when the (err) when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men [lah] but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women [eh] I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and and and people always say okay (um) you know
(um) you shouldn't get back to your (err) to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is is is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly [kan] (err) maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my ex~ no not experience [lah] but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense [ah] I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
!aww!
!aww! so cute
a book like a diary
[oh] right okay
[oh] my gosh
[eh] but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
[eh] that is actually a good thing like (um) it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know (um) on paper
(mm)
then it hit you [ah]
ya you I mean I know like you you know when a person is looking at you and like (um)
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you you guys are what contacting now again or what
(um)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up [ah] then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
[oh] my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
(mm)
ya [lah] like I said
it it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the the your recent ex was the cause of the break up [eh] not not the cause of your okay [lah] somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay [lah] I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to to to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya [lah] but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you al~ you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
!aww!
!wow! you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
[eh] [oh] my gosh
I mean
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly [eh] when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
(err) it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the the the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if if you ask me go ahead [lah] it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on (err) cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay [lah]
you know
but (err) do you know if he's attached now or not
[oh] my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
[oh] is it
ya I don't give a shit anymore [sia] I can't even remember
[eh] isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah blah blah (um) let's catch up for let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
[eh] you don't don't say that about yourself [lah] you are amazing
(mm) (mm)
[oh] my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
[eh] ya [oh] my god I almost forgot about our #makisan#
okay to be fair I'm like facing the other side of the room now so I can't really see that it's like
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy I don't mind
like different topics every time
this is this has been an enjoyable voice recording session engaging
!wow! if I were to start with mine we need another one more hour
[oh] my god
so basically (um)
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and (err) so (err)
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything [lah] about his life so
true enough [lah] he is a very (uh) forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an (uh) up point for him [lah] you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
#changi# airport
(um)
and that #changi# airport is what we thought it was [lah] to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why she's so secret~ she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it [lah]
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then (um) so now he is (uh) working at (uh) #novena# H_Q and he is there because (uh) he wants to do office work and rightfully so [lah] because he wants to (uh) spend more time [lah] with your family
(uh) and
since he has going to move towards
getting married (uh) he thought this the right step [ah] as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound [lah] in why he's doing it okay then he talk about (um)
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay [ah] this one [ah] [oh] every time I do as in [ah] like
was it so difficult to [ah] get this out
the mirror the mirror side
[ah] middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so [ah] what else (um) okay so I I
[ah] okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
[ah] that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
[ah]
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact (uh) do you have connect plan that's he look at me like (uh) what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years [oh] we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said [lah] ya [ah] six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and [ah] okay
that's why exactly that's why I say
ya [lah] but I don't know why they want that place [lah] anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
[ah] he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
correct ya
so (um) ya so that that part they understood [lah] you know what it's it's spilt milk ready [lah] [kan] like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
and then
that's why [lah]
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk #zina# whenever #zina# butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then (err)
[ah] revise plan [ah] [ah] correct
[ah] I also don't want to embarrass [lah] #zina# cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing #zina# session but no point [lah] the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
for #zina# to actually [ah] secure a job
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows [lah] that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working [lah] and you #zena# needs to build her C_P_F and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience #zena# hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for #zina# to
work so that she build her C_P_F and then they also talk about children [ah] then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
[ah] that one okay [lah] they bring about the halal thing [lah] so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya #zina# needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
you
grow up
grew up together
#ashraf# you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
and then
[ah] come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you dis~ disagree or what is your perception
[ah] then they say
okay for me I (uh) I feel that
so it's like if he [lah] in the sense that [ah] so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
then after the whole session also I told #zina# and even just now I texted saying that
so
of course [lah]
(mmhmm)
anyway I
so (mm) ya then I told him okay #ashraf# after all that's been said [ah] I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya [lah] I said you have
(mm)
then
(um) so basically that's it [lah] and then
at least it's it's clear [lah] that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
na~ no he will just use
(mm) like
(mm) ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage [lah]
ya
so
ya
sister is working as a librarian but at #changi#
ya so it's was very easy [lah] then after when he left also I was telling [lah] see how easy and simple #ashraf#
was
by just being upfront
no #zina# you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
ya [lah] so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
ya so
like my [ah] that's why it was very simple [lah] because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that [lah] [kan]
so and he also can recognize [lah] the value in it and can recognise why you know #zina# needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that #zina# needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time #zina# would be the one taking care of it
#ashraf# [ah] because (uh)
someone needs to be there at home [lah] he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or #zina's# parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working [lah] and then I then I ask him so (uh) are you exploring the possibility of #zina# working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
(um)
okay [lor] then after then the
in the dining
(uh)
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear [lah] clear and upfront
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
for example
(um)
okay
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
!huh!
#zina# is receiving #dayah# is not there yet
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working [ah] [ah]
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
#dayah# at is at this stage of her life
(mm)
(mm) so we don't know that [lah] !huh!
basically this this guy ya
that's why
so [oh] anyway going back to #zina# I I told #zina# like
you need to sit down and you really need to (uh)
figure out the plan on how you gonna
plan it out
fair enough [lah] if he (uh) considered (um)
cause he then I say (uh) I
(uh)
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how #ashraf# is
I told her [lah] did you see or not what #ashraf# did
ya
that's why [lah] she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as [oh]
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
#zina# that is not easy-going
(mm)
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going [what]
you are not (um) having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
(mm)
that's why during the
that's why #ashraf#
if
the way
ya [lah] of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent [lah]
I don't think he would [lah] if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
(err)
push #zina# right
pull
pull
ya
consume
step up
(mm)
so ya basically concludes the whole thing [lah] with
#zina# and #ashraf# then
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya #dayah# and me then ya I understand that you and #dayah# are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what #hidayah# is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
[ah]
!huh!
you [lah] [ah] then
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
I had the same kind of argument with me and #izat# I bet you [ah] you and #dayah# would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least [ah] you see [ah] it me and #izat#
I'm doubting you know whether you and #dayah# would apologise to each other
ya ya
that's why [lah] that's why it seems it's
ya [lah]
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
what the
like have to see it as steps [lah]
so
that I mean like
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
so okay [lah] I think
I can tell that me and #izat# even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
(uh huh)
that family comes first
that you need to see that
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya [lah] so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
we will make it happen
yes so I
and then
mama !wah! at one okay at one point
(mm)
nevermind just (mm)
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like (um) there was one point where (um)
then I said #zina# since when you are that close to #izat# then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to #izat# then I say rubbish [lah]
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
so that's why I told her ya #zina# you are close to #izat# because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to #izat#
#izat# is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct [ah] but I say you are close to the boys just because of (uh)
(uh) you are close to #izat# just because the boys (uh) with #izat# you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to #izat#
then I say since when you been talking to #izat# since when
all all the
you are that close to #izat# then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys [kan]
further studies
[ah] then I then I also
need this person the person [ah] to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what #izat# can do this job [ah]
[ah] then #izat# do you think then she's like smile [ah] !aiya! [lah] cannot [lah]
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
(mm) that's why
(hmm)
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward [one] really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
you know comfortable
ya of course
wish [eh]
then for you
three months
[oh] like how is it
twice a week
[ah] not bad [lah]
[oh] you met the the mum
okay
ya [lah]
(uh)
(mm)
[eh]
right
[oh] okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you [ah]
but you guys haven't fought right okay [lah]
cause they say like you know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
[oh]
I think it will take a while [lah]
one year
K [lah]
(um) I think one year okay maybe six months [ah]
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
like
right ya so he is
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
(mm)
(mm) so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh]
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
but does he know what he want to do
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
(mm)
ya I mean take a risk [ah] if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
[kan] I mean that's what I would do [lah]
then (um) okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
N_U_S has any of that kind of [ah]
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in N_U_S he has to think properly [lah] what kind of course he wants cause like
(mm)
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but woo~ where do you want to go
what
[oh] okay okay
there's a master's in (uh) lasalle
(uh) (err) east asian studies
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
I think that it's okay [lah] like
cause if you just study [jer] [kan]
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy [ah]
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
okay two years [ah]
when
ya
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that [lah] I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your (um)
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet [ah]
but for you
(mm)
(uh)
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive [kan] then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare [ah]
[oh]
ya it is it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
#tuas# #tuas#
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
PayNow (uh) (uh) [seh]
clubhouse
okay
[oh] okay but it such a weird place [lah] to like get a get married at (uh) at #tuas#
ya I mean if you're up for #pulau tekong# [kan]
like I'm if you're if you're up for #pulau tekong# you're up for pretty much anywhere [seh] but I think you don't want #sentosa# right #sentosa# is too touristy for me
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
[oh] ya you just book the cruise [lah] you just get one cruise (uh) (uh)
then you get married in the on the water
(uh)
(uh) (uh) [seh]
like like go all out [lah]
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know
(uh) mocktail [lah] mocktail
like we get like a bartender that just does mocktail okay and orange juice apple juice sparkling wine

[oh] K
[oh] K K ya [lah] like buffet [lah] then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
(mm) ya ya ya
[eh] but no barbe~ barbecue pineapple is nice
[oh]
[oh] because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly [lah] I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
!aww! it tasted like meat ya
(mm)
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
even when it was (um)
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
take them afterwards after the first [one]
(um)
[ah] [seh] or you can go with us [lah] like me and (uh) me and #hafiz# so you as in
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also [lah] then at least there's some a bit of
(mm)
(mm)
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay [lah] so it won't be any different
I want to go J_B like staycation in J_B will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that [lah] obviously
really [ah]
like
how how bad is it
it is
they had like the music
(err) show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover [seh]
like even
if they they recover like if #johor# is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
to get back up
ya
if
ya like I think like
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
like from what it looks they are not
ya india is like one of the worst I think
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
(uh) (uh)
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it [lah]
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck [ah] [ah] cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
(mm)
ya
ya
(uh) (uh)
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad [ah]
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
[ah] luck luckily like (mm) I alighted much like (err) quite fast [lah] so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
(uh)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(uh)
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit (uh)
(uh)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(uh)
okay
(uh)
(uh) and just be aunties [lah]
ya ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh) [seh]
(uh) (uh)
ya
(mm)
[ah] ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like [oh] my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to [ah] ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
ya december twenty nineteen
(mm)
that's why then I'm like also like
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) how how their conditions were right
[oh] my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
(mm)
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb [jer] [ah] cause no choice [kan] ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order [ah] law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then (err) some people made a a like sarcastic kind of (err) remark it's like (err) go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this [one] they say go to hospital because they found out like
(uh)
(uh)
that time [ah]
ya ya
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like (err) you you don't you can't transmit anything [lah] so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work [seh]
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more [leh] then I'm like [oh] my goodness
(uh)
this kind of like way to combat right (uh) (uh) it's like I read it I cannot forget [seh] then I keep telling people then people like
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
[ah]
S_U_S_S
[ah] okay
how much was the rent for S_U_S_S
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
(mm)
okay
but you can cook [what]
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
(uh) good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
(mm)
of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm) okay
okay
can so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to trav~ they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
it's okay I'll ask the second question
(um)
(err)
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
(mm)
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya
(mm)
true
okay
you don't remember
anything about your memorable meals
(mm)
like
sniper
like a gun
as in it shoots bullets
okay
(uh huh) paddy field
swan
no not swa~ flamingo
flamingo
crane [eh]
crane
and
and did you like it
(mmhmm)
don't have courage to try new things
okay
okay
go somewhere else
you say [one] [ah]
don't take back on your promise [ah]
okay
okay then I ask you
the next question
which is
what is your favourite
genre of drama or T_V show that you are watching now
okay
short stories like what
[oh]
okay
(uh huh)
okay do you have any
(mm)
cartoons you like cartoons
ya
okay
frozen you mean
fross~
okay
disney pixar [lah]
then you did did you watch incredibles two
(mm)
then do you have a name of a favourite movie
can be foo~ bollywood also
the blue aliens
okay you know they are making the second one
ya
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
then the storyline
(mm) okay
(mm)
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
(mmhmm) okay
then
which superhero movies have you watched
okay
so between the three s~ do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
(mm) okay
(mm)
then
so if you were to
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for pri~ (err) indivi~ sing~ (err) single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal [lah] his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
plan out their
master (err) their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or P_H_D
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as profe~ professor in N_T_U so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no [lah] professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their re~ research [what] like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to N_T_U each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it [lah] and
ya
in school
then wednesday
cause I have events on tuesdays wed~ and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing [lah] because many of my friends
they
not just my A level friends but also my friends from e~ actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they alre~ most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my frien~ A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
man~ many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different [what]
for poly they already have a diploma in dip~ their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
you mean from my J_C
I only know one other person who's in N_T_U
was from my J_C also but the rest are all from different en~ (err) J_Cs
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in N_U_S
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like C_S and B_S
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
I like what I'm doing
(mm)
N_T_U I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education [what]
ya
I'll probably still stay in N_T_U
ya
probably still st~
ya they have P_H_D and masters
but as in I think
also
and it's important to start early [lah] because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also [mah]
ya

(mm)
ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring (um) rice cook~ we can bring prep rice cooker
(uh huh)
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can (uh) I think you just bring to the room and
ya
or stew
ya no [lah] it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more [what]
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back [what]
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say [what] monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months [what] it's just one semester six months
[oh] [eh] not six months [lah] three months of school
so
no school (uh) just come back (uh) three months later
ya
she's working in U_K [what]
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
(mm) so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies [lah]
so ya she already graduated [what] she she no no N_S and then
ya
so she's working in the U_K now
then U_K is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working [lah] and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that [lah] to make money
ya
ya U_K [kan] just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland [ah]
going for exchange
other options are U_S
ya can go U_S canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
U_S
then I U_S also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature [what]
it's more it's less
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries [what]
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
(uh) but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
(uh huh)
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you [eh] school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
no I don't want go U_S [ah]
we don't have relatives there
I don't know I think it's something related to
I_T related
ya okay
okay

yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me [lah]

in a playlist you know because the whole thing about
(um) E_D_M or house music or that point of time it's just to get the the whole flow the whole energetic flow of dancing you know of having fun in the dance floor
(err) I would
correct (err) back then yes (err) but

S_U_S_S
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
(uh)
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
we cannot
hi~ no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I I have to find the locals [lah] to work there

if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
ya
the the canteen sells malay food
muslim muslim
stall is a muslim stall

(mm)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food

ya
N_I_E
[eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
like
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
so let's
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
[ah]
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
if not that
maybe we can afford
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
(mm)
master
[oh] okay
(err) is with is with a private coach
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coa~ coach is quite hands on [lah]
(mm)
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
(uh) so I I I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do ac~ I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active S_G
is it with the equipment
pilates
[ah]
(mm)
is it good
just
(err)
just (uh) designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
(um) the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates [lah] I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
because private ones I think is quite expensive
(mm)
(mm)
I mean the credit
do~ (uh)
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
(um) I didn't learn anything from
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
(mm)
yes
then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
(mmhmm)
ya
one dish
(mm)
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast [lah]
I don't mind
but (err) only the down~ downside is that
(err) because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
(um)
I would rather go for something with proteins
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
ya
(uh)
ya

ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice

I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion sh~ you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
so just one one will do one small piece of
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) according to your taste [lah]
then you cook [lah] rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version [lah] there's many kind of
instead of (uh) instead of
so what's that one and a half cup right
(uh)

march
ya ya I need my own time [ah]
so how you today #nas#
[oh] ya
ya ya ya I I also been watching Netflix [lah]
[oh] favourite [eh]
[oh] right ya ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no [lah] yo~
but they still do watch the anime [ah]
but
(err) cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
(uh) september twenty nineteen
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
[orh] ya
exactly
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[ah] at the sorry [ah] at the mountain right
[oh] ya
!wah!
so
does that mean [ah] in the future will be a demand also
[oh] ya
[orh] ya that [one] is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six [eh] !wah! he's really strong
ya
such coward
!wah!
O_P man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
but but
it really blews me away [ah] blows me away sorry
[ah] opening [ah]
(mm)
(mm) ya
ya
it's like (err) one thing good about anime is like there's no
[ah] pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of c~ certain events in their life
(um)
like those people like they they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
mind blowing [ah] legit
ya
ya
ya
(um)
(mm) ya
(uh) one piece
ya
[oh] ya
not too much
it's it's (uh) it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
[orh] ya
ya it has been I I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
exactly cause that's why I I always [ah]
I always en~ envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for [ah] films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in in in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the the level
[ah] ya
[ah] ya
ya correct
no no no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
[oh] ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take [oh] wait no other than that got physics [lah] but that's all [lah] physics should be simpler because this [one]
its pre-calculus [sia] what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
[oh] is it the
the position vector [eh]
!wow!
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
ya so (err) ya that's why exactly but okay [lah] the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you (err) encounter like many problem solving [ah] methods or like
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me [ah] because one thing (um)
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with (um) other people or like
(uh) actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to [ah] do it whether I don't don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like (mm) I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya ya
(mm)
ya
(uh) ya ya
(mm)
that sounds
crystallisation thinking [eh]
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) soft skills that they're born with
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill [lah] but the the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
(uh) your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the the mood [lah] in in a way
ya ya ya
it's for for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own (uh) thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you [ah] in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
(uh) you you just you don't want to bring up the (uh) negative (uh) vibe when you speak up
so this the intre~ intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts [lah] so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
[ah] ya
(mm) ya
(mm)
[ah] ya ya ya ya ya
(mm)
ya and and in okay [ah] in university especially
okay
cannot
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
drop
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh] !wow!
!wow!
it's (uh) it's the same thing for my my school also cause (err) if I'm not wrong [ah] is (err) when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university [lah] if you never meet their G_P_A requirement after like every semester or something
but (uh) if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time (um) if you are if you have a academic warning already
lesser than two point eight
suspension meaning
ya
[ah] ya ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much much harder just to get that G_P_A to increase by a bit
ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
some
ya some some still have exams like math we still have exam [ah]
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
[oh] [eh]
!wah!
[orh] okay I mea~
(uh)
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
!huh!
[oh]
ya
but is it mean the same thing
prof [oh] professor
french
[orh] is it
ah~
geo~
(mm)
[oh] I
[ah]
(mm)
a~ (um) is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in (uh) game design right but I think the the first the freshman batch this year
it is (uh) user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience [ah] since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
[ah] [kan] so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this (uh) tiny tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say (um) enjoyed the little hap~ happiness in life
because if you [ah] if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
[ah]
ya
[ah]
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness [lah]
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it (uh)
they imagine them like [eh] with this
I I'll look good [ah] like [ah] with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
(mm)
ya
exactly
but I guess (um)
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
(um) elon musk [eh] he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the the the top most like the the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can an~ [ah] achieve
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
[ah] if if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was (err) I okay [lah] when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy [lah] of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
[ah] their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
[oh] [ah] sorry millennial millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely yo~ all the
(uh) we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to [lah]
[ah] [ah] ya roller coaster
(mm) ya y~ you have to take a break [ah]
that's why I feel
(uh)
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
which is why I also like how (um) okay [lah] not demon slayer something much more loar~ large scale which is Marvel
!wow!
Marvel is (uh) huge scale of
all the things that you [ah]
you imagine it to happen
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero [ah] but with no actual superpower
[orh] ya
cool
[orh]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
the black widow and iron man started
(mm)
[oh] ya
gauntlet
ya
(um) assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
you'll feel good [lah]
make your drive even
(uh)
higher
so that [one] (err) I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
(uh) good in you know programming in in in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements [ah] but in that case also like if you were to think about it [ah]
now [eh] ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some I_T knowledge so I thought okay [lah] maybe
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make [ah] it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
(uh) it's it's hard [ah] is the most hardest thing for me
[orh]
I always I I try push myself with with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of peop~ there are more people that are saying like [ah] if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very re~ relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be [ah] okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
[ah] [ah] too intro~ introvert that they wan~ they don't want to show their weaknesses [lah] there are certain people in in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
(mm) can say [lah]
ya ya
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay [lah] becaus~ before
uni [ah] you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art th~ the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like (uh) you learn programming all this and that it's useful because [ah] we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
(uh) how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
(uh) good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
[ah] exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
(uh) biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
for educational purpose
[oh] but okay [lah] cone
in in a way like M_C_U the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
it's a good it's a
ya in~ ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
[ah] ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our our earth [sia]
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years [lah] give or take
in
[oh]
ya
strap [eh]
[orh] [oh] ya
probably they
[eh] [eh] best [sia]
[oh] man I I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive [ah] to experience it
persevere humanity to maintain young
[orh]
[ah] ya ya ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
[oh]
[a'ah] ak~ #akaza#
a demon
[orh]
[oh] ya mayb~
I will still stay young [what] I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
[ah]
[ah] upper moon
ya
same
(mm)
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live a~ [ah] eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya ya ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying trying trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said (um)
wo~ the the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
(err) people who die I don't know [ah] this this is like a a a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die [lah] normally
ya
that's humans [lah] in a way [ah] that it's a beauty [ah] like when you die i~ you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know [lah] but
even if you die you you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
[ah] set the bar
ya
[ah] wrestling or any any person in interest [lah] like [oh]
aha undertaker
even if he if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already [lah] even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any (uh)
impact yet
ya #maradona#
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few (uh) weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
[ah]
passing
[ah] ya ya
it's like it heightens your
[ah] I guess you can say that
I I guess that that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he (uh) that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film [eh] or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
[ah]
exactly
which is why I like anime
stop [lah] am I at taiwan taiwan at times already [ah] okay [lah] hello [ah] actually [ah] K bye
(err)
ya
[kan]
in order [ah] so (uh)
like
keep up with the
academic [lah]
I [ah]
(um)
ya
how how how do I
how do I do this question and like
what what what concept that I don't understand [ah] just ask what concept I don't understand
(uh) formula [ah]
(mm) (err)
ya
(mmhmm)
some bluetooth speaker
(err)
the bluetooth speaker requires a
power source and
a device that has bluetooth
so
you you just have to
you just have to plug (err) use use a android android charger to for
for the power source
and then and then connect connect the bluetooth if and device with a phone and then
and the
the you can play any anything like music or video video audio
and and the and the
bluetooth speaker will will
will
amplify the
the the sound
from the phone
ya
(mm)
daddy (err)
code a scenario
that that the that the teacher given
then (err) must present
then
and then
and it must be the project must be (err) presented in
and the deadline [lah]
ya
no as as in like
(err)
and it like program [ah] like
they give you a a certain scenario where like
that like you have to
like the output must be
must be what they expect [lah] like example they give you a a
example they give you a table like a stat~ statistic they (uh) you have to use your your knowledge of
you have to use your knowledge of (err) programming that you have learnt during class and then you have to you have to in the input you have to quote in what you've learnt and then at the output right you it must be the the same as what they expect in the question in the scenario
(err)
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(uh)
(uh)
so I
they didn't
a prototype about
about a certain problem like for example
(uh) (uh) you have
you have problem with your earpiece like
like
you you have to wear earpiece where you
where your earpiece (err) wire always always like
like tangled so
so
we have to make a prototype to fix that problem [lah] [oh] okay that's good but because basically you you match your basic maths [ah] ya ya ya
ya ya
(mm)
(err) additional maths [ah]
they cannot
all cannot understand [lah] but
it takes practice [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya we went #geylang#
