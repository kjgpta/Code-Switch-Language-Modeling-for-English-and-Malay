alright
alright #mahirah#
yo hi alright alright it's good it's good okay so today's topic will be beauty in everyone
beauty in everyone okay this is a
yes
okay
for me
but but what can I say is that
beauty to me is not really appearance beauty is how you treat someone
how the your personality how the behaviour whether you are kind you are humble I think that is the overall beauty which
is the thing that we're gonna go deeper soon
beauty in a long term !woo!
(mmhmm)
true true true
ya
in the youth ya true true
so se~
(mm)
like okay because you are pretty I'm gonna friend with you because you are handsome I'm gonna go to no I rather I rather not
because because there's there's the because we don't see beauty we we don't see
or jealousy no that it it is really a general rela~ relationship that's why I find that if you want to find friends in the future
(mm)
go towards the beauty or
[oh] damn
(mm)
(mmhmm)
you can tell you can see a divide you know that kind of thing
and and not I mean okay there are some there are pretty people that are (um)
which is (um) it's not it's not really a a good thing
but it's up to them [lah]
ya very subjective
(mm)
true true but overall selecting friends with with (uh) with that kind of beauty in terms of appearance is not (uh) it's not the right way to do [lah] I would say
so ya it's not
if there's if there's a competition you know what I mean
what what what do you think about that is that a good thing or
it's not it's unfair [what] because you should pick someone of (uh) of ta~ of talent of skills instead of beauty
(mm)
[oh] yes
pay plays an important role e~
(mm)
design
F&B
social service ya
true true
a a partner in life your (uh)
(uh huh)
that is true of course of course first app~ ya you will see the appearance [one] or not
true true true true
me too me too
I think I think
for me for me right I I got a
okay I will share you later you you share first
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
what's the point [kan]
(uh) I'm not I'm not gonna talk about myself (err)
things like that this little things that will build up (um)
stressful for some people
it's it's it's it's very it's not a good thing right you know what I mean but it's hard to get rid of it
handsome
ya
if (uh) can you make me (uh) beautiful because I don't think I'm very smart
I'm I'm okay this to me towards me I'm I'm scolding myself that means I'm trying to say that
[oh] that means when if I'm pre~ beauty
actually if you know this again is very subjective is very sensitive topic also
who who who doesn't
but as long as the person is
yes yes
yes
[oh] !wow!
girls or boys
ag~ again you see it's subjective because not all girls do that not all guys
but
ya
physic~ really physic~
practical
(mm)
you can say (err) comparing [eh] comparing
(uh) judgy but
but but yes overall if you wanna say between both gender then (uh) (uh) most likely is the
especially in two thousand twenty twenty
youth suicide because due to due to not being able to because due to getting bullied
ya due to
this bully term
this kind of thing is what
which I think is
this one is is this this kind of thing [lah] that that is bad for
it but it it goes with the era you know what I mean
[oh] dear I think I heard a dysfunctional something [eh]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
functional [eh]
[oh] ya
ya comp~ competition (err) competition yes
because if there's no competition then if you unmoving you know we're not moving forward
there there will be a president there will be (uh) our manager there will be our the boss
there there won't be any leaders that to lead
usually it's it's gonna be the pret~ the pretty idols or the pretty singers that's that's gonna be (uh)
but nobody pays attention to her so there's biasness
[oh] my god like
because you are too attached of the with the thing
with beauty with beauty they are too attached with beauty so that is bad
(uh) same like macam
see this is the bad the bad side the not bad side (err) but the the the the negative side about
the look at the people will just support this (uh) this the group of
based on their
so that is the negative side [lah] about beauty but other than that
being not cannot being beautiful
you can you can everybody can achieve success
so success doesn't depend on beauty
to a certain at to a certain extent
some people can get the easy way [lah] but but that doesn't mean that
that everyone cannot get to that what do you think about this
(mmhmm)
true true
(uh) it's okay (err) but like [eh] like it's I'm just wearing shirt as long as it's clean then it's fine right
you can just wear anything then you can go nobody would judge you you know what I mean imagine if you last time you nineteen ninety five for example [eh] and then you call you wear (uh)
as time goes by
(uh) better and more (uh)
this is the shit you know
there are hold on okay (um)
(mm)
fashion thingy
fashion okay
fashion
!wow! okay ya
but the trend ya the trend we kind of know like you know what I mean based on pictures
it's very laid back
the trend is it (mm)
true true
[oh] yes
but you are not a hipster you know what I mean (um) ya ya ya
just to ya just to fit in ya that's that's the word
I think saturated
I would say today this
(uh) of (uh) twenty twenty of the twenty first century
it's not (um) it's because (uh) as technology evolves we evolve
(uh) facebook twitter youtube
why I mean
you don't need people
you don't need to be somewhere
you don't need to grab this thing with the people that is bringing you down
you can just go to your go with yourself or go with a comp~ (uh) company of friends that you know of of a good kind that will help you bring to that
(uh) stage you know what I mean
(uh)
have the same people that will hold you back
not because not not to level up to become someone that is
fashion wise (uh) people are now using (uh) fewer are following the more of the K pop
go [jer]
(mmhmm)
value is it popular popularity (mm)
(mmhmm)
self love
okay for me
as long as you know
where
but I mean if you fight with your clique you can either get back to them but if it's not then you shouldn't
rush for a friend just because you wanna be you wanna have that some you wanna have that (uh) circle of friends for security purposes or for comfort or whatever but
if you want to really find a friend then find a a good one take your time to find (uh) someone that really is genuine in your friendship
to be in that position then maybe I'll have I'll be very self my self esteem will be very low and I will be very depressed full or what~ whatever right
to me to myself also in the future or to whatever
so go ahead like (um) move forward find
there will always be better circle of friends out there that that you deserved that the person deserves
yes I I still remember our first our first
so and
sec (um)
not at for us (err) we don't we don't we don't go to that direction
so that's a good thing
I I see the like our
no point also [lah] judging like move on [lah] move on
our circle of friends ya friendship
yes yes yes correct
yes there is
!wah! you you got you got the face man
ya you got the face you got the physic
full package full package
that's a good recipe
you know what I mean
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay role model to me
in my family I I'll have to say my mum [lah]
my mum is someone that
if some if some if someone that
although that she's tired but she still
ya so role model
#neelofa# #neelofa#
like real be and and she's very #muslimah# also so I thought that she's a whole package and she's very beautiful
ya I take that as a as a
#wallah#
ya
okay ya it's subjective it's subjective
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
those who have that
(um) like
there are there are other aspect that is you can prioritise more than just beauty
just be because at the end of the day we are all the same [lah] just human being
ya
whatever you have would be taken away you know what I mean
just like just go with the flow just don't mind about all this let's have that that your pride is is to be the best version of yourself [lah]
(mm)
yes ten years down the road what what you want to say to yourself okay okay no no no (uh) okay how about before that we say
(err) the one thing we regret
what can we advise ourself right now
for the ten years down the road okay we we gonna talk about our regrets first
ya sure sure
!wow! that is deep that is deep ya that is true
for me my regret is that
I tend to look down on myself
very low
like I should be more
affirm is it affirm should be more probably a bit more selfish
a bit earlier just a little bit more not to that be as in but just everyone to to to
(uh) re~ the respect that you you're given by society that is more
is it is it an advice or like what we want to be or
[oh] message to [oh] okay okay
[oh] okay that's good that's good
(mm)
true
you can
you can treat yourself you can feel that you are valued [lah] in this world into serious [eh] for me my advice is that to always be nice to each other
and I have experience of of job interviews of people of a higher standard
have my own (uh) business or I I'm (uh) I'm the manager or have a bigger pay whatsoever [lah] bigger title whatever
I mean you shouldn't judge
bad which I don't want that to happen and
that's a wrap

really
[oh] I don't like to work from home especially
about one month
I rather work at from the office
so between you and me the the the experience is different [lah]
ya
how long how long
so my my environment my working environment is not
as comfortable as doing it in in in in the office
so so at least you you have a table and two monitors right
then my drink then how con~ how how is that
effective ya
(mm) it's not at all also
[oh] my god and the
and he he is used to that
(mm)
and your room
[oh] okay
or
[orh]
(mm) okay so the experience is quite
okay [lah] for you compared to my experience is not that okay
so different experience
back to school already right
[oh]
[oh] one more month !wow!
ya you're left with one more month wait you started since when
!wow! you got
two months of holiday [ah] not bad [ah] you
(mm)
(uh huh)
like what
why
spent too much on what
[oh] how much you earn [ah] that that that job
(mm)
hundred per
[oh]
ninety nine
per night
!wow!
okay
makeup stuff
[orh]
#Tampines#
!huh! then how you travel [seh]
i~ #Yishun# correct [orh] so you got straight bus there [lah]
technically [lah] a bit [lah]
compared to staying at hou~ [ah] compared to where you are now until
(mm) okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience [what] you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
(uh)
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K [lah]
(mm)
!wow! not bad [ah] you Q_C
do you know you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
(uh) the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the f~ in the emtire human line
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up [what]
[ah] [kan] so if you are the first person it's the easiest job [ah] but quality check a bit hard [ah]
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
(err) we start at about nine [kan] then we need to
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the [ah] the rice is either you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target [lah] but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person [ah] so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
the industrial area at #Woodlands# there [lah]
(mm) so they needed manpower (uh) so they asked manpower from my company so so ya [lor]
(mm)
yup my current wor~ company [lah] so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them [lah] (mm)
(mm)
ya [lor] so that's why I whe~ when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand [lah] what it means when you say fast paced
[oh]
buat apa
swabber
nope you don't need you just need an experience I mean you don't need you just say you are available then you you can [lah]
no [ah] you will learn [one] usually it's either you are an assistance or you are the one swabbing
so my friend applied for it
and the pay is quite good [lah]
three K [lah] three K for I don't know how many weeks of working [lah] so ya
[oh]
[oh]
so you what you
[oh] okay okay can
(mmhmm)
(mm)
okay
[oh]
it's the easiest part time it's the easiest pa~ packing job is it
compared to your your your makeup makeup [one]
you just sign up only
(mm) then for
how long is it by contract basis or what
[oh]
[oh] but night shift though
(mm)
technically [ah] what time start
eight thirty must be there
then finish at eight A_M
so eight to eight (err) eight to eight [ah]
[oh]
okay [lor] can [lah] then you better survive in this job
packing
is it
(mm) I understand
how's you and Andy
ya that is tea don't you realise it
(mm) !ee! I ask you first how's you and Andy
you and Andy on InstaStory
[oh] okay okay okay okay
[oh]
that's why you guys spend time together
(mm)
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
[oh] I mean
[oh]
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
understand each other
good [lah] good [lah]
(mm)
not talk
(mm)
well good [lah] good [lah] at least
in in this relationship the two of you
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
ya how long already [ah]
what
three years
not bad [ah] three years [ah] this is this the longest
(mm)
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay [lah] actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you li~ like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya [lah] because his side he don't make it he don't
(uh) his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya (mm)
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like !hais! [eh] cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
(err) me and him are dealing shitty stuff now [lah] so ya
do you know what he's working now
(mm) you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram [ah]
[oh]
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya insuran~ so he's an insurance agent
so under A_I_A but (uh) under A_I_A there's a sister company called
M_F_A_G
so (err) basically how to plan your financi~ how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
(mm) so okay [lah]
[ah] so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified F_A
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people [kan]
ya so you will meet new people of many age~ of different ages (uh) different character
okay [lah] I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so (um)
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
fourth year in the relationship
okay so okay [ah] now I explain to you what happen
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me [ah] [oh] (um)
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like (uh) means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
get it so means [ah] means [ah] like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about #Lina# that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his N_S
[ah] so that is the first time it happened
[ah] it d~
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
not interested [lah] because that V_C girl also have a boyfriend
vol~
no V_C is (err) volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for S_A_F
[ah]
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional (uh) breakdown [ah] I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his N_S
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp [lah] like
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating [lah] but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct [a'ah]
so during N_S is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
[kan] (uh)
ya
this is what I'm trying to say [lah] don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
like limited talking to new people
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is (um)
(err) way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the yo~ he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say [ah] this is me [ah] this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit [lah]
so ya !hais!
no I don't know because
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up (uh) like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me [ah] if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya [lah]
like that's why when you things like (uh) on Twitter will say this and that right you w~ you wait sometimes you need to leave you mu~ you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
[ah] I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know [lah]
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
not exactly [lah]
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
yes sure up to you s~ you can go ahead and share
(mm)
(mm)
but you you do try to recover after that right
(mmhmm)
(mm) ma~ [ah] that's the word make up
(mm)
ya [lah]
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
[kan]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
with him
(mm) at least at least a goal with him [kan]
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like (err) am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
ya so now I'm just like
(uh) like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I
everyt~
met his parents
han~ his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
!haiya! ya [lah] the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
(mm) [eh]
like
[kan] [kan] s~ so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him o~ with him right
(mm)
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
so far so far during this period right
where (uh) like
(mm)
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story [lah] okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware [sia] ch~
(err) like I don't know a week ago maybe
he's
I know I understand
!hais!
!hais!
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only [lah] I hint to my mother only [lah]
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to (uh)
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya [loh]
on my Instagram I think people can like [oh] okay Hans and #Lina# is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
(mm)
too f~
I have fallen for him too hard that (uh) now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person [lah] but
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
[ah] it's just me expressing my emotions
(mm) and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
!huh!
ya it affect
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
I'll just knockout [ah] so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing [lah]
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
then
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so (um)
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already [lah] so that is good enough
(hmm) ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand [lah]
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
ya ya ya ya
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
cree~ busy [seh]
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space [seh] that is good that's what I need [eh]
we just need a different type of (um) router ya
ya
[kan] that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
(mm)
ya means we need an addi~ additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the T_V
how many wifi you have at home
[oh] you have two
one is at
(mm) so you are connected to your
parents' [one]
(mm)
ya
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
(mm)
so for example you work let's say you work from nine to six
that is your normal work your normal work
then we got Zoom meeting Zoom meeting is to make sure everyone is in then we we we are all
ya because the thing is now my team okay what's happening to the team now is okay I tell you now [ah]
(err)
mo~ I and one more colleague is in the office just the two of us then the rest one (err) some of them are deployed in community club
some of them are deployed in at M_S_F to do social work
so so they are deployed at different places but the same time
why they are deployed at different places is because these places will give the money to the company then the company will can pay us
our normal rate
(mm)
[ah]
(uh)
(mmhmm)
no jus~ just now [one] is because I had to do a trai~ a mini training for this up~ [ah] tomorrow's training
ya
ya so ya [lor]
then anyways so I am starting a~ another job again cause I was just
I was like quite happy that I I'm out of the community club
then on Tuesday I am back I'm going to M_S_F
[ah] ya is to I'm going to do some homeless job you know as in (err)
pay to maintain the mon~ the the cash flow the money going in the company
ya so it's tiring because you are doing that job but at the same time you're doing your own job so you got two jobs
ya
it's just it's just COVID things [ah] it's it's it's it sucks bro hopefully hopefully by the time you get your first time first full time job right everything is back to normal
ya
(uh)
(mm)
five hundred right
ya that's the rate for poly
!huh!
your I_T_E is
five hundred
unless you work at retail retail will be eight hundred
ya so that's why I never ex~ like you get to experience I_T_E internship right then
at least you experience the paydrop when you say it's five hundred for the poly we will say it's normal ya it's it's just the rate
as an intern
it's okay [lah] you already pass through the (err) internship phase unless you want to go degree then maybe another internship
being what broke [oh] you want to work for your own
up to you your decision you still got like half a year to go

ya
[oh] okay then it's quite near [what]
that's pretty near

so you rather get them delivered than save like how much is the delivery fee and all [ah] like three four dollars right
then on top of that they charge you extra [eh] for like per menu item
that's not bad
that's right
(uh)
[ah] ya ya okay I know I know that [one] not bad
it was like FatBoy's [ah] it's I think more or less the same [eh] but
their menu all like
[eh] sorry Fatty Bom Bom ya
similar
the name I mean
Fatty Bom Bom is like
would you rather Fatty Bom Bom or
those typical western stall at the hawker
ya
ya ya okay I get what you mean like poly [one] [lah] the one you know beside the
the #Idah's# Kitchen
or the indian indian stall
you know the western stall is quite famous [eh] you know like at first they had the store in F_C_G right then after a while it closed down
remember
(uh) no no it's like
you know the that stretch right
it's the last the first shop near the drinks stall
that [one] to the end
not last stretch the first you know that stretch right it's the first stall closest to the
drink stall
ya before korean it was western it's (uh) mother and son (uh) partnership
!huh! serious !wah! that [one] is damn good man and it's like also pretty cheap also like
I think normal platter like say chicken chop [ah] only four fifty or what
with two sides
(uh)
what's that chicken chop
(mm)
(uh)
ya ya ya that's the thing about school (um) food I feel even if the price they say not say
(um) cheap or what right my portion is like still worth way more worth than what you are getting outside
[oh] it's too much [ah]
(mm)
no no they don't
ya ya ya
[oh] okay I think I know I know but I never eat never tried it
[oh]
ya correct
[ha] play [ah] more you can play more pub games [ah] I feel bots like no point [ah]
because all the toxic (uh) opponents or teammates right
it's because your op~ team is terrible that's why you feel like opponent is good
sometimes serious [ah] especially the filipinos and the pinoys in DOTA !wah!
damn toxic man they like I don't know what they doing most of the time
then they will just start blaming you all these kind stuff but entertainment also [ah]
[oh] #genshin# is just my browser not loading [ah] I think if maybe got to do with my internet connection at that point in time
but I yet to try again [ah]
the main part of the whole thing [ah]
(mm)
but like
[ah]
ya ya ya
that's a like chakra
(uh huh)
okay
(uh huh)
[ah]
then after that you got to wait until the thing will recharge or what you gotta hunt for the reason the resin
[oh] I see I see
but like
ya ya
so do you think this game will like continue being this popular or die down soon
(mm)
ya right right right
the best so far
one of [ah]
[ah] better than runescape
[ah]
ya confirm laze [ah] after a while
ya ya
maybe [lah] perhaps you know like confirm people like play what how they want to earn money also
but I think they earning a lot [sia] this game it's like available on all platform except like console [lah]
you can whale on #genshin# also
(uh huh)
!huh! !wah! this crazy [ah]
!wah!
so you think this [one] more
you know money intensive or maple
[ah]
do you even spent money on games
[orh] okay ya okay makes sense
[orh]
ya true but it just on solely on cosmetics anyway
[oh]
ya ya ya
[oh] why [eh]
how I know maybe you changed man already sometimes talk about soccer
#bayern# very sick
ya ya okay
ya I know stop back forth back forth [ah]
(hmm) ya each to its own [ah]
[ha] when you check it
you wanted to book or your parents force you
ask you
!fuh!
when's the last time when's the last time you went
[ah]
[oh] so it's like balloting process or like first come first serve
okay
okay
can [ah] try try
you know the APOL chair
ya it's like a new you know there's like Secret Lab then Royale Ergonomics like these chair brands in singapore
then APOL
ya here it quite prominent [ah] and like
they really build up their name [eh] you know like
those DOTA players E_A players right
all the chairs are all sponsored by (uh) Secret Lab
ya
cause aesthetic wise right is up there [ah] pretty nice [lah] you see the thing like very tempted but like functionality wise is like the same [ah] throughout all these brands I would say
[ah]
ya but then like it's like
aesthetic wise I mean but you think about it is like four nine nine right it really makes a difference you compared to using
like a normal chair right now
(mm)
ya
[eh] but this [one] is like high quality P_U leather like they add in all the other I don't want they do [lah] but
they treat the materials quite well so it's like very resistant to all these (uh)
sweat and for you to you know peel and tear like
ya that's why
that's why I'm deciding [eh] I want ask you this would you rather pay like say
(uh) let's say five hundred four nine nine for the the Secret Lab chair
than [eh] APOL is three nine eight
ya
so I'm now weighing the option whether like a hundred dollars more for extra three years warranty is it worth it or not
(mmhmm)
ya ya
ya
ya that is the thing need to ask properly
(uh) that [one] obvious [sia] the terms and condition specifically say that
if you let's say they found any like (um) forceful kind of you know
what they call it [ah] damage on your behalf then it would be voided [ah]
I
over time maybe yes [ah]
then that's the part where that tear warranty comes in
(uh huh)
ya kinda it is it is
ya
that's true [ah] Coke like damn sweet [eh] I I'm not a fan of Coke [ah] it's too sweet for me
[ah]
ya standard correct
[ah]
[oh] carton
[ah]
ya ya syrup kind of base drink [ah]
that's non-fizzy
(mm) Seasons the blue colour [one] right
that's the green tea ice lemon tea [eh] is it
sugar
ya
ya I agree I agree
[eh] wait seasons
[oh] I think I got I think I never try Seasons (uh) peach tea before [eh]
[oh] no I don't think so [eh] the I can't recall
maybe [ah]
(mm)
(uh)
through you haven't been to club room right ever since
because you got the mindset [lah] like you know there's a
relax corner in school
ya
ya true true
(uh)
I also finding [ah] I want find like (uh) you know like stable kind of part-time
and nine dollars [ah] if you can get it's like pretty good already for cafe
if you want F&B you want earn like ten dollars got to be like those like that time I told you Marche
then like a bit more established kind of (um) eatery
never banquet I never do before that time was (uh) kitchen job [ah]
ya Grand Hyatt [ah]
so you know when banquet (uh) how it works like
let's say for event you must set up
the number of tables for events these kind of stuff
so for them that's why they like banquet and they can earn quite a lot
ya ya they all like make friends already [ah] that's why
[orh]
Shangri-La
(uh huh)
gary gary [kan] you know gary then the alex those people
events
[ah] ya ya ya they are events (uh) lighting all this kind of stuff
[oh]
[orh]
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
[oh]
ya ya
s~ so it's a win win
it's a win win situation [lah]
ya
true
because
[eh] since when you care [sia] bro
okay [lah] okay [lah] (uh) you changed man right
no the swedish bistro (uh) they call it
ya
(uh huh)
I'm not sure [ah] if that's Fika or something some other cafe near arab street last time
(mm)
(err) but how much was the food
so Fika or the what's that called [ah]
Malayan Council [eh]
!huh! serious
I never tried that food before [ah] but the desserts not bad [ah] quite delicious
(uh) ya my sis told me also because the boss [kan] like it's (uh) this chinese guy
he's she say their service his service is top notch because he knows how to treat their customer right [ah]
[ah]
ya that's why that's why is the owner is smart he
mark up the prices of the his items right on his menu
go there quite a few times with his family and all
so he he knows the owner
(uh) the next time they just go then use the voucher to get like
you know cakes and (uh) tea or something like that
good good the
actually I don't know also I never see the store in person before
ya around there [ah] arab street #haji# lane
damn long [ah] I never go this kind of place
[eh] next time
[eh] of course [ah] I broke man need to find work
go there then step give the #akshay# face [ah]
no beef [lah] then like just laze [ah]
!hey! beef is on bro
!wah! I need to watch the thing
ya that's why at first I thought it was like a
just a group of friends they just wanna try something then until I see the pro skater came into their video
to their series then I'm like !huh!
can't be like just a random fellow can managed to get a skater
a proper renowned skater you know to come in
(uh huh)
ta~
ya exactly
(uh)
ya it can never get old [ah]
which one
(uh) I don't know I haven't been like keeping up to date [ah] with their videos
shit I never watch I never see that
you and him met first then I was still on the way there
ya
[eh] I injured man right
or how who else #sundair# but #achap# cannot [what]
I thought you say he's out for the month
talk on Discord [eh] don't say like that
have a day outing
that
hashtag
(mm) later he got hashtag dare to stab
[eh]
all the battle royale game but it's a bit more futuristic
and then you get skills or niche
kind of character you choose
it's good no no it's not it's like futuristic it's not cartoon-ish there's a difference you know between cartoon-ish (uh) cartoon-y and future futuristic
it's like what's the valorant
!huh!
okay if you think valorant is not cartoon-y that means apex is definitely not already because apex is like (uh) it's like PUBG but
instead of like you know the buildings then the
or the guns all like a typical gun but it's like more of the halo kind of version
[ah] ya something like that
but it's quite dope [ah]
ya
P_S five I don't know [ah] I never see since the pre-order part
I think no [ah] like they still publish [ah] it's just that it's out of stock on the main (uh) website if I'm not mistaken
[ah] but you don't actually own you didn't own one right
[oh] okay okay
(mm)

[orh]
[ah]
[ah]
[oh] wasted
okay [ah] P_S_P was short-lived also [ah]
it
it's good good actually I quite surprised the thing (err) like just die down like I thought it will be a continuation but
I think P_S and
say again
ya no it's because the Sony go screw up the
the new series which is the what's that [ah] P_S_P Vita
[ah] Vita Vita
P_S Vita that that
part of I mean that that series was like the downfall I feel
then just nice D_S came up also then people just I don't know actually I quite surprised why D_S became popular
because of like Pokemon and what
I think
(mm) I think the main appeal is just because D_S can support the
(uh) what's Pokemon games people literally buy D_S just to play pokemon games
ya even Switch also Switch initially was like ya that's why
ya
animal crossing also quite is quite new [what] this like this year right ya this year
ya I don't even know why it looks super lame [lah] to me
but it looks like minecraft is just I don't feel appealed in playing the minecraft kind of games
ya ya why
!huh! serious
how you know
!whoa! sick sick
or is it just to garner the support of like I don't
ya hipster
hipster grand dad
that's why every single move they made it's all got (uh) impact they want to achieve you know

ya
but actually last sem
cause last sem last semester is everything was H_B_L
so I can H_B_L while I was working cause it's four hours rest [what]
#al-ameen#
I not sure [seh] I think around
I think until two A_M three A_M like that [ah]
if I not wrong [ah]
ya
the food is nice and all but like
like feel like unhealthy [ah]
if if I'm not exercising already all the more I shouldn't eat there [what] correct or not
ya diet [ah] if cannot cannot exercise then diet [ah]
but I think I want to start back soon [ah] exercising
extreme [ah]
he he he
(mmhmm)
but then I don't know [leh] like I feel like
(uh) since I got the height already right
ya but
the effort [ah] and like
I don't know [eh] I feel like going gym
okay
like
I don't know [ah] like even if you are skinny you don't look so unhealthy
so but that stigma also like
a bit
a bit #paiseh# [ah]
but I feel like if I don't start like
[eh] you know I I looked through my gallery right
like
last time during N_S
I skinny [sia]
okay
not not not skinny [ah] I'm I was skinnier
like I was still big but like
I think hundred and four [ah] (uh) last time I checked was hundred and two
weighing scale
so now
I just take as my weight still at hundred and two [ah]
I don't know [eh] my
cause since after N_S right my weight fluctuate is from hundred
to hundred and five [ah]
no actually hundred two to hundred eight like that
then it always
so
not say maintain [lah] but (uh) after B_M_T can order in already [what] so I always buy #nasi lemak#
ya
like before I know [ah] like towards the end of N_S [ah]
cause army [kan] army the the longer
the superiors all will be [ah]
ya
so towards the end is like every week
I eat #nasi lemak# I eat Fatty Bom Bom
[eh] fat~
Fatty Bom Bom free [ah] I want to eat [ah]
[eh]
watch your language man
woodlands have at #marsiling#
no no no no no no it's (uh) you know where #marsiling# M_R_T is
it's it's opposite #marsiling# M_R_T [ah] but not to the polyclinic side [tau]
you know you know #marsiling# got new shopping mall the where the police post is
towards the M_R_T tracks
[oh] ya ya ya
but what's the difference [seh]
like FatBoy's and FatPapas
that [one] is like they have similar menu but they open one cause they want to make a halal version
ya that's why
cause usually franchise is people
they want to make use of the name [mah] it doesn't make sense for you to franchise
but then you change the name
don't know [ah]
but
like if got feels for Fatty Bom Bom [ah] it's just like
no no no it's not at #afghan# there it's at
ya it's opposite #dunman# sec [ah]
then #lia# my my girlfriend's house is like one stop away from there
like really like it's it's like
#yio chu kang# to your house like that
like
ya okay wait actually actually not that far [ah]
may half half the journey [ah] from #yio chu kang# to your house
if you at the comfort of a house already you watching
watching television all already like
then they deliver straight to your door step
ya three four dollars [ah]
the
(uh) #tampines# [one] not so bad [eh]
I know
usually me and #lia# buy
two people
later with the discount code at last pay like twelve dollars fourteen dollars
ya
usually I get the
cajun cajun [eh] cajun cajun chicken [ah]
the cajun chicken with rice
like the spaghetti the spaghetti not bad but like
I think I prefer rice [ah] the rice is they
garlic rice garlic butter rice like that
but it goes very well with the sauce and the chicken [ah]
Fatty Bom Bom or FatBoy's
ya
depends [ah] some
you know some of the hawker centre [ah]
the western shop got like secondary school feels [ah]
#Idah's# Kitchen
I don't remember [sia]
is it the one the the thai shop take over [ah]
the last stretch
last stretch near the drink stall
[oh] [oh] [oh]
I that [one] I thought that [one] is korean food [what]
[oh] I don't think I ate there before [ah]
now they got new [one] [ah] at Koufu
that kind of price [ah]
(uh) the
the whole range [ah] like you know chicken chop (uh)
the
hawaiian grill
all that kind of time
all that kind of stuff [ah]
even though six ninety seven ninety still
that thing worth it [ah]
usually they give like half bowl like that right
Koufu you know where the (uh)
is the last shop but it's the same side as the japanese side
ya
but I not too sure [ah] maybe
japanese shop [kan]
[eh]
how [lah] I want to get better at DOTA [sia]
no [eh] but I play
it's like
if I get toxic opponent [eh] like if my teammate is terrible right the opponent would be somehow good [ah]
maybe [ah] maybe also
but I don't know [ah]
I don't know [eh] like
like
the #genshin# impact also cannot right
but okay [ah] nevermind [ah] because #genshin# like you can't really play with friends [ah] like got co-op mode
but it's not really
it's not
ya it's not ya the main part the game play is not revolving around
co-op mode [ah]
then you just explore the world yourself [ah]
then
I mean like now I toned down I don't play as much anymore [ah]
like the call it resin
so
you know [ah] so like (uh) this resin right if you want to do a dungeon
you need to use like let's say twenty resin
then let's say you got hundred twenty you use twenty means you got hundred left
but then the this resin will recharge [ah] like I think it's like four minutes to charge one resin
or
so it's like once you used all your resin already you got nothing else to do
so
the resin you cannot you need to wait for time to go by [lor] then it recharge slowly
so it's mostly a waiting game [ah] like you finish
I don't know [sia] I see online people mostly say it will die down right
cause of
how limited your game play is
l~ like like really the game play is
fantastic [ah] phenomenal
but
I would say [ah] M M_M_O_R_P_G I've play [ah] so far
it's just that you're limited like there's so many things to do
but because of the resin you only can
ya so it's more of a waiting game [ah] so like as much as I want to do a lot of things I cannot
I think maybe that's their way of like getting people to play it long term [ah]
ya true [ah]
[oh]
they spent like
ya so like they and even then right they don't have the
like got this guy spent four thousand dollars
he still don't have all the hero
I think maple [ah] cause this [one] is very easy to free-to-play
like like so far for me I never spend money but I'm still
quite far in the game already [ah]
like I I complete all the story mode already
ya ya ya it's like DOTA like that [ah]
fifteen then
so I just complete the tale like until the max then I get the skill already
then after that I don't spend money already [ah] like
ya some more it's like
like
an advantage is advantage [ah] but like they make it minimal [lor]
since when I even watch soccer
I don't know [ah] like
I never I've never seen the the
what's the word [eh] the
the attractiveness of watching soccer [ah] like it's just
so slow
so see a lot of action for forty five minutes like that
you wait pass pass pass I don't know [ah] maybe just not my thing [ah] I guess
[eh]
tomorrow tomorrow I got no school [ah]
wanted to book [ah]
(mm)
I really not sure [sia]
I think the same week [ah] on monday I think the thing open
it's first come first serve
but if you already did it like within
I think now is five weeks [ah]
or four weeks I not sure
so like let's say I do today already right
[eh] I do tomorrow already
it
[eh] I think they blacklist me already
where you where you (uh) where you plan on getting
APOL
(uh huh) I only know se~ I only know Secret Lab [ah]
but then the pricing [eh] similar [ah]
like
but
I'm not getting the premium like it's not you said it yourself [what] like it's not genuine leather right
[ah]
(uh) five hundred dollars on a chair
(uh huh)
!huh!
worth it [ah] got you can take it like it's like you buy
you buy laptop in poly
you top up hundred dollars you get three years warranty on site [what]
then then they what they sew it up or what they cannot change
ya I think this [one] must ask [ah] I think if
if really one for one exchange worth it [ah]
every other week
[oh] really [ah]
is it considered like
damage with intent or is it like accident
but
okay but wh~
like you know Coke is very very corrosive right
ya exactly then people are putting that that stuff into their mouth you know and into their system
ya I also
like
F&N [pe] F&N is like the standard [ah] the (mm)
they got like a lot of Coke
like one one what do you call that [eh] (uh) basket
not basket [ah] they got like one they got one but container full of Coke
s~
so for me I'm more like ice lemon tea
ya different
syrup also not a big fan [ah]
I think more of like bottled drinks that
that's like established [ah]
like Pokka Seasons
Seasons (uh) (uh) the ice lemon tea is the blue colour [one] but they got the
it's
ice ice lemon green tea
ya ya you can taste the tea [ah] but the blue colour [one] is mostly you taste the
lemon and the sweetness [ah] ya the sugar
I don't know why
Seasons not Pokka
for for a while already [ah]
[eh] [a'ah] [eh] (uh)
wait from where
wait I still looking for a job [ah] dude
haven't [ah] but I heard they going to open already
so I don't know [ah] I just scared
like history repeat repeat itself [ah]
lik~ (uh) ya that's why
my friends all
my friends all is really
eighteen year old nineteen year old
so there's always that generation gap
so like I think I'm not able to
to bond with them as much [ah]
so maybe not that bad [ah]
ya but like
in the one that pays well [ah]
ya ya nine dollars is okay
or banquet [ah]
okay [ah] honestly [ah]
that time you work [what] no [meh]
[ah]
(uh)
[oh]
#sheikh# also work kitchen [ah]
[oh]
the one a
[eh] but that [one] also see your manager also [ah]
because
it's not really banquet [ah] but they set up for the banquet people [ah]
#shang# Shangri-La
ya so what what they do is they just set up the place
I think so like who
[oh] yeah yeah yeah but
[ah] ya then this [one] is only for
like wedding reception only [ah]
ya so but then cause he make friends with the manager [ah] so
the manager is like #sheikh# and that [one] also
(uh) like
like to pass on the responsibility to someone
so he pass on the responsibility to my friend
so my friend from casual labour becomes a manager
but you get casual labour pay [lah]
but cause of the manager position he's not doing much [ah]
ya
ya
then I don't know [ah] I think everywhere you go I think as long as you make friends [eh]
(uh)
maybe
[eh] have you have you went to Fika before
ya [eh] the food there
ya it's it's
you know where working title is [eh] actually working title closed already it's beside working title [ah]
!huh! they work there
I cannot imagine #rian# at Fika though cause the people there are like really
how to say [ah] I don't know [ah] I can't imagine #rian# there
like #aidil# #aidil# I still can see him [ah] working at Fika but #rian# a bit hard [ah] to imagine him working there
[eh] but the food there the food
the [eh] the ambiance all
top notch [ah]
like work there also I think #swee#
[eh] the food
[oh] I I never try Malayan Council before like
ya a lot people ask me try because they say the food there good
cause (uh) my friend tell me their service there is like top notch [ah]
but then my friend say [ah] like even though like
okay my friend went there for the first date
like at a normal cafe that's what he will get [ah]
worth it [lah] ya
but then voucher means you need to come back there and spend [ah]
[oh]
[ah] ya
I want to try [ah] but like
where is it [ah] I never knew where it was [eh]
but it's at #bugis# also
but then (mm)
but then the price [ah] start dating
(ugh) you scared what must pay for her [ah]
this
sad face
(uh) I thought you say you got beef with #akshay#
[eh] got beef with both the boyfriend and the girlfriend [ah]
(uh) beef is on
[eh] ya [lah] I think I want to watch
(ugh)
cause
no cause it's not a proper show it's like
(mm) (ugh) (uh)
(uh) no no no okay
but their storyline is all connected I think that's what The Real Bros is [ah]
ya (uh) key and peele established already [ah]
they got this new video [ah] what what was it [eh] s~ (uh)
[eh] which one was it [eh] key and peele
it's the newer [one] to come out
(uh)
(uh) (uh) [oh] the jaden smith [one]
then you should (uh) (uh) you should watch it [ah] the jaden smith [one] funny
that time I watch with #shah#
car park [ah]
[ah] ya ya cause you were late [ah]
[eh] how you want to plan now or not meet with #sundair#
no [ah]
last month [ah]
don't say like that what makes you
ya
#rehan# why #rehan#
[ha] funny guy #rehan#
[eh] then how later later want to play DOTA
I play for a while [ah]
(uh)
I want to get better don't know
cartoon-ish is like what like like team fortress [ah]
valorant is not [sia] actually it's quite realistic [what] is like same as almost C_S go but
only the suit like a bit
[eh] how
are you are you buying the P_S five or not
[oh]
(uh)
ya like the first console I owned was P_S_P
(ugh) cause okay
when I growing up like I never had all these things cause
so like
want me to concentrate on studies kind of thing [ah]
so
like
I didn't have much distraction other than computer
ya so
then after that [eh] you need to finish assessment book first then you can play for twenty minutes
so it's like a reward kind of thing
so
so I only got my first console after my P_S_L_E
[eh] [eh] no primary five exam primary five exam I got all A
ya then my
they never even tell me you know cause I always tell them I want game boy I want game boy
not really strike a deal [lah] like they just said okay if you do well for your exam we'll get you a game boy
but they say that since primary three [ah] so like I never really believe them [ah]
(uh) wouldn't say well [lah] like
so so [ah] A A B B
like A B B B
like I would say it's ave~ okay [ah] above average [ah] slightly above average
but then
I think primary five I don't know [ah] one day I just come home [eh]
then turns out one was for me [ah] one was for my sister
ya
ya my sister was the one that wanted P_S_P I wanted game boy [what]
your son will get sick of it very fast
ya dying already
no [ah] but wasted [ah] cause my parents bought P_S_P when it first came out
so it's P_S_P one thousand
[ah]
[ah] ya so
like
I think a few months after I got my P_S_P the slim [one] come out
ya
but then that the closest to console I got [ah] P_S_P
ya but actually the games there quite good [sia]
ya
D_S [ah]
I think D_S take over [ah] the market
P_S_P Vita Vita P_S Vita ya ya ya
downfall [lah] ya
then I
but I
I think
ya it's like
[ah] that [one] is a Pokemon brand already [ah]
until now right ya Switch
got other games [ah]
ya don't know [ah] mayb~
maybe if we play it then maybe we also get hooked [ah] don't know [ah] this kind of thing
you know joe biden
he he also play animal crossing [ah]
ya
the (uh) he got post on Twitter [ah] I got see a picture of his (uh) like office like that
I think
publicity [ah] like you want to be relatable
ya that's what
all all politicians like that [what]
got a rea~
probably that [one] also not he play [ah] maybe his P_R team play for him [ah]
ya
!hais!
but some like okay but some cartoon-ish graphic is nice [leh]
like I okay this [one] is a very indie game
like last time my sister buy from popular [ah]
adventurer concourse I forget [ah]
it is [ah] it's like you build you build a town like that then you hire hero
(uh) medieval conquest yes that's a game
medieval conquest
no no no no it's one by itself [ah]
but quite fun and quite challenging also
total war is what [ah]
is it
[oh] no no no
ya you you are on the planet
then you can choose two sides
so every player we choose one side got two sides to choose from [lah]
so basically the side you choose from
it's like basically imagine counter-strike
but it's ongoing the game is always ongoing
so I forget [ah] (uh)
I !wah! I forgot what's the name of the game but basically what how you supposed to win right
is you are supposed to advance your unit
through to the other side [ah]
but cause the game is so massive right
like the frontline rarely move
but it's cool cause like
let's say you got ten friends
tactics to go to the other side you know then like
do missions to like
sabotage the other side
(err) (uh) quite cool [ah]
I forgot what's the name of the game [ah]
plazma burst
(mm)
isn't that just (uh)
escape room
and then there's a ghost chasing you
[oh] is it
I'm not sure [ah]
#farid# all [ah]
skipper
#aiman#
#aiman#
[oh] I don't know [ah] I never see [ah] they post on twitter [ah]
okay [lah] not bad [lah] he was top top in singapore [ah] one point of time
then your
M_M_R for that hero will increase
[ah] so like (uh) he play this hero I think he just keep playing the same hero over and over again [ah]
so his score is higher than everyone else so he was like top seven in singapore [ah]
for me the best I got was top thirteen for north side
and no no no north singapore region means woodlands #yishun# ya
I they don't have singaporean server I don't know
I think it's (uh) asian server [ah]
but they got they got a location service
so for singapore is easy singapore is divided into four places are north south east west
so after you get like let's say you top of north already
then you I think once you hit a certain position then they will put you as laptop in singapore
ya
under it will be malaysia but then under malaysia got top in #johor# top in #selangor# top in #sabah# that kind of thing
ya that's why
singapore is one state [ah] singapore is a state [what] it's a state country right
(uh)
out outdate outdated information [ah] that [one]
okay I can say also [lah]
!hais!
(mmhmm)
how you know
of course [lah]
(mm)
the malay [eh] actually this [one] I can ask my friend [lah] you know #khai#

whatever forum that they try to
implement within that short period of time to ensure
students still can (um) collaborate do team effort all that
but I feel like like (err) this current time this current period is like the the most
(err) hardest [ah] I feel
ya
(uh huh)
something like that
(err) honestly [eh] I might
might not lose a lot within this year that I have a gap
I mean I'm still losing money [ah] that's the main thing [ah]
(uh) I mean I guess you can say this recording [ah]
no [lah] I mean
honestly speaking I'm trying to look for a job I applied for a job but right now
okay at first I feel like okay at first I thought okay [ah] maybe I should try to apply something related to what
I want to do in the future
then okay so I look look look see see see for any like opening cause like
most of the people that they're looking for are like [oh] two three years of
(err) the experience that you are
rele~ relevant ya then I was like what

I didn't bother to look for any jobs [ah] during august to september

I expected september
to get my last pay [ah] but

S_A_F how they pay is like

sixth october that's
I think about a week from now
[ah]
cause (um)
bill from their system
okay
so then (uh) the the person in charge they like [oh] (err)
can you come to the
computer here I I check the reason then I was okay they check they check they check then they the
that lady was like [oh] (err) are you still are you still in N_S are you still serving
then I was like [oh] [ah] I just finished I just O_R_D like
last week then she was like (uh) okay okay then I have to remove you from the eleven B scheme [oh] man
that was like ninety eight dollars
!hais!
ya [lah]
ya [lah] of course [ah] I I expected I need to pay but I
was like hoping at that one per cent
but
ya
(mm) !huh!
!hais!
I was like nah~ nah~
the the amount of work I have to do
two point four
three is that [one] is before (err) [ah] C_P_F but six months is a very long
think so I don't know [lah]
no but the thing is I don't I don't want to do that the job scope anymore
it's just too taxing [ah]
[a'ah]
I would extend if I'm doing like admin work [ah] honestly if they give me admin work for the next six months I'd take it
I would not
[eh] I would not think twice
I just
ya serious [ah]
one last talk
[oh] I see
[oh] I see
(uh huh)
[a'ah]
I see I see
no [lah] okay so (uh)
and then
to [eh] no sorry my P_S
and then basically then go up to O_C [ah] so there's this
this directing staff is external
okay so there's a
particular set of people that like really
(err)
(err) expect a lot from the from us [ah]
S_A_R standby area is at seven thirty seven forty five
he ex~ they expect us to be there before that
I don't know
[a'ah] ya
and okay so you know how in
(err) B_M_T they say [oh] okay (err) the duty sergeant or the duty officer will be the [one] doing all this (err)
all these checks right correct
(uh huh) okay
so we also have the
we also had the schedule [lah]
okay who's duty on monday duty tuesday duty wednesday so on and so forth
okay so let's say specifically
that day was wednesday
okay and then unfortunately the
directing staff was one of the
(err) the [one] that we don't like [lah]
like he expect us to be there he expect us to check he expect us to do everything
and okay
the the thing about (err) the duty (err) is like only one person supposed to be there correct or not
okay so
then
so this directing staff came down he was like [oh] (err) what time already I was like !huh!
what do you mean he's like (err) why I only see one sergeant why I don't see all the sergeant here then it's like !huh!
what you expect [sia] you expect all the sergeant to be down here during the check [ah]
you get what I mean
ya [lah]
cause like so
that means those people not on duty need to go down and do check [ah] rather than preparing for what's to come for the day like [ha]
ya like as we got okay we got so much limited so very limited resource
and he wants to use all the resources just for one small
so we're like (err) when when I going O_R_D it was like [ah] don't care already [ah] because
maybe one one more week or two more weeks left with them so I was like I don't care already [ah]
ya
I mean I I just worry for my
under studies [ah]

make it make it more unique [lah] like more us got more personal touch you know
like let's say (uh)
it's more of a mix and match kind of thing it's like

[oh] ya ya
okay
(err)
thank you so much okay so (um)
(uh) are you studying now are you working tell us more
okay anything else
okay
okay that's great [ah] okay
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
okay
it's it's not a definite shape I can say [ah] it's not a definite shape it's not a pat~ it's not a a shape that is
is precise or [ah] specific is
it could either be a it it could be ei~ it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
unique
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
a few types of mango
and yeah
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite fr~ my favourite fruit
so ya moving on (err)
nah when like I don't know supermarket
(err)
(err) hangs around the M_R_T station
like late at night
so
okay thank you so much
(uh) ya ex~ exactly like I mean (uh)
in singapore it's it's a very common fruit to find
(um)
and as products they they come in varieties a variety of products
what do you think
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(err)
beauty products so
okay in other forms of food
like like my sister said it's (err)
for me it does makes me feel happy
(err)
mango tea [kan]
dessert
exactly cause
it's
yellow
and
it just draws
(err) mango #bingsu#
(err)
perfect
sunshine [eh]
(um)
it's like a brand
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a mang~ (uh) (err) a fruit name for a brand because
(uh) they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all [lah] because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
I guess
that's interesting
okay
I feel like
mango cake is something that you would find easily
(hmm)
exactly
exactly I feel that
sure I mean (uh) that th~ whatever that she said was right because I feel that
we don't really think about
[oh] my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs [ah] we there's also
they sometimes have that and mango pudding
pudding [kan]
like
it's amazing how how much I love mango pudding
process
that's true
about having mango soda
do you have have you had any mango sodas
okay
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking [kan] (um)
actually durian I don't know if you guys know du~ durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about (um)
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
okay
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
and
I think it's awesome that we can actually eat it off the
the fruit the seed
ya I don't know it's just it's just where it's probably easier to grow here and cultivate
and okay
mango has been cultivated for over four thousand years
it's way before all of us
and there are a hundred types of mango
each with a unique taste shape
so
okay this fruit is not only delicious but boasts
it's actually quite true cause
that
okay the fact that it has it's sweet
eating snacks that is high in sugar you know like
it's
I don't know it's
it could be replaced with just eating mango which is amazing
mango and its nutrients to health benefits
(uh) it's a good news right because we love eating mango so much
that (uh)
we know that i~ it has its health benefits
like ya (uh) such as improved immunity okay that's one of the benefits

[a'ah] no I remember
(mm) whenever someone want to fight right I fight
even if that person don't want to fight with me want to fight with someone else I will fight for that person
I remember got that one time
there was this game we're supposed to play it was a spoon in your mouth and then you have to balance the ping pong ball
ya ya
and one of this this one girl was picking on this other guy
he's a very small guy [ah]
and then last time I was very I wasn't big [lah]
but I was bigger than the rest for some reason
which is hard to ya it's hard to imagine right cause right now I'm the smallest person
you know last time I was big (err) kind of big
bigger than everyone else
[kan]
ya and I was very how to say gangster
[ah] gangster ya and then after that
was his name #afiq# I think his name was #afiq# he was a really small guy

I hope you don't consider him
[a'ah]
annoying
[oh] that's some random thriller show right
what you mean bridge the cursed bridge
so is the cursed bridge
so it's about a bridge
I don't know now got what movie
can we watch the hunt
intruder we already watch
Greenland
want to see this one of the worst show in the world
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
april [kan] lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
[oh] so which #mulan# have I been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would #mulan# do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched [lah] but I don't remember [lah] [kan]
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about #mulan#
so #mulan# [kan]
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
woman is not required to go for this [one] [what] this [one] N_S
ya woman cannot go
but then why is sh~ she forced to go
[oh] okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
I watched before
no no no I watched already you see
#mulan# go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then (err)
then the doc~
[ah] sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check (err) then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander (err) leader [ah]
[meh] she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie [what] right
she got caught in the se~
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
#hans#
so is #mulan# like
based on the real life
let's finish the #mulan# first [lah]
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
#wushu# finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay #wushu#
#wushu#
okay #wushu# then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why I just help me understand
no you make me make me understand #mulan# first then I'll make you understand #aladdin#
what do you mean I know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
(oo) makes sense
nineteen sixty five [eh]
!wow! that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about #aladdin#
okay [ah] honestly I think it's stupid [ah] because
okay because
she don't let me drink water [ah]
cause he
cannot [meh]
then you want me talk for one hour no drink [ah]
!huh!
okay
this one guy

okay whatever okay
so in the
(err) go inside the movie [eh] go inside the cave
then he climb climb climb get the lamp then he rub the lamp [ah]
he met the genie inside he met the genie inside the cave
ya
ya
ya
you know #aladdin# is the monkey [what]
#aladdin# was just like on the cliff
tell me your wish
then they sing a song
but I don't know the song is in the original movie or not is there a song in the original movie
then they sing song
then they rub then he rub rub rub already ask for the first
that was the monkey's first wish
ya that was the genie's first wish
(oo)
okay whatever then after that
the three the three wishes no we have to end this
podcast
know your facts
the first [one] is is he wants to be a prince of
(mm) I don't know [lah] what's the name
you asked what
ya I'm telling you how it goes
so the three wish is the want to be prince
then second wish

if I'm not wrong [lah] they closed down the slides like all the slides
I don't know [lah] I I I need to ask the maintenance guy

so what my team did
so
I will just in the middle again all I had to do
was to capture that intercept the frisbee from the opponent
okay
so once you okay let's say I scoring this [eh] I scoring here [eh]
I will throw to one guy at the back

the the the wait the ex the the ex the official ex that he was with before right cheated on him but then when I got to know how they are
during that relationship right I don't think it was
a real relationship I'm sorry [lah] but (um)
that was like during his teens [lah] like I think eighteen nineteen

me and #amin# no [ah] we are friends even though we dated each other
(uh) he's not
so how it ended with me and #amin# is that he was the one who ended it ya so
(um) he didn't say why but he told #amin# [eh] he told #syafiq# it's because like he feels that (uh) he's doing all the work and then I I
I am not reciprocating his efforts but I don't think it's it is that
but then I
I don't think I acted that way [eh]
#amin# now
back then ya I was fond of him that's why I'm still friends with him

sya~ #syafiq#
#syafiq# I've been friends with him for more than a decade already [eh]

[ah]
(uh huh)
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
!aiya! I I give people the benefit of doubt [lah]
so anyway (um) so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump [lah] I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this [one] [ah] this [one] I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
[eh] no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so (um) the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
she doesn't want that
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and (um)
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said [lah] what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
(um)
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ready to settle down I think [lah] almost there [lah] but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if sh~ if I think he really likes this girl [lah] but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
(mm)
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason [ah]
ya
(uh) I never ask for details
(mm)
you know when they first went out right
sh~ he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really [ah] I no one has no one has asked me
at all

[oh] why he
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
can we see him
we haven't seen each other for
long time
wedding [eh]
but do they have a
a great wedding
what's that
[oh]
who's that see
why
hello baby
[oh]
(mm)
so #fathul# I have a question for you (mm) if you have three wishes what are (err) what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would (err) void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say (um) by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things (hmm) maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and af~ after all to live happily is what everyone wants [lah]
(mm) and some skills that I want to have (err) maybe include (err) having all the capabilities to al~ all the knowledge that that exist in this world [ah]
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily (err) to us to some people to live happily is to have (err) the money and the wealth
(err) so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy [ah] and intelligence also [ah] this is to me I think it relates to me also [ah] because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
(uh) so maybe for now we move (uh) to the next question which is (err) superpowers #fathul# what (err) if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
[ah] [eh]
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of [ah] the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you (err) by accident
the the
the amount of (err) infection or the possibilities of (uh) infection rate [ah] you have anything to argue
yes correct
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk (uh) ambitions that I have
or maybe (uh) I wo~ I can take risks without having worrying that I might (uh) injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe (err) get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win [ah]
provided I am strong [ah] and maybe with this regeneration
(hmm)
I can donate let's say some parts of my (uh) limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
(hmm) where I have this ability so I can do is (err) I request my leg to be cut off and then give away (err) in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard (uh) tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
(mm) what do you think about this regeneration ability
(mm) it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having (uh) to be looked at or without (err) being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
(hmm) I have this
I want to be (uh) isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self [ah] to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems (uh) affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
(mm)
how long maybe until I feel peace [ah] so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I ca~ I cannot give a number of years or months [ah] but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months [ah] then slowly maybe I will
(err) increase the number of the period [ah] slowly
(hmm)
we can never do something to improve the people around us
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable [lah]
but it has to be looked in a certain way [ah] whereby the person
(err)
he is not affecting badly (uh) around the people (uh) (uh) he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state [ah]
(uh)
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
they will change a lot [lah] so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small (err) goals small (err)
small achievement so this child will live without (uh) having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife [ah] he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife (err) agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free [ah] to do anything that he wants
do you think so
[eh]
(uh) cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
(err)
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary [ah] but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams [ah]
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart [ah]
(mm) so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self (err) I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self [ah]
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
(mm) and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
(um) what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos (uh) I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and (uh) an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud [lah] or maybe just email yourself [ah] so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
(err) a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself (uh) since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is (err) I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see (err) how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe st~ (err) start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
(mm)
K
you maybe you next we should talk about (um) near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was (err) I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was (uh) stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall (uh) is when I was
(err) riding bike (uh) it happens maybe due to
(err) rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to (uh) overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next (uh) topic that I have in mind which is (err) a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
(uh) ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
(hmm) whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that (err) there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
(um) synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example (uh) few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
(err) I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future (um) a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go (uh) deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took (uh) I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
so you have anything to add on
okay
you may start
no actually like I fetch her at (um)
like eleven plus
then I fetch her
she said she just want to like drink like #macam# relax [ah] relax and drink

join [ah]
(mm)
[oh] [ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
so
so what's your what's your take on it
in the future but why is the future is now
mix
okay
okay
a lot of like
like on their especially in singapore like on their I_C it will state
what race they are what
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
[oh] okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
(err)
like what's your point
(uh huh)
(mm)
like you say they shouldn't choose
[oh]
do you know that got some #macam#
[ah]
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
(um) probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
then they need indian [pe] and then that their open slot is only indian like #macam# that open open #macam# the empty house is only open to indians
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for chi~ [ah] indian
ya
[ah]
probably the same race
[a'ah] [a'ah]
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to #macam# some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying [ah] so it's like
(um)
(uh)
(um)
ya
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like (um) there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of [ah] like #macam#
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now [ah]
[ah] yes [ah] #macam#
ya so to a certain extent I guess like it's justified but did you know that #macam# this (um)
racial enclaves
ya
ya true [lah] true
ya and also #macam# there's a lot of like (um)
I mean this is what I learnt [ah] (um)

[dah] okay bye
(hmm) three wishes right
I want to help the poor maybe (uh) I feel that (err) it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then next (uh) the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes #furqan#
(uh)
my views on what your wishes are it's actually (uh) is very good from what I see you are a people person like (err) like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at #tampines# I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like M_R_T (err) taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the M_R_T I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say (uh) for example I I share an example [ah]
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food (uh) food court I teleport to the place
then after that (uh) I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay (err) you said it can increase because the person (uh) didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so (err) let's say you are not talking about teleportation you take~ you are talking about (err) going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an M_R_T I took M_R_T I took a bus and (uh) maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from M_R_T to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's M_R_T
there's (uh) maybe (uh) the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
we only expose to the office
[ah] which is easier to contact tourists
it is (uh) something
(err)
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know (err) be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
(err) I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one (err) mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of (uh) being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe (uh) act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but (err)
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it (uh)
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that (err) you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to (uh) ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that (err) you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means (err) if a person is a father
okay so (err) what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of (uh) two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man (uh) should isolate himself
for months
I feel (uh) I I agree to a certain extent (err) where
let's say this person have (uh) no responsibility maybe (uh) no parents no siblings no children no wives then (uh) I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say (err) okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example (uh) a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
actually (err) pretty similar [ah] on on the investment part because (err) actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves (err) a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
(err)
if you were to tell me that investment is (uh) is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe (err) last time I was maybe too good [ah] I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society (err) when they see [oh] a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much (err) about monetary (err) maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old (err) ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more (uh) gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this (uh) money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go (uh) anywhere that I want because (err) there's a certain level of (err) financial freedom I would say
second topic
[oh] my my memory memory is (err) de~ degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
[oh] I admit (uh) do you have you heard of (uh) about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the ne~ the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep (uh) items
or (uh) photos [ah] to then (err) to keep in a secret place or maybe (err) some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video (err) it's like a conversation with (uh) my old my my oldest self so let's say (err) my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually (err) when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so (uh) I just hope I don't lose the video [lah] actually I don't even remember where is it now
(hmm) I like to be famous yes
but
but (uh) I think is (uh) if I were to take myself a picture of myself (err) every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
one of the nicer waters in (uh) asia that (uh) that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic (err) trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so (err) I think there is (err) what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and sud~ suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have bre~ you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of (uh) funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that (err) short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then (uh) another (err) much more serious (err)
(uh) experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me (err) makes me (err)
then (err) maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was (uh) I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that (err) jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to (uh) go into (uh) into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then (err)
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an am~ amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that (err) it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually (err) and even (err) just now I was riding a bike
(err) due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so (uh) I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
(uh)
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
(err) someone is (err) or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of (err) delivery riders who is (uh) riding very recklessly around (uh) (uh) on the road [ah] because they are
(err) chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe (uh) road (uh) sorry (uh) lorry drivers lorry drivers
(err) less trip
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because (err) (err) when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example (err) if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can (err) plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering (uh) maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that (err) we are not so (err) I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe (uh) three hobbies one is (err) maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start (err) ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
(err) I would know I'm I'm not really a good (uh) soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because (err) I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that (uh) soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me (err) easily when whenever (err) people especially (uh) in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said [oh] let's play soccer outside
(uh) this way you gain (uh) relationship or some
re~ relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and (err) in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems (err) I think is is is quite interesting
(err)
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some (err) activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure (uh) how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because (err) in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals (err) so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less (err) how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think (uh) as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
(err)
so far I think [eh] all the (err) hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from (err) we are kind of (uh) similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers
okay
so these days
to design more
ya I think I want to I need your help
so ya
because my Instagram shop is not
progressing at all
I don't know
hobby is hard I want to try new things you also want to try new things right

all the materials [lah] because you know starting a new hobby is always so expensive but it's always been my interest and actually now is my passion [ah]

ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market (uh) like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game [eh] without the players what do you have like an empty online page
(mm)
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot

cause like previously something happened [lah] when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
(mm) ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like [oh] I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
like really late and then [ah] they wanted to start filming at like eight
model or something
so she's quite tall [lah] and then like (um)
her features were like pretty [lah] like
like a model person's features
(mm) that part that was the one [lah]
ya
(mm) ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying [lah] cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
so like
like wandering around and shit
ya
I think the aunt~ the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
col~
then we just like like we told them [lah] like [oh] we're filming a horror movie here
but it's quite interesting place [ah] cause it's surrounded by H_D_B
that hut that looks like a #kopitiam#
but it's exist now ya
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the H_D_B so it's quite quite cool
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor [lah]
so like ya
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
[oh] visit !huh! there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven A_M
the there's a road that goes through the entire place [lah] so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people [lah]
and but we only hear like
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like #paiseh# [ah] cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the S_F_X stuff
so like
and then (um)
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like [oh] !wah! so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya
she just goes around does that every time
[ah] but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice [ah] it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
(um)
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting [ah] the place
interesting
(um)
M_B_S
I honestly don't know [ah] I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night [lah]
ya I think same [ah] if like I had to like
true
but
[oh] ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
(mm)
(mmhmm)
really
that's interesting
(uh) the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes [sia] is it even open I think it is already [lah] if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
#pulau semakau# that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
three years quite recent [lah] ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
[orh] [orh]
catty
catty enclosure
(mm)
and jumping on things
(mm)
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed [lah] like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible [lah] to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age [sia] the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from #yishun#
#yishun# has cold weather and move it
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not [meh]
it was
it was [lah] cause I don't remember wearing for R_C things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
(uh) five A_M to two A_M
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya [sia]
sec four [lah] so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
[orh]
it's quite pretty [lah] the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and #changi# airport
(hmm)
that's a hard question
but legit [lah] like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
(oo)
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
(hmm)
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job [oh] my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
(mmhmm)
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole H_D_B filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
(mm)
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
[oh] ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
(mm)
ya previous
(mm) money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so what the hell
!wow!
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
[oh]
(mm)
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your Q_R code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your I_C right it's literally does nothing different
(mm)
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no G_P_S in it [ah] so like
probably not
(mmhmm)
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
(mm)
(mm)
no one was interested
ya
(mmhmm)
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay [lah] to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their I_C and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
(mmhmm)
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like !oops!
I mean if it had if had G_P_S like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
(mm)
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
[orh]
same
I just I cannot imagine like
[oh]
I was like !huh!
ya
[oh] that's weird
the hell
(mm)
(mm)
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
your cat is wild
yes
that cat deserves to be in a zoo
have its own like
safari at like enclosure
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
[orh]
(mm)
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
(mm)
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
that's when it gets bad [lah] like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it [lah] but like it's fine (uh) it's fine [lah] he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
[oh] really
[orh]
I mean get scared [lah] like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine [lah] like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
(mm)
(mmhmm)
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic [what] then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die [lah] confirm but like
[oh]
(mm)
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
(mm)
is put to use
ya
(mm)
somewhere else
that needs it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next U_S president should just remove money
there is not no money
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
bro~
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing

nonsensical [sia] like how

ya so that's how I started [lah] s~ so the first my first the first class I went was with her and then it was very #suay# because it was like
ya because unsubsequently it was like slow and chill and guess what today also was fast for me I was just like !wow! do you just not like me
(um) okay so it depends on the studio but like that studio because of the size they can accommodate (um) three groups of five

so the first day (um) afro was like in the corner
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
right
so like the first day cause I will maybe I was too focused on like myself but I didn't notice the second day it was fun because I was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me
so that says something

ya that genre is is I mean that's my favourite genre which is #shonan#
ya
okay
okay
[ah]
explode
[a'ah] [ah]
okay strength
okay
[oh] okay !wow!
I thought I thought you were gonna say set stuff on fire remotely because that
because pyrokinesis is
but no one else has powers
(mm)
!huh! then how does he talk

you don't you skip the intro and ending right
!huh! serious [ah]
how many episode is it
[oh] you mean like each season got twenty something episodes !chey!
no I'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite #gundam# series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
(mm)
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy [lah] like
like you know brings us together
that's rude
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
(hmm)
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
ya
although it did start [lah] it did spur it it started my my thing for #gundam# so okay fine fine I give you that #bandai#
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay [lah] fun
(hmm)
ya
yes so how did it go
(hmm)
she's like tall she's so tall
(hmm)
right right
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
!oops!
!huh!
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore [oh] okay she knows [eh]
!wow!
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
(mm)
(mm)
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
(mm)
ya ya ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments [lah]
ya
correct ya ya
ya
sassy [ah]
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked (uh) #najhah# about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many [eh]
maybe at most twenty plus [lah] but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as #naruto# and all that with like five hundred and two seasons [eh] three seasons [eh] in all that kind of
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is P_G twelve
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
I guess ya [lor] like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area
ya
[ah]
[ah]
ya
jesse
me and my western pop culture
ya
cools
in this show in full !wow! really
I mean I don't
I have so many replies but I'll just I'll just keep it to myself
serious [ah] a full frontal is an eighteen [jer]
okay okay

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean it's different when you own it
#yikes#
how did #shah# react
so I was like [oh]
I mean it's different when you own it
[oh] my goodness
#yikes#
[oh] my goodness somehow I'm very surprised okay
you're prepared
ya nudity
ya
ya
it's like ya
and then it's like !whoa! full frontal !wow!
what
okay [lah] at least you were like considered legal
[oh] ya that's true
so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly [lah] it supposed to be a little like #teng# #teng# #teng# I mean
[oh] yikes
it scarred you
it's nice to know like someone cares for you like someone's looking out for you
I mean I know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
(um)
[oh]
okay okay
[ah]
ya ya ya
it's true though
I wonder like how many of my stupid decisions can be attributed to like
the strange perceptions that I had of like relationships (hmm)
(mm)
ya
!oof!
we haven't even graduated
right
[oh] my god ya
that's that's the thing [sia]
[oh] burn burn
ya
okay
[oh]
[oh] typical
pre~ a celebrity preacher
okay
[oh] I was like what's up with
okay
!huh!
check check
girl
!wow! so romantic [eh]
okay
[oh] #shiok#
okay okay okay
he's not provoking
okay sorry
what
I know I know don't read the question [mah] so there he was
that that pause of me with the math the meme
and then just left like without waiting for them the question to be answered
okay okay okay okay all right fine fine okay
who is sending them
peeping
okay but
okay
it's just unrealistic
[ah] she would have slapped him
in-law
[oh] my god okay okay I I see where this is going [oh] unhealthy expectations
okay ya
is it on #suria#
ya like you know we can do without this scenes it recruits is it
ya that's why I already feel damn sorry it's so so christian michelle
e
[oh] my goodness
okay
so
ya I think movie also can so should be okay
okay
why it is sad like
like [ah] okay
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[oh]
[ah] [oh]
!wah!
but then how [ah] like
ya
why so weird
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
[oh]
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
what
but that's really your favourite movie
!wah!
(err)
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show [oh] then [ah] my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
(um) they suddenly
(um)
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
all of them I think almost all of them get married
ya
[kan] like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young [lah] so the thing is like he's (err) like professor in this like
like (um) over the years [kan] they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like [ah] people who are like basically like
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met [ah] through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
(um) you know like straightaway
like realise [eh] tomorrow you gonna get married this person
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world [lor]
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing [lah] that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool [kan] I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker [lah] don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
[oh]
[oh] ya you told me [what]
[oh] ya ya the cafe thing then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
[oh]
!wah!
#oma# spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
farrer park ya but the thing is
very circular
actually ya
(uh huh)
like tough [what]
but you know
ya but it's not
ya
[eh]
ya
maybe you are just like picky
tea without sugar can but coffee [oh] because of the bitterness [kan]
it's just weird
K [lah] okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
you can fulfil [lah] okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya re~ re~ resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so (um) out of these three [kan] like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay [lah] have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
#lee kuan yew# no [ah] is it you can be rich I can't remember
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know [what]
what
okay I think that's a bit far [oh]
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
(mmhmm)
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries [lah] our neighbouring countries [lah]
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries [lah] if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore [ah] no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
like you know
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun [kan]
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case [lah]
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot [lah] hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national rail~ railway railway is [eh] you know the train [one]
[oh] my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay [lah] (um)
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
no but maybe maybe because like
what you doing there !huh! (uh) you never read the sign is it
[eh] ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like [oh] my god
like [ah] like the maid was shocked [lah] when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya because it's okay [lah] but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
(um) you need to
like you can achieve now [lah] I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy [lah] to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
!huh!
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and (uh) cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia [ah] and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya [lah] but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave P_S_E_A account
post secondary [ah]
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya
so can use that
(err) if it there's one country my wish list [lah]
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young [lah] I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like #naruto# like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing [lah] last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly #naruto# come in ya po~ [ah] pokemon all this you know and then I was like
[oh] my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
!wah!
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like #osaka# #kyoto# #tokyo#
and I when #nara# I went like #kanazawa# then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no [lah] I went with my friend but I went (um) I think I went #hiroshima# alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter [eh] wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing [lor]
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like #tokyo# and #osaka# they rarely snow I think
#tokyo# ya #tokyo# rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
[oh] you didn't know I went korea [oh] my god
I showed you ya
[oh] my god you didn't know I went korea

[oh] you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
!huh!
I feel like going with your friend [kan]
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went #batam# with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like [oh] no I cannot eat it's [oh] no like this place is
but then he was like then ya and then he was like why why the hotel smell then I'm like
hotel supposed to smell that way you know

ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage [lah]
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment (err) one star price then I was like
!alamak! why you like that

interesting [lah]
like ya

ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between [kan] ya
(mmhmm)
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a #suria# actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
(mmhmm)
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no [lah] like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya
ya I didn't expect
him

I think D_V_D ya the whole box then my friend give me lend me [lah] then I watch everything finish then I stopped watching already because the only reason why I watch Netflix is because of that
ya unless I won't use it so actually I wanted to subscribe I tell you [ah] like I just want to try so I actually could just use the one month free or was it three months but then in the end never [lah] then you guys all use free I never rely on anyone [lah] ya I very independent

[oh] for me [kan] I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
ya [lah] for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
this small staff [lah] these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya [oh] (mm) so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because (uh)
it's to me it's one of a kind [ah] and then like (uh) so many different
see experience all the different species in one area [lah] in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the #kampung glam# area
ya about the old school stuff like (uh) sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya [oh] ya and I want to know (mm) which genre of drama or T_V show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like (err)
drama like between people I mean I prefer (uh) movies [lah] because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch T_V series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
and then like after that (uh)
(um) [oh] there are some reality T_V shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun [oh] then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
(uh) it's called #kahani# ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that (um)
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch T_V series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so (err) ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
yes
ya so like [eh] I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
[oh] what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
(mm)
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch (um)
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important [lah] so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
ya so very cool cartoons [lah] and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first (uh)
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
(um)
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
[orh] ya [lah] soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like [oh] he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the [ah] every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
[oh] I like this question because I like wishes
(uh)
[oh] not a lot of people will say food why why why food
(mm)
unusual superpowers !wah! I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya [lah] that's that's what I want to
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think (uh) the reading about minds one sometimes (uh) I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is (um)
actually why one thing [ah] why cannot be many things I say education ya
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
[oh] if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that (uh) people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
[eh] then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like [oh] it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
!wah! so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun [lah]
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like !wah! how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
say if I were to play like music or like (uh) art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true [oh] then I wanna ask (um)
(mm)
think for me (mm)
four episodes ya and then (err) the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
to this place
for me I really love concerts [leh] like it's too bad [lah] this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
(uh) then like (mm)
for me [kan] my (uh)
a higher price
ya [lah] so like for me (uh)
as a frequent concert goer [kan] you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that [oh] my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
think for me my fashion style I always like to (uh) dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then (uh) if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and (err) I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me [kan] (uh)
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
so like (err) personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
ya what is it
I think this [one] [eh] your hardest question [eh] how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like (um) say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me (uh) just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
[oh] I was thinking
(mm) korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is

everywhere now you go like you need experience and this you know
for people like us
but I hope I hope you do find you know job that you can be you know
stable financially you know support your parents you know that
honestly
super hard you like
about hundred percent ten per cent [jer] companies who does that
like they
they don't appreciate you they
once you do something bad

!wow!
that's unfair
how old is she
she's two years younger and she's the head of your
team
!wah! that's a bit unfair
[orh] it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
I mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies I mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
I don't know [lah] this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
I mean that's why
(um)
M_O_M exist
ya so and anything complain [jer]
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
I am a student care teacher
(err) basically I just supervise the kids [lah]
(um) you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
(um)
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
a moment later you're there changing the
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
homework
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
torturing so
a lot of people
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
like
l~
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay [lah] I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
[oh] ya I did [oh] my god I miss her so much (um)
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and [ah] I met man the house so so empty
and
and ya [lah]
and all that ya
but
I don't know I'm happy for her
ya that's like
I mean like
nowadays (um)
you know when you find a soulmate you know you just
you just
it's important to go with the flow you know
like
not f~ forced upon it

but I heard you and your
your boyfriend has been together for
for years right

#mashallah# I mean like

I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay [lah] take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
[oh] I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
(um) me and my family okay
I don't know [eh] I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have [eh] have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay [lah] slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
[oh] man
I saw this post and they said that (um)
the first child
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
(um) ya pass off so
but at the same time you you are nurtured
(um)
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third [lah]
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are eld~ the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya [lah] are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
(mm)
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
(um) okay talking about sweet right
I scared [leh] I scared of diabetes
(um)
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
diabetic
his deserts you
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
[oh] my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high [lah]
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low G_I food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower G_I so that you
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
(mm)
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
you save so much
one to two days
!wah! this is
is quite hard
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know peop~ like nu~
like why can't you just love is free yes
okay love is free
I think like we're at that age
where everything is just hard
is it a twenty two
no no no
twenty two curse
her
grandfather
and then drove back home
and left him there
malaysia [lah]
singapore
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then (um) they receive a phone call from the dad (um) the dad call another [lah] his son [lah] another son
then went there
and he said the father said okay me home [lah] then then they say like [oh] it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good [leh]
because
of (um)
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so [ah]
how old is she now
but the around
(oo)
I think more the the the the over sixty five [lah]
definition of
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will
no fresh air I'll be like
lonely at least we go out where you'll get to people watch you know
just watch people walk
and
I I enjoy people watching honestly so I can relate to your grandma
(oo) that I like the question (mm)
(um) I
think [kan] I would
probably would love
love
to
just
(um)
around
okay [ah]
paris area
london because
is it so rushing
I have heard a lot of people saying that
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know (um)
ya [lah] but that's my goal [lah]
just
ya you how about you
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit [lah]
it's just too fast pace but
but
ya [lah]
and like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control [kan]
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
(mm)
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated [what]
in certain way
but
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
S_M_U
I mean that's good [lah]
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
like
[eh] okay
but like
ya [lah]
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
[oh] I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so (um) and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
meant to be
that's why I believe [lah] so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
[oh] man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
then I
kept up
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
!wah! a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
[oh] my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that S_M_U is a good school
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
intake
but #inshallah#
I mean like you can I can [lah] I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya [lah] you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can [lah]
and S_M_U is good because you are taking full time right
answer me

ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
but
okay [lah] I mean there are so many expectations of us
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
but
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't ex~
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about [lah]
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
in singapore
because all those movies are al~
always based on other other countries you know
I don't know like

quite
I can't like I don't have self control

they say they are no longer they are no longer
you know but I thought that they will be like okay like for example I thought peter bush would want to be a professor you know you want to climb the
she's just tired you know
and (um)
I think that's the main reason why they retire
[eh] even at that time they were complaining about the millennials right
they both of them have the same complaint
the millennials are so
no we're not we are not we are post millennial we are not millennial
millennial until thirty nine [oh] for you you are millennial I'm not [sia]
I'm a nineteen seventy nine
(uh) I am a generation X [leh]
it's really the you [lah] but you are not the the the the people that #seroja# and #borshak# was saying [lah]
the they were saying that this millennials [ah] lazy you know lazy [ah]
ya
[ah]
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
no she said people the
so
I think ten years [eh] twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even (err) make any profit
(err) around the same price as #seroja#
(uh) (uh)
(uh)
slightly more [lah] or around the same price [lah]
because she already bought a f~ she already got (err) her flat
(err) her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
she want to because she love (err) cycling
I think she wants to cycle near the beach [lah] she doesn't have to
(uh)
ya [lah] but she has wonderful legs [ah]
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around (uh) ten years or so [ah]
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road [eh]
the amber road I'm not sure maybe [ah]
I think I I don't think is a new condo [ah]
(uh) (uh)
(uh) it's new it's new
(uh)
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
and not having to borrow money from the bank
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
[oh] my god sex heaven
condo [kan]
it's very very nice
(uh)
because I thought I I thought she stayed at #serangoon# garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
(uh) (uh)
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
!huh!
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask [lah]
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
especially french so I think it's something that they
(uh)
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very (err) thrifty [lah] [sia]
rent [eh]
(uh)
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
(mm)
that's why she move (uh)
make sense right
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo [lah]
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
so they are a bit different [lah] their their the way they
their upbringing is different right
(uh) distinction [lah] (uh)
ya
they don't necessar~ from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so [lah]
(uh)
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best [lah] the best usually not them [lah]
(uh) I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace [eh]
she he ya
ya
he went to #eton# know that was his socialization [tau]
[oh] I (uh) my father owns a travel agent company
(uh)

but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I I found out that he was educated at #eton# so I was like #eton# then #dasha# was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to (err) the people in #eton# but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the #eton# boys (err) russian [lah]
#eton# is like the boarding school
in U_K in U_K there's a boarding school

(um) like before COVID [lah]
new zea~
ya that was so fun right U_K and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to U_K
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
[ah] K
[oh] okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K [lah] at least you were sort of prepared for it [lah] to happen
I don't know what's nice over there
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it [ah]
like it was like an (um)
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[eh] but K_L okay you can go K_L by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know K_L #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
yes yes definitely need to stop in K_L [lah] like I need my dose of K_L man
[ah]
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
ya
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
ya but if I had to pick
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
ya
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
ya best donuts [seh]
ya
(mm)
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
that was also like a random find right
ya
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[ah] okay okay okay
ya
like you know when we were craving for
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
(mm)
what what what what do you miss
okay okay
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
a pie pie face
ya that was nice also
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
we were so noob man
[oh] and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain [kan] yes yes yes
[eh] it's a once in a lifetime chance [seh] we never know if we are going to pass by that place again [lor]
trying to recall [lah]
(err)
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
enchanted garden or something
no no no it's not luge
fifty [eh]
fifty sing [ah]
[ah] okay [eh] what what else was it that we did over there
ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then (um)
ya I just remember that that thingy [ah] what is it called [ah]
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to [lah] [eh] but the beaches there were nice [eh]
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
ya at U_K did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
(mm) we really miss the nature [ah]
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya [eh] but malaysia nature not bad [leh] actually
ya
(mm)
no [lah] you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya but okay [lah] I mean like okay #langkawi# has nice beaches
okay [lah] it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can [ah] while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have (uh) know two thousand maybe
wait what did you go to spain for
[oh]
[eh] but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
and then
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare [ah]
!huh!
so basically you were ca~ trying to catch your train (err) trying to catch your flight you mean
serious
[oh] my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
(mm)
okay okay and like the timing wise
okay no cash on hand [lah] you mean
okay
(mm) (mm)
(uh huh)
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
[oh] I see like how much it's supposed to cost [ah]
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
[oh] !wah! were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him [lah]
(mm)
start of an adventure [eh]
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
[eh] wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
ya ya like (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
(mm)
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
(mm)
okay

is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
I see I see
yup
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never en~ encountered this before so
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the emplo~ employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay

[a'ah]
[a'ah]
add ons
[oh] give away
don't you think so like with COVID like
it was january february march COVID
november december
(um) I think I wanted to go to new zealand
ya new zealand [ah] most
fully because it was in a tour
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
there are shared memories together [ah]
[oh] berry van [eh]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to U_K ya
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
and ya [lah] so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my f~ back then [lah] my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the old~ eldest or one of the oldest
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya (um) and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
[ah] despite my aunts' protestations
and ya [lah] so he jump [ah] he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply [lah] [kan] you got there
and once you are done ya [lah] I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
ya
actually for new zealand (um)
the year that I went
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
(err)
[eh] did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
[ah] was that the first time I felt snow
(err)
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun [lah]
is that
the malls closed at five P_M so you imagine [eh]
ya
K [lah] how chocolate is the best [lah]
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
[ah] apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
!woo! #shiok# [ah]
wilsons promontory
dapat
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food [ah] [kan]
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
(err)
ya
(um) you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
(um) you can even decide on the spot that !hey! I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I just gonna shoot straight for K_L
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
wanna drive all the way (um)
what they do is they drive
to #penang#
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border [oh] you see
so to me
then the other alternative is fly to
#krabi# or fly to #phuket#
ya
ya
true but then I felt that okay [lah] I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience [lah] of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship [lah] [kan]
cabin cabin
ya
it wasn't that bad
no [lah] I guess when it got
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm [lah]
[ah]
[oh] ya
ya I think supermarkets overseas [ah]
(um) there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
because they are the producers [ah] that's why
[ah] meat so fresh
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
true
even the ice cream is different
okay
because you have a variety to choose from [ah]
much more predictable in that sense
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
quite common
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
(mm) ya
and the best donuts in the world
[eh] do you notice
it could be ya
we ordered the the bombolinis [lah] the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
(um)
and
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique (um) overflowing
so they were oozing out and okay [lah] I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world [lah]
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya [oh] and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
plantains [eh]
did they grill that one grill [kan]
I think it was grilled and then they put (um) brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that [ah]
ya that one
[eh] there was something that I thought about (um) [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] (um) london (um)
the devil brownies [ah]
ya that was a random find [ah] no we went to that
that weekend market
(um) I wouldn't say it's a random find [lah] because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
[ah] correct
where aspiring business owners visit this there (err) these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons [ah] so these dragons are
(um) so ya she pitch her brownies to them [ah]
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
(err) she used that as part of her advertisement [lah]
[ah] but I really good are really really good
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
[ah] noodle oodle (um) that's just
soup [ah]
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the P_F_C paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
K imagine nandos [ah] so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
[ah] the price the price is way cheaper than nandos [ah]
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab [ah]
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
[ah] yes
[eh] the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name [ah] a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice [ah]
ya what else [ah]
what else was nice that we have
[oh] buffet that that buffet was power
[eh] that was a nice chance upon [ah]
that was not in our initial plan [lah] because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
(um) ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay [lah] it's a saving grace [lah]
it's a saving grace because I think
(um) those ya that jacket potato was nice
ya it was milkshake and skittles [ah]
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian [lah] at least [oh] that was some nice jacket potato
ya
that's true
[kan]
ya cheaper [lah] ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands (err) on prada
understand [ah] it's still thousands [eh]
B I C E S T E R bicester
yes
somewhere near the south
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
okay [lah]
so far none so far the three of our major trips
we have there are this this three major [lah] the U_K and the two australia
[ah]
[oh]
(err)
slide down the slope ya
best [ah]
fifty
(mm)
[oh]
ya
the beaches (err) jog my memory again where did we go
[oh] sydney ya bondi
I think we did
portsmouth
ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay [lah] I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia
(um)
[oh] [oh] ya ya ya
[ah]
but it's hot [ah]
that's true
that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have (err)
two thousand let me recall [ah] when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
(um) we went to travel around the areas [lah] so we went to spain (um)
specifically we went to madrid [lah]
so (err) I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
(mm) ya
(um) I think you really have to plan
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
so I remember there was one (um)
so when we reach belgium
(um) we thought that the bus station (uh) at that belgium to the airport was quite near [lah]
only for us to realise that actually
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely [ah]
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
(um)
ya
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour [lah] but sixty kilometres away ya [kan] so it's still quite a distance
forty five minutes to get there [ah]
this was the start [lah] almost the start I think ya
so we negotiated [lah] we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind [ah] he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind (err) I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros [lah] basically
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation [kan]
and then by the time we reach there he
(uh) maybe three quarters [ah]
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got [lah] and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed [lah] maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey [ah]
run into I
I think the high~ I won't say highlight [lah] but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
ya and (uh) I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you [lah]
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid [lah] [ah] but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
(err) I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think [ah]
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
[ah] so [dah] happy happy
ya that was that was an
ya
[oh] I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
no
ya
so
no
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each [ah]
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it [ah]
ya
power [ah]
ya that's why
ya
ya
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
[ah] like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
ya
[ah] yup
true
who came up to us
say #assamualaikum# and started to (err) to talk to us in malay
so we talk to him when quite further in he said [oh] actually yes he's bangladeshi
for
working [ah] so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then (um) you know went back went to spain to work [lah]
ya working overseas is something
okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months [ah] of exchange in canada
that was a clo~ I wouldn't say there's even that even came close [ah] but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome [ah] to the point that I felt that !hey!
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both [ah]
okay so (um) when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
(um) the M_S_A or the muslim students association they were quite
(um) vibrant and there are very active [lah]
so (um) I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them [lah]
because when I were went there also (um)
it coincided with the fasting month
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short [ah]
so ya
!wow!
[oh] interesting
(um)
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
there [lah] almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
okay
(mm)
but when it comes to chicken or duck
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(um)
[ah] mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
is
if I were to be a vegan
and mama
(mm)
(mm)
vegan
is is there a certain
(mm)
(mm)
I
don't have anything

(mm)
(mm)
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
(mm)
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
[ah]
(mm)
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
(mm)
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature [lah]
(mm)
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
very personal because
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
(mm) (mm)
I don't have any other interest
and the new age #plato#
(mm)
okay
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called [ah] the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
(mm)
the difference
I want to go to greece again
(mm)
[oh] in addition to that scandinavian countries
[oh] ya ya
sweden

K [lah] hopefully next time
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
euro centric okay my apologies
(mm)

(mm)
running [eh]
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours !wow!

the whole two thousand twenty one [eh] two thousand twenty
(mm)
and
(mm)
okay [lah] if if you could
be your younger self
(mm)
you know what do you have against schools [ah]
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
but for you most of that internet [lah] [kan]
I think that will help a lot
[ah]
(mmhmm)
this [one] is the beginning okay
(mm) very anti climactic
okay [lah] I like new beginnings (um)
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
[oh]
(mm)
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
in a way
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
(um)
and
you have yourself and people around you
this year
so you
institution
religion
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mm)
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
(mm)
(mm)

(mm)
[ah] [ah] I wish I wish we can talk about something new [lah] (mm)

ya
that one is sofitel is at #tanjong pagar#
very near [what] the hotel I mean I mean you can go I mean it's around cit~ there's a lot of cafes there also [what]
ya
ya I think it's all nearby there [lah]
ya technically I don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon [lor]
yup
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year I guess
ya [lor]
ya [oh] ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so I might have to take leave ya
but then I think I'll take the whole week [lah] I see how [lor] technically I got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya [oh] ya last year we had the what
ya no but whenever #tanjong pagar# theme
don't know
I don't know O_L [lah] maybe O_L theme
[oh] ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
ya
[oh] really [ah]
from which (err) supermarket
ya
#sheng siong# #sheng siong# also hard [sia]
I mean you see my area around down here there's no #sheng siong# the nearest is #bukit panjang# mall
giant [lah] since we just with brandon
[eh] last year we did giant
!aiya!
[eh] N_T_U_C ya ya N_T_U_C
so what
ya I remember the cause I think N_T_U_C got more things to buy
(mm)
who's the free one [ah]
can you plan
please
you have to be codes
this is not chinese new year
dinner
but now buffet very irritating [ah]
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
(mm)
is it I there's only one buffet town I think it's at raffles city
I know
[oh] ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
[oh] ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
okay
[oh] ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that [lah] they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
ya
different timing
ya
can
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely [lah] I mean you cannot meet [lah] but
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
[oh] ya just five of us [lah]
without partners [lor]
(mm)
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us [what]
korean ya that [ah]
#farin# birthday
[oh]
[oh] yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners [lor] that
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya okay
ya
(um)
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work [lah]
ya
(mm)
ya [lor]
monday right
is it really
ya
[oh]
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
!hais!
okay [lor] we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
then he say it's like seven hundred [oh] my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred [sia]
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
you are in a cold room
!whoa! but luckily I went taiwan [sia] just before lockdown
ya
(err) not as good as that one we we went that time
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
!hais!
!hais! ya
ya
[eh] but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
T_P_E
(um) ya
but you know the that time the who say [ah] which minister
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably [lah] elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations [lah] wait those are compulsory right
ya may~ maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel [lah]
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
was there [lah] [oh] my god
(mm)
(err) they have another issue to tackle there [oh] my god
(mm)
are you talking about succulent
[oh]
the normal one cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
(mm)
[oh] I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what [sia] cardboard
[oh] what
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
!hais! anyway I have an assignment on an essay [lah] so I need just (err) your your point of view [lah] I guess
(mm) it's about (um)
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
why
(mm)
ya
true [leh] ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
(mm)
ya
(mm)
good [what] lockdown good [what] I was enjoying the C_B period
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems [lah] rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
[oh]
ya
(mm)
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are entertile~ but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel [lah] like always been pushing
S_M_E all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation [lah] so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway (err)
ya [lah] #alhamdulillah# I need the money so what's the problem
to avoid this (err) to convert their platform store into online platform [lah] so
(mm)
true I mean you will lose your human touches also [lah] right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of H_B_B now like because of a lockdown so I think
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
(err)
I think it brings families together
kind
that's all [lah] like
so
ya
I know
not every family can get along [lah] hundred percent get along so
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one !wah! then
ya
right ya
(mm)
ya obviously
ya
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during C_B it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better [lah] because you know carbon footprints were reduced [lah] I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit [lah] of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight [lah] like just
ya
ya
ya
okay [lah] at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress [lah] I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit [leh]
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
(mm)
ya
maybe they did [lah] like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
not counsellors [lah] what what is it calling
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
ya
(mm)
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes [lah] but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya [eh] can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society [lah] I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case [lah] on the rise during C_B
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water [one]
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito [one]
it's true okay [lah] but that's not really a problem I guess
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the la~ the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down [lah]
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel [lah] at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot [leh]
is it
aren't we not at the top
[oh] we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest [lah]
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to [lah] but it's not possible [lah] per se
[oh] my god
[oh] that one that they kill all the animal [ah] but cause the one all is affected in~ infected with the coronavirus [what] ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
they have to kill all the the chickens [mah]
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
yes
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya inside the middle [ah]
(uh huh)
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese (err) [ah] swiss cheese plant
stop it [lah]
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the me~ at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times [leh]
what is a prayer plant
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but monstera is an indoor plant [what] right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
(mm)
ya
ya
technically they are bushes [lah] weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
not really [leh]
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt [leh]
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer [lah] but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
(err) the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk [leh] like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also [what] light can [ah]
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
can [ah]
ya probably can [lah] I don't know
I don't know it just grows short [lah] from small to big [lah] I guess shoots ya
!hais!
no [oh] my god that one
no [meh]
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
[ah]
(mm)
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office (uh) condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
!aiya! very the
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
(mm) [oh] my god
(mm)
!hais!
(mm)
spray is it then
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
(mm)
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also [what] if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
(mm)
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
(mm) ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die [sia]
(hmm)
[oh] my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough [lah] too much plants [ah] mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant [eh]
[oh] no
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
it's like a fern anyway
!hais!
you don't have class so what you gonna do tomorrow

(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not dis~ not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
(uh)

I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
(mm)
ya
ya [lah]
ya
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
(um)
you know what I think I want to talk about our house
you know we started off from here
and it became like one
ya
ya
ya
not no what I'm saying is this is is is not that it is
if is small I mean it is
I would have imagined it to be slightly bigger but it is not
you know
no no no I just wanted to
the only [lah] but the buttons ge ge which is good [lah]
ya but it's okay it's not that bad
ya
ya honestly
I was kinda glad that the
me
I choose it
I wanted the the
are you sure
(hmm)
iran
you know it was an option that you know that I didn't even pick you picked it
you know and I thought it was just interesting you know because I've never been to iran and the idea was just intriguing
I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like (mm) ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was
ya ya ya ya ya that [one] was nice that was really really nice you know when we woke up in the morning and then
(um) we we woke up in the morning and then you know there was a whole sunlight and everything
so that was really nice and
(mm) where they were that was really really very nice and then (um)
you know it was just interesting it's just that I think it was an it was a really unfortunate when when when we went #tehran#
we didn't have a guide like what we had (uh) in #isfahan# and #yazd#
[eh] no no no we didn't have #yazd# it's #shiraz# sorry ya
but
ya [lah] we didn't have a guide [lah]
would have been nice [lah] if we had a guide [ah] but we didn't have a guide
ya
no the that point of time I was I wasn't I was freelancing so I had a lot of time
!huh!
ya ya he had a wedding to go to
okay so that was the most interesting trip
but what was the most memorable trip
but you went to #bordeaux# so many times
[oh] ya
(mm)
cranny
(mmhmm)
(uh) #biarritz#
no yes we did we went to biarri~ #biarritz# we went to #cannes#
yes
and then we went to #biarritz#
ya and then we went to #arcachon# ya
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pep~ pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
I'm about to really go dri~ deep
yes ya
yes
[eh] no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
(mmhmm) okay
why
(uh huh)
[ah] okay
(uh huh)
(uh)
(um)
design
(uh)
(um)
accounting
accounting
accounting ya
so that I can become an electrician so that I can fix my own things
you know
and I I think those three skills would be
most
(uh) would be most useful
I believe
okay
okay
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
okay
(uh)
(uh)
(uh) talented
I have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)
(uh)
ya tom holland
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay (um)
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) wheth~ how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
(um)
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes woul~ okay what I find such studies very interesting because they alw~ like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to feed~ you have to you have to understand because
nec~
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as m~ as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this conversa~ is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
and
ya
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
okay cleaning done !wah!
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
yes
ya
[ah] [oh]
we can go later we can go tomorrow
yup
okay so okay
ya
I kinda like it though
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
okay
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
(um)
(uh)
I can eat that I think for every single meal
you know
it is such a perfect meal it is not a balanced meal
but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
okay
I love it so much in fact
ya
ya but back to our house I actually cannot believe that you know that this is going to be our place
just
you know the wall
actually I was thinking [ah] like dining area
or just this wall
just this wall
the store wall
okay [lah]
okay [lah] just leave it plain [lah] then I can put paintings
no [lah] I honestly I I don't like [lah] I mean like

four bars
[oh] my god the parking the parking can pay off my bike instalment babe I swear
is still the best option if you're still just a couple
I don't think I can sustain a fucking car
it's crazy

[oh] my god babe that's a lot of money [sia]
it's not it's how can a person like how can if you want talk about economy right how can you put (uh) a company's precedence over an individual
like you want to say that [oh] because company also need t~ need to earn money how can you put that over a an in~ individual's loss
they never even spend anything
there were no losses
nothin~ ya tha~ you didn't get any of the products
!wah! I will angry [sia]
ya
[oh] you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
(err) like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him [lah] he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like [oh]
just like
I think it's quite cute [lah] like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right (um) the last girlfriend [ah] he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you ca~ do you want to be my girlfriend I was like [oh] so like i~ to him it means a lot [lah] that he ask me then I was like [orh] okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
(um) also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with #hassan#

but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like [ah] loose threads or like (uh) consequences on some like those aftermath of me and #hassan# that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with #aqil# and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with #aqil# I want to be with #aqil# only and not have like [oh] this is because of #hassan# that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about #hassan# like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
take care of himself
I think so [ah] because like he was a great boyfriend [sia] babe only things m~ things messed up after the relationship
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year [ah]
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way [sia] babe like
like the thing with #hassan# all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet #aqil# and this is going to happen
ya
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time [ah] babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and #aqil#
okay

cause you were still with #audi# and then like we went out remember you me #hassan# you me #hassan# #audi# ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
the~ like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so [eh] babe
(uh) like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like (um) cold like he's very (err) like
a~ [ah] very action [ah]
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like h~ he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like (uh) when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then (err) he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder [ah] like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
be someone that they're not
then their true form comes out !wah! scary [ah]
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
[ah]
okay
like that would be
babe thailand the best place ya
[oh] ya you went with your family right
that's nice
I tell my parents I go with you
!huh!
[ah] [ah]
[oh] right
ya not your thing okay okay I get it
[oh] my god
#bangkok# is it
I think it's #bangkok# right
like
sorry
no [lah] I think you you and simon should have your time first
you guys should go #bali# [sia] babe
no like #bali# is is accepting like tourists at the end of the year
so you should like
[eh] they have they have like private villas with pools and like nice vi~ nice ass views and the food's pretty good I think you should check it out
it's just like for maybe like three nights [lah] you just have time for each other
just #lepak# with each other
[oh] my god they're gonna transcribe this t~
ya like typing it out like okay so #miza# (um) said she and #aqil# colon
[oh] right we can like
ya
I think it'll be fun
then [ah]
[ah] ya the the they were in the lot and then like #aqil# saw them then #aqil# was like [eh] and then he park near th~ th~ near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like (err) Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
!huh!
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
like his jealousy
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
#firdaus# is an idiot
ya
you know
we got seven more minutes
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce #aqil# to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the ba~ he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to d~ like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like [oh] my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like #aqil# like morals also questionable
like he [ah] he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who d~ who do that also
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
ya
ya
right
(mm)
your mum
ya
[eh] how's your mum is she okay
(err) I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
(uh)
most likely early next year
or mid next year
but I told him [ah] like my C_P_F is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like [oh] no [lah] but like he wants to
then I say it's fine (um) like we can like plan [lah] like
try to understand and see other people's view [ah] like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with
alright
(uh) overstay my welcome is because I think it's too too long [lah] it should be
yes and then after that I I you know many many a time I told her that okay I'm never coming back but in the end I still come back you know that kind of thing [lah] you yes (err) so the the the the very interesting thing that I realise that when I came back

[ah]

yup yup yup
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective (uh) a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think (uh) it's quite it's it's something that (uh) there I I would I would (um) and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn [lah]
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
for me
[oh] right
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
[oh] definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
[ah] no no it was a academic (uh) more of a academic kind of (uh) mistake [lah] (uh) I mean it was a academic (um) how to say [ah] misstep which which I could have my my my (um) my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science [ah] which means then after that (err) the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was (uh) just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six [ah] I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit [ah] when I was in J_C I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis [ah] so I had to remove my appendix because (err) it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had (err) not (err) what (err) gone to the hospital [lah] (uh) if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication (uh) in which this this (uh) operation actually made my stomach lining weak
(uh) because they have to cut they have to cut through [mah] so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my (err) my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another [lah] basically so it was first it was an appendix then (uh) it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical [eh] in a medical sector your intestines (uh) usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
(uh) apparently that can be fixed okay (err) and and basically what happens is (uh) if you fix it (uh) generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
this this this this (uh) this condition but (um) the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and (uh) hopefully hopefully [lah] [ah] cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again [lah]
!huh! this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was (uh) in the U_S you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the U_S because I joined the university that is (err) (err) specifically flying related
so (uh) they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day (uh) but I was in the U_S and it was this time when I was in the U_S that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying [lah]
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
am I still what
in that in that in in in that [ah] [oh] debt (uh) I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the U_S correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them (uh) [ah] no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate (uh) site I was actually doing (uh) business business aircraft when I was in the U_S
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
yes so when COVID happened (err) this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad (err) I mean it was just a very bad timing [ah] it was the worst hit industry ever (uh) unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and (uh) they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old [lah] so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again [ah]
to the parts [ah] they get (uh) they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
(uh) some of them they do but most of them for the most part (err) they don't need right they just they juts leave them there [lah] they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there [ah] nobody wants to (uh) you know [ah] then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this [lah] you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be [lah]
[oh] man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of (uh) of the airplane graveyard over in the U_S ya they have they have one in the U_S they have one in australia you know they have a lot [lah] this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was (uh) it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay [lah] so I thought it was (uh) it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did [lah] and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
but but for now (uh) I got the next best thing which is (uh) flying drones [lah]
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers [eh]
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen [ah] but if that ever happens [ah] you will know why [ah] you know all about the history behind it [lah] you can tell people [oh] yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya [lah] yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know [oh] my goodness

why I scared to be bankrupt because I don't want to owe people money
[ah] but then a lot of things are restricted like you cannot (uh) apply for your own home you cannot invest
[ah] but if you're somebody with a home and if you are declared bankrupt then they will take away their home [what] no [meh] not true [eh] is it [oh] I didn't know I thought they will take why all your your earthly belongings and your possessions
(oo)

white stands for purity okay then

I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
like have to make sure like they are comfortable with non aircon area

to work somewhere that have aircon or like a fan [lah] at least
then after that
okay so
(um) okay there's no aircon so are you sure you're okay with it
okay at least it's like is there any like fan or something like cause it's a guard post [what]
so obviously there's fan
like how how rude is that like I just want to know if there's aircon [eh]
if there's fan since you said is non aircon and it's open space so obviously
they must install like fan [what]
I doubt it will open
ya I miss I miss going there then like talking to the kids even though they are annoying
but I don't miss the managers
sorry [ah] like
ya that voucher
but you got use or not
[oh] ya [ah]
but you can ask him to follow you [what]
right
you can ask him to
ya [lah]
can [what]
[ah]
then
ya
true
like starting okay maybe the first first few weeks
like know each other like know what are they supposed to do
like that's what I realised [lah]
ya so
after
ya ya
that's why so
to go out
you never ask [ah]
[oh] my god okay
so right okay
ya okay so
okay (err) when I started (um)
maybe
ya last two weeks
okay okay so [kan] actually
ya okay so
(err) sarah said it's obvious [lah] and then I was like what do you mean it's obvious
then she said (um) most most of the time if you go out with your friends you will say the name
but then today you just said yo~ you going out then I was like !huh!
what's mama's problem [lah] what like why she keeps on calling us like
she said curfew at one so why are you like bothering us around twelve
dude like our curfew is at one
but then you act as it you are the sp~ sp~ (err) special child you know like
(mm)
like mix of both so like there's bad and good [lah]
like it's #zeko's# story but then how come #zeko#
told #aisha# then end up like mama know you know
!huh! okay then I was so pissed
so I went to expose one of #aisha's# secret [lah]
then after I exposed then after that (err) my mum was like
illegal gathering [lah] then I was like okay whatever
(err) #mariam# did you tell mama that
then she was like (err) #mizi# told me
so apparently she go text #aisha# [eh] she go text sarah she said
why must she tarnish my name by saving her boyfriend's name
technically it's your fault because you started the topic first
it's just #zeko's# ranting to you then end up you have to tell mama about it
how to say [ah] like she always talks about her friend's problem but then she don't talk about her problem
she
she go use my C~ C_D_G
like
I will throw your nike inside the water
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
(err)
!huh!
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
cause
I I won't say it's okay [ah] but
I don't know [lah] I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay [lor] but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm [one] then
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
no
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and #aisha# our shoe size is not that
like comfortable
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so I really don't know like sarah can use [lah] but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
I mean I have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then
like no thanks later will ruin all the fun because I will complain about my blister and all
ya
one okay I saw two of it what's the another one
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay okay
