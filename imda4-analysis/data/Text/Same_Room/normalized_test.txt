<malay>kau pula kau punya</malay> course <malay>apa</malay> [ah]
I say
if you really like it then
you can start by building up your portfolio now
by like trying all this part time under design media stuff
cause nowadays these days
[kan] <malay>ta~</malay> (um) cause of the time
there isn't much jobs right but then they also calling a lot of design production so you can try to like build up your portfolio
so you can try to like build up your portfolio
because uni all about portfolio [what] so starting from now you can try you know
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>aku nak cari kerja sekarang pun susah</malay>
and then <malay>kalau nak</malay> try under pharmacy <malay>pula dorang punya</malay>
working hours also a bit tough
then
then like (um)
you all need <malay>macam</malay> diploma degree <malay>baru boleh dapat</malay> the experience
so my course a bit tough [ah] I just need to wait until internship [lor]
<malay>aku tengah cari kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang tapi pasal</malay>
COVID [kan]
so
times are tough [ah] so I know for government <malay>pun</malay> they <malay>macam</malay>
they
they retrenched quite a number of people so
a bit tough to find job now even though <malay>macam</malay>
they need people
they also need very quality type of people you know [ah]
#ons# bro if it's like nothing to do with our diploma then okay [lor]
my exam [ah] (hmm)
my exam can [lah] can do by is cause
because COVID [mah] so
everything online and is not paper exam written is all like coursework and assignment then you got oral viva or something like that I don't know [ah] our brand new for because of COVID so like
a bit difficult [ah] or I still don't understand the system a bit
to be honest right H_B_L [ah]
I at home I sleep you know
so like I sleep you know so like cause it's where my comfort comfortable place is [mah] so it's like at home
then near my bed like that then
very easily to just go on my bed and just sleep you know you [leh] you have H_B_L right for the whole semester
I mean slowly if the situation getting better [ah]
some classes is online some classes offline not too bad [ah] but like
if really the whole of my
five days is online [ah] (hmm) bro I just sit at home not even listening I eat at home not even listening to class
teacher go through stuff also I like a bit don't understand but I also don't want be you know in front class unmute then suddenly everybody hear my question
so a bit [lah] I don't think so I can <malay>tahan</malay> [lor]
they don't also really need and not much people also tourist don't have
ask people also don't have want to up the economy [mah] so
if we apply job all then a bit tough [ah]
relate bro is like I swear I got no money then like I keep spending you know all the shopee sale and all
today nine (hmm) got no money bro
possible [meh]
bro got one time
the person [ah] the shopee person
keep going into my house keep knocking my house door like
[eh] <malay>berbual pasal</malay> COVID <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] [eh] <malay>aku dengar</malay> that time <malay>kau kena</malay>
<malay>aku bilang kau aku ada concert satu kat sini</malay>
<malay>satu kat</malay> malaysia
and you know what because of COVID the [one] in singapore got close down first [oh]
cause the singapore issue was more prominent you know
so like
then the other concert was in malaysia
I haven't book ticket for the flight so that's good
but is I already book ticket for the concert itself but got cancelled last minute and then after that cancelled and then immediately don't have the concert anymore so cause of COVID I also cannot watch the concert cause the concert thing is all like close packed right so
what to say [ah]
that [one] is what I miss what I missed the most cause of COVID I want go to concert and all
for both the concert
the [one] in singapore was N_C_T
then the [one] in malaysia was super junior [ah] you know the sorry guy
then [ah]
the [one] in singapore was refunded very fast but the one in malaysia <malay>tu</malay> a bit slow [ah]
cause they want show cancel or not [ah] then they cancel then they refund a bit slow but I got both the refund if I have bought the flight ticket right
malaysia airline won't refund [one]
(hmm)
I think
not much [lor] from singapore to malaysia maybe about one hundred (hmm)
(hmm)
I think right I think you will like got seven
can [lah] can relate my money gone so fast man no job now right cause now [ah] COVID then they do online concert
online concert take so much money also but then after that #sian# [lah] my money all gone [lor]
[oh] same [lah] same [lah] like N_C_T they all like multinational people but then they all cause they train in singa~ train in korea right so all of them in korea [lor] like you know all of them chinese member [hor] you all cannot go back [ah] so they only stay in korea
I think right
I think I'll be homesick [lor] cause [ah] I a bit of a mother's girl so a bit of mummy's girl so like my mother not with me [ah] I think I will like I don't feel comfortable [lor] then I will also definitely enjoy the experience [ah] going overseas and then study you know

maybe KOI <malay>aku dah lama tak</malay> try KOI
<malay>aku tak suka</malay> pearl <malay>dia</malay> [ah] to be honest like I tried the pearl [ah] it's a bit I mean I cannot expect [lor] cause their pearl is not the high end kind of pearl right so (uh) I just anyhow [ah] but like I buy also I a bit scared to try the pearl or like the normal bubble tea [lor] I always try you know last time the one year of secondary school there like the bubble tea is the milo blended [ah] ice blended or something like that [ah] small like that [lor]
#shiok# bro #shiok# I tell you my favourite drink [ah] is horlick cause of that I cannot stop drinking horlicks [ah] I tell you is like !wah! out of the place [eh] my favourite drink now so like !wah! thinking about my school food [ah] !oof! now [ah] got <malay>halal</malay> #mala# also in one of the food court so not bad [ah] then their #mala# also not bad is just that the disappearing chicken the chicken keep every time we buy the big chicken [ah] suddenly come out [ah] after they make for us the chicken only left like three four pieces [eh] then we don't know where it go
then in another of our food court got like this one like food [ah] I think this other poly also have is like (um) Indomie !wah! Indomie <malay>goreng</malay> that [one] the best bro that [one] like my go to that one [ah] with horlicks !oof! me and my friend every day right every day buy that meal then you [leh] what's your favourite food in school

I saw their McDonald's cone is seventy cent
actually (uh) I never really properly by iris only follow my friend maybe I should try one day then you [leh]
I think standard [ah] I think all poly also got subway and cheers also if I'm not wrong you school got cheers
I also know your school quite big then how [ah] if you late to school or like you #swee#swee# you just [ah] you know five minute before school you reach then how [ah] you confirm late or not
actually not really [ah] honestly if I late to school then my my class at the end of the school [ah] only take me about ten~ five minute to reach there so I can like speed walk then I can just reach earlier but it's quite space [ah] got a lot of big spaces [lor] but better [ah] than it being cramp I guess so like not too bad [ah] but still small [ah] but like spcious also to say the least if I'm not wrong also my school the smallest poly right
no [ah] #nanyang#nanyang# bigger then then my school
honestly right (um) my first few days of school [ah] my first few weeks I cannot make it but then like afterwards like okay already [lor] (uh) but then like (uh) how to say [ah] your my school (um) some food court they two different lifts must take right specifically that [one] I a bit confusing [ah] and then the one behind my school is just the sports C_C_A centre so that [one] only if you got like C_C_A if you got like P_E like that [ah] like S_N_W then you go there [lor]
!wah! but then the downside of it right I must always wear my jacket cause it's so damn cold [leh] like I swear I don't wear jacket right I confirm I want like shiver till damn bad I tell you but then after lunch [ah] somehow [ah] the aircon a bit [leh] <malay>sekali</malay> become hot but maybe because of window open [ah] then that's why the sunlight a bit strong at that period of time
(hmm)
sometimes ya [ah] cause like we want the space to study right after school [ah] cause we need the school wi-fi then [lor] all those kids there already book table then they make noise then they stay there until quite late [ah] then they play their game I don't know league of legend or mobile legend [lor] then they take up the space in (um) in the library [eh] then we cannot sit there to study cause they take the space already [what] they we cannot tell them (uh) excuse me we need the table [mah] so just have to <malay>tahan</malay> [lor] like !wah! [leh] then like the tables we need right then we no choice we just sit on the floor [ah] sit on the floor also a bit cause no charging port then laptop die [ah] G_G [ah] this kids [ah]
(um) honestly cause of COVID right people will kick you out even if we are students right they don't allow us to like stay there so they like they say got one time the I saw the security uncle tell the person you over here what you want do you got school or not then the person then the student was like no I want study then you should study at home [ah] the uncle was damn rude [eh] then cause the person was taking quite some time to pack right then he was like what you waiting for christmas is it !wah! like this security uncle cannot say nicely [meh] COVID already then like be understanding [ah] we understand you got superiority but like
(hmm) cannot [ah] I think they will be stopped at the entrance I think like cause they wear uniform already [mah] then I don't think so they can go in so like I don't know I don't even think so they can cause nowadays when I go back to school some times I don't see them like coming over also then like I think it's (um) a rule for them to go back home afterwards I don't know but either way also the place is crowded [lor] cause got student want to use the wi-fi for H_B_L [mah] ya
ya but like our table not so far apart (um) like they put us five people per table but like how to say [ah] (um) they so one metre also the table but then now five people per table without the one metre ruling [mah] that [one] a bit [ah] cause my teacher sometime don't know if it's true or not so they ya but then also cause of the five people per table one metre away right my teacher also a bit more careful I guess but like [ah] don't know [ah] it's just a bit [lor]
(um) sometimes it cannot be helped [ah] because like M_R_T is M_R_T [mah] then everybody need to use it need to take it for to travel to paxes cannot expect them take Gojek and all the transport [mah] so like (um) sometimes cannot take it [ah] cannot be helped so like M_R_T public transport cannot be helped [ah]
a bit scared [ah] but like I said cannot help it like I a bit scared cause I live with my grandmother so it's (uh) the thing is more contagious to them you know more higher risk for them so sometimes I a bit scared [leh] but most of the time so you just go home you straight away bathe [lor] don't interact with other people I think that's the best ting to do [lor]
see uni cannot go out she every time got chance she go out you know how old people are you know how they are they cannot sit still [one] the always want go out like that then like most of time we tell her cannot [ah] cause a bit far the places she want to go like her sister's house at #bedok# [eh] a bit far then her sister also want bring her go mall and stuff but then my grandmother also a bit [ah] cause she you know got the safe entry all right then she like a bit lazy she don't know how to do the safe entry [mah] she find it very
ya [lah] typical she doesn't like to take bawa~ unless like she late [lor] then she take Gojek [lor] or she take grab
no [ah] it's actually me I help her book then she just pay [lor]
nowadays got not much work from home [ah] but then rest of my family members all work like my sister now she in camp [ah] then the rest all is (um) cannot work from home [ah] so my mother my parents they go to work physically to you know earn the bucks
but I say [ah] she a bit lazy to go out cause got the safe entry thing then like nowadays also I got nothing to do [mah] so I sit at home with her then entertain her then now she at home she look at new recipe right then she make it all then all the <malay>makanan</malay> now right very different it's like post COVID like suddenly she add on I don't know what bunch of ingredient [ah] inside then all the <malay>masakan lauk yang dia buat</malay> [kan] <malay>semua macam</malay> different so <malay>macam dia ada</malay> add extra ingredient <malay>kau tahu tak</malay>
<malay>lebih sedap ada</malay> [ah] <malay>tu memang</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> standard <malay>tapi</malay> different <malay>tu</malay> different it's all <malay>macam</malay> [ah] how to say [ah] modified [ah] I guess
(uh) I actually don't mind [ah] cause she make food [mah] so I just eat whatever she cook [lor]
(hmm) [oh] I like soup [ah] so like my favourite will always be <malay>sup daging ataupun sup ayam</malay> but then <malay>sup ayam</malay> she <malay>tak buat sangat</malay> [ah] cause she say like a bit <malay>susah</malay> so <malay>tak tahu</malay> but ya
the thing is right she like she cook in the morning [ah] she cook in the morning I sleep you know then I wake up she finish cooking already even like sometimes she want to make the snacks [ah] I don't know if you got try before <malay>kuih keria</malay> !wah! that [one] I help her and stuff like pudding and stuff ingredient all I help her buy [ah] cause that's the least I can do [mah] then Sheng Siong also a bit pity on her [ah] to go down buy stuff so I might as well just buy for her [lor]
<malay>dekat tu dekat</malay> [ah] <malay>jauh pun jauh</malay> cause I in the inside I the most inside the neighbourhood [mah] so to go out it's a bit troublesome also take like about fifteen minutes like that
walk [ah] don't want waste money buying~ don't want waste money buy [ah] <malay>apa</malay> sometimes take bus [ah] if I lazy want go home like that [ah] I take bus but other than that I walk [ah] walk faster
actually <malay>tak</malay> I go <malay>seorang</malay>
ya cause fast game [ah] just touch and go so I just go there then come back then like that [lor]
if I go school right I just buy something for breakfast then I go home to eat my grandmother lunch I don't like you know (uh) eat outside so that's the good thing [ah] I get to save money like that
!wah! then especially are especially [hor] they tax you see what they could !wah! kung fu aunties anticipate at their excited one ya [ah] anyways [ah] I think it's time to let go I think we are done catching up I think
nevermind give this person some time [ah] cause COVID [mah] then the business never go up at least give them some money you know
ya serious [ah] whatever [lah] okay [lah]
<malay>kau buat apa</malay> the whole day

celebrities
who are getting divorced

(uh) is a guy one is a girl
then (um) I know #Puteri# (uh) which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
(uh) divorce right
it really shows that
maybe #Syamsul# did something [ah] but I don't know [seh]
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like (um)
marriage and everything
and then actually (uh) on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick [eh] but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
!wah! if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
at that point of time <malay>yang aku rasa macam</malay> !wow! he found the one
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
[seh] like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore

<malay>kalau</malay> I Bella I <malay>pun</malay> maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
of loving someone who is
toxic
ya they got back together I think time <malay>bulan ramadan</malay> I think they got back together that which make me feel <malay>macam</malay>
why but then bella was saying like [oh]
don't [ah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] judge and everything then I was like (oo) okay
ya
ya
ya ya
actually that time I <malay>terserempak dia</malay> then when I saw him right
I feel I don't feel (um)
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel <malay>kesian</malay> cause he looks very like
(um) scared but he put up a very like brave front like he got everything under control
ya
(mm)
but I think it's also because (um) he
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the way his work is
cause that time I know [ah] <malay>dia kena tangkap pergi</malay> karaoke <malay>dengan</malay> like other girls
I mean the other girls were like not even
(um) saying sorry or anything
[oh] your hair
(um) I don't know [seh] I think you should just
<malay>buat kot</malay> cause like
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya I mean no harm trying [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> if you <malay>tak</malay> try then you'll never know what
ya so you should just go for it [ah]
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya
but then tomorrow right it's just like from ten to
[ah]
from ten to ele~ [eh]
from ten to twelve I have like (uh) group consultation then from twelve onwards is (um) ten minute consultation with my professor then after that [dah] <malay>balik</malay>
ya
but I have a lot to do so
no [lah] like I can <malay>balik</malay> but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> I got like <malay>macam</malay> this whole like deadline to do and like reflection due on wednesday
(uh) should be <malay>kat rumah</malay> [lah] cause <malay>sekolah</malay> like
I don't know anyone there so
the food there is boring
ya there's nothing interesting
ya no fast (err) there's only one halal malay stall which is <malay>ayam penyet</malay>
(uh) okay [lah] but like I feel like S_P food is nicer
[ah] which make me feel so like
ya
I feel so sad cause my school really no don't have not enough food like nice food
but it's okay [lah] cause like most of my classes <malay>dia</malay> online
so <malay>kalau</malay> online then I just
foodpanda or what [ah]
ya
[oh] my dance classes [eh]
(um)
okay [lah] <malay>bila</malay> I first <malay>datang</malay> right
I feel a bit <malay>macam</malay> intimidated
but all of them were nice and although they have prior experience right
they didn't they wouldn't so like
show off kind I mean there's actually one guy who is like you know those like humble brag kind of guy
ya
(mmhmm)
<malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak sabar</malay> I thought that
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>habis kerja</malay> then you don't know what you gonna do with life
then isn't it better
to have like a sense of security <malay>kat sana</malay>
[oh] ya I don't think your colleague are really like the best but okay [lah]
you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
[ah] cause I <malay>rasa</malay> lonely <malay>kat sekolah</malay>
maybe but like I feel that everyone
<malay>macam</malay> cause most of <malay>kita nya</malay> classes online [kan] then <malay>dorang macam kita macam tak ada</malay> that common like bonding for us to make friends and <malay>ni semua</malay>
and then
it's like everyone is so like
studious they are not really
my kind where is like they #chiong# last minute or what
I just feel
so lost
as in I #chiong# last minute but they all very studious like
the example [eh] <malay>macam kau ada</malay> assignment due on week seven
<malay>dorang</malay> [dah] <malay>habis</malay> week
three
or week four
<malay>macam</malay> #kanchiong# <malay>habis</malay>
I don't know [seh]
but ya and then
[oh] did I tell you I met
(uh) our soccer friends
<malay>dorang</malay> actually <malay>kat</malay> S_I_T <malay>sekarang</malay>
[ah] our captain remember
[ah] <malay>nama dia</malay> start with letter L
and <malay>dia punya kawan</malay> (uh) I think <malay>nama dia</malay> start letter B
ya
ya the same place as me [ah]
[ah] my our campus is
[ah] Dover
ya
ya [oh] my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
you know I <malay>nak beli baju daripada</malay> Shein you know Shein
is like a
a website [ah] where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review [ah]
ya and I thought of buying it [ah] cause like
I feel like
I <malay>tak ada baju</malay> [seh] <malay>pergi sekolah</malay>
although I <malay>pergi sekolah dua hari</malay> [jer] every week
(mmhmm)
why fifty dollar quite a lot [what]
[oh]
but I think in your con~
in your like situation <malay>memang susah nak</malay> save [tau] actually
because you only receive like nine hundred [ah] spending money how to save
ya
[eh] I feel that the money that you have
for like <malay>kerja</malay> [kan] is just for you <malay>untuk</malay>
spend for the month
but like maybe okay [lah] not that
direct nine hundred [ah] but like
maybe one hundred you <malay>simpan</malay>
those kind of thing
you know I <malay>rasa macam</malay> this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I've been a snorlax for so long
then <malay>sekarang macam</malay>
<malay>baru bangun</malay>
[dah] <malay>bangun kena kerja keras pula tu</malay>
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
(mm) I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
[orh] for #Anas# [eh]
you know I feel [kan] <malay>untuk</malay> present <malay>kita nak beli</malay> present <malay>untuk lelaki memang susah sebab</malay>
<malay>lelakinya</malay> present <malay>selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu</malay> because <malay>lelaki dorang macam</malay> very practical
ya I mean I feel for #Anas# right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple X_L [eh]
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
cause [eh] I haven't finish <malay>cakap</malay> [lah]
because
<malay>dia tak muat</malay>
okay then <malay>takpe kot</malay>
ya you can buy
can buy him <malay>sabun</malay>
ya I mean if you want it easy then just <malay>baju</malay> [eh] then just (uh) perfume [lah]
(uh) I think it's okay it's just sometimes <malay>dia</malay> very busy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
but at the same time I <malay>rasa dia boleh</malay> [lah]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] I mean
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
that time he met #Dakshah# also <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> free
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even #Dakshah# had to ask him out
(mm)
ya that's true
depends [ah]
(uh) a bit of physics but other than that no
!huh! I very like packed with a lot of things [eh] I got C_C_A I struggling with school <malay>takde</malay> time [ah]
[oh] did mama tell you that
[oh]
but it's really difficult to <malay>ajar</malay> him [seh] cause
(mm)
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also [lah] I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
(um)
parents <malay>dorang tak tahu</malay> tau <malay>yang</malay> actually <malay>macam mana nak</malay> handle <malay>budak-budak</malay> and everything
and then they just like feel <malay>yang cikgu yang akan</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> [kan] <malay>budak-budak punya pelajaran</malay> and stuff but
doesn't work that way you know
[oh] he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
[oh] he did !huh! what did he do
[oh]
that's cute you mean when he was sick he came over
[orh] but how much were you paid per month
!huh! fifty [jer]
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
[oh] my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya [lah] you can say like [oh] you want to help the child everything but !wow!
that progress and also the time spent right
is very taxing <malay>penat</malay> [seh]
I [ah] <malay>boleh</malay>
ya I mean people always <malay>cakap</malay> !alah! P_S_L_E [jer] [pe]
but P_S_L_E really marks where you can go
to secondary and secondary is like <malay>macam</malay>
the place where you
make it or break it [seh]
ya I mean
I'm kind of thankful <malay>yang kita pergi</malay> a secondary school
<malay>yang</malay> not that <malay>macam</malay>
#minahish# and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
!wah! like you can really see <malay>macam mana orang</malay> turn out to be [seh]
and all the <malay>mats</malay> and <malay>minahs</malay> and
the fact that they start smoking even during <malay>macam</malay> lower sec and doing a lot of other things
it's really scary
actually I scared [seh] <malay>sebab</malay> you know (uh) recently I <malay>nampak kat</malay> news [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
(um) the
<malay>budak kecil</malay> right [eh] not <malay>budak kecil</malay> [ah] like just like lower secondary everything
<malay>dorang</malay> (um) they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase [eh] like it's damn
scary [ah] that how young and how brave are you to do that
[oh] primary school <malay>pun</malay>
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it [seh] like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
social media [ah] <malay>macam</malay> TikTok
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever [seh]
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very big matter
and I just <malay>tak faham</malay> [ah] cause like I remember that time
(err) <malay>ada cikgu ni dia datang kat</malay>
me and then <malay>macam cakap</malay> [lah] like [ah] <malay>jangan buat malu keluarga</malay> [ah] <malay>jaga maruah keluarga</malay>
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then <malay>dia macam cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua</malay> then I just feel that (err) they don't really understand
and then they just (um) try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
cause secondary school [kan] <malay>kita tak pernah lambat</malay> [seh] <malay>kita cuma lambat</malay> on the last day of school
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
#Afif# <malay>tak pernah lambat</malay> [ah]
secondary school
[oh] but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
[oh]
[oh] my gosh okay
[ah] why he like that [seh]
you reminded me of our netball coach
<malay>dia pun lagi satu</malay> toxic <malay>nya orang dalam hidup</malay>
how old was she [ah] when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
!wah! early twenties then she act until like that
[oh]
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
cause of her <malay>macam</malay>
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
[oh] when was I there
[oh]
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with [seh]
(mm)
[oh] my god ya it was during like the
(um)
exam [kan]
ya I cannot [seh] <malay>dia</malay> seriously something wrong with her
I mean how we've been overworked
I mean if you realize like those <malay>macam</malay>
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
there were like <malay>macam camne nak cakap</malay> [eh]
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
[oh] I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her [oh] my god
(err)
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma [lah] to be honest
(mm)
(mm) you know I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan] the best coach <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> right was actually my Singapore poly <malay>nya</malay> coach they were really like
so supportive and stuff
and although I <malay>macam tak datang</malay> training <malay>atau</malay> I not that good [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> still never stop believing in me [seh]
and then <malay>dorang</malay> always <malay>cakap macam</malay> [oh] #Ayra# you can do this blah like that
ya
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise [kan] actually <malay>tak</malay> healthy <malay>gila</malay> [seh]

(hmm) let me think
actually
I know that
if I cannot like <malay>macam</malay> give birth or what right
I should be open to having <malay>anak angkat</malay> [ah] cause like
like if especially if my husband wants a child
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel <malay>macam tak</malay> comfortable
ya
ya I <malay>tak</malay> comfortable I think in a way because like
I mean like you can always say [oh] I will treat this as my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
pers~ someone <malay>punya</malay>
that's why
[ah]
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head [ah]
ke~ <malay>kenapa</malay> would you consider
[ah]
ya
I don't know [ah]
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
but would you <malay>nak</malay> sim~ would you <malay>simpan</malay> like cat or whatever pet
you love cats
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can [ah] <malay>pelihara</malay> like
<malay>kucing</malay> when I [dah] <malay>besar</malay> but when I think about it right
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
(mm)
I don't know [seh] it really depends [ah] whether I have time to <malay>jaga</malay> them or not
that's why
[oh] my god actually right last time I <malay>pergi rumah kawan</malay> I cause <malay>dia ada</malay> rabbit
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
and then like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang bising</malay> [tau]
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like H_D_B house all like not
suitable for their environment [ah] it's like why would you keep them there [seh]

I okay with zoo [seh] cause I feel <malay>yang macam</malay>
(uh) ya it's true [ah] <malay>yang dorang patut</malay> be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very similar to those in the wild
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I mean those are just news [lah] I feel that Singapore zoo is like still having some efforts also [what]

(err) <malay>bila</malay> (mm) <malay>jumpa kawan</malay>

<malay>aku rasa</malay> at this point of time <malay>pasal kita orang kena</malay>
<malay>tersekat dekat negeri</malay>
<malay>jadi mungkin aku rasa</malay> that's the best time <malay>untuk</malay> (um) <malay>beriadah</malay> [ah]
<malay>untuk</malay> just do leisure out of
<malay>kau punya</malay> own comfort zone <malay>jadi</malay> this is the best time <malay>untuk kau</malay> come back to <malay>kau punya</malay>
(err) youth <malay>balik ke</malay>

[ah] and <malay>aku rasa</malay> it's a good thing <malay>juga</malay> with this (um)
with this (err) pandemic because
<malay>aku rasa kita</malay> will tend to <malay>macam tahu yang dekat negeri kita</malay> itself
<malay>ada</malay> this <malay>tempat ada</malay> that <malay>tempat ada</malay>
then <malay>kita pun tahu yang macam</malay> okay <malay>kita sudah tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> right now apart from just <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> start to do cycling will start to explore <malay>macam</malay>

open [ah] <malay>lepas tu macam</malay> [eh]
boy [ah] open [ah] <malay>itu macam</malay> that kind of thing [ah]
nonsense [kan]
but this was before <malay>yang</malay> the first phase was the one <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> chance <malay>untuk keluar pun</malay> [kan]
[kan] that first few weeks [kan] at least a month <malay>tak keluar</malay> [kan]
so this phase two <malay>yang</malay> that one month <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kedai-kedai gunting pun</malay>
ya [kan]
ya circuit breaker
like I think we were talking about circuit breaker itself
phase one was later on
yes and then <malay>ada</malay> phase two right
ya so this was <malay>macam</malay> the first
first few days <malay>yang</malay> when <malay>dia orang</malay> announce <malay>tak boleh keluar</malay>
[ah]
okay [ah] (err)
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> was having so much (err) <malay>banyak</malay> (um)
kind of <malay>macam</malay> (err) slowly became <malay>macam</malay>
spending [sia]
<malay>dalam diam aku</malay> did a lot of shopping you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> online shopping which is <malay>aku</malay> never that did that before [ah] but I really did [ah]
and then ya it was really <malay>macam</malay>
like any other day it was just <malay>macam</malay> two dollar <malay>punya</malay> shopee
three dollar <malay>punya</malay> stuff and then every
like every two three days <malay>mesti ada barang datang kat rumah aku</malay> [eh]
but ya [lah] it was really funny that <malay>aku</malay> (err) <malay>ada</malay> that phase [ah]
because <malay>aku rasa tak semua orang tak tahu apa nak buat</malay> [eh]
(mm) I mean being <malay>apa yang engkau nak buat</malay>
and then <malay>kita orang tak ada</malay> that that
<malay>tanah lapang</malay> you know we don't have a big (um)
big land to
to play around to run around
[ah]
<malay>kalau kau nak pergi luar</malay> to check people out <malay>pun macam</malay>
and the road was empty the whole street was lonely
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> that experience was really <malay>macam</malay> best <malay>untuk aku</malay> [ah]
and then because <malay>aku pun ada</malay> at some point of time
(err) during that circuit time <malay>pun aku hantar</malay>
<malay>aku punya</malay> senior <malay>aku punya</malay> dad <malay>dekat hospital jadi</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> saw how the street are lonely
till it go into phase one
and then yes
phase one is when everybody <malay>macam</malay> really <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sudah</malay> come back to <malay>macam</malay> you know
(um) lively [ah]
[ah]
I think <malay>yang dah boleh pergi makan dekat luar kedai-kedai dah banyak buka</malay>
[ah]
but ya
but I think during cir~ (err)
during C_B (err) <malay>apa</malay> (err)
during (err) circuit breaker <malay>punya</malay> time <malay>pun</malay> I think (um)
I did walk around [lah] <malay>macam pergi</malay> mcdonald's then
come back and walk and then I saw the whole thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
!wow!
it was really <malay>macam</malay> almost to
almost to <malay>macam</malay>
being in the eighties <malay>balik</malay> where there is not much people around
(err)
but at the same time <malay>pun macam</malay> lonely <malay>juga</malay>
[ah]
ya
ya
I think it's okay if we are younger
because <malay>kita pun</malay> will be hide inside
you know <malay>macam</malay> it's okay if you're younger
but being an adult
then you cannot do much things and you don't have (um)
a place to go you can't go anywhere
you know and then (um)
and it's a it's almost is almost lockdown [ah] and then ya
<malay>semua benda boleh</malay> change <malay>kalau tak betul-betul le~</malay> you can change you <malay>punya</malay>
perspective you can be
crazy also <malay>juga</malay> [kan]
right I mean
but we are alright with that we~ we've
we've done that with our music life we've we used to be isolations
ya
so ya [lah] but still <malay>pun</malay>
ac~ the effects are there [lah] you know
[ah] the effect and I just <malay>macam</malay> for the
<malay>tak tahu</malay> how it will go on [lah] but I guess
this is one part of our life <malay>yang kita jumpa</malay> [ah] you know
(err) I don't think
it might happen again or it might happen again but <malay>lagi</malay> more [ah]
[kan]
<malay>kerja</malay> [ah] it's not no work you know affected
<malay>aku rasa</malay> it's (err) more of (err)
more of (err) like going through a war

it's <malay>macam</malay> (um)
<malay>macam</malay> (um)
it's <malay>macam</malay>
a smooth war [ah] you know a smooth war that <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kita tak boleh</malay> expect that you know
<malay>kita tak boleh</malay> expect that but we're going through that you know because everyone <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada kerja</malay> or probably <malay>macam</malay>

I was having a conversation the other day <malay>balik pada macam</malay>
[ah] the things that we do
[ah] you know <malay>macam</malay> (err) you know talking about
music in general <malay>macam</malay> (err) the whole world right now is (err) having
or the whole creative <malay>punya</malay> line in the whole wide world is (um)
is (err) not doing very well right
<malay>habis aku</malay> was just (err) <malay>bagi tahu</malay>
(err) #deedee# the other day a friend of <malay>kau tahu</malay> #deedee# [lah] [kan]
so <malay>aku bagi tahu</malay> #deedee# about <malay>macam</malay> you know the rest of the world
(um) especially <malay>macam dekat</malay> U_S and what not
they had an industry and the thing is
<malay>dia orang punya</malay> creative was kind of <malay>macam</malay> stopped right now
and kind of stopped or hibernate at this point of time and it affected them
and the shittiest part about
<malay>kita orang</malay> was that <malay>macam kita orang tak ada</malay> industry and <malay>kita orang nak kena</malay> stop <malay>juga</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> you get what I mean it's like <malay>macam</malay> (um)
<malay>macam</malay> ya [lah]
don't you have three then
everyone was affected be it the bars and whatever you know
but <malay>kita orang</malay> kind of <malay>tak ada</malay> industry
<malay>pun nak kena</malay> stop <malay>juga sama macam dia orang</malay>
and <malay>lagi teruk</malay>
(ugh)
ya all the big (err) bars club
ya I mean but what lucky enough <malay>juga</malay> what if <malay>kalau kau dah baru</malay> graduate
<malay>kau baru</malay> graduate last year probably <malay>baru nak</malay> start <malay>kerja dah</malay>
you know but now lucky enough <malay>macam kau ada</malay> time <malay>untuk</malay> breather you know a bit breather and
(um)
chill a little bit and them (um)
you can have time <malay>untuk</malay>
see what's going on and then from there
(err)
come to a point whether
<malay>apa kau nak buat</malay> ready <malay>untuk</malay> next you know
because right now also everything <malay>macam kau</malay> was talking about
(uh) all this <malay>macam kerja dekat dalam studio</malay>
and what not
and you know right now everyone was really <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) really <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tak boleh</malay> go out for
for in the studio <malay>pun kalau tak betul-betul</malay>
and even now the studio are all not operating <malay>pun</malay>
ya it's like the same thing like what happened <malay>dekat ini juga</malay>
time (um) everyone was into
the cyber during the cyber the it was everyone was into internet it was
crazy times <malay>juga</malay>
(uh) for creative because
we were not being paid well we were not (um)
youtube just used whatever content you know <malay>macam</malay>
whatever
then it was if you look at it at that point of time if you look like really close
(um)
ya <malay>semua orang macam</malay>
anyhow [ah] <malay>kira macam sembarang</malay> [ah] <malay>kira</malay> (uh) it's ya
it was haywire napster coming in you know
[ah] it was for consumer they will like it [ah]
but people who produce it people who
who you know
and even <malay>macam sekarang ini macam</malay> netflix and there are big (err)
(mm) you know big (err) movie affected by
but how they going to use all these <malay>macam</malay> despite of time
you know <malay>macam</malay> how can they <malay>macam selit</malay> how can they like you know (err)
whack or
or just like (um) be part of
this you know like just come in and slide in
ya I mean
there will be light
<malay>aku</malay> I'm very sure there will be light somewhere
it's just that <malay>macam</malay>
(um)
<malay>aku rasa</malay> don't give up don't give up for the sake of giving up just because you <malay>tak macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada benda yang kau belajar</malay>
th~ but the thing is take it as if <malay>macam</malay> there's a new skill <malay>yang kau belajar</malay>
apart from that probably (um)
like also <malay>kau kena ingat juga</malay> since <malay>kau cakap</malay> video <malay>dah ada</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> you should share it [ah] you know <malay>macam</malay>
share it because ya
ya
yup
anyways
how are you
that's good
[ah] ya
I mean it's just only one game so
I think
that's a little bit too much
because like ya <malay>macam</malay>
okay [ah] I mean like
technically
technically you can't copyright that shit because you edited it to
you know
way beyond its for creative use [ah]
like you can't really copyright that shit
[eh] fair enough
ya
they can't demonetised you if you are not monetised right so you know
(err) ya I think that's different
(mm) fair
<malay>asal pula</malay>
(oo) ya okay I get it
is it not bad [sia]
I mean at that price range quite affordable already [sia] considering like
okay [lah] okay you can't really upgrade it but then like at three fifty
two correction two fifty that is
cheap as balls
the new rising five
okay
[ah] (uh huh)
is like <malay>apa</malay>
(err) it's like P_S five in india
somebody <malay>dekat dalam kat</malay> india
somebody copy [eh] copyrighted [ah] ya copyrighted [ah]
somebody copyrighted P_S five so
P_S five they Sony can't release P_S five as P_S five in india because it's copyrighted
how I know
th~ I mean there's gonna be a legal battle ensuing about it probably but
true
but then Sony will try to
probably [ah] I think
probably will try to buy it off the person [ah]
because it's like
it will be really wanted to be a dick about it you can just copyright
I mean iphone <malay>punya itu</malay> okay [lah] no I mean iphone bad examples because they already copyrighted all the
all the way the series so like in that same vein you can actually do that ya like if you wanted money [ah] you know unless <malay>dia orang macam</malay> like [ah] okay [ah] <malay>kita</malay> skip one generation that kind of thing so it will be very weird it will be like
P_S one two three four
then five is <malay>apa</malay> roman numerical V
<malay>bodoh</malay>
[ah] ya and it's Sony so like you know he's going to get a lot of money from it
really
[oh] P_S four chat that's disgusting
that's terrible
correct
ya no okay push to talk isn't the issue it's more of in game comms has been
traditionally very shit
after teams speak but then
team speak all of this you had to pay for the channel
ya [lah] you had to buy
ya discord is like you open everything you want to create [ah] create [ah] you want create how many you want you create but then you don't have to pay for the room but of course like at the start of discord it was quite okay [ah] it was rocky [ah]
like if you compared team speak with discord team speak obviously better [ah]
I mean it's just a brand name only [ah] at this point
you know like some of the products are good but then like
majority of them is just brand name like (oo) look at this Razer whatever
buy for
you know usually it's fucking expensive [ah] but then it's like
<malay>bodoh</malay>
[eh] [ah] no I'm not about that life man
man
no [ah] not about their life or I mean
the products are way to expensive
it's not
ya [lah] I mean it is a gaming peripheral [ah] but still like
at least limit it [ah] like at least make it more
marketable or more friendly in that sense
like if someone wanted to buy Razer they would be like [oh] Razer
and then it i~ you know if it's a new person that buys it and it's like they don't know what to look for
and there's a lot of products out there
recycle model
but different name and then you know it's always going to be more expensive than the that [one] by then there will be a sale on the older ones
and the older ones like
[eh] that kind
[ah]
I mean I have <malay>tukar topik</malay> [ah] like I have troubles
with my current night shift
cannot [sia] boring <malay>gila</malay> [siol]
boring <malay>gila</malay>
like at least in my previous company right night shift I had something to do
like I'm quite active okay this person is there that person needs that okay got problem here there try to rectify okay can
but this [one] is like I'm sitting in front of the computer like [oh] my god then there's like four screens
and each screen has different things
okay [lah] like the two screens at the end is your camera screen after that your main working screen is the [one] that you are looking at this the second [one]
then the screen to the right is
the map
you can search for shit [lah] like
whoever [ah] whoever say something right then (err) or the expressway or whatever roads and you just search they will appear on the thing
you can do your job [ah] and then like cannot [ah]
you know I'm not a coffee drinker
it's just boring [siol]
ya but then
true
but okay this is the thing that I don't expect from this sector though is that they will pay you
for the entire month at a certain date like mine they will pay on the twelfth but for the entire month
like that I work for the first few one week
two weeks then after that take leave for the rest of the month get paid already
I still get paid
ya [lah] no [lah] leave
unpaid is
I think when you haven't confirm yet like the first three months
or six months
(uh) I can't even take leave at this point
I mean I can [ah] but it's just unpaid
it's not the entitled leave
but ya like
usually the probation is three months some companies is six months right
okay [ah] depends on the company [lah] but this is one of those that is three months then I get all the medical benefits and all that nonsense [ah] but
the travel expense though it's free
no that's the thing the other thing is I have to clarify was <malay>apa</malay> this transport allowance right
can use for other things or not you know seven eleven can pay by EZ-Link right [ah] I thought can but no
but
ya I got scam
the transport allowance is transport allowance [ah] you can't
you can't
use it
ya because they kind of paid due to do it
ya I mean they paid
you in cash for it whereas this is more of a
not ya
like a token is a token more than anything [ah]
then it's like every month you just get topped up back to the original amount
I mean you can't I can't
it states there in the contract that I can [ah]
let anyone use the thing
[sial] [ah] I have to use it
anyways you just more or less a tracking system for me [ah]
no [lah] it's them for them to track their employees that kind of thing
but then it's like
I mean like [eh] there's this other card
that you can apply for
provided
you can reliably prove
that the company is making you travel everywhere
so like (err) if you exit
the quantity that the travel allowance right
then you can like prove that okay that I'm travelling
(uh) all these places and I'm exceeding my allowance my transport allowance
because I'm travelling for work that kind of shit then it's like
not really ya watch cameras [ah]
like I'm just saying there's
there's (uh)
hidden thing to it [lah] like if you don't cause like you exceed your travel allowance
then you have to pay for from your next month's
<malay>gaji</malay> then like for what [sia]
you might as well apply for this other thing which apparently is unlimited
but ya
ya
but the thing is like you have to keep proving that it's company expense like they are making you travel then
ya then you apply [ah]
no [ah]
like where the hell am I supposed to go [sia] if I'm watching cameras all day
I mean can [ah] can is can [ah] like the
like the culture quite laid back quite <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] considering like anytime you can just ask somebody to cover for you because they all like okay
you work in shifts then after you work morning then <malay>cukup</malay> time <malay>dah lapar</malay> [eh]
<malay>kau nak apa tak kat kedai</malay> #kopi#
<malay>aku nak gi</malay>
then take orders [ah] #teh#teh#kopi# <malay>ni itu</malay>
then if <malay>tak</malay> then order from Grab
I mean the
no [ah]
anytime ya
and then there's no place to eat also
like you eat in the off~ no you eat there in the !oops! room itself
like you don't go out to eat then come back
(uh) I mean it's true [ah] I can't really you can't really like changed that aspect of it because at the end of the day it's you're bloody job is to monitor the cameras and like if you
are not there to monitor the camera then you're not doing your job then like
pointless right
so ya but then again also like sometimes the job gets so hectic
that you are so busy with that [one] then it's like you want to eat but you cannot eat
no obviously you eat after and before [lah] but
the during the <malay>kerja</malay> but sometimes
ya that's true
I mean I already enjoyed it
like if
but then okay that's the other thing that I didn't expect from this [ah] job
because <malay>dia punya tempat kat</malay> town
then usually town food bloody expensive
so I got chicken rice three fifty
like [sial] [ah] where you want to find chicken rice for three fifty
in town
okay [ah] don't say town [lah] #ulu# <malay>punya tempat pun susah nak cari</malay> three fifty like
(uh) ya
ya
like even hawker centres also are not that cheap
and plus this period some more
what to do it is what it is [ah] but yet
I mean we are more or less
stabilised
and twelve few days ago
a few days als~ a few days ago also
[ah] zero
but ya more or less we are stabilised
we can start opening already
if we wanted to
ya
but the sad part is
the whole world still burning so even if we open we can't really like travel
right ya we travel to australia also same thing
no the sad part is right
singapore australia open on the eighth
eighth was it no eleven
we already open so we can travel
to the countries I mean australia but the sad part is if an australian citizen travels to singapore spend the time here for holiday whatever comeback they need to pay
a <malay>saman</malay> so to speak
because they're australia itself is not open
you can go for travel
but the country itself is not open yet
we are open to go there but they are not
ya [lah]
[eh] no
they don't have to they just have to do the swab test
then
S_H_N is
fourteen days [siol] I think you just swab test to say that you are not you I mean you don't have it then after that you are free to go after that
but ya
it's set for their citizen [ah] I think <malay>kena saman</malay>
okay [ah] not really okay [ah]
the <malay>saman</malay> is a wrong choice of word [ah] (err) it's more of (err) ya
it's not a fine it's more of
something like that [lah] like it's a tax kind of thing but it's not really a tax
but it's not a <malay>saman</malay>
something like that
ya I mean that's true
it's like what (uh)
I heard from my aunt it's like three thousand
australian
so an australian citizen comes to singapore comeback then they need to pay the three thousand
ya I know
two thousand plus I think
(uh) I think what one dollar to ninety cents something like that
ya more money that kind of shit
then everyone goes there then after that the then now is like what okay [ah]
[eh] but then new zealand that time got (uh) recently I think yesterday got a few cases because of the travellers
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean we have the resources to spend
to do all these test
okay
one and the other thing is we are more or less generally
quite submissive [ah]
like whatever government says we kind of have to follow otherwise we get the rod
but then it's like
that's worst I'm I was just putting it nicely okay but ya
so like I mean if you compare us to other countries there is like you know their freedom of speech blah all that nonsense then you see [lah] what happened now
three hundred thousand already
(uh huh)
ya
yup
two hundred thousand
it's already three thou~ three hundred thousand
and then the other sad part is
it's all people of colour
not
ya no that's the thing their medical system that is flawed as fuck
you see [eh] go into the A&E
they have their own pricing on it
like whatever
[ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it because they charge whatever for whatever treatment that the want to give and then in the end like the bill comes out then like [sial] [ah]
like who in their right mind can afford that kind of shit [sia] like if you don't have insurance in america you are fucked
(oo)
you will be so screwed
three something like that ya
ya and the thing is you can pay by instalment if you don't have the cash
ya
unlikely
true
then it's also zero percent interest [what] so you are not paying extra for the stupid
ya [lah] I mean late payments but like if you're choosing to pay by instalment and you know you can pay that amount every month and eventually it goes away
it just takes awhile only [ah] I mean there's also like you know like you don't want to pay instalment already you have enough money to pay everything then you pay everything [ah]
ya
okay
really
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
ya #borat# is #borat# [lah] so
I wonder if they edited that out
(uh huh)
I mean to be f~ okay [ah] no [ah]
no then it's on video it's proof enough like they'll find I don't know I think they will find somehow or another to turn it around
it is what it is [ah] but you know it's fucking video proof [ah] like even
even
even the
the law enforcement system
right you know how everybody saying that police are body cam supposed to be
are submitted for evaluation or some shit like that right
no it's not they switched off
I don't know which state
said that
(uh) they shouldn't submit the body cam anymore
because
it shows a lack of de escalation
ya
ya
and then is like as long as the story tallies then is like you can't really say what
I don't know [lah] which state [ah] one of the judge [lah] they said they shouldn't send the things anymore because it just shows that they are doing a bad job
like I mean their police is already that terrible already but it is what it is [ah]
[ah]
no comments
in othe~
in other news right whole world is burning
that might be true for #taiwan# soon
I think world war three should start soon
(err) china
planing on the invasion already it's in the work
the thing is now the threat seems very real
because the eastern side of china the one that is closest to #taiwan# right they upgraded the middle the missile or some shit like that then is like the thing can now hit #taiwan# [ah]
I mean that's not really diplomacy anymore
considering
[eh] ya
I mean to be fair they've already taken the majority of the world
#taiwan# is part of china and then
I mean ya [lah] like
and they could have just let #taiwan#
be as it is
have their own government but no
then like
really
so you
so you can't have a people's republic of china and a democratic republic of #taiwan# like no
I think they call them (uh) D C P right [eh] no D C
[oh] !wow!
I mean #taiwan# is kind of like singapore
just
much bigger
okay I mean
okay let's be fair to them they are their own country
they are their own parliament
it's just that another
ya that
okay [lah]
that [one] no comments [ah] ya
it has been like this for awhile only it's just that now only now their making news of it
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
legit [ah]
[oh] !wow!
<malay>bodoh</malay>
(uh huh)
!ee! [ah] ya
that's malaysia
that's the issue I mean
ya
you all busy fighting each other also [lah]
[kan]
ya [sia] all those [ah] grab drivers top up from J_B <malay>semua</malay> they like bloody salty [lah] [sia]
damn
that's
one sixty that you could have spent on something else
ya
all this <malay>ni semua nak tak nak</malay> [jer]
<malay>abeh dah malas nak buat apa</malay>
[oh] speaking of fuel the that
venezuelan ship no one going to save the thing
ya
no
ya
crude oil okay [ah] it should be fine but the problem is if it
if it sinks
[kan] I mean already is sinking
that's what I'm saying is like because the area around that ship is going to be contaminated as fuck
coast line
because coastline you can clean
that's fine
it's already dying I'm just expediting the process
just because of one person
[ah]
why
no
ya
basically
that's also true
[oh] obama <malay>punya tu</malay> toast invited obama to play among us
disguised toast
on fucking tweeter of all the places
really
that ya
in social media ya that's
ya that part I know but now I
I didn't expect that he's still active
a lot of the country don't agree with that [lah] but okay [ah] there are the backwater parts [ah]
the backwater parts the backwater part
the beginning of the congenial work at chomp
it's just I think this happen only because
one of the <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
crap I forgot I don't know her name she was playing among us
no the
A O C
A O C
nah
yup
week
[sial] [ah]
(uh huh)
it's basic human nature [lah] what you expect
no hell no
they will donate what they can just so they don't have taxes
ya per year mind you [eh]
per year for a bloody tax
and that's
correct
right yup
<malay>banyak kau punya</malay> millions
no the thing is new world
and if people still believe in my legs
no hasn't been proven or there hasn't been
ya
ya [lah]
okay
(uh huh)
okay
!wow!
he couldn't take the delegation or interrogation other questions [ah]
differently
ya
ya I mean
it is what it is [ah] it's his style
either way it [eh] no I mean he's no he's trying to imitate china basically
we don't they do obviously the country is like that because it's already like that
what I've said is correct
then you just have to believe [eh]
we might as well be
#kim jong un#
[oh] my god I don't know [ah] [sia]
it was but is a guy he say I love the bible
ya
ya obviously
you would have a favourite somewhere
<malay>nak buat</malay> [sia]
and that is trump in a nutshell [lah] [eh]
okay
how do you think are chomp is affecting economy
who is making economy great my business is booming again he's asking like what business are you in your what are you doing [oh] I do (uh) money lagging
[oh] !wow!
correct
yup
I don't think public transport is affected
ridership
ridership but then it still doesn't affect the whole
thing as a general and Grab drivers yes
because
obviously the company will care [ah]
ya
obviously not
ya but the thing is to grab drivers will hit the hardest especially the C_B period
that [one] terrible [siol] like
only essential workers [what]
me [ah]
then like yours truly [ah]
work essential service not really essential
ya
not all
Grab drivers they only had their subsidy through their
[ah] rental <malay>punya tu</malay>
they got
it's not even that much [sia]
taxi yes Grab no Grab their rental was it was what they cut it down by thirty percent forty percent something like that but they still had to pay whereas taxis
it was free like [sial] [ah] they can [sial] [ah] that's why you see a lot
of taxis during the C_B period just waiting doing nothing
that's the thing they can afford to do that because they don't have to pay rent and they just have to pay fuel
but then they don't have to drive around
because like why should I drive around when I need to pay for the fuel later so I just wait there
where as the Grab drivers they still had to pay like what fifty bucks from the right from the amount that I was talking with them like the rental they had to pay fifty every day still but then during C_B period [sial] [ah] how to earn fifty [sia]
okay [ah] not everyone can [ah] but that's why during C_B I had the same driver a week straight [sia]
he live somewhere [ah] there like nine hundred plus there I think
then everytime I book [eh] same guy tomorrow [eh] same guy
but <malay>padehal</malay> he just like on the app <malay>lepak kat rumah</malay> then <malay>tunggu ada</malay> call [jer] the [eh] bro I on the way [eh]
then like [ah] sorry [ah] bro <malay>ada benda boleh tunggu</malay> ten minutes <malay>tak</malay>
and like okay [ah] ten minutes only [what] not like I going anywhere I just take like for Grab
I don't I'm not really that
picky or like in a rush kind of thing cause you know I go out early then I don't <malay>sampai kerja</malay> like on time I always <malay>sampai kerja</malay> with a lot of time still like half an hour before
that kind of shit [lah] so like I don't really care will have to wait extra just for the Grab to <malay>sampai</malay>
no it's like I'm there I'm just waiting you pick me up go <malay>dah sampai kerja buat kerja</malay> but then it's like ya
like unless on that day I overslept or something
then like shit I need to go now I need to go I need to <malay>sampai</malay> like right now
rare [ah] but then only then I will cancel
but then other than that no [ah]
if not <malay>nak kena</malay> <malay>tunggu lama</malay> [siol] or the best the best that I got (uh) book
the <malay>punya</malay> G_P_S say ten minutes
it was at #boon lay#
[ah] around that area <malay>tunggu tak sampai</malay> the car not even moving
don't know call message
everything no reply
[siol] then I like what the fuck [sial] wait here half an hour already [siol] then the thing still say ten minutes the fuck you doing [sia] cancel
no [ah]
it's justified
anyways okay you can cancel within five minutes
after five minutes then you cancel got charge right but then like half an hour already [sia]
[kan]
then like <malay>gi mampos</malay> [ah]
just cancel get a new [one]
but then the thing is you don't
you don't directly
(uh)
okay [lah] ya there's the more apt way to say it [lah]
<malay>asal</malay> [kan] <malay>makanan sampai boleh makan dah cukup</malay> that kind of thing
like no see that's the thing there's a lot of patient customers out there like <malay>kalau kau ajak</malay> fight <malay>dah dua jam</malay> then <malay>tu lain cerita</malay> [ah] or the worse [one] is
you collect the food already
you collect the food already <malay>dah sampai</malay> right
then you put delivered
then <malay>takde</malay> the food not there
#sot# [sia] <malay>tu</malay>
like you wait already you wait and wait
okay <malay>makanan dah sampai</malay> the thing says okay delivered <malay>buka pintu</malay>
<malay>mana makanan dia</malay>
then like [eh] [sial] [ah] <malay>kena</malay> scam
[oh] ya ya
then <malay>terus dia keluar</malay> [kan] pizza <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>tu memang ajak</malay> fight
ya
or those people in P_M_D I mean the disabled people
(hmm)
[ah]
but in singapore majority of buildings have lift [what]
like rare you find
that [one] is dorms
[eh] well
service industry [lah] [eh]
the woes of it
you get that kind of shit [ah] you get that kind of shit [ah]
you is body disease
better than the previous workplace then C_B start
everyone was you know up in arms about it
bloody supermarket getting cleared out and shit
is like you know what like
okay [ah] <malay>suka hati korang</malay> [ah] [ah] you want to stock up I don't know how many
months of rations it's not even officially yet that kind of shit then it's like
okay [ah] <malay>suka hati</malay> [ah]
and usually the thing is
there's a pro and con to it [ah]
usually by then on the shelves will be cleared and they'll be restocking
but then if you come too early
got nothing for you
but then you have to come just the right time that they are restocking the stuff then ya
cause <malay>malam</malay> is when all the supplies <malay>masuk</malay> [pe]
then ya all the vendors <malay>datang</malay> then they take stock and all that nonsense usually it's like right now currently [ah] is like
the supermarket if it's a twenty four seven supermarket they'll be like one or two staff only at night [ah]
cause
<malay>takde orang</malay>
(mm)
[ah]
okay [lah] I mean
the one that I went to was somewhat like this
[ah] #gek poh# <malay>punya</malay> prime small-ish [ah] so like [ah] there's not
there's only one entrance and one exit [lah] so like you can't really run away
and then you have to like you does use your
safe entry shit go in then after that buy whatever you want to buy
then <malay>takde</malay> cashier
the cashier doing restocking
then like
but lucky got bell [ah] got the service bell so like you know if you want to like do whatever shopping that you need already then after that you ring the service bell

we have our fair share of idiots
everywhere else in the world I mean our percentage is not that much compared but there is still so like you know one person say like this everyone say like this then becomes hive mind you especially know the older generations
because they have their own group
clique thing so like one person say something everyone will believe it you know that kind of shit
why
why
but ya
[ah]
like okay [ah] if
if you go out of your way
to try to verify it then I would understand [ah] but then like you know
you post in the thing then after that you believe like [eh] !siala!
this thing [ah] like that
then like
<malay>bodoh</malay> [ah] it's just <malay>bodoh</malay>

you know I know you know
[eh] <malay>aku nanti</malay> photoshop

(oh) okay maybe nearer ya
ya okay maybe I should show my <malay>baju</malay> a little bit

okay I should try editing it with light room
[oh] look like
<malay>pelik</malay> [sia]
okay like this
should I edit it out
okay
damn sticker
(oh)
okay
okay later I will edit I will try to edit with lightroom so <malay>nampak macam</malay>
I because I used I edit like preset on my lightroom <malay>punya</malay> account
no need
because lightroom is technically is not like VSCO
VSCO has like
the featured presets you know ya lightroom you can created your own preset
so that is what I did
is more like <malay>untuk</malay> photographer [sia]
but you can learn [ah] it's easy
like my picture you know my picture with someone I posted it's so H_D I love it [sia] no that is the only picture that is H D because I used lightroom
apparently I guess like depends on how much filter how much (um) you edit [ah]
like your preset the <malay>macam</malay>
the higher your
your saturation (err) contrast and all that right
the worst the H~ the quality would be I it Instagram because the more
effect that you put on your pictures in another account in another app
then when you post it on Instagram
the qua~ the resolution will be higher
so it will make it more
they will make it less H_D
ya
that's why if you when I updated pictures in VSCO right mine look nice on VSCO but then when you post the quality goes down
ya because the amount of (um) effect and then like the effect you put how high it is [ah] technically
[kan] and that's what my photographer friend said [ah] and I was like okay
it's little bit blurry right ya
ya that's ri~ that's why
I'm so tired
don't waste money
[oh] is my card with you
okay
(mm)
ya same as you right
[oh]
[eh] wai~ but if I end late
if I end like late I cannot take M_R_T [what]
like if I end before eleven forty five
(mm)
but will that minus off like my pay
(oh) okay that is nice
(mmhmm)
it just enough time for me to take M_R_T home [lah]
so like can I have to go back to orchard
[oh] [oh] the stop the bus
<malay>tak de</malay> bus stop <malay>dekat</malay> somerset also will be easier [ah] because like somerset have take
then I stop at #dhoby ghaut#
[ah]
<malay>duduk sana</malay> [ah] <malay>depan</malay> laboratory <malay>kita</malay> why we sitting here
(uh huh)
nice I mean at least better than Smiggle
ya why would you even put like six cents
they say they want to increase my pay after like
whatever but they didn't even do that
I'm so tired what the shit
okay I can't wait to watch my Netflix
<malay>aku semalam tak pergi sekolah</malay> [kan] I literally stay at home and watch #anime# ya
I watch #anime# then I watch this new K drama <malay>yang</malay> do you like #brams#
#brams# no
no it's a K drama about like classic music classical music (mm)
it's not bad [lah] I think next week [dah] <malay>habis</malay>
no actually K dramas [ah] korean drama they usually end after episode sixteen
the longest it'll be twenty six or like thirty eight
right
(hmm)
that's me when I watch scarlet heart #ryeo# I was so sad ya I mean like scarlet heart #ryeo# was more than twenty episode I think
I think like twenty five or something I think so [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay> I wanted a season two
[oh] my god it was so good [kan] then like
then like at the end they showed her going back to real world in her future world like her present modern world and then he's stuck in the old world the historical world
ya they should make like how she got back in the future world and then meet
the guy from the like reinclination of the guy and then they fall in love again or whatever
because the thing is she remembered her pass then !ee!
so annoyed ya
and the fact that she has a child in that historical world ya she gave birth then she died during childbirth
ya
and technically the <malay>anak</malay> is a princess
I mean like it's half blood
yes
technically she's the half blood [lah] because her father is the king and then the mother is like a
no
the mother is like commoner bu~
<malay>dia punya</malay> sister the cousin-in-law is a princess then got married to another prince then after that she became like this the lady in charge of all the princess and the kings <malay>punya mandi</malay> and stuff
ya you like the ya the head servant that kind and she became like that like a royal something [ah] can't remember
is a nice show
like I'm so sad
I heard they make a chinese version of it
I don't know but then chinese version <malay>ada</malay> season two
that is the thing
[kan] [oh] ya I saw
<malay>ya ke</malay>
(hmm) but then I feel like <malay>yang cina punya</malay>
drama the goals are [eh] like [meh]
like [eh] but then the case like korean dramas <malay>punya</malay> standard ya
[oh] you know I watch I recently watch this chinese drama my unicorn girl and then
the act~ the lead actor was the guy from meteor garden
like the chinese the china chinese or china version I don't know [ah]
I think china version of meteor garden that are four
one of the guy is the lead actor of this drama I finish watching
<malay>habis macam</malay> handsome <malay>gila</malay> [sia] he's like my favourite actor [ah]
dylan I think his name is dylan #chen#
no dylan #chen# I think
handsome [sia] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>kau pun sama</malay> I cannot say much about me
my jaw line is gone <malay>diam</malay> [ah] [sia]
[kan]
(hmm) I can't wait to eat
I don't know I'm conflicted my stomach is conflicted ya
I can't wait to eat #tom yum#

ya like that [ah] because like they are old people I guess
but at least like the food is nice ya it's cheap also I want to eat the fried mushroom
super nice
<malay>sedap</malay> [sia]
maybe but then it's small
i'm' not su~ I'm not sure
but then right I heard like if you book the down town east the new down town east resort
staycation #thingy# ticket and the chalet you get free tickets for !wah!wah! wet
ya and I want to go !wah!wah! wet
ya but if you book you get free [sia]
I don't know I think hundred plus I remembered it depends on how big you want the room to be the small the smaller room are like hundred plus per night or something like that it's quite cheap [ah] actually but I feel like it's not that worth it
because <malay>tempat dia pun kecil</malay> even at the two storey room is small ya like when yo go inside the room right
you didn't have like T_V toilet sofa balcony then you go up it's just the beds
ya so it's nothing much ya it's like studio M but maybe slightly smaller I think because of the area and then more hipster
I wanna go cherry
so fun
[oh] my god I was so shook [sia]
and I felt so
guilty you know like I literally said sorry [eh] sorry [eh] I'm so sorry about my friend they didn't even realise that then the malay bouncer said it's okay [dah] <malay>biasa selalu macam gini</malay> then <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] ya [sia]
literally <malay>terus aku tengok macam</malay> what the shit but thank god she was wearing like
(ugh) <malay>apa tu</malay> what's the thing called off shoulder she wore off shoulder like okay [lah] at least can flip ya it was double sided <malay>punya tak ada banyak</malay> pattern

ya [sia] but okay [lah] she was drunk so
(mm)
(um) sure
three A_M [oh] my god so <malay>lambat</malay>
I don't think so
I don't think so because
because confirm she will ask me like why didn't you take an earlier shift and the she be like then how to go back like very logical
ya she be like !huh! why~ why you
why you just cannot earlier shift
why you can't <malay>balik siang</malay>
sometimes I do that you know then she be like give me so many reasons to like [oh] I'm so angry
no she won't be like that [ah] she's not like that but she just like tell me <malay>macam</malay> you should take an early shift next time

[kan] asian moms okay [lah] it's not a bad thing [lah] but sometimes it is
ya
but one point eight K is too much [ah] honestly
(um) not bad what you have to consider your <malay>gaji</malay> you have to consider how much you have to set aside for like is being cut for example your food your home utilities
but that's not possible for a graduate student like just finish schools kind of
ya [sia] I mean like the most we can get is two point two I mean like that's the standard diploma
salary I think
true but you have to work [lah]
why not you rent your at your brother's house
he has a room what and the child is small
she doesn't need her own room yet
I mean like you cannot live there for technically like for free <malay>apa</malay> you have to help out also right
ya but you are still living in the same quarters
so you have to actually do a little bit of chores
why would you even do that
I can't wait for my sister to have her own house
I mean I think she has or maybe like she contacting somebody I don't know [oh] my god it's so annoying <malay>tengok besar</malay> [sia] this is my stomach
I'm a cow okay maybe this is

what you mean last year this year <malay>pun apa haprak sangat ke</malay> this year okay [lah] maybe I gain weight
but then that doesn't mean I'm not pretty that's what you trying to say because you say I ugly

but it's true [ah] when you eat the TruFitz

I know how to self-defence like <malay>siapa-siapa nak pegang</malay> [kan] try me like seriously I learn a lot how to self-defence with guys [lah] cause <malay>dah banyak kali kita dah</malay> take advantage but then I learn how to be stronger [lah] <malay>belajar belajar</malay> #pang# <malay>satu kali ni</malay> this guy [ah] <malay>dia nak</malay> try one time shoot he run away he was like
like legit no one talk to me anymore because he is the one <malay>yang nak ambil</malay> advantage <malay>punya</malay> he tried to <malay>macam nak pegang-pegang tu semua</malay> then I was like bro we are just friends bro then you are touching me this way then he was like can [lah] can [lah] <malay>terus</malay> I give up like okay <malay>kau fikir perempuan ni apa lemah sangat apa</malay> I give him one punch at his face because I was
because I was like damn pissed off [lah] cause he really thinks I'm like girls is just like so weak you know like I hate it because
that [one] I don't care [lah] like I just it's better to be safe than sorry no matter what he's gonna do to me <malay>ke buang</malay> (uh) me from the army or whatever it is right as long as I'm safe because I can just make a report sue him let him know what he have he has done [lah] and <malay>dia pangkat</malay> sergeant and is a very high rank already for like the sergeant <malay>punya</malay> rank [lah] so if he if once the big boss already know about what the
the sergeant did <malay>buang</malay> so whatever he did to me he will get back [lah] ya
we are basically like the black people
no seriously like white always have the privilege I mean guys always have the privilege
(mm) that [one] is damn sad [lah]
I can't really say much but ya whatever it is like try me whatever happens [lah] because I know how to save myself but then we see how it goes [lah] who knows things change we don't know but like I can just be brave that's what I can do I just ya put my mind into him
like because like I feel like I'm talking to you like you know just don't make anything bad happen to me okay
I don't know the way that is not like (err) being like disrespectful disrespecting [lah] I'm just like you know if he's like my father but in a very bigger way like he's got like he's our dad [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> cause he's the one that create us [what] so is like one way to do it is like if this is how comfortable I am with #allah# like this is how peace he make me feel like when I'm talking to him praying to him you know so is like <malay>bukan macam</malay> [eh] <malay>lu macam muak</malay> no
that's exactly ya that is like <malay>ya allah tolong</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>buat macam gini</malay> you know like please [lah] please [lah] at least that [one] he knows <malay>macam</malay> because he already know what are we gonna say what are we gonna do so if he knows that I'm gonna disrespect him he knows what he is gonna do to me like you know <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>berbual maki ya allah</malay> you know that
kind of disrespecting ya but then no [lah] so far I never do that before I'm like always like you know I'm always very comfortable
[oh] my god
I don't know what is their motive though we never disrespect your god why must you disrespect ours
I think because they watch a lot of nuns [lah] how is it scary we are [oh] my god we are covering up what we can cover man nevermind they don't understand we at least understand our religion nevermind as long as we believe in what our god trying to make us do nevermind they don't understand they don't need to understand [lah] they don't have to also
if not just ask us [lah] about you know try to understand about our religion at least like okay [lah] explain us about good I explained ask about your god
just because we look scary !wow!
and as people also don't understand you doesn't mean those <malay>hijab</malay> people that you don't understand you must like be against them example we are not okay with okay [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you are a french person okay and you don't like me because I wear <malay>hijab</malay> and I don't like you because you are very ignorant am I like why are you so ignorant #blah#blah#blah# no right like I'm leaving you alone because like you do you I do me like that
like all those wannabes
same <malay>sama</malay> ya true
(mmhmm) like not just saying that we are that old you know to the point where we can judge them like seriously this is you know
ya and not saying that we are that good we are not that perfect <malay>memang betul kita semua bukan</malay> perfect <malay>pun</malay>
so is like something is even <malay>orang yang</malay> very bias also they do mistakes maybe not now then or in the future so is like we don't even know what we are gonna do sometimes <malay>kita fikir macam kita buat benda semua macam</malay> [oh] !wow! <malay>kita aku rasa aku betul</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi orang lain tengok macam</malay> [eh] actually <malay>dia ni apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia buat</malay> [a'ah] [sia] <malay>salah</malay> [sia] <malay>padahal sendiri fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>baik</malay>
<malay>tapi nanti bila dah</malay> live a long life already <malay>fikir balik macam</malay> like [oh] my god what the hell man what is this like what did I do like something like that [lah] like so <malay>sekarang</malay> for the <malay>mak</malay> and <malay>minah</malay> I feel sorry for them [ah] because they maybe <malay>tak dia kurang ajar</malay>
<malay>pasal dia orang betul-betul kurang ajar</malay> so ya I have this okay so people keep saying that I'm a <malay>minah</malay> and I'm very against it because do you even know what's a <malay>minah</malay>
I can be any anyone [lah] like can just say I'm a girl with a lot of personalities
I can be a <malay>minah</malay> I can be a #mat# I can be a guy I can be a girl I can be bias I can be not you know but then is like that's my life and people keep judging me for that is like okay this is my life not yours and #allah# give me this life is not for you to judge and not for me to <malay>macam</malay> you know like judge people or for you to judge me
but maybe their way of saying ya and sometimes <malay>kita tak macam</malay> we never K like sometime when we are angry we say things different we thought is like just saying you know but people is like why are you so mad like why you so harsh but <malay>padahal macam pada kita</malay> is like I'm just saying the facts and if
the facts you cannot really accept it then what else can you accept you expect us to <malay>macam</malay> sugarcoat everything <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you are doing so great [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai hijab tak tutup</malay> (err) <malay>apa ni leher takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>lupa melayu sikit takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>kau tak tutup pun takpe</malay> [eh] <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>tak pakai tudung</malay> [ah] <malay>kau pakai tudung dengan</malay> sleeveless <malay>pun tak apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kau nak main bola pakai tudung</malay>
never heard of that but ya like <malay>semalam dah cakap</malay> [ah] it's like okay that kind of <malay>teguran</malay> is like you are stupid and you like to sugarcoat everyone what are you trying to get is like !wow!
[eh] example like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! #farah# so nice [ah] she everytime sugarcoat me ya but <malay>padahal</malay> #farah# itself is like
like I don't really mean that you know like I'm just trying to sugar coat you because I want you to be my friend like that type you know so it's like people just don't know the difference
exactly (uh) like seriously I feel so <malay>malu terhadap melayu-melayu kita sendiri</malay>
(mmhmm) I mean they have like that self esteem okay fine that [one] I but then like that's too much [lah] know your limits [lah] no need to rub to our faces [lah] at least (mmhmm)
[eh] [oh] my god <malay>kalau tak jadi riak pun</malay> #allah# <malay>tak terima</malay> [sia] so #allah# <malay>sendiri dah tahu apa kau tengah buat dia dah tahu apa kau akan buat</malay> so the more you share to people <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak aku solat</malay> [sia] [eh] <malay>lima waktu</malay> [sia]
okay then what you want me to do <malay>macam</malay> [oh] !wow! you confirm go to heaven [lah] what you expect exactly so is like [oh] my god
ya then is like okay firstly is like you really recite <malay>quran</malay> [ah] a lot of time <malay>macam anda khatam tu semua kau tak payah ingat macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau <malay>dah</malay> khatam belum</malay> like <malay>aku dah khatam</malay> [sia]
I'm like okay you can at least say like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kalau</malay> if your friends like haven't <malay>khatam</malay> and you have already <malay>khatam</malay> like at least two times three times you can just <malay>ajar</malay> that person <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>aku tolong kau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku bimbing</malay> [ah] <malay>apa aku akan jadi</malay> your guide [lah]
guidance okay so <malay>kau dapat pahala kau tak payah riak macam</malay> K [lah] <malay>aku jadi cikgu engkau</malay> [lah] <malay>aku dah khatam banyak kali</malay> like you don't have to say that <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah]
like for example I haven't <malay>khatam</malay> you already <malay>khatam</malay> then I'm like I really want to <malay>khatam</malay> because I want to be closer to god I want to really understand it I want to finish it I want tears of (um) like tears of joy you know at least
and ya sadness because ya then #farah# came up to me like example [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) do you need help like <malay>kau belum khatam</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab aku baru khatam</malay> so <malay>kau perlukan bantuan tak</malay> at least you are offering in that kind of way and that kind of tone is very nice and for me is like
you are not judging me in any ways you know it feels like you are really you really want to help me I was like okay [ah] <malay>boleh tolong tak</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you know you can just say it that way but why must you like so ya exactly so is like [oh] my god like <malay>memalukan gila</malay> [lah] <malay>serius</malay> like <malay>tuduh ke</malay>

okay so the you know the (um) with a song that I showed you just now is it's basically (um) it's a K pop song by shinee
(um) ya so (um) so how they use it on tiktok is like it's either the humorous or funny (uh) K pop humour the jokes on tiktok or it's like used by like thirst traps you know
too and then they <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>buat</malay> videos <malay>yang</malay> can make you pause for a while and like [oh] I'll double tap that
it's I never heard
[oh] okay (uh) maybe I think so like you know pull you like in to my side
<malay>entah aku tak tahu</malay> but we'll find out soon
I recently learn this term it's called (um) (um)
kissing my teeth but K_M_T if you've seen it on twitter K_M_T stands for kissing my teeth
so like (um) like you're not you know that meme <malay>yang</malay> the person is like (um) like they're not happy they are annoyed
ya so that's what it means so if you see K_M_T <malay>maknanya</malay> kiss my teeth
so like for example (uh)
what's the [oh] ya ya I know it's so true [oh] my god
like once you respond <malay>habis</malay> that's it (mm)
I do it you know I've got come my <malay>adik</malay> I do it at #nasha# when I ask her to like get me something
[eh] #nasha#
I am a <malay>minah</malay> at heart
[ah] I mean like that number [ah] the number of hours I'll be on tiktok everyday is just ridiculous
so (um) like on wednesday because I was working from home
like I finish work at six right immediately you know like for me right it's very clear
it's six o'clock that's it I <malay>tutup</malay> my laptop I roll over to my bed and I <malay>buka</malay> tiktok
I stayed there for three hours
scrolling endless scrolling F_Y_P and I didn't realise that three hours had passed until my sister knock on my door
and she was like you <malay>tak nak makan</malay> [eh] and I was like [oh] right dinner I totally forgot
it's so addictive I love it
I learn so much I love it
ya that's the tea
I got into
(um) because I saw quite a bit of it on twitter right because tiktok videos are very easily (uh) loaded and shared and I think that's one of the main (um)
main powers or main advantages of tiktok like for instagram it's not very easy for you to port over or to share if you share like (err) an instagram post it always comes in a link but whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on (uh) any
(uh) any app any social media app
like it's like a native post which is great
here you are native post
today I learn so <malay>macam</malay> like you know people can watch the videos very easily they can say [oh] that it's from this app called tiktok and at first it's like you know at first I thought it was like the musically <malay>yang bodoh punya</malay>
ya <malay>betul</malay>
yes and we know that musically <malay>dengan</malay> vine <malay>tu semua budak kecil</malay>
y~ yes like the <malay>budak mana</malay> from #clementi# <malay>tengah buat</malay> dancing
[ah] tiktok is the same
but it's just not on your F_Y_P page cause it's well curated [oh] I see it is on your F_Y_P page
what have you been watching
right and sometimes like you know when you want to test out if a video is gonna be popular so you just show like on your F_Y_P even though it's not your scene so if you like it
so that
ya the algorithm so don't know whether it's popular or not just randomly give to act~ bunch of people and if there's a high percentage of people who like the video then they spread it even more
so that's why sometimes you realize [eh] you got videos will have about fifty or sixty and just kept there doesn't load so once (uh) once it realizes that [eh] this video isn't as popular as with the other users then it just doesn't show anymore
so that's how they determine the prior~ priority
correct yes they really wanna see that
yes
or is it you don't want grab ge</mandarin> to see you
[oh] !wow!
[oh] [oh] !wow! amazing !wow!

hashtag
multifunction
be up to be like her for real like give me listening to guide to grab food in like reading chinese novel play what bro
you and that was a that was the plot twist that I did not see to be honest
what's the point where do you where I don't like I thought that you know you should explicitly referring to like japanese stuff anyway you probably won't go the other way sitting right
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I thought that you know it should be exclusive if you're like into japanese stuff #anime# you probably won't go the other way
ya
but it's okay sis you got what you call that you got range
it's what
ya you got range
wha~ wha~ what's your exact the plot twist that I didn't quite expect you know watching #anime#
ya I've I really truly enjoy watching saturday and ya I'm so ashamed for like you know anyways but I'm watching I don't know if you know this show it's got #saiki#
the disastrous life of #saiki#
[oh] that's good
(um) it's more slice of life I guess (um) so I guess I prefer that kind rather than <malay>macam</malay> like actually the things I remember watching
but it's very promising and I might start on it
okay so I might I start ya so this one is more of like (um) slightly modern japan and it's basically revolving around this character called #saiki# (um)
who is basically a psychic then and he has like extraordinary superpowers so <malay>macam</malay> for him right he wears his like pink antennas on his head
so apparently that helps to curb his powers <malay>kalau dia tak pakai</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti dia bangun pagi</malay> [kan] <malay>terus dia punya rumah dah habis dah</malay>
like exploded
so like he needs to so okay so his power is like literally anything that he touches expected to stone or like or if someone say it's can you like <malay>urut</malay> me like he would <malay>urut</malay> and then after that you will just your body whole body just like just becomes a ball because he just his power is just too strong or he kicks someone okay so there's was this one scene
strength [ah] yes so I was like talking about like
powerful strength and he can also (uh) teleport (um)
he can he has pyro~ pyrokinesis or something so he can like keep himself warm literally any power you can think of
he could do that too
like literally like any power you can think of he has it so the whole #anime#
ya it's just him
the whole #anime# revolves around him and his life in school like how he's trying to keep (uh) people like his close friends from knowing what his power is and the most interesting thing is that throughout the whole #anime# he never opens his mouth
ya
so it's just so because he also has telepathy
(um) you can hear his voice but you won't see him open his mouth
people can hear I guess the thing is people don't realize it but they're hearing his voice through telepathy
it's so <malay>merepek</malay> but it's so good it's so <malay>kelakar gila</malay> like if you have the time then give it like one episode I love it so much like during lunch breaks
my one hour is so precious while I heat up my food and go eat right
I watch three episodes
it's twenty minutes long
okay fine like twenty one twenty two minutes I okay may have taken more than
I don't skip I love everything about it
okay yes I skip the intro that's what I do you have to skip the intro so like just one hour straight I'll just watch [ah] #saiki# it was so good and the thing is I think there's like a couple of seasons I <malay>rasa belum habis</malay>
like I've started two three weeks ago I <malay>rasa belum habis</malay>
(um) I don't know it's about twenty three plus
I watch during lunchtime I watch during dinner time <malay>tak habis-habis</malay> [tau] I'm like <malay>bila ni</malay>
ya but I still can't finish
and I watched that many episodes for lunchtime and also I'm like !wow!
right I should have finished like one season
<malay>aku tak tahu ada berapa</malay> season <malay>berapa banyak</malay> episode I'm still with season two [tau] season freaking two
ya
[oh] ya ya
[oh] <malay>yang</malay> total <malay>aku tak tahu aku belum</malay> I don't even know how many seasons there are sorry
I'm starting there
ya it's like to it's she's own I guess I prefer that [lah] cause I guess I can relate to it more <malay>macam</malay> #shonen# is like a little bit more difficult for me cause you have to
ya you really have to get into it
even this one <malay>tak masuk akal pun</malay> at least I can relate
[oh]
maybe it's just like the frequencies type of things
yes
drama
those I vaguely recall watching a #gundam# series on kids central
[oh]
ya
(mm) (mm)
yes
yes
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm)
that's very interesting I've actually thought of that
fact #gundam# I all I remember is I watched it but it's more of like background noise
cause never really got into it
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
(hmm)
it was really good
back then like when you thought it was good and then you check further more into #gundam# and you're like no
#gundam#
I actually (um) because I brought home #najhah's# <malay>punya</malay> (um) #haikyu# jacket and
[ah] it fits out quite nicely thank goodness cause she's actually quite pudgy now (um)
yes she's tall is one thing she's also like quite <malay>berisi juga</malay> like she's not stick thin
so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't internet [lah] correct
(um) so I was actually quite scared that she wouldn't fit into the jacket
plus it's like her favourite show so I <malay>tak nak hampakan</malay> [lah]
but thankfully it fits and she was like okay nevermind it's not my favourite team but it's okay I like it okay good you know that's great
and she hasn't taken it off like when I left the house she's still wearing it
she loves it so much
me too so I think
[ah] no I think it's still with #aisyah# okay nevermind that's fine
ya so (um)
I told her like [eh] sorry [ah] I really cannot bring you because N_C sixteen and I don't want you to start thinking that movie ratings are just a suggestion even if it is like I want you to take them seriously but didn't tell her that of course you know because that would (um)
they would insinuate that some people don't take it seriously told her like sorry movie rating is N_C sixteen and you're not sixteen so you cannot watch (um)
but some countries
she knows but some countries its P_G thirteen I saw [ah] I saw on re~ reddit she's on fucking reddit
she's on freaking Reddit for like anime I was just like [oh] my goodness you really cannot like if you have any questions like you can you go ask me at least I can ask <malay>kak zan</malay> and <malay>kak najhah</malay> you <malay>jangan macam gini</malay> [eh]
it is where I feel like you need to be ready it but
ya (um) it's it takes some getting used to but reddit can be particularly useful when like for example okay back then when I was really into my like fitness craze (um) there was some like reddit pages like how to lose with reddit
or like the before and after reddit so this kind like you when you follow you get along motivation from people cause it's super positive so it really depends [lah] or it's more of like Q&A or like one of my favorites is (err) E_L_I five which is explain like I'm five
so ya so like you know and they have like really (um) topics that you don't understand like (uh) explain like I'm five what is bitcoin and someone will explain it to you in a clearer simple english so it can be beneficial but it can also be like a cesspool
and there was like this particular Reddit page was so I'm now more if you but I used to follow it because (um)
I like to read like I like tea you know to (um)
and it was on relationships or like am I the asshole
ya so at first it was really fun because like you know you get to see like
some how are some people are just really ridiculous [tau] <malay>merepek gila</malay> [tau] <malay>dia punya perangai</malay> and then after awhile I realized that for
for one of the commenters their suggestions or with their (um) comments is always [oh] this guy is definitely an asshole break up with him even though it's like things like marriage
or like ya it's like a marriage like leave this guy he's not fit to be like your husband or this
the father of the children I'm like these are really drastic opinions that you have like you I get it that you know I feel like just from one activity like this you cannot just say things like that
stop being freaking childish
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
correct so even though like
maybe from the description like the situations really bad [lah] I feel like there are many other ways to resolve it rather than leave the man he's trash his men disposal service I'm telling you that you this man is screwed up
ya
so you mean if the person is really lost or really confused and they see all these responses and the ones with the most R_Ts therefore you know endorsements from people is divorce the man
so
[oh] ya so back to [ah] so (um) so I asked her like (uh) can you give like (uh)
like a summary of the story cause I couldn't catch up without having to be dark somewhere [lah] and she was like
no you don't want to bring me nevermind it's okay but you want to know more then you better binge watch by yourself
then I was like goodness me this person
which of course you know you only have one season so yesterday
#izz# can easily catch up [eh]
[ah] okay [lah] not bad [lah]
[oh] yes
not bad
she was telling me also like it's okay if you can't bring me I'll just find online I was like [eh] N_C sixteen where you want to find online <malay>macam mana</malay> cannot because it's N_C sixteen you cannot watch she's like I'll find the P_G thirteen one
and I'm like you're not thirteen yet you just turned twelve last month she's just like I'll find a way
(mm)
[ah]
ya okay
sub technically I got a
but ya
I'm also trying to think that where is the N_C sixteen is from the blood from the slashing of men
[oh] okay
all right okay send
[oh] my god okay but you know I only realize how important we think when I watched
(um) this movie I think it's called the spy movie I watched it with #sha# it was after A levels
(um) I watched it at downtown east so essentially the story is about (uh) this dowdy the spy support executive or something played by
(um) came up a name something mccarthy
this pudgy comedian (um)
colli~ okay nevermind so there was this like okay so there was this (um) spies
jesse mccartney no [lah] that's a singer <malay>merepek</malay> [jer] <malay>sampai</malay> [jer] <malay>kutuk aku</malay> <malay>bukan</malay>
no it's not jesse mccartney
but
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>tak boleh haram</malay>
it was a spy movie and it was I think M eighteen I mean we were nineteen back then like you know you could easily walk in
ya
so then we walked in and we watched a movie and that was the first time I saw a like a real life actual dick
ya
!wow! really he's fine movie it's all netflix you have netflix actually I mean I do I mean not that you wouldn't want to watch you just because somebody but what's my first sign on only
ya it was a spy movie it's on netflix are you on netflix I should take you
I mean not that you would want to watch it just because of the but it was my first time an I wanna what
I'll just keep it to myself
I was so surprised I was really taken aback because I will just was not expecting
it's not full frontal it's literally a close up because okay so the scene was (um) a man who accidentally to or rather a man is taking some sex videos
so he actually zoom in into like his own like a dick
so that was the scene and (uh) so he was videotaped right and then the spies exec~ executive who became a spy
was looking through the content inside the camcorder and she came across that I'm like wait what
I couldn't believe that a comedy movies staring that comedian was going to show me my first ever dick
ya so after that
he was pretty normal about it I think
ya I'm pretty sure
I was like [oh] I was really full I couldn't pay attention for the next ten minutes
ya then I was like okay so that's how a dick looks like in real life thank you (um)
and then ya so I guess from then on I realise how important ratings were
and also like you know you when it's M eighteen
when it's R twenty one you better make sure that you know
I was not prepared
(uh huh) like nudity or sexual references (uh) ya but normally when you see those you like you're not too bothered by it because you've seen it before and they're like ending [oh] it's probably just the butt or something
so that was very interesting
ya I was legal and I knew what it looked like comically I suppose
but I was just I didn't expect to see it on big screen
(mm)
what I get to is shooting up then I'm like [oh] okay !wow!
that was like twenty fifteen and I still remember it [oh] my goodness
ya I was so shy he was very indifferent about I was like it was a lot
[ah] <malay>biasa</malay> okay [lah] <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] #shah#
ya !alah!
[ah] right
ya
ya honestly like I mean it does feel like a burden sometimes by I feel like if I don't do it who else is going to do it and I really you just hope that she sees it as me
guiding her through this rather than me telling her no cannot this one cannot
so like for me it's always about
(um) this is not the time for you to explore such things here
and the good thing is that she doesn't run away from this kind of conversations
she sits and she is squirmish she's very like a little bit uncomfortable
like when we talk about like watching you know ya #wey# or like whatever she's like a bit squirmish but
we have to sit through this
I think she's more intrigued than interested she just wants to find out like what is it or if it's like this like okay it started out with #haikyu# she was really into #haikyu# her friends got into it and naturally because this is about competition this is about brotherhood
it dwells into a little bit of that area of boy's love their only thing
so I really had to just guide her a bit and making sure that she understands that (um) but whatever she's reading is not necessarily normal in an irregular relationship ya
I just wanted to like impact her brain not this early please
the strange perceptions there
I mean I honestly can't speak for you so I don't know
ya it's like how when I watch those malaysian romance (uh) series
when I was younger [lah] when I was like sixteen seventeen eighteen
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] [oh] my god that is so true like we were big kids already
[a'ah]
it really impacted the way (um) I saw how relationships or is
like how they start with marriages like how they are very like you know the girls always like <malay>tunduk</malay> to the husband
then like you must always listen to your husband and the husband
ya and when I look back and I'm like no like
when I interim put that my malaysian friend offer is like
why
take actually to check out eatery do like
you should just have said T_V <malay>tiga</malay> so
<malay>kau datang dari</malay> drama <malay>mana ni</malay>
ya
recently I watched because it came out on netflix I watched <malay>nur</malay>
it's so basically okay the is quite interesting okay so it's about this (um) new <malay>ustaz baru</malay> graduate from syria or something like worst of the countries
he came back and he is on track to take over his father's business
ya and his father is like a pre~ a celebrity preacher
who has his own (um) <malay>tahfiz</malay> school and his own <malay>masjid</malay>
wrong islamic consultancy maybe
so (uh) so he's a very popular
preacher on T_V and when he came back he is slated to take over the father's business
and then one day while he was giving the <malay>ceramah subuh</malay> thank god he
cause you pick your nice actually somebody you know I didn't Q&A session are we I no one is it
<malay>kat masjid dia orang</malay> and then he received like some questions of people (um) and it's really weird because
[ha] <malay>dia orang</malay> Q&A <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [kan]
<malay>ada</malay> Q&A session (uh) the questions were
ya serious curious cat islamic version <malay>masjid</malay> version
and then like the questions were apparently very you know intriguing and like (uh) thought provoking he wanted to know who it was from turns out (um) it was from this girl
<malay>bila keluar masjid then dia nampak</malay> this <malay>kelibat perempuan yang sedang menulis</malay> on a white piece of paper
and it turns out to be like a prostitute from like a nearby neighbour
so he was intrigued and ya plot twist
so like his initial (um) like emotional said he felt
like disgusted but still
like res~ respectful the person like
he was <malay>macam</malay> ya like !wow!
these sort of kind of questions that you know you coming away based on like you gonna talk provoking questions at the same time like [oh] my god you're a prostitute man you know you can have a you can have (uh) this kind of like
(uh) ya they asked I can't remember what the questions were
(uh) fundamentals one thing and then there's also like you know the typical questions that people would
ask when they're venturing more into the
into the religion without any guidance it's more of like (um)
one of the basic ones was why are there so many like why do bad things happen to good people kind of random things ya
so but like more in depth [lah] so like for him like want to provoking <malay>macam hati dia macam</malay> #dup#dup#
(uh) <malay>kalau solat saya kentut bila rakaat ni</malay>
yes it is idiot
so okay so #tup#tup# they ended up getting married
yes
I know done with the question about everything so (uh) he was looking for her
everywhere like <malay>dia punya dekat jalan</malay> and they met and they dated
[a'ah]
ya because she didn't want to be found out so she <malay>tergesa-gesa</malay> but the she just
ya I think some of them he didn't address on the spot cause he didn't know how to answer
so he was like (um) like between a couple of weeks or two three weeks he kept taking all these anonymous questions that are very different answer
know who so when he found out he was like [oh] my god I need to find this girl and he really went down to the neighbourhoods to find her so I was like okay [lah] when I watch this okay fine this one can I can brain everything (um)
but the ridiculous part was when they got married
and she suddenly like not suddenly she seems like a very patient person but it's <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> the level of patients and the
[ha] it's very unrealistic I feel like people will have broken at some point
she could have
I mean (um) the way that the mother
the mother-in-law was treating her also
ya but I have to say that it was somehow the better ones
my favourite like most ridiculous malay show that I watched was <malay>cinta si</malay> wedding planner
with (uh) starting #mira filzah# and if you know #adi putra#
so okay nope the most ridiculous parts was when first #mira filzah# was twenty four seven
okay not twenty four seven but she was like full time when she's outside so there'll be like bedroom scenes okay not bedroom but she's chilling and then <malay>kat rumah</malay> and she's about to sleep and she's wearing <malay>tudung</malay>
or she's sleeping in her <malay>tudung</malay>
ya
and I'm like you know we can do without these scenes if it's
so difficult [lah] logically
yes
ya that's why like
it's so weird
correct you know the first
like her head [ah] [ah]
or like maybe not the you know the <malay>nenek-nenek</malay> kind
the instant [ha] instant I'm like okay I get it
realistically this does not make sense
ya that's why
which also brings me to that stupid (um) commercial shampoo commercial
<malay>dia cuci rambut tapi dia pakai hijab macam</malay>
[ha] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
what wallet

what if
[eh] what [ah]
ya means can give full bottle already [lah]
I don't know because only until six months you can give milk then after six months you can give food already
ya
ya but the thing is that then like this [one] is I don't know
ya how [eh] when to increase milk
too much I don't know
you see when should I increase my baby ounce oun~ oun~ is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty M_L per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty M_L ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pedi~ pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can [eh] as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty [ah]
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
so ya [lah] <malay>dia nak masuk</malay> two months already
ya so hundred or hundred twenty can [ah]
ya
[oh] ya I <malay>lupa</malay> I need to call seoul garden <malay>bukan</malay> need to call I want to call seoul garden ya I <malay>lupa abeh dia punya</malay> time <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah]

ya
happy birthday to you [oh] ya
no because okay the story is this that time I like <malay>yang masa</malay> I <malay>keluar dengan dia</malay> [kan] then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I just <malay>tanya dia</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like (err) like do you have any plans for his birthday because if not I feel I thought I want to bring him to <malay>pergi</malay> U_S_S then <malay>lepas tu</malay> after that she say [oh] no [lah] nothing [ah] usually <malay>kita</malay> just <malay>pergi makan</malay> [jer]

and <malay>masa tu</malay> time <malay>tu sekolah rendah</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang bawa kita pergi</malay> [ah]
(err) #kampung glam#
it was very interesting at first sight because [ah] I mean <malay>kita kalau macam mana nak cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>kita orang melayu pun kadang-kadang pun tak pergi tempat yang kita punya</malay> culture where it is [what] so it's like when I go there
it's interesting because I found interesting games <malay>macam permainan-permainan orang dulu suka main</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gasing</malay> or #chapteh# <malay>lagi ada</malay> five stones there are five stones
five stones they have five stone [ah] they have five stones and they have like they have this handmade paper plane
and then they have another one with the handmade [ah] where you it's a paper ball where you need to blow on it and then in order for it to expand then make into a round shape then you can just you know play it around like that
so ya I think I am more attracted <malay>dengan dia punya permainan-permainan orang-orang dulu</malay> [lah] [oh] <malay>ada lagi ada congkak dia orang pun ada jual congkak dia ada lagi jual macam-macam</malay> [lah] <malay>macam-macam permainan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam permainan dulu-dulu</malay> I think I'm
from what I heard from my friends like I'm more to like the old side of like I mean ya I'm that I give that kind of vibe to them [lah] like I really like [oh] like old school style like you name it like for me like it's very fun and interesting for me [ah]
happy family you mean yes
[oh] I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of (uh) you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
I would not say I grew up watching it [lah] how would I explain it <malay>dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok</malay> drama korea <malay>macam cuma</malay> drama <malay>melayu macam dekat</malay> channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends (um) she suggested me this [one] at that point of time of the year [ah] the title was boys over flowers
so I bet everybody knows this so <malay>masa tu macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] boys over
flowers best [tau] <malay>cerita dia</malay> [ah] <malay>cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya</malay> then <malay>nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni</malay> then I was like
[oh] okay <malay>mula dengar macam</malay> [oh] okay then when I watched I was like okay it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the whole full episode so it was
it brings me back so much [lah] like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean type of drama they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like [ah]
they I mean they have a lot [lah] but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
[oh] I like
we watch the same thing ya [ah] kitchen nightmares
[oh] those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on M_T_V right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's [ah] go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like !wah! like !wah! you bring me back so much to the time where ya
naive
(err) how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like you say [lah]
it might be I mean I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
like people using fake profiles <malay>macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu</malay> then <malay>orang mesti macam</malay> [eh] I want <malay>tinggi</malay> !wah! <malay>cik lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>buat kawan</malay> [ah] [kan]
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like [ah]
<malay>aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau</malay> I'm here for you like you know
like that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
[oh] ya
movies
(uh)
[oh] movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one [lah] I mean I watched
from the season one to like I think I forgot how they got too many but ya their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next movie to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting [what]
<malay>macam dalam dunia ni itu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> movie [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [kan] based on
non-fiction [what] so it's like <malay>bila ada</malay> movie <malay>macam gini macam</malay> !wah! <malay>macam dia orang pakai macam</malay> magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
[eh] it is so good I wish (uh) I could you know get that kind of (uh) if it was to exist in singapore [lah] or in anywhere like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you
[oh] no okay I know
[oh] okay alright
yes bec~ that is
three hours is because (uh) they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture [what] ya when making movies [lah] but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it [ah] it <malay>dia ada macam</malay> crime scene <malay>kat dalam tu</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
how [ah] you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good [what]
!oof! cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I remember I had
teletubbies <malay>punya patung</malay> I mean I <malay>tak</malay> collect <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two of the characters I think one is the yellow is called laa-laa another one is [ah]
tinky-winky is the purple one the first one with the red handbag
I think of I don't
each and every one of them has their own
own <malay>macam dia orang ada macam dia orang punya</malay> character <malay>dia orang ada macam barang macam</malay> tinky-winky <malay>ada</malay> handbag <malay>kalau</malay> dipsy <malay>dia ada topi dia</malay> [kan] then [ah] laa-laa <malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> orange bounce ball
then for po they have the scooter [ah] po was unique he because po was younger then po has the scooter
but ya tinky-winky also is like
very unique because he has [ah] a red handbag with him
ya so ya I grew up watching tinky-winky I got
you can say spongebob like who doesn't watch spongebob right like spongebob so <malay>macam</malay> spongebob <malay>pun unik juga pasal</malay> spongebob <malay>berkawan dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>dengan apa dengan</malay> starfish they call it right ya <malay>dia berkawan dengan</malay> starfish <malay>kawan dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>sotong</malay>

[oh] sesame street
[oh]
I get it
[oh] no if me it will be
if me it will be (err)
(uh) [oh] [ah] (err) I think it would be ya like I say it's boys over flowers soundtrack that's [ah] same like you when I got into boys over flowers that's where I get to know K pop that's why I get to know certain groups form because of the O_S_T
ya that's ya I mean like ya
of course yes
[ah] titanic
<malay>mesti sudah tentu</malay> titanic <malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>siapa yang dengar nama</malay> titanic <malay>tu mesti tahu cerita pasal kapal</malay> [kan] <malay>cerita pasal kapal</malay>
<malay>mesti cerita pasal kapal</malay>
<malay>cinta</malay> !wah! that was the first movie also right <malay>yang</malay> very popular at that point of time ya so it interesting [eh] <malay>yang ini</malay> [oh] I got a question for you (um) if you have three wishes what would you wish for
<malay>kenapa tu</malay>
<malay>seorang yang tamak</malay>
(err) it'll be money health and food
(err) <malay>terutama saya suka</malay> I <malay>suka makan</malay> I <malay>suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan</malay> [kan] I mean food bring joy to everyone so food is for me
I mean [kan] it's important in everyday life [what] you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
food also is something like <malay>kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kita boleh macam</malay> explore you can go like
<malay>macam</malay> try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
ya that's just a wish [lah] but ya money and health of course health is very important for us [lah] as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all [ah] ya [oh] I have another question for you
[ah]
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
(uh) it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind <malay>pasal yang</malay>
<malay>kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir</malay> [kan] <malay>dia macam dia diam</malay> [jer] <malay>jadi</malay> if
I have that superpower to know what you're thinking <malay>apa dalam minda dia macam</malay> !wah!
I can maybe like let's say <malay>nak buat kawan kita</malay> because I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people [lah] if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like [oh] okay <malay>dia ni rasa macam gini-gini</malay> maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind [what] so
ya for me it will be (err) read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean [ah] you know
[ah] food it's always about food [ah] in the end it's always [ah] it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too [lah] what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
I think I mean like that's part of (uh) your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean <malay>dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada</malay> <malay>macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam</malay>
<malay>yang kecil-kecil</malay> [lah] you know <malay>tapi mana ada yang macam</malay>
and like <malay>tapi apa-apa pun</malay> in the end it's all you know it's all up to you [lah] actually
alright so how about [ah]
K got another question for you okay (err)
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya [ah] okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's true
(mm) I get what you mean
what was [ah] the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like <malay>masuk kedai</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>nak beli baju ni</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>kena bayar tak payah bayar</malay> okay
I mean just <malay>bawa balik</malay> I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] sometimes <malay>kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti guna ke tak guna</malay> [eh] <malay>tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna</malay> so
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
(err) [oh] I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found (uh) if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes this quite interesting
ya I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
be a healing process because like you plant <malay>berkebun</malay> I mean <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>tanam</malay> any <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] any <malay>bunga atau pokok yang</malay> favourite [lah] [kan] <malay>tanam</malay> then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful (uh) peaceful what do you call [ah] called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
<malay>tanam</malay> maybe like you can <malay>tanam</malay> fruits <malay>buah-buahan sayur-sayuran</malay> I got a neighbour [ah] [ah] my neighbour likes to plant [ah]
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
and then the starfruit was it came in a it came in how do I in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common areas also <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada macam tanam cili padi habis</malay> you <malay>nak cili padi daun kari</malay> for me it's very common <malay>daun kari</malay> then <malay>ada apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>macam bunga-bunga</malay>
<malay>bunga</malay> rose I don't know if it's common <malay>bunga</malay> rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
[ah] ya yes
hobbies actually !wah! hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me [lah]
I love to bake I think I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
<malay>tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi</malay> I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury type of (uh) food [what]
so it's like when comes to ya I think my hobby is baking for now [lah] I try I like to venture out on a lot of stuff like I mean I vacant I used to like bake like [ah] I think one of my successful bake was a oreo cheesecake that was
for me that was a biggest step cause usually I will like to take the simpler step like maybe like meringue cookies <malay>macam kuih-kuih tu macam bahan-bahan semua senang-senang macam kalau nak buat kek</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kena bahan ini</malay> [lah] <malay>bahan itu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi nak dia punya</malay> process the process of making it is very hard [what] so for me ya my hobby will be baking how about you what what what would be your hobby or what would you like love to do
prac~ I mean it depends on the person practising (uh)
I mean for me it's best to practise first than you I mean some people like to gamble they just like [ah]
why not you just try you know believe in yourself and just go for it you know but for me I'm the type where practise first you know just to be safe than you know just to gamble like you know do whatever
stuff [lah] ya
of course yes
[ah] favourite <malay>lagu</malay> genre <malay>macam</malay> genre <malay>melayu ke</malay> genre [ah] <malay>sembarang-sembarang apa-apa</malay> genre <malay>kalau apa-apa</malay> genre

make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically (uh) ya very interesting how what do you think
[oh] I understand K
[oh] my god okay
[ah] <malay>faham</malay> ya <malay>ada orang pun fikir</malay>
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people <malay>mesti tengok macam</malay> !wah! <malay>dia ni kacak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam</malay> handsome [jer] [ah] <malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] <malay>fikir-fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> like would you really
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got [ah] another question for you
(uh) [oh] you talk (err) [oh] okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
!alamak! okay that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>ais limau dengan</malay> syrup <malay>limau</malay> ya !alamak! if me K if I were to choose between syrup <malay>limau dengan teh</malay> O ice I will <malay>pilih teh</malay> O ice
I mean syrup <malay>manis</malay> I mean I <malay>teh pun manis</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi teh lagi macam lagi</malay> like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting !wah!
yes correct
I would [oh] wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our !alamak! this also very hard [lah] I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting [ah] country to I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that [ah] from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard [lah] to say but then I mean every country all have different type of culture and different type of (err)
different type !aiya! basically it's culture [lah] but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for us
[oh] no (uh huh)
it's just <malay>mi apa</malay> noodle
ya correct ya
[oh] no okay
[oh]
ya of course me too I won't I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore [lah] like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only [what] what for we will go like [eh] let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place
ya talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya [ah] what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore any places
[oh] of course
<malay>kalau</malay> sound (uh)
any sound [eh]
actually any sound <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>takde</malay> idea <malay>tapi macam</malay> if you were to ask me if [ah] I <malay>tak pergi</malay> where what is [ah] my favourite place to go I will pick (uh)
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers <malay>bunga</malay> basically like I said [lah] <malay>bunga cantik</malay> like I really
you know my favourite [ah] <malay>bunga matahari</malay> is my <malay>kesukaan bunga matahari tu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> every time I <malay>tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia</malay>
the colour <malay>dia</malay> colour <malay>macam cerah</malay> [kan] colour <malay>kuning</malay> [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> what [ah] it will lift up your mood
when you see sunflower for me [lah] for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I ya
yes
if me I know I I heard stories that [ah] rose is hard
to plant and to <malay>jaga macam kalau tanam bunga</malay> rose <malay>tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>selalu</malay>
<malay>kasi dia air</malay> so gotta give it enough sunlight if not it will not grow well [lah] from what I know rose but if I would want to plant it's like I say
<malay>bunga matahari</malay> I <malay>nak tanam pokok bunga matahari</malay> ya
like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course it give you [ah] much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it give you more energy when looking at
plants and looking at [ah] flowers bloom <malay>bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak</malay> [eh]
<malay>pokok</malay> [eh] <malay>bunga cantiknya</malay>
[ah] it will make us <malay>macam</malay> it will make
make us forget about the busy life in this [ah] singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from [ah] from that side that busy [lah] that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these [lah] I also really agree with you on all this cause it's
K
<malay>hari kita nak berbual pasal</malay>
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one [lah]
so I think you can start first [ah]
why batman and iron man s~ specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
those abilities like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] kinaesthetic
kin~ [ah] kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility [ah]
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I mean as in like it's a different perspective [lah]
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you want to be superman <malay>atau pun nak jadi</malay>
batman
[oh] bat sorry batman or iron man okay <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> batman or iron man I would also want a superpower <malay>yang</malay>
can help others
but like for me is basically
[oh] so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
(mm) <malay>dia bukan</malay> specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
[ah] so for me [oh] ya teleporting [eh] didn't actually come across my mind until <malay>tadi sebut</malay> teleporting
(mm) [ah]
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
any place of the world you [tau] <malay>macam</malay> harry potter
harry potter there's this
(err) magic spell I forgot [lah] <malay>apa</malay> magic spell [ah]
where they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot [lah] what's the magic spell
(mm) [ah] disapparate [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age [ah]
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing (err) port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish (err) irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
goblet of fire cedric diggory <malay>yang ada siapa tu yang</malay> handsome <malay>tu nama dia</malay> [ah]
r~ robert pattinson
ya that [one]
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers [ah] wait but I also I
if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
[ah] if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like <malay>macam</malay> switch on and off
K but maybe
[ah] specifically to children [ah] because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard [ah]
like
<malay>budak-budak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kadang-kadang budak-budak pun kita</malay>
<malay>tak faham apa yang dia nak</malay>
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
for me to <malay>macam tahu</malay> what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I think also works for [ah]
adults [ah]
(um) but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
I do not want <malay>macam</malay> to be burdened
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> on and off [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya [lah] but
the thing is on and off [lah] I think every superpower <malay>ada</malay> burdensome
telepathy [ah] [eh] sorry <malay>apa</malay>
teleportation [ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
but it saves time it's very quick
<malay>cepat</malay>
(mm)
ya [ah] but the thing is
you are saving time
it depends [lah] whether you have more time the thing is people I think people <malay>nak</malay> this
teleportation
please [lah] don't cut me off [lah] the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this [lah] but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it [lah] [ah]
ya okay
so that's teleportation
(err)
(um) if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
<malay>macam kalau duit</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> definitely okay
ya
but money to me do it is not everything [ah]
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
[ah] your energy your smile and your
<malay>tolong orang</malay>
okay <malay>apa</malay>
superpower <malay>macam</malay> okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe [ah]
sorry occupational hazard K [ah] teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or <malay>jaga</malay> or <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak nangis datang kasi peluk</malay> to <malay>orang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> nothing [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son #aydin#
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
in the <malay>mata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
!wah! you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
(mm)
(mm)
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited [ah] okay
[orh]
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective [eh]
but what if <malay>naik lemak</malay>
like they <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay>
work hard themselves
they just expect to be given [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay> rich <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] work hard so we just wait for him <malay>apa</malay> to <malay>durian runtuh</malay>
okay
(mm)
okay
(err) but I okay [lah] maybe for you [kan]
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
it's something that you think of [lah] but I to me I think you know me as a person [kan] I'm not a person that wants unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
K
but I [oh] something came across my mind [lah]
ya I know it's just
a superpower
with unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
ya
(mm)
because [ah] okay the thing is something there <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that <malay>apa</malay> I respect it's just that I'm just
showing
the other side of ya
(mm)
okay
that's you were saying superpower
since you were saying superpower <malay>apa ni</malay> your superpower of unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
(mm)
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome [lah]
yes no the thing because I was thinking
if there's if that's if there is someone [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ubat</malay> for COVID nineteen like the perfect <malay>ubat</malay>
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study <malay>belajar macam mana</malay> like
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
[ah]
[ah] the bull's eye of medicine [ah] [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay>
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
free only <malay>untuk</malay>
K the thing is I think [kan] <malay>kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni</malay> [kan]
probably free depending on what type of <malay>ubat</malay>
but also
subsidised
(err) like singapore doesn't give <malay>macam</malay> a lot of things <malay>percuma</malay> free
subsidised
then that [one] you have to talk to the experts [ah]
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
[ah] not everyone
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone <malay>betul tak</malay>
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
<malay>apa</malay> you your superpower that you wanted was
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
knowledge you <malay>pun macam</malay> [meh] (uh) <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
okay so
[eh] so that's about superpower [lah]
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
<malay>macam kena gaya</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> my personality [lah]
[ah]
or do you want to give me a superhero that <malay>macam sama dengan</malay> I wonder woman
or because I can
that is just T_V [lah]
(mm) wonder woman [eh]
is okay wonder
okay can I will start with wonder woman wonder woman is
wonder woman is just <malay>macam</malay> too feminist [ah]
ya
ya [lah]
so but she can do [oh] she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
<malay>cakap bohong</malay>
about wonder wo~
[orh]
okay
about wonder woman <malay>agaknya macam</malay> most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
<malay>tua</malay>
<malay>dia selalu sama umur habis ke</malay>
ya <malay>lambat gila</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai</malay> <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
she had to watch her <malay>kekasih</malay> die
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
[oh] it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
[eh] then that's boring man
[eh] but they are supposed to
I think they will filming [ah] <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> stop <malay>pasal</malay> COVID nineteen [kan]
[oh] <malay>dah habis filem dengan</malay> production [eh]
[oh] because of COVID nineteen then <malay>tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok</malay> [oh]

the promo ended already because [ah] you sign up with a A_I_A insurance then you paid a little bit then you get this price
ya eight dollar <malay>dia</malay> giro not giro [ah]
but it doesn't add up one eight zero
ya
that why <malay>aku rasa macam sayang nak</malay> cancel
ya then is F_F then because my friend say like join GYMMBOXX or anytime fitness then I was like !huh! anytime fitness is like what eighty eight
(mm)
and then <malay>macam</malay> the equipments are not
not that I
<malay>aku bagus</malay> [nah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay>

fever and dengue <malay>dia rabak</malay> [eh] chronic [eh] but this lecturers are your class lecturers or adjunct [oh] okay so only one presentation [ah] <malay>bagus</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku dua</malay> presentation you know week fifteen week sixteen
week fifteen is our ya same module week fifteen is our lecturer itself <malay>macam tiga</malay> lecturer <malay>yang kita ada</malay>
and then like (uh) week sixteen is another lecture that we <malay>tak kenal</malay> ya so it's like (uh) brand new face that see <malay>macam</malay> because our lecturer ya correct
cause that lecturer <malay>kita</malay> [kan] everyday <malay>nampak</malay> [kan] so like they bring this another lecturer then from there <malay>terus</malay> but that particular presentation they see everything like what you did for the whole semester and your portfolio everything ya so it's like (err) that one I can say (uh) make or break [ah]
ya but the adjunct lecturers <malay>semua baik gila</malay> ya
but depends [ah]
is it I don't know what that lecturer is called
[pe] processor ya <malay>entah</malay> [lah] that what name ya
I feel like this sem my lecturers are quite good
cause last sem really it's <malay>rabak</malay> [eh] and I feel ya <malay>entah</malay> maybe because <malay>pasal</malay> like
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] I feel like last year was their year <malay>macam shu dengan</malay> eff~ like eden I feel like this year it's like me and <malay>effy punya</malay> ya their they are so <malay>rabak</malay> !oi! [ah] ya last term
(mm) honestly <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay>
!huh!
same year (uh huh) year one sem two
it was a bad year two sem one this sem mine is good
(mmhmm) [orh] it's your own major right ya <malay>kita</malay> every sem <malay>tukar kelas</malay> ya but fuck
cause
because like honestly I thought this sem <malay>kita akan tukar kelas lagi</malay> but then me and <malay>effy macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>kita geram gila</malay> [ah]
you know we still in the same class <malay>tapi macam</malay> okay how it goes right that
<malay>sama</malay> class so everyone in <malay>sama</malay> class [ah] so basically its like monday tuesday is <malay>kita punya satu</malay> module [jer] <malay>kita ada</malay> for this sem for next coming sem [ah] <malay>satu</malay> module [jer] but we have to choose another three modules that we want to take
<malay>kirakan</malay> major [ah] like what we want
<malay>macam</malay> we have <malay>macam</malay> performance installation we got ya we got a lot [ah] performing arts then we have
<malay>apa tu</malay> packaging motion design <malay>semua</malay> then we can only choose three <malay>aku ambil</malay>
ya part of my module C_D_E cause C_D_E is like cross elective
okay [what] <malay>macam aku ambil</malay> figure drawing is the same [what] but it's still under fine arts [what]
ya graphic comm ya because graphic comm we have a lot of <malay>apa tu</malay> routes to go actually so this one I took we have to choose three then (uh) from that three then <malay>kita belajar</malay> then ya
ya but honestly it sucks because last sem <malay>aku tak dapat ambil dua yang</malay> figure drawing full [kan]
ya so <malay>aku</malay> just have to cause my C_D_A I only have to take two for my module ya !huh! [oh] my god <malay>aku</malay> four [jer] [eh] (mmhmm)
[oh] ya but packaging [ah] the <malay>aku dengan effy</malay> took the same thing we took packaging motion illustration and the other one I forget what [oh] design and brand strategy because honestly (uh) <malay>kalau kita ada tiga ni benda</malay> [kan] then intern <malay>kita</malay> will be easier though ya because like for us <malay>macam apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) whatever we take is to prepare us for the future
ya and honestly <malay>aku tak sabar untuk</malay> intern I don't know why
what is that have [lah] choose your ya correct [oh] for you guys [lah] okay (uh huh) [oh] !wow! [eh] that's good [eh] [eh] that's good
girl you know how we have to get for our intern we have to choose six from like example intern S_G
fastjobs ya exactly then we (uh) these ten slots [kan] we put inside this P_D_F then that P_D_F (uh) for the P_D P_D_P P_D_F [kan] we have to send to our lecturer which is like our P_D_P lecturer [lah] for the whole three years then (uh) she will be chooosing he or she will be choosing for us our intern ya he or she feel that which one is better for us
right exactly that's why I feel like yours is better [oh] okay
cause like I feel like <malay>kita boleh pilih</malay> but at the same time <malay>macam</malay> our lecturer will be the one that ya but (uh) honestly after that after this coming semester [kan] <malay>kita ada</malay> three months holiday right then me and #effy# thought of like <malay>kerja</malay> at any (uh) graphic comm <malay>punya</malay> firm and then from there <malay>kalau</malay> like we feel that in <malay>apa tu</malay> that company is quite good then we just continue until intern [lah]
ya so it's like a smart move right
no it's in year three babe ya [lah] so continue [ah]
<malay>dah ada kerja</malay> what you mean okay (uh huh)
<malay>kerja</malay> for that really [meh] no [lah] I don't think so <malay>tu</malay> I_T_E <malay>ni</malay> diploma
[eh] you okay or not
no [lah] I feel like during okay [lah] I feel
the process it will take place in that sem [lah] week sixteen twenty blah ya
the process then <malay>kau</malay> will first day <malay>macam</malay> for example first day <malay>kau</malay> is during that year three sem one ya I feel like it's like that ya [lah] so <malay>apa yang kau nak</malay> start <malay>dalam</malay> year two sem two ya [lah] the process is year two sem two [lah] ya [lah] okay so that's what I should've say girl
but honestly right I feel yours is better [ah] but it's nerve wrecking also [lah] ya true
(hmm) <malay>entah</malay> [eh] I feel like it's a both pros and cons because
pros is like at least you get to talk
for your own self and like ya you have your own voice and you can <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [ah]
like the companies that choose you can choose yourself you know
then
then after that like (uh) <malay>tak</malay> the cons is like you have to compete with everybody [ah]
and a bit like <malay>macam</malay>
in your face [tau] <malay>macam</malay> company <malay>tu tak nak kau macam</malay> !ouch! <malay>sakit</malay> [sia] honestly right yesterday I saw like a lot of jobs right they <malay>dekat apa tu</malay> indeed <malay>aku nampak banyak macam</malay> art teacher <malay>abeh</malay> those <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
that C word I forget what is that for the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>budak-budak</malay> art
<malay>bukan</malay> taxi [lah] !aduh!
[oh] my god I forget but then it's like something

document doc
the funny part is
I got tell you right that my lecturer showed everyone my C_P_J and ya they (uh) then end up <malay>orang lain punya kerja yang dia pilih aku dah</malay> su~ exactly so I'm like exactly then (uh) #effy# is quite mad ya
<malay>effy dia</malay> #sot# [lah] <malay>tak aku</malay> example it's like really unfair [ah] I don't know why but it's just the school [lah] I can say
you show peop~ <malay>macam orang punya kerja</malay> it's like a good thing [lah] but at the same time it's a very bad thing cause everyone's going to follow you and end up everyone's gonna like
<malay>apa tu</malay> copy yours and do better and after that
<malay>dia orang punya kerja yang kena pilih</malay>
and you are still <malay>kat bawah</malay> trying to survive <malay>padahal kau punya</malay> it's like <malay>orang yang</malay> copy
ya I think there's that [ah]
[eh] <malay>kau suka pergi</malay> hiking <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak aku macam nak pergi</malay> hiking
<malay>aku dah lama mana tak pergi</malay> hiking <malay>abeh</malay> one time <malay>aku kat</malay> N_S <malay>abeh macam mana</malay>
every friday saturday sunday
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
not every [ah] ya can say ya <malay>macam</malay> friday I fetch him and saturday the whole day expo [ah] so every time <malay>dia nak patah balik</malay> sunday ya
sunday
I don't know though honestly it's going better cause at that time [ah] we actually went downhill [lah]
<malay>aku tak bilang siapa-siapa</malay> ya it's like I don't know [ah] at times we <malay>gaduh</malay> and then like but that one time we <malay>gaduh</malay> right quite <malay>rabak</malay> ya but (uh) the thing about us is like even if we fight so much right we won't break it off
ya because we find it <malay>macam</malay> you know if we break it off then what's the point of us <malay>macam</malay> wasting each other's time at the first place right then like ya correct (mm) the thing I like about him right <malay>dia punya</malay> mindset is really mature !oi! he's your age ya
then like I don't know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>dia cakap</malay> like <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>dah tak suka</malay> I <malay>semua ke apa</malay> in our relationship anytime [tau] <malay>kalau aku</malay> just <malay>dah tak ada</malay> feelings but just <malay>bilang dia</malay> and tell him the reason why then if it's like makes sense to him then he'll like let me go [lah] <malay>kalau tak macam</malay> if he wants to make it work [lah] ya so it's like very matured thing [ah] at the same time <malay>kalau kita nak</malay> break it off
we have to really <malay>macam</malay> talk things out to each other and yup I don't see that coming any mean time ya
and then like now it's getting better I don't know I feel like ya
I think that one week before he went N_S we really fight a lot
ya really a lot until we I think he (um) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] I call [kan] <malay>dia tak angkat</malay>
at that point <malay>macam betul-betul</malay> like he like we had enough of each other [lah]
but then <malay>macam</malay> (um) during the N_S period the first few weeks <malay>terus macam makin lama makin</malay> okay then now it's better [ah]
ya cause that time he was on holiday then I was like quite free right <malay>dengan</malay> my school schedule then like we met almost everyday [sia] then I feel like it's because like we are too ya too attached to each other that
we keep fighting then now ya then now we it's good [lah] cause we got our own space and we can focus more ya
and we don't fight a lot also and like you miss that person a lot to fight so ya I don't feel it better [ah]
and like <malay>pejam celik aku</malay> next month [dah] one year <malay>dengan dia dok</malay>
ya you remember that time where we sat at eighteen chefs and then I told you that I like this guy ya <malay>tu masih suka</malay> [eh] <malay>aku masih</malay> (uh) <malay>kerja kat</malay> U_S_S [seh] <malay>baru</malay> [oh] my gosh then now <malay>dah nak</malay> one year it's quite fast [eh] really fast

and there
I saw and then I was like
[eh]
okay dear then I wanted to take a second look but then I'm like okay <malay>tak apa</malay> if I take a second look the one sitting on my left would notice that I saw something
so I <malay>diam</malay>
then like that again at the corner of my eyes it's just like that again then okay

<malay>ramai-ramai</malay>
!wah! irritating [ah] playing around
[ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]

short [eh]
<malay>tak</malay> then you so daring to take three takes
scare yourself first
ya
exactly but how they are the one doing the task [tau] which are brushing the teeth and washing the dishes
<malay>kira pada</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> !siala! <malay>aku mangsa keadaan</malay> [seh] <malay>aku tengah menjalani hidup aku</malay>
don't
and then have you heard any in F_F okay let's not touch our own club because like we don't want to scare ourself like that
no
don't know
okay in our club obviously there is [lah] but like I just choose to ignore it
because like I'm gonna work there for very long time you know like witch we work together
but you've never seen
ya
ya
ya so like they all tell me the story I'm like [ah] ya ya and then later this new person <malay>mama dia</malay> was like she found one yet and I'm like (uh) (uh) <malay>nurul kata memang ada</malay>
like you what me you what you want me to do like
I never see but like it's true <malay>benda memang jadi</malay>
so I cannot deny [lah] I <malay>rasa mesti ada</malay>
but hundred A_M bro
bro hundred A_M is fucking real bro
you close club at ten o'clock ten [oh] ten you never come out the thing <malay>halau</malay> you [lah] [sia]
the thing will take dumbbell and smash on the floor
yes
yes
<malay>budak-budak sana</malay> [lah]
so minnie <malay>kena apa</malay> [tau] closing and minnie is a kind n~ that's not like us [tau] <malay>macam pakai benda terus buka boleh keluar</malay>
hers is like <malay>memang kena tukar seluar baju</malay> makeup bag alright
so closing shift ya so she's doing all that
suddenly she turn around <malay>ada orang macam dia rasa ada orang pekik dekat muka dia</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
because she's taking too long to get out from the club
whenever then do you know how hundred A_M is last time right to~ tower counter and then you have to go down the stairs
you know right so that stairs minnie <malay>pernah jalan</malay>
<malay>orang tolak dia benda tolak dia gila babi sampai dia terus</malay> land <malay>dekat bawah</malay>
that is like I think like
seven six flight of stairs
time
<malay>orang tolak dia terus macam</malay> <malay>lepas tu dia terus jatuh dia jatuh</malay> all the way to the floor
(mm) (mm) all the way down
<malay>terus macam</malay> okay
ya so like the part where
the <malay>benda</malay> will always
the <malay>benda</malay> will always <malay>macam apa ni</malay>
(uh)
<malay>apa tu</malay>
ya like
bang the weights all this <malay>semua orang pernah kena</malay>
everyone that's one hundred A_M always <malay>tutup</malay> exactly
ten O two
ten o'clock <malay>semua orang dia dah halau</malay>
because <malay>dia orang pun tak nak kena</malay>
ya so <malay>macam</malay> [eh] !siala! <malay>kau orang ni</malay> real [siol]
ya exactly
so the thing is
okay another story is it's a shopping mall
and then
the connected to the hotel <malay>apa</malay> the for the swimming pool
ya maybe so
<malay>pagi orang</malay> opening shift so opening shift
<malay>masuk</malay>
no opening shift is <malay>masuk</malay> !siala! I open the shutter I have to be the first person there
unless I open shutter aunty cleaner <malay>ada</malay>
with me
then there will be two of us correct
<malay>dia</malay> open shutter <malay>dia nampak</malay> member <malay>jalan</malay>
so <malay>dia macam</malay> sir the gym is not open yet
<malay>kau</malay> first person [tau] <malay>buka apa yang kau nak berbual dengan</malay> member
so (uh) then I say why you say like that no because I didn't think like that [lah] I think <malay>macam</malay> member <malay>macam</malay> (uh) coming from the swimming pool like you forget to lock the door or what then he sneak in
so I was telling him that
we haven't open then I follow him so that okay let's say [ah]
one row of treadmill
dock
pillar
so this person <malay>jalan</malay> towards this treadmill <malay>ni</malay> pillar [eh] <malay>jalan</malay> this way so this I thought <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau nak main</malay> catching I will walk here and <malay>kejar</malay> you surround you here
so <malay>dia dah tunggu sini tunggu orang ni tak jalan-jalan</malay> so <malay>dia tengok tak ada</malay>
and <malay>dia macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] maybe <malay>orang ni dah keluar pergi</malay> back door <malay>ke apa</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah keluar balik dekat</malay> shutter <malay>dia pergi tengok dekat</malay> C_C_T_V <malay>dia berbual seorang</malay>
<malay>dia kejar benda</malay> nothing
and then me <malay>asal kau buka</malay> C_C_T_V <malay>asal kau</malay> very curious
<malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>aku nak kena tengok betul-betul apa dia masuk daripada pintu mana aku nak tengok</malay> closing shift <malay>semalam tak tutup pintu ke apa</malay> I need to know
<malay>sekarang kau dah tahu sendiri kau berbual dengan siapa tu</malay>
<malay>kau nak hidup kau ni sekarang apa maksud dia</malay> <malay>hidup kau tak ada makna</malay> [tau] <malay>hidup kau tu permainan syaitan</malay>
shit right
to me right okay
that is real too because you really show yourself
<malay>macam benda yang macam kena tolak ni semua</malay> okay [ah] <malay>kena pekik</malay> you know you hear it you feel the air but you don't see it
<malay>tapi ni sampai kau nampak orang</malay>
have more extreme one but I just feel like don't want to tell
K the less extreme one
(uh) you know how trainers are very tired
do you know how trainers are very tired right
<malay>terus dah</malay> tired <malay>gitu</malay> and then
and then they will sleep
they will have a nap
so #lasiri# was sleeping
<malay>terus dia kena hempap</malay>
so [ah] so ya people when they say <malay>hempap</malay> [eh] <malay>hempap ni semua dia ada</malay> scientific reason
there is a scientific reason for all that [what]
then
when I say cannot [ah] will say no bro
when I <malay>tengah itu aku buka aku dapat buka mata cuma aku tak dapat pekik aku dapat buka mata</malay>
<malay>aku dapat buka mata</malay> [kan] and then
and then <malay>dia kata apa ni</malay>
(err) I saw the <malay>lembaga</malay>
sitting on top of me damn big
so she's a trainer [what] so she went to this one guy
!hey! bro
<malay>kau tengok</malay> [eh] chest <malay>aku</malay> [eh]
<malay>rabak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kau kena hempap</malay>
then <malay>dia macam</malay> !huh! <malay>aku tak bilang kau apa-apa</malay>
how you know
<malay>aku pun kena</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan lembaga besar</malay> [kan] <malay>mata merah</malay> !huh! <malay>kau pun kena aku dah selalu kena</malay> #wei#
ya so this so <malay>bermakna</malay> before she even tell that guy already know
how that thing looks like what happened to her because it happened to him as well
so like to me right
if you tell me alone I will say you world but because
there is a cross referencing
the two person experiencing the same thing then I feel like [eh] maybe real #siot#
[kan]
yes and it's fucking big so that fucking big thing is the same thing that
snatches the weight at night
that gets angry
(uh) ya same
[eh] you ask and then you say no right same I also did that <malay>siapa</malay> [sial] [eh] <malay>tak apa jangan jawab</malay>
<malay>sama bila rasa tekan malam-malam</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa</malay> [sial] <malay>gila babi</malay> [eh] <malay>tak apa</malay> sorry <malay>jangan jawab aku tak nak tahu aku</malay> #paiseh# <malay>aku</malay> #paiseh#
<malay>bodoh</malay> I scared [sia]
and then they'll be like

but do you know the swensen soup in the bread if they put sourdough then I'm like shit
(uh) (uh)
the bread is the sourdough
#siot# [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> mood [sia]
(uh) it is it's just a very wheat bread to me
(uh) (uh)
(uh) pizza hut they have one day this meal they call it
curry zazzle
I don't like it also but then that is the only thing that is spicy
so like I have to eat spicy food right
and always because when I go out right I feel very hungry I can't even wait for the baked rice to cool down I will end up burning my tongue
!wah! means you reach work #swee#swee# [sia]
I no time to this one know
cannot no time I know [lah] every time go work
from here I know
ya it is near you know right from my house when you walk when you want to walk to the M_R_T that's really like if you walk relax seven minutes if you walk like me
four minute
then I usually wait for the train like one or two minute
then it takes another eight minutes to raffles place from raffles place to our workplace [ah] that one is the problem
outside where then jaywalk
[oh] then you can walk
you quite smart [hor]
I've never thought of that [leh]
!wow!
shit
ya but because I think like clifford <malay>tu macam kena jalan kena tempuh</malay> clifford <malay>kena tempuh</malay> like Q_R [tau]
okay
(err) my day today was okay it was quite a slow day (uh)
because I didn't do much (uh) today
(um) I got up got some coffee
then
I open my computer
watch some YouTube videos
and then I tried to update my resume
resume for my resume for work [lah]
I haven't actually applied for anything
(err) I was there was this (err) job link that #adli# sent me
it's from Apple
ya the phone Apple
(err)
the job <malay>punya</malay> name if I'm not wrong it was <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) annotation analyst
at least if I remember correctly [lah] but then there was an addendum to the title
that said (uh) it was (uh)
malay language specialist
it should be [ah] or <malay>siapa-siapa yang boleh faham</malay> [ah] <malay>melayu</malay>
ya but the job <malay>punya</malay>
the job <malay>punya</malay> description !wah! was not that bad (uh)
basically just listen to
transcriptions [oh] sorry (err) listen to audio <malay>punya</malay> files
and then
transcribe them into
words [ah]
then I think most of the audio would probably be in malay I think it's for Siri
no I think it's like maybe <malay>macam</malay> N_L_P <malay>punya</malay> type of thing (uh)
(err) natural language processing
ya basically [ah] but I think there's also another aspect of <malay>macam</malay>
(err) natural language processing <malay>punya</malay>
feel
which is more concern with (err) A_I and machine learning
where the
the A_I itself
actually (err) learns language
because [kan] you know <malay>ada</malay> debate [kan] whether language is
(err) nature or nurture <malay>macam</malay> whether there is a biological foundation for language
or whether it's completely nurtured
ya
then (err)
so
so ya [lah] the I think they want to do that on two fronts
the first is to figure out
the brain <malay>punya</malay> mechanics in obtaining language and I think they want to see whether they can apply that to A_I ke <malay>tak</malay> whether the A_I can learn
[ah] yes I will be part of that
[a'ah]
soon [lah] in a few days [lah] I want to see no I want to see if they can actually I can actually just apply with my current resume
because my results [kan] <malay>belum keluar</malay>
so like
I got no results
the
if I apply then like a bit weird (uh) but I'm quite sure I will pass [lah] so I think <malay>tak ada hal kalau nak</malay> apply [jer]
(err)
so far no (uh) except for a few that I saw (err)
special education <malay>punya</malay> teacher
<malay>kat</malay> A_S_P_N
(err) wherever [lah] I think there's a few locations
because I fall into the <malay>macam</malay> the
no like (err) I meet the requirements ya
(mm)
okay [lah] the exam was
only one exam was quite difficult (uh) the other three <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [jer] (uh) okay [ah] I did two of them quite well (err)
ops management which was just basically a lot of maths
and (err) second language learning
which was basically all theory
so it was quite easy (uh)
the best [eh]
probably second language learning
!huh! why
no (uh) because it's like I mean it's rooted in theory [what] so it's more difficult to screw up
but at the same time <malay>kalau dia</malay> rooted in theory
that means if you don't get everything you won't get the highest <malay>punya</malay> score possible
ya I just want to pass
(mm) ya
your leave
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
wait pause they made you take
a test
[oh] so <malay>macam</malay> what are your strengths what are your weaknesses <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
[ah]
skewed biased
I mean the name of the workshop is strength training [eh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya your boss's boss
wait he got cut off [oh] because the break up room <malay>punya</malay> time was ending
ya
(mmhmm)
!huh! how come your computer shut down in the room
[oh] so the
so basically the zoom thing crash [lah] nothing wrong with your computer [lah]
okay good
<malay>sebarang</malay> [jer] [siol] leave in the middle of the thing
but then it's not like it's the <malay>benda ni</malay> compulsory [kan]
!whoa!
okay (uh)
I sat in the chair
<malay>belajar</malay> all the way like for hours and hours straight
but it's okay [lah] I mean I managed to
(err) get the most out of my studying
no difference
ya I got all the info I needed
like
the
the only issue was (err)
for the eighteenth century <malay>punya</malay> lit
that [one] maybe I could have spent some time going over the actual books and where the quotes were
<malay>tak</malay>
as in like I know
can I know the story I know everything then I just need to know how it goes and then I just pick and choose the parts that I want [ah]
I mean
it's work for me throughout the four years (uh) for all my lit <malay>punya</malay> courses [ah] plus I hate lit (uh) so
no I went for the english aspect
not for the lit
<malay>asal</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>apa dia</malay>
[ah]
then he suddenly appears
<malay>menyibuk</malay>
<malay>tak menyibuk</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tak cukup</malay>
<malay>tak cukup perhatian</malay>
but what
jaden smith
your crazy midnight shift [eh]
(mmhmm)
left <malay>maksud</malay>
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
so
so basically there was no person in charge [lah] for the thing
!wah! co in charge [lah]
on the ups
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
after six A_M
[oh] okay
[oh]
[oh] <malay>kejap</malay> pause
but the appointment <malay>pukul enam pagi</malay>
[oh] okay
<malay>nak kena siap apa</malay> [seh] you just need to go over to the location [pe]
ya
(hmm)
so he's new
[ah]
(mm)
okay so he's not actually <malay>baru</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
[oh]
so your shift doesn't deal with <malay>macam</malay> N_E_A <malay>punya barang-barang</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa</malay> N_E_A and (oo)
wait
cannot say
confidentiality
[eh] to whoever's listening
confidential okay
(mmhmm)
<malay>kirakan dia</malay> lost [ah]
the what thing
[oh] okay
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
yes
like why they put you in the same crazy shift again
(mm) (err) on the days you're schooling
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
ya
ya
okay N_E_A shift is what time to what time
<malay>tiga pagi juga</malay>
you
[oh] you cannot request for shift change [eh]
[oh] for your class [eh]
[eh] I think I destroyed your chair
[oh] okay
<malay>kita orang macam</malay> chair destroyers [eh]
ya
but
but wouldn't it be nice to have like a new shift
like no more normal timing
it feels like
it feels like you've been on this shift
for like
at least a year already
because like everytime like
you have to sleep like so early at night then wake up so early
it's
ya
ya because like
your
(mm)
ya
ya
or see people first
and then go to work at night
ya
so there's like no time basically
I mean even on your off days also most likely <malay>kena tidur</malay> [kan]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
it's like a fake off not rea~ I think it's a shift <malay>punya</malay> thing (uh) <malay>pasal dulu</malay> #nasri# <malay>pun bila dia tengah kerja</malay> shift
I think you felt the same way in that
<malay>macam</malay> even on his off days his time was taken up by
<malay>tidur dulu</malay> because you need that rest before you can actually
take a break if that makes sense
(mmhmm)
[oh] shit serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
justin bieber
[oh]
[oh] they are not big fans of justin bieber
(mm)
wait so you mean different <malay>punya</malay> clients
have different workflows [eh]
so like the process itself also is like completely different is it
[oh] ya [lah]
you better do it
ya
serious [ah]
(mm)
ya
but then it's a bit
it's a bit (err)
weird
I think especially because <malay>macam lain-lain punya</malay> organisation <malay>ada lain-lain punya</malay> processes
so <malay>macam</malay>
like
there's no
solid base to work from within your own organisational <malay>punya itu</malay>
like it's dependent on the client rather than the <malay>itu</malay>
that's tough so like every new client that you shift to
it's like an entirely new learning curve for you (uh)
the previous shift
<malay>terlalu banyak apa</malay>
comp~ complacent [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
I don't know (uh) I think
honestly to me
<malay>janji kerja dia habis dah habis cerita</malay>
like just get the job done get it done and over with and then send (uh)
in what sense
(mm)
what do you mean <malay>kena macam tu</malay> [eh] <malay>apa</malay>
first come first serve <malay>siapa nak ni dia cakap dulu gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh]
ya
(mm)
wait
<malay>pukul lima</malay> five in the morning
okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
ya like you
and you don't want to be the kind <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tanya macam</malay> !oi! you want or not [eh] you want or not <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] ya
and I think like you want other people to step up also right
like I have a feeling like usually the one <malay>yang</malay> step up is you and not all those other people <malay>yang itu</malay>
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>ada apa</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
jaded
(mm)
[oh] okay
I was actually going to make a joke
<malay>pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>ada apa budak baru nama</malay> jaden [kan] <malay>abeh</malay> seniors <malay>dia</malay> jaded
so jaden <malay>dengan</malay> jaded <malay>sama-sama</malay>
never mind let them cringe <malay>janji kita punya</malay> audio <malay>dorang dapat</malay>
[ah] okay [lah]
<malay>betul tak betul</malay>
(mm)
wait pause it's like we're having a conversation
with a third people listening in
but there are only two people
who are physically present here
no
!huh!
ya they know we also know
no it's like <malay>bila kita orang dua orang</malay> [jer] <malay>berbual macam</malay>
if there was no recording between us it will be like okay but now the opportunity presents itself for us to share
our knowledge and our language with a third person
<malay>kalau orang melayu apa</malay> [ah]
no there's like a
like home wrecker [eh]
no there's
<malay>ada</malay> there's a (uh) there's a phrase I think for home wreckers
<malay>macam</malay> like [ah] is it
is it <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I think it's <malay>kayu tiga</malay>
ya there's
no now that one person has more (uh)
voc~ malay vocabulary to transcribe
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
[oh] okay [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean we're having
<malay>macam</malay>
ya
I don't know (uh) but see like the thing is the thing is when I'm talking to you right now
[kan] it is
I feel like I adopt the same cadences
as if I was talking to the person who is listening to this
ya
so I think it's fine [ah] it's not like I put on any ass for the camera
what kind of conversation that you can I think it should be acceptable [lah]
!aiya!
[ah]
[a'ah] [sia]
I mean maybe the design of <malay>dia punya</malay> H_D_B blocks also plays a part [lah]
but at the same time <malay>tak</malay> [kan] you shouldn't be banging stuff when it's so close to time <malay>orang nak balik rumah</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] of course [lah] it's their job
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>orang sia-sia</malay> [jer] <malay>ketuk-ketuk</malay> [siol]
just anime like
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] anime
#weeaboo# <malay>kalau melayu apa</malay> #weeaboo#
<malay>kalau</malay> indo #weeaboo#
are we allowed to swear no right
okay
I will try not to swear
I've been watching (um)
<malay>apa</malay>
(err) Fire Force
old
it's new it's twenty
it's twenty nineteen and twenty
basically a fire fighting force
but the fires that they fight
are magical fires
and they have magical powers of fire
and then there's some conspiracy thing behind it that I think you will like
because you like all these weird conspiracy things right
no spoiler because
(err)
part <malay>dia pun belum sampai dalam</malay> anime <malay>dia</malay>
(err) there's two seasons
now second season ongoing
they had to stop for a while <malay>pasal</malay> COVID
ya
ya Evangelion
Evangelion
(uh) apparently january next year in japan [lah] <malay>tapi kat</malay> singapore <malay>belum tahu</malay> [ah]
maybe add three or four months
[ah] ya
in japan
[oh]
but (mm)
ya but then like I wonder what the logistical issue would be in importing the movie over to singapore not much right
it's just the digital transfer of the thing right
just send the raw digital file [ah]
they have their own I'm quite sure they have their own <malay>macam</malay>
cinema <malay>punya</malay> based cloud storage that helps them to transfer everything
cloud
[oh] ya
but wait
there are no more actual physical films that are screened right in singapore most
that's the only one [ah]
I feel like the projector also uses digital now
they should have like some sort of niche hipster kind of place where they screen film like that
is it but then again like with film you can see like there's a lot of (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
artefacts
(err) to do with the film [ah] let's say <malay>macam kalau dah habuk ke apa sikit</malay> then you can see brief flashes on the
from the film itself <malay>abeh nanti macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>dia punya tu</malay>
but then again
ya that's the thing <malay>macam kalau</malay> film it's like
with the film itself you are not restricted to resolution
you are actually projecting it based on light and the image not the pixel <malay>punya</malay> density
like with digital all like you are constrained by <malay>dia punya</malay>
the pixels [ah] and the resolution that it was framed at [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you know lord of the rings
the reason why there's no lord of the rings in four K
is because <malay>dia punya</malay> digital effects were actually rendered in ten eighty P
ei~ either ten eighty P or fourteen forty P or something ya which was the maximum resolution at that time in two early two thousands (uh) two thousand one to two thousand and four
<malay>ada apa</malay>
<malay>dah ada apa</malay>
<malay>takde</malay> [ah] but it weren't limited like if you film
the actual film
like
(err) like
for example now you take the film camera right then you film something outside
you are not limited to resolution that means you can just render the thing in four K when you download it and edit it digitally but
the thing is at that time with lord of the rings
they filmed it most of it on film
but all the C_G_I and the extra <malay>punya barang-barang</malay>
was (err) ten eighty P <malay>punya</malay> rendering so if they were to upscale that to four K
the problem would be whether <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dorang nak bikin balik tak semua dia punya</malay> effects
or whether <malay>dorang nak apa</malay>
(err) just use the existing <malay>punya</malay> rendering
and then upscale to four K <malay>tapi macam buruk</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> zoom in <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] that's the kind of effect
[ah] ya <malay>macam</malay> stretched <malay>gitu</malay>
or like something someone would draw in paint
<malay>tak kasi dia makan dulu</malay>
<malay>tunggu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
I don't know why for some reason when I laugh very hard on this thing through my nose
then it clips the recording
like
like the [kan] the thing become red right
ya that's clipping I think
ya but
but
speedy
ya
ya
I want to make a film you got camera right
you got camera right
just film any wait I write the script
I write the script
then
(err)
can I direct also
obviously no I think you can you be
no you director of photography
basically
!huh!
I mean you have an eye for the frame [what]
[ah] ya [lah] you have an eye for the frame I will write in the script <malay>macam mana dia punya</malay> scene develops
and then after that you will get like
you know like the three quarter removed <malay>punya</malay> angle or like
what there's a
I think there's a like different terms for different things (uh) like
<malay>macam</malay> the #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay>
stanley #kubrick# <malay>punya</malay> follow through the halls
behind ya that kind of shot [ah]
(mm)
A U T E U R [eh]
[a'ah]
#auteur#
ya
but
no <malay>tak nak</malay>
(err) anything [ah] can also (uh)
<malay>tapi macam kenyang</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] Gong Cha
just put for me whatever order you think is nice
but ya I think can be done
but I feel like
I have the image
in my head
but I don't know
how to work the camera to achieve that <malay>itu</malay>
flexible
in what sense
(mm)
okay ya
(mm)
[oh] to get [ah] ya I mean
it might
no
I think director <malay>macam gitu</malay> is
<malay>dorang dah</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> successful <malay>dah ada banyak duit</malay> then
the ego that comes with it is <malay>itu</malay> (uh)
but I think
if I were to write
a movie
confirm I will write it
in
bearing in mind at the back of my head that there are
budgetary and (err) location locational constraints
ya
anything mix also can
drama
I think I will try to go by genre first
probably be a psychological drama
like something that makes you dig deep inside your head ya
it's like that's the only thing that I actually want to achieve
but in terms of the story
I think it can go anywhere [ah] doesn't necessarily have to be <malay>macam</malay>
horror or <malay>itu</malay> it can be like drama
but with
a
psychological (uh) age not twist [ah] like psychological age that really examines the human psyche
because I feel like that's what movies are all about [ah]
that looking into the
the person and the nature of the person <malay>macam</malay> who are you <malay>gitu</malay>
(err)
quite a few actually
Handmaiden was good but it's not
okay [ah] stimulating [ah] but it wasn't like
it's like in what I have in my head is halfway between an art film
and a sci-fi film
it's like (um)
like you know Annihilation
nata~ ya that's like I think one of the
the best
because it is
it is the movie
<malay>macam</malay> telling you
telling you to look inwards
but
but it doesn't explicitly tell you what it is that you need to be looking for
ya and (err)
jurassic park also is another one
no but the thing the thing about jurassic park is
no it's not nostalgia the thing that I love about the original jurassic park the first one not the Lost World
(err) J_P three was a mess but I just watched it for fun
the thing that I like about the original <malay>punya</malay> jurassic park is
is like it is an
ethical dilemma
that (err) that <malay>apa</malay>
discusses
within the movie itself discusses power roles
it's like as humans
you know we have this power
and then it's no longer a dilemma
by the time the movie rolls about
because the humans in power have exorcise
sorry exercised
that option
and now they are no longer the ones in power
ya
ya correct but like
it
it kind of moves beyond <malay>macam</malay> like what constitutes
through
(err) power
you know and like
a display of real fear
like how you know there was a scene of the guy <malay>yang dia</malay>
(err) <malay>apa ada</malay> T-rex
then after that <malay>dia</malay> abandoned <malay>budak-budak</malay> then after that <malay>dia terus dia lari masuk</malay> toilet then T-rex <malay>gigit kepala dia</malay>
ya
like that's the one's like there's true fear man
ya
directors you know director damn smart
(err)
let's see
[ah] the wailing
the wailing
it's like
it's like (err) <malay>macam</malay>
you are like the other person is
what you want to see in that person so like whatever that person does it
to an extent it doesn't really matter
because it's like all you know within you see that's like that's the kind of thing like I want to get and the wailing was like
between
horror supernatural sci-fi and an art film
(mm)
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
ya and then like
are they just what you would like to impose on them
(mm)
I think they shou~
go to the house
ya
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya [a'ah]
(mm)
I don't know I cannot I cannot remember that particular detail [ah]
I only remember the beautiful shots of the <malay>itu</malay>
all the gloomy scenes where like they make the people like really small like to show like you know how
it's like it is significant like you and your thoughts are significant in the way that
it impacts the view of the world around you but at the same time you're also insignificant like what
just being nice
and the shots with the ghost woman also <malay>macam lawa gitu</malay>
it's very <malay>macam</malay> ethereal
<malay>mana satu</malay>
I don't think you were with me
was it the
[oh] ya that's okay we watched that [one]
we watched that [one] in the cinema (uh)
I cannot remember but it was the director of <malay>pengabdi setan</malay>
but I want to watch <malay>pengabdi setan</malay> [ah] where to watch [ah]
<malay>malam ni</malay>
nevermind [ah]
I think that [one] will I probably will have to watch with #rehan# lights off speakers on
[oh]
(mm)
ya but
I think the easiest step
is to write the script
make the script as perfect as we can and then we can edit it along the way
nope
I can just wing it [ah]
because I took the scriptwriting <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>apa</malay>
[eh] I got A you know don't play you know
you make the film I write the script <malay>dah</malay> settle [ah]
director of photography [ah]
written and directed by then I put my name
I just want to see that
what
[ah]
no you know no
no [lah] we do it properly [lah] but I just want to see like
one of my dreams aside from (err) getting
(uh) machines to learn language on their own
is to have a film
and then it says written and directed by
ya that's it
[oh] ya
no need [ah] low budget [ah] indie
live what
no [lah] it's like an aside thing it's not like it's like you know like we spend
no [lah]
we put I mean yes I'm going to put my whole heart and soul into it but when I'm free [lah]
ya no
or we can do it every other weekend
try to film as many scenes as we can in one weekend
[oh] ya correct
okay [lah] then when we on our off day then we do [ah]
I think can no worry can be done
[oh] ya also I think I might be actually getting the expensive G_P_U
not anytime soon [lah]
like next year
like next year because <malay>tu apa tu</malay>
(uh) my G_P_U hot [ah]
then like it's not keeping up with the fourteen forty P
like my monitor <malay>punya</malay> resolution <malay>terlalu tinggi</malay> for the card
so <malay>macam</malay> I need a stronger card
your card okay right
no as in like
it's not like
lagging out in games or [what]
[ah] whatever game you can try you try [ah]
(mm) you never try Borderland three
buy [ah]
isn't it like thirty plus bucks and black friday sale coming so I think confirm <malay>murah punya</malay> maybe like thirty-ish maybe less
I know #rehan# that time buy on sale thirty seven S_G_D <malay>murah</malay>

okay [lah]
[oh] okay
!huh!
I want to take one
#nezuko#
then why do you order two
ya why you order four
you
you keep it in rotation [ah]
ya [lah] so you rotate those masks also one
why no fear
ya as in
no the thing is
the thing about demon slayer
is that it has reached
the crossover threshold
ya it's no it is no longer limited to
just the #weeaboos# it is now in the realm of the normies also
ya
that's why it's so <malay>macam itu</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> I don't like it [ah] because all the <malay>mat reps semua macam tengok macam</malay> (uh) demon slayer
then I'm like bro you don't know what the #weeaboos# go through
I think
(mm)
ya
ya like it takes away from the
from the ya the value the perceived value of the movie
ya I think it's
it's very oxymoronic [ah] in that
you want
you want these things to succeed
because in order for them to continue making these things
like they need to
there to be a certain scale of popularity
but at the same time when they blow up
then it becomes like
[oh] no like I am no longer special
ya
ya
(mm)
(uh) #haikyu# is not that
(mm)
<malay>tu semua</malay>
<malay>boleh beli dari</malay> AliExpress [pe]
ya
Hunter X Hunter is quite popular
ya I know
ya
ya like I wanted to buy like
figurines for
#oregairu#
the
my teen romantic comedy SNAFU
because like the name is actually the title of the anime is actually anti tactical to
the theme of the
of the thing because it's actually <malay>dia macam</malay>
grounded in realism
<malay>macam</malay> with real respect for people <malay>punya</malay> feelings and not just some
random rom com <malay>yang dorang macam sebarang</malay> #rojak# <malay>letak kat dalam ni semua abeh</malay> mix <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>janji kelakar habis</malay> [ah]
ya like it was well thought out and well written [ah]
but ya the series just ended like a few months back
like the entire I think that was the fourth season third or fourth season [ah]
but ya the series just ended but then I cannot find any figures so sad
ya
(mm)
but at the same time like you must also consider <malay>macam kat</malay> japan [kan]
how it works is usually
<malay>yang</malay> the source material <malay>dorang punya</malay> #manga# <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> light novel <malay>ke</malay> visual novel <malay>ke</malay> [pe]
has to be actually very popular <malay>dalam</malay> its own format
in japan itself
before it is being adapted
into anime
like very rarely are there anime originals
and when there are they're either brilliant
or <malay>sampah habis</malay>
ya
so that's basically how it works (uh)
(mm)
different <malay>ke</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
[oh]
so <malay>sahaja</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>dia ambil</malay>
(mm)
(hmm)
(mm)
J drama
(mm)
[ah] I watch one but I can't remember the name
real dramas [eh]
(mmhmm)
makeup

so
mama
so mama you already you know right that <malay>kakak</malay> [kan] <malay>suka makan ayam goreng</malay> right and then lately <malay>kakak macam makan</malay> popeyes <malay>sebab</malay> I think popeyes <malay>punya ayam goreng</malay> is way nicer than K_F_C what do you think
but I think
popeyes <malay>punya ayam</malay> is more crunchy [eh] I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to K_F_C and then ya the mashed potato popeye <malay>punya</malay> like <malay>lebih sedap</malay>
and then compared to K_F_C <malay>punya tak sedap langsung</malay> I mean like it's nice
K_F_C's one is nice but
(err) the popeyes' one has a lot more things in it compared to K_F_C is just like mashed potato and the gravy but popeyes is like gravy mashed potato then got like the vegetables and everything
ya
(mm)
[oh] ya you know (err) starbucks right now cause (err) christmas
starbucks right now it's christmas right so
(err) they got the toffee nut
crunch latte and then they got these new other flavours also like really want to try before because that time so many times I want to try never get to try the starbucks one before but ya
(err) but they say it's quite sweet because my friend
allowed me to like taste some of hers then it's was like okay [lah] quite sweet but actually quite nice also
and then they got the one at N_T_U_C they sell the packet [one] also
feel like buying it because you know like home
like
I be my own barista at home right because of co~ (err) coronavirus and everything
so ya do you want to try it with me
I want I don't know I want like I want what's that called the turkey with the cranberry sauce
I don't know why but I think because I watch
so many videos of people like preparing christmas
dinners thanksgiving dinners then I'm like I keep on wanting it and also want my
what's that called [ah] gingerbread cookie because
<malay>lagi-lagi</malay> like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
and then [oh] christmas cake the log cake everything ya I also want that one
ya
ya that's why
and then
like right now also I think you know I got my performance right then everybody want to celebrate also very hard because
(um) because of the coronavirus the maximum group of five thing and all
which is okay [lah] but at the same time quite sad especially when it's around this time of the year when it's like christmas and then everyone to
everyone want to throw like chalet or like meet up to gather together
but then you still have to wear your mask <malay>macam susah</malay> and then it's also <malay>tak</malay> fun <malay>langsung sebab</malay>
you cannot meet your friend
ya
[oh] ya they got the hundred dollar fees the hundred dollars
tourism voucher right and then like
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> complain
<malay>dia susah</malay> to <malay>dapat</malay> the vouchers <malay>sebab ada berapa banyak</malay> website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website <malay>tu</malay> then in the process <malay>semua pun macam</malay> very <malay>sulit</malay> and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> first of december
and then starting to starting on monday also got the mask
can take our masks also I don't know if you know
ya
I don't know [eh] I think so like I saw at <malay>kita punya</malay> void deck they put the poster everything then they say (um) start date thirtieth this monday [lah] thirtieth november until like
two weeks later
ya and it's very dirty and like very uncomfortable already cause the metal keep like the metal thing at the nose is like twisted and bent already
haven't yet school holidays still got school
ya
like usual [lah]
ya
I also don't know we all don't know yet
[oh] I don't know I see first how cause we also don't know what we want to do with the vouchers cause in case we got any celebration or what
then (uh)
the mask
ya the mask I never put in the washing machine but it because keep on using and then keep on washing then like when you dump in your bag when you take it off or like when you want to eat all these are very hard
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean <malay>kemas</malay> and then the after is yellow very dirty then <malay>macam asyik lunyai</malay> and everything so ya
the one that I painted all cannot use because the paint smell very strong then if I tried wearing it but then
like he did like that
ya
ya cannot
ya even after washing cannot wear cause it's very (err) smelly and all
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask <malay>tak boleh dipakai</malay> so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that <malay>dia punya</malay> paint very faint very thin <malay>macam</malay> acrylic <malay>dia</malay> it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with (err) like a bit more <malay>macam</malay> like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last [mah] so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very <malay>rugi</malay> because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
so I've been searching up then they all sell like big bottles [one] but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag <malay>banyak</malay> all my stuff so ya I don't know see how [lor] even if I buy like (um) the big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
ya like that [lor] don't know how see first
I also don't know we see how we have whole month then we have school we also don't know how then ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
I don't know see how like if I can get into uni then go into uni [lah] if cannot then see how start working first or what
ya like that [lor] see how don't know how already
cause it's also quite hard [what] poly and J_C very different you know go into uni~ then with the whole coronavirus also very hard already
tomorrow got my (err) I got school what so then after that I need to rush my assignments
ya
ya if can by monday if not by tuesday because I need to print it out and then submit by thursday morning then on monday also I got another assignment due so that one I need to clean up also
ya
until six seven P_M
ya
C_C_A no more already but the normal class is until six P_M seven P_M like that
okay
ya
[meh]
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then <malay>kalau tak habis</malay> then I will be rushing then <malay>susah</malay> if I rush because
I got like my two thousand word assignment essay and then got my (uh) reflection journal that I have to clean up
finish already the reflection journal finish already but then I have to clean it up and then
for the
essay the two thousand word essay I'm only at like nine hundred words so ya
two thousand
ya
ya
but it's actually very easy just the organisation and the
because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but it's actually quite easy [lah] because I got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like (um)
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya I still have my religious school until next year
no it's not finish end of this year semester ends mid year [what]
ya
I think so [ah] that one also not so sure you have to check with the <malay>ustazah</malay> again
no
ya
ya the water sports sounds fun [ah] but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so <malay>tak tahu macam mana</malay>
until june two thousand and twenty is <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
ya
I also don't know see what have [lah] what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is I think tomorrow will like
I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
(um) chop type of person ya you know so <malay>kena</malay> we all <malay>nak buat macam cepat-cepat</malay> because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then <malay>dapat rehat cepat</malay> so ya
ya
ya
I think you can ask #adi# if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got <malay>madrasah</malay> tomorrow
no [eh] no preference
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog <malay>goreng</malay> or like fishball like that
the <malay>epok-epok</malay> also just now (err) <malay>orang sebelah kasih</malay> also like very nice also
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but the <malay>epok-epok</malay> like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very <malay>garing</malay>
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
(um)
bake it
[oh]
I think like the <malay>epok-epok</malay> when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of like old #chang kee# [one] cause it's like
(err) taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat <malay>sebab dia banyak inti</malay> and then <malay>dia pun macam</malay> very crunchy <malay>rangup</malay> like that
the old #chang kee# one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the #ondeh-ondeh# and the red velvet one
ya the #ondeh-ondeh# one
but it's like
the #ondeh-ondeh# one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the #ondeh-ondeh# because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was (uh) on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
but it was like very little but got flavour [lah] and then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap macam rasa macam</malay> those #ondeh-ondeh# cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>manis</malay> and everything then I cannot <malay>tahan</malay> also
ya
the <malay>apam</malay> I ate and
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
[oh] then I don't know cause the <malay>apam</malay> was actually supposed to be one for me and one for <malay>adik</malay> but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if <malay>adik</malay> ate it cause he was very full after eating the #bhatoora#
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the <malay>apam</malay>
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the #briyani# with the potato also can
and then the <malay>kuah</malay> from the #bhatoora# also still have
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the #bhatoora# like in the morning eat very nice [ah] but also like really oily
I think they fr~ like I ya they deep fried or something
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to <malay>tuang</malay> it's on the #bhatoora#
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
[ah] got sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like [oh] maybe can make hummus then we eat with hu~ we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying [ah] so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first (uh)
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
doing hummus right <malay>tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan</malay> hummus
<malay>macam sedap</malay> [seh]
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
[oh] ya #baklava# also very nice #baklava# with like <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
#kunafe# is which one
(mm) I don't think I tried #kunafe# before but I think I've heard about it before
the bak~ is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first (uh) I think like
[ah] cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
[oh] ya that
the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then <malay>bila dah nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam rasa dia berbeza</malay> cause <malay>orang lain yang buat</malay>
so ya <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> [ah] like
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at #joo chiat# right like (err) that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
!huh! #ang mo kio# A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W [oh] no that one is shake shack
[oh] I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream <malay>macam tak</malay>
ya the whipped cream it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's not like <malay>serasi</malay> in that not <malay>serasi</malay> it's like <malay>tak</malay> equal like that <malay>bila dia</malay> spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
I think the #satay# when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the <malay>lemak</malay> and then you know the #satay# <malay>punya minyak</malay> [ah] like that right and then you eat with the <malay>lontong</malay> the <malay>bawang timun</malay> everything then you <malay>cecah</malay> in the <malay>kuah</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay>
ya the <malay>babat</malay> I thought the <malay>babat</malay> #satay# I wouldn't like but when I ate it <malay>bila masih panas</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap gila</malay> then <malay>macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan</malay>
I think the I don't know for me was the <malay>nasi</malay> was nothing special it was like <malay>nasi minyak</malay> like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice [ah] but the they have the like the <malay>sambal</malay> not the <malay>sambal</malay> but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli <malay>makan dengan</malay> green chilli <malay>gitu</malay> with the <malay>nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam</malay> crunchy <malay>gitu</malay>
but the <malay>daging</malay> very nice <malay>macam makan gitu macam sendiri</malay> because it's very easily peel off then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay>
and then <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>minyak</malay> right I was thinking if like if <malay>kalau kat rumah sendiri</malay> right the <malay>nasi</malay> you put in the <malay>minyak</malay> then you <malay>panaskan</malay> you <malay>buang</malay> you <malay>buat macam nasi goreng</malay> like that
ya but I think I like it [ah] cause
I was like in the mood for like just not
not a lot of flavour but like just the <malay>daging</malay> taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli <malay>makan tepi gitu</malay>
but the sad thing is the vegetables <malay>dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit</malay> [jer] the lettuce and everything ya
<malay>sebab</malay> if I have a lot then <malay>macam makan pun macam tak segan</malay> right then can put and wrap everything nicely
ya
ya
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then <malay>nasi</malay> then we still have a bit of the <malay>serunding</malay> right
and (uh)
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't think seaweed and <malay>serunding</malay> will taste nice so I think <malay>macam beli</malay> lettuce <malay>atau</malay> cabbage <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>serunding</malay> and then <malay>buat macam</malay> wrap <malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>sambal belacan</malay> and then a bit of <malay>macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang besar gitu letak</malay>
<malay>kat dalam makan</malay>
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know (err) during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for K_F_C you know even their K_F_C right the K_F_C each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
no [eh] I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so <malay>nak beli barang tu semua</malay> but maybe we all like
<malay>keluar</malay> to cause <malay>hari ni</malay> is

personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed [ah] because like we all thought like (err) we all planned already and then like that night last minute (uh) that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her [mah] but don't know how [lah] see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped <malay>kena</malay> find <malay>orang baru</malay> [ah] don't know how see first
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
bet the person bought <malay>lebih sedap daripada</malay> you <malay>beli</malay> because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak was-was</malay> also <malay>nak makan</malay>
so ya then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>beli besar pun</malay> like knowing you know like you <malay>makan</malay> one slice then you can <malay>simpan</malay> if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel [oh] the apple strudel was so nice
strudel shop still have but not at #jurong# point anymore I only eat the
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like <malay>lemak manis</malay> everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit [lah] because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one !wah! very nice I <malay>rugi</malay> they never buy the apple flavour
she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
if not then go eat at <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> or something <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap</malay> and then like
you guys can eat #bingsu# or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
it's <malay>besar</malay> so <malay>dua orang makan kenyang</malay>
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat [lah] but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things [what]
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like <malay>belanja</malay> her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it [seh]
if not
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like <malay>macam</malay> treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
<malay>minum teh</malay> like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you <malay>boleh makan kat situ macam</malay> tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where <malay>macam dia orang makan</malay> [ah] you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
then
that time also
(uh) my friends they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the (uh) tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity tea then the tea also <malay>dia minum macam sedap</malay>
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive [lah] but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if <malay>betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan</malay> catch up with one another
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like <malay>buka</malay> the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> it's
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
the desserts all like really nicely <malay>macam betul-betul sedap-sedap</malay> they got assortments <malay>macam</malay> like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain <malay>macam susah nak pakai</malay> voucher <malay>ni sebab</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> really <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> hotel <malay>mana</malay> accept hotel <malay>mana tak</malay>
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people [lah] but you cannot like hund~ (err) four hundred dollars
ya
I think
(err) if not you can go #bugis# like the #bugis#haji# area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to #bugis# street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's (err) like it's like affordable (uh) not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
(err) ya and then if not you can go to the that time the #joo chiat#
#changi# area
the ya then <malay>macam</malay> got a few cafes [lah] if not also the
around her area
#choa chu kang# area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite #ulu# [mah] so ya
ya
that time I went with her at #jurong# east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like (uh) the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad [lah] but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like #bugis# or something to <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>berbual-berbual kat situ</malay> because atmosphere <malay>pun</malay> #shiok# and then <malay>makanan pun</malay> actually really not bad and then nowadays #bugis# area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I <malay>makan</malay> burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five people
[oh] ya cannot refund right
<malay>tapi</malay> if like that <malay>macam susah</malay> because from the look of it <malay>susah nak</malay> travel <malay>sebab pasal</malay> COVID and then I read up they said that <malay>kalau nak</malay> travel <malay>pun sekarang dah ada banyak</malay> measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so <malay>macam susah</malay> like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but <malay>sekarang pun macam</malay> end of year <malay>pun belum lagi</malay> okay everything <malay>macam</malay> we are still <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> in phase two
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know [ah] quite <malay>susah</malay>
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
!huh! if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go #bali#
indonesia
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian <malay>bakso sedap</malay> [seh] <malay>dengan macam</malay> chilli <malay>sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi</malay> roadside <malay>makan-makan gitu</malay>
<malay>dengan dia orang punya soda gembira</malay> everything and then the atmosphere <malay>orang-orang rokok</malay> everything
I want the <malay>murtabak manis</malay>
[oh] ya this whole year <malay>takde pasar malam</malay> [seh]
I don't think will have
luckily my school has some of the <malay>pasar malam</malay> food like #takoyaki# all and then like cantine all have the <malay>goreng pisang goreng keledek</malay> all so okay [lah] can still <malay>tahan</malay> but the #you zha kueh# burger ramly all !wah! I really miss <malay>keropok lekor</malay>
and then the <malay>susu</malay> honeydew <malay>tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air</malay> sugar cane <malay>dia orang suka</malay> [seh] <malay>tu rindu</malay> [seh]
[oh] I want to go the I want the indian sweet again the pink colour one you know the pink and white one I always eat then I want to buy one of the skirts again
ya but

[ah] ya that time <malay>yang</malay> #deepavali# that one that #adit# left halfway
ya that one the mango #lassi# very nice
[oh] ya

ya for me today was okay [ah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
<malay>tadi</malay>
today was my off day
and I got like three days off you know how I told you <malay>macam</malay> I
<malay>ada kira-kira</malay>
<malay>sepuluh hari lagi</malay> left
of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) I've been trying to clear so
slowly [ah] slowly <malay>gila</malay>
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths (uh) they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit <malay>macam</malay>
a bit
<malay>apa tu senget</malay>
ya
ya a bit skew~ skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's tech~ it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
I went first in that group and when I went first
the <malay>apa tu</malay> the
I took like I think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which wa~ that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this
then he like he talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the sh~ zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [seh] <malay>kurang ajar gila</malay>
it's not it's <malay>tak</malay> compulsory <malay>tapi macam</malay>
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya
then how was your last week
[oh] that sucks
(mm) do you think you should have studied or started earlier
sure #bo#
sure #bo#
[ah]
[eh] <malay>asal</malay> you <malay>tak baca dulu sebelum</malay> you <malay>buat</malay> paper

okay I think that was me in <malay>apa tu</malay> in
secondary school also when <malay>kita buat</malay> lit
ya
then why you take
[ah] okay understand
okay <malay>jap</malay>
speedy <malay>ni</malay>
speedy <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini</malay> [tau] like everytime <malay>dia</malay>
everytime <malay>kita nak</malay> everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
ya [seh]
okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak cukup</malay> attention
<malay>tak cukup apa tak cukup</malay> attention <malay>kesian dia</malay>
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
but
(err) because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three A_M shift correct
so <malay>dia baru</malay> join
so it wa~ like his first day was just me and him
because there was this other person but he <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
<malay>kena</malay>
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
ya it was quite <malay>rabak</malay> (uh)
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
I may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was I_C [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya so I was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just I think (err)
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six A_M S_M_S
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
(err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no like probably at eight o'clock probably
<malay>nak kena siap apa nak kena siap abeh nak kena pakai baju</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>abeh nak mandi semua</malay>
I don't know [lah] I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
so anyway he told me that [lah] he told me <malay>macam</malay>
(err) okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] I told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's been
on N_E_A or like our other client
(um)
!wah! damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not [lah] but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait [ah] !walao!walao!
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
so <malay>macam</malay> he was damn lost [ah]
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three A_M shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss [lah] I feel bad
(um) hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
(err) I requested to go to N_E_A
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
[eh] no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this N_E_A shift in
in what day [ah]
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
my language classes then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> cin~ <malay>tak cakap apa-apa</malay> never say anything so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to N_E_A this confirmed movement to N_E_A because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> give me some heads up (uh)
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to N_E_A shift
in december
same timing
three A_M to twelve P_M
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty A_M to twelve P_M [eh] twelve thirty P_M
then now it's like (err) three A_M to twelve P_M
I can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but I'm going on this N_E_A shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot <malay>paksa orang</malay> to
<malay>datang</malay> and you know
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
and then <malay>macam</malay> it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I'm
my sleep is deprived
I have to really plan <malay>macam</malay> straight away after finish
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
<malay>pastu keluar lepak</malay> and then go straight to work <malay>atau</malay> sleep a bit more and
go to work ya
ya correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
(mm)
<malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>kerja</malay>
ya and because my shift <malay>pukul berapa pukul tiga</malay>
<malay>tiga pagi sampai dua belas setengah petang</malay>
it's like
if I were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct
don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this N_E_A shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for N_E_A
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
no <malay>takde</malay>
no they <malay>dorang</malay> big fans of N_E_A <malay>macam</malay> the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill (uh) actually
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>maksud dia</malay>
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything [ah] because it's a totally <malay>lain punya</malay> client ya
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what I mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
<malay>tiga ribu</malay>
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
ya she took chemistry in the U_S <malay>pastu</malay> (um)
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good [lah] I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
that I've been very complacent <malay>macam</malay> I've
like this current shift that I'm on [lah] I've been too complacent
not complacent <malay>macam terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>apa tu terlalu banyak</malay>
I don't know I just I
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
(err) [oh] <malay>yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok</malay> the deadline and all that
like [oh] because we have to make like attend~
a clock report right every ten A_M
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
<malay>abeh kita</malay> proofreading we put everything [ah] like whether the date is correct
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that answers [lah]
the numbering and all that and the [oh] categorisation and all that is <malay>betul</malay>
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then I realised [oh] shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> whether they
whether they <malay>apa tu</malay>
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
volunteer because <malay>kita punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak ada nak kena</malay> #chope#
reserve
<malay>macam</malay> you must #chope# certain deliverables [lah]
ya
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of <malay>macam mana kita kerja</malay>
okay so <malay>pukul tiga setengah</malay> I <malay>bangun</malay>
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
let's say <malay>pukul lima</malay> we have to send headlines
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
because I'm the kind of person <malay>yang</malay> I cannot <malay>tunggu</malay> for people
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I'm not a <malay>apa tu</malay>
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm undeci~ indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it (uh) when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
that was last time (uh) remember I told you there was like one time in between july <malay>sampai</malay>
september <malay>ke</malay> august
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
<malay>pastu</malay>
jaded ya
just jaded like <malay>macam</malay>
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
so <malay>dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat</malay>
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
<malay>orang ketiga</malay> [lah]
no
<malay>apa benda</malay> home wrecker
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
no I think <malay>dorang nak</malay> more natural conversation so that
this whatever A_I can pick up
I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)
ya [lah]
no but I just
I don't know <malay>takut</malay> it's not accept~ because I don't they also never say like what
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live in a H_D_B you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay [lah] I think it is their job [lah]
[a'ah] [lah]
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
ya what have you been watching lately <malay>cerita</malay>

sometimes the environment doesn't allow for that to happen
so you have to like manage your expectations and also your

(mm) it's every it's all the things that I appreciate in films put together and like !whoa! I was so surprised [eh]
you know what I mean like you it makes you think <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god !whoa!
do the people that you know now are they like
who are they you know what I mean make me question my current relationships with like people that I know like my family even are they the people they are

I hope this isn't a spoiler for the person listening to this
but like you know when he went through the <malay>apa tu</malay>
[kan] <malay>ada</malay> I don't know whether the lady or the man <malay>yang cakap</malay>

did we watch another movie together about the <malay>cerita</malay> indonesia
<malay>yang</malay> (ugh) was I with you
(uh) then who did I watch with
it was this <malay>cerita pasal</malay>
this indonesian woman

<malay>ada badan</malay>
<malay>cerita apa</malay> [eh]
yes that [one] <malay>yang tu</malay>
(uh) can watch online if you want [eh] you want to watch today
ya
why
(mm)
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that [one] will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know [ah] movies are
just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> or ask anyone I don't know
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah#blah#blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes
ya but like not all your mon~ and not all your money
but this kind of thing definitely need <malay>macam</malay> to set up to set aside like at least
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
(mm) I try play on Borderland [lor]
I haven't bought yet
expensive no
[oh] yes you're right <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> #betuls# okay [lah]
(mm)
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train I bought the demon slayer masks
cute <malay>gila</malay> [oh] my god it's very cute
ya I <malay>dah</malay> wash <malay>lagi</malay> I <malay>dah basuh</malay>
I <malay>dah kering</malay>
I <malay>dah apa lagi</malay> (err) vocabulary <malay>boleh kasi dorang</malay>
I <malay>kering</malay> I <malay>dah</malay> squeeze dry
I <malay>dah</malay> compress <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
semp~
ya I <malay>dah</malay> I've done quite a lot of things [lah]
ya so as in it's drying now <malay>tengah nak kering</malay> I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
<malay>bawa balik</malay> [ah] <malay>mana satu yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
I I I only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
I ordered four
because it all looks so pretty <malay>semua lawa gila</malay>
of course [lah] but like I have other masks too
ya but I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
<malay>dia macam</malay> those who know will know right
and then people think like (err) this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie <malay>dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
ya we've talked about this before <malay>berbual</malay>
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
like you know how when it's <malay>macam</malay> when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
I feel like when everybody watches it
dia <malay>macam</malay> it feels a bit cheaper because like
[oh] now they are going more mainstream <malay>lebih</malay> mainstream
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
popularity of <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer for example
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
not as popular of course [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merc~ merchandise <malay>nak beli apa lagi</malay>
<malay>nak beli</malay>
ya <malay>macam</malay> these merchandise <malay>nak beli baju</malay> you know
it's so easy to find
ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> if you if it were another show for example <malay>macam</malay> Fruits Basket
<malay>atau</malay> I don't know what's another show I don't hear it (err) hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean
like if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what I'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
well known so <malay>macam</malay> that's why I say there's pros and cons [ah]
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because I don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
you <malay>tahu</malay> [kan] I <malay>ada</malay> classmate <malay>jepun</malay> in my korean class
so <malay>dia</malay>
(err)
she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
so <malay>macam</malay> most of us <malay>kita ambil sebab kita</malay> either
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
<malay>kita tengok dengar lagu</malay>
<malay>kita tengok cerita</malay> K drama <malay>dengar lagu</malay> K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
so I asked her like [oh] how about ya so I asked her <malay>macam</malay>
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
and she say <malay>macam</malay>
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
<malay>macam</malay> real people
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] I just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics I think
(um) I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
the life in japan <malay>macam</malay> how was her school life or like at least [lah]
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
she's quite nice [lah] then she shared with me like about her school life (uh) how <malay>dia kerja</malay> part time
(um) like during high school and all that
quite interesting [ah] it's I love this class because <malay>macam</malay>
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and like the eleven year old <malay>punya</malay> remember I <malay>berbual pasal</malay>
cute <malay>gila</malay>
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm ver~ I'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
ya because like I talk to her about <malay>macam</malay> my trip to #yogyakarta# the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also <malay>macam</malay> in #jakarta# and how <malay>dia rindu</malay> [lah] <malay>rindu gila dengan</malay> #jakarta# <malay>tapi</malay> she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place <malay>paling</malay>
<malay>paling selamat</malay>
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID [ah]
<malay>tak kat</malay> #yishun# not at #yishun#
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
and then (um) <malay>dia macam</malay> I don't know
very nice [ah] they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay
<malay>boleh</malay>
[ah] I have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
<malay>sampai tahap maksima</malay>
kidding
<malay>apa</malay>
(um)
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to (um) calculate [lah] because <malay>dorang punya</malay> numbering is very <malay>susah gila</malay> it's like
<malay>dorang</malay> count [kan] <malay>dorang punya</malay> currency <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
in the thousands so like
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia <malay>sama juga</malay>
so <malay>nak kena</malay> you must really calculate [lah]
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
<malay>banyak fikir</malay> [ah] I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
exactly but <malay>macam</malay>
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to <malay>layan</malay> my korean I feel like I'm such a
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very nice bro
<malay>lawa gila</malay> it's very it's super damn it's super nice
!wah! I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and I'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech [eh]
say it's for Logitech
!hey! how are you
<malay>dah lama tak nampak kau</malay>
<malay>tak ingat</malay> [seh] I think like since COVID about
<malay>macam</malay>
almost two months ago
[kan]
<malay>betul tak</malay>
<malay>asal kau ketawa</malay> [ah] <malay>kau teringat</malay> something [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti</malay>
[a'ah] that time <malay>yang aku</malay> video call <malay>kau tu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kau ingat tak</malay> what happen that time
you were having your assignment but then I was like complaining to you about something that happened
no
ya
facetime
I don't know I can't remember but it was video call
(mmhmm)
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
[a'ah] [seh]
[ah] [sia] like a blessing in disguise [ah] [eh]
okay [lah]
<malay>kerja aku rabak juga</malay> [ah] like because I don't know whether
you heard
but
(um) <malay>kerja aku</malay> recently <malay>buang orang</malay> like at least two K of the staff are gone so right now I mean the ones that are left <malay>semua nak kena buat</malay> you know pick up the slack <malay>abeh lagi banyak kerja kena buat</malay>
I was not affect~ as in like okay I was not affected for the exercise I was I mean I'm still having my job now [lah] but (um) you know because of the lack of manpower then now quite loaded and overwhelmed with all the stuff that needs to be done [ah]
ya actually I am most of the time only like (err) two days half days a week then need to go back to the office
ya technically yes because
everything can be done via the laptop [lah] but the only reason why we need to go back is because we need to <malay>apa tu</malay> collect <malay>dia punya</malay> physical mails
cause there are some like letters from (err) the government that we need to open up and address them so that's why they need us to you know like physically be there to collect the damn mails and
you know ya
what about you how's school
[eh] <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> imagine [sia] like I will I cannot even you know
both of us <malay>ada</malay> short attention span and like to have
to sit like for that long hours
back sprain
<malay>abeh</malay> like you can't even like focus and
you know
I just can't pay full attention if I were to do that like on a daily
will drive you nuts actually so at least you know for me if I were to go back office at least half a day at least I get some fresh air otherwise I mean I'm naturally a home
body
but you know it's good to get yourself out at least a short period of time [lah]
a few hours at least
in a week
ya [lah] I mean staying at home involve like I mean ideally will be netflix and chill and not like you know sit
in front of your laptop on a chair for long hours
ya that is definitely not ideal
(mm)
!huh! as in like what the recording part or like our conversation really
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
ya I know you always do [lah] you always try your best in everything that you do so is your final lap just persevere [lah]
I mean you made it this far so what's one more year to go right ya
[oh]
I know
I think that's why they call it comfort food to comfort you otherwise it would have called being called something else if you buy like fruits and vegetables to make you I don't think that is a comfort food right so hence the name
ya but I feel you [ah] like I stress eat also most of the time I think it's not just us
<malay>banyak orang juga</malay> like you know stress eat
and when you stay at home right miraculously your weight gain you have massive weight gain also
ya and then like you know right now and at this day and age (um)
convenience is everywhere so it's if you want to order food it's just one (um) app away or one call away so
(mm)
is it I never heard of that before
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god that is
are they new on youtube or what
[oh]
I see I will check that out I think one day <malay>aku</malay> check it out
(mmhmm)
[oh] that's fun speaking of <malay>joget</malay> recently also like literal you know literally yesterday (err) me and my sister we just on like random youtube videos just follow through <malay>macam</malay> dance <malay>punya</malay> youtube videos which is quite fun you know at least when you're dancing [kan] <malay>kau</malay> you don't feel I mean you're burning fats but you're having fun so you don't dread you know like as opposed to <malay>kau buat</malay> like (um)
HIIT workouts I mean that works better [lah] because you know it's a specific <malay>punya macam</malay> (err) they target specific areas of your body to workout right but then when you're dancing you're moving your whole body and then you are having fun also so and then (um) she we decided to because we have P_S four I mean she we decided to <malay>apa tu</malay> download
this thing (err) this game <malay>apa</malay> just dance [eh] ya so we've had we've yet to try that (err) it's going to be fun I mean honestly as much as we hate to workout
we need to you know just to keep our minds healthy
be mentally you know fit
and physically fit at the same time
(uh huh)
ya
(mmhmm)
yes that's the key to be consistent and is very hard to be consistent but once you are you will feel good [ah]
like you feel more refreshed <malay>abeh nanti kau tak</malay> feel so lethargic when you're working you know like people say they always have no time (err) always very busy but if they make time at least like ten minutes in the morning or before you go to bed that works as well like little bit goes a long way
as cliche as it sounds [lah]
I'm not one to preach but it is important [lah] cause now also <malay>zaman sekarang kita makan semua sembarang</malay> all fast food and things like that you know as compared to <malay>zaman dulu</malay> [kan] they're more much more
(um) healthy eaters simple food so there's less processed
so
ya like I have to at least make time or force myself to to to lock down my (err) to get my workout in [ah] on a daily
it doesn't matter how long ten minutes <malay>pun jadi</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau tahu tak aku</malay>
highly ambitious <malay>niat tu ada</malay> but <malay>selalu tak kesampaian</malay> like I set my alarm on at six A_M in the morning everyday <malay>macam berangan</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam kau nak</malay> [oh] <malay>berangan nak</malay> jogging at around the neighbourhood for at least an hour or like at least half an hour [ah]
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> start the start my day right you know working and then like <malay>macam</malay> feel refreshed okay that happened just like once or twice
ya like you said [ah] <malay>tadi</malay> you just have to be consistent [ah]
once you get the ball rolling I think it would be okay but you know to start is a bit hard
we just have to
set our mind to it [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] is it
(mmhmm)
<malay>kena</malay> monitor [ah]
what's the average [ah] what's the ideal B_P
that's normal [ah] [ah]
that plays a part [ah]
ya (mm)
you know there's a saying you are what you eat really what you consume right it will show on your face your body
ya like <malay>macam</malay> if you eat healthy you clean you eat clean it will show like your skin your complexion
will show that you're glowing you <malay>macam tak nampak</malay> so tired or worn out [tau]
(mm)
<malay>asal kau menyesal</malay>
ya [lah] it's never too late I think the pimple will be gone like a few days but you know the irony is that
you have more time you're online learning right but why are you telling me that you are more (um) you know invested in your facial regime then when you are much more busy then you are now
that's right that is just you it's okay we have we all have that phase
I mean it's not that bad [what] I mean if you never tell me I wouldn't even notice that you have a pimple on your face [sial] babe
[oh] no I'm saying this is because my room is dark and I can't really see your face right now
<malay>aku memang suka</malay> like dark (err) like because I don't know like
I've always like you see even my light is dim and I refused to change it because I like my room to be cosy dark and nice
actually I did once upon a time but I took it out because
<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam tak lawa sangat</malay> [ah]
ya I hang it like <malay>macam</malay> fairy lights around <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [ah] my bedroom <malay>punya</malay> frame
and then I took it down I actually still have it [lah] and then <malay>macam</malay> because I prefer to use like <malay>macam</malay> candles more sexy and cosy and then like you know with the smell and stuff like that <malay>kalau</malay> fairy lights when you switch it on [kan]
okay [lah]
it looks fine I guess I just want to change things a bit
but I feel like it then I'll put it back on [lah]
I think the orangey type I guess there is different settings [ah] different modes that you can choose from like <malay>macam</malay> those like blinking ones or like <malay>macam</malay> !alah! you know <malay>macam lampu lap lip</malay> [lah] basically
it's like that
ya
[oh] yes it's right there
ya I use it is <malay>dia macam</malay> aurora lights
no [lah] I mean I don't switch it on when I'm asleep [lah] <malay>bila aku nak</malay> you know feeling spa day <malay>nak</malay> relax then I on the spa music and then light on my candles
<malay>bila aku nyanyi</malay> ya <malay>bila aku nyanyi nak</malay> feeling
you know me too well
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>kita dah kawan</malay>
how long have we known each other
primary school yes no
is it [eh] is it K one or nursery [eh]
<malay>sana tu mana</malay>
<malay>kat</malay> #gek poh# [ah]

[oh] my gosh wait primary five
[oh] <malay>apa</malay> eleven
and then now we are like [oh] my god turning thirty next year so how many years
I'm really bad at my math
no we weren't even close
<malay>tak tahu</malay> it's like literally after school it's not
even during school we don't really talk to each other [kan]
[ah] [eh] speaking of which <malay>tadi baru aku sebelum aku jumpa kau aku jumpa kawan aku lagi satu tu pun</malay> like literally random [ah] like <malay>aku tak rapat dengan dia pun</malay> like <malay>tu pun aku</malay> that time <malay>kerja</malay> part time and then we won't even like working on the same shift most of the time
and then (err) <malay>kita tak</malay> contact <malay>pun</malay> and then after that random after few years <malay>aku jumpa dia dekat</malay> (err) #tioman# island <malay>ke apa</malay> then random <malay>gila</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> we she just went up to me and we say hi and then after that a few months later also random thing we plan a trip to #bali# and then I met her again just now so <malay>macam</malay> random [lah] like but we click instantly you know that the those kind of friends you don't even need to <malay>macam</malay> like meet them often but
they're friends for keeps you know like you click so well
(mmhmm)
[oh] [ah] <malay>tu pun</malay> random [seh] <malay>kau pun pergi</malay> trip <malay>dengan dia juga</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
that sounds so wrong
I mean come on everybody's thinking it
I bet the transcriber also will be thinking when you say that right
okay
anyway speaking of which how's your love life <malay>dah lama aku tak dengar apa</malay> any anything new that you want to talk to me about
(mm)
(mm)
the last time <malay>kau cakap dengan aku dia</malay>
something about his throat [eh] <malay>sakit ke apa</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>rajin</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
(mm)
ya
(mm)
right
I think I know like you
I mean as a friend I've always known that you are the kind of person who always put others first sometimes to a fault
you know <malay>macam</malay> you gave so much (um) care and concern love to others
ob~ obviously you don't expect the same in return [lah] <malay>kau ikhlas memang</malay> but
you know (um) from what you're telling me
correct me if I'm wrong if you're feeling like <malay>macam</malay> it's one sided like you
like
the effort
is only at your end
you know then <malay>bila kau sakit tangan ni semua</malay> I mean it's not even something minor I mean is a big thing you know like
maybe it's not a life and death threatening thing but still it
it is a problem for you it's an issue for you so <malay>macam</malay> he's not putting in that effort maybe is that what you are saying like <malay>macam</malay> all this even though you guys have not been together for like a long time
only a few months it is already draining you and relationships aren't supposed to be like that I know there are hard times [lah] but
(err) it is all about compromising and <malay>macam</malay> if you're the only one putting in the effort and being invested
you know like (um) in someone who does not
do the same when you're facing a problem or issue
then <malay>entah</malay> [eh] do you really think it's worth it then
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
!wow! that really open up like
a lot of things like <malay>macam</malay>
while you are sharing me this I mean I completely agree you know there are some people
in our lives
okay [lah] (um) being in a relationship of friends [ah] like okay since you are talking about
boys
or guys or men for that matter
there are some
who define us and there's some who you know contributes to our growth over the years
and then there are some who
are not even like
you know
there's this (um) saying everything happens for a reason and then obviously like (err) people come and go
and especially when the (err) when you and when a relationship ends and it's you're part of the
the cause or the reason why it ended
I don't know about men [lah] but for women we tend to
analyse things
you know I don't know
like it
a relationship will never truly end until the guy or the man says so because for women [eh] I don't know
we always strive our best to make it work no matter how bad the situation is
so
it's not wrong that you feel that way if you and people always say okay (um) you know
(um) you shouldn't get back to your (err) to your ex because you know you broke up for a reason but you know sometimes
it is just a matter of where you guys were at that point in time like you guys were so young back then was poly [kan] (err) maybe you guys wanted different things then and then now after a few years you already know like how you want your life to be like and is much more easier and
from my ex~ no not experience [lah] but from what I noticed like I do have like my sister and my friends also who got married to their best friend and
their marriage is much more stronger in that sense [ah] I'm not saying all but most of the time people who marries their who married their
their best friend
tend to last longer
because
I mean it's your best friend you literally like can be like what you say you can be yourself around that person
and then
there's nothing that holds you back you know like from expressing yourself telling them how you feel or how to act you know in front of them and you know
you guys were friends before lovers so you know like
the person inside and out
the good and bad
remind me again why you guys broke up [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
!aww!
!aww! so cute
a book like a diary
[oh] right okay
[oh] my gosh
[eh] but you know it's a good thing you know like I think
[eh] that is actually a good thing like (um) it's like an open communication kind of thing but you know (um) on paper
(mm)
then it hit you [ah]
ya you I mean I know like you know when a person is looking at you and like (um)
gazing at you or whatever like you feel it do you feel like he's still like attracted to you
as in what online
so you guys are what contacting now again or what
(um)
!aww! <malay>dia</malay> blue tick <malay>kau</malay> [oh] <malay>dia</malay> seen <malay>kau</malay> [oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
ya
but did you guys end it on a nice note
or was it a bad break up
there was the break up [ah] then no text after that
until today
then he followed did he follow you back okay
seriously what did you say like what
did you actually say
[oh] my god
what did he say
were you secretly hoping that you might spark something with him
which didn't work out
I think
it's because you know it ended
on your part
and then you were secretly hoping the what if you know
what if you didn't do that you know because okay to be honest out of all your exes <malay>dia yang paling</malay> decent
ya
I mean come on you don't need me to go
down in details of what happened right with your previous exes
(mm)
ya [lah] like I said
it ended on your part so maybe at that point
we just wanted the what if maybe you know like karma as shitty as it sounds so basically you
the your recent ex was the cause of the break up [eh] not the cause of your okay [lah] somewhat contributed to that right
and then
you got with that guy and then you know the guy that guy played you like cheat you more than three times already so
okay [lah] I'm just
telling you this
from my perspective
no hard feelings whatever cause I'm a true friend I'll just tell you what is on my mind
so in a way maybe it's a karma for you maybe at that point in time when you were talking to your recent ex he was
he was having such a hard time
to process that
to understand that and to actually let you go
so maybe he was
you really broke him then
and then I don't blame him if he's putting his guard up because
you mattered so much to him then
and then you broke him and then he he's obviously
you know like healed over time and then he don't want the same thing to happen to you again just like how you feel
about your recent ex you know like you don't want the same thing to happen so whatever that you're feeling with your recent ex with that particular girl that he was playing you
with
it's exactly how he feels
about you and your recent ex did you see the bigger picture
ya [lah] but you can't blame yourself
it's only you know it's only through those experiences that you know makes you a better person like you truly appreciate this like you know you al~ you always appreciate the things when they're gone and you tend to reflect on that
!aww!
!wow! you would have gotten like a two year old son or daughter by now
[eh] [oh] my gosh
I mean
if you may never know <malay>mana tahu</malay>
I mean I'm not saying that you should be hopeful
but if it's meant to be there's a reason why your path cross now you know what I mean fate
work in very miraculous ways
honestly [eh] when it comes to love or when it comes to
matters of the heart
(err) it doesn't matter whether it's crazy or not because love itself is crazy if you feel like it
it doesn't okay first thing if you want to put yourself out there
I would advise you not to be hopeful
you cannot expect anything because the saddest thing about love is
if you love someone
is they are not obligated to love you back
you know what I mean that's the riskiest part
so
if you ask me go ahead [lah] it doesn't I mean since you guys are like technically
on (err) cool right now that you guys are following each other on instagram doesn't hurt to just make the move to ask him out you know just for coffee you know just
you know if it's a if it's if it turns out good you guys you want to respark your and ignite your spark and then okay [lah]
but if it's not then just end it right then and there and you know at least you know for a fact that okay I've tried you know (um) but this is really an end to us like you know we don't fit it in we don't fit in each other's life anymore so <malay>kau</malay> just
move on at least you don't lay in bed at night you don't lie to me I know like you you play all these things scenarios in your head [kan] <malay>bila kau</malay> like you know
late at night <malay>kau tak boleh tidur</malay> thinking about all these what if you know could have should have
you know
but (err) do you know if he's attached now or not
[oh] my god really
ya it will be weird if the so
I mean bottom line is if you ask me
it doesn't hurt to ask like you know but of course
just don't be hopeful and don't expect anything much just ask him out casually [ah] you don't like <malay>macam</malay> don't make it obligatory for him
<malay>kau tanya</malay> [jer]
[oh] is it
and then <malay>kau</malay> action [ah] treat him for his birthday or what
ya I don't give a shit anymore [sia] I can't even remember
<malay>bila</malay> birthday <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>dekat tu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> action <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god isn't it your birthday today or isn't it your birthday this weekend
<malay>tak</malay>
ya or (um) no you know what if you ask that then it'll be like what if he says no so you have to be like (err) <malay>jual mahal</malay> but at the same time like !hey! you know okay I will suggest you to say just ask him like
[eh] isn't this isn't it your birthday this week or isn't it your birthday next week or blah (um) let's catch up for coffee you know something like that
so
you know in a way you won't be like if you were to ask him
(err) do you have any plans <malay>macam</malay> a bit needy you know what I mean like if you will say like <malay>macam</malay> (err) let's hang out you know it's like more casual as opposed to (err) do you have any plans <malay>macam</malay> like secretly hoping him would to say yes
ya so just make it casual make it like a friendly thing
<malay>kau</malay> set reminder
ya you tend to do that because why you are that respectful which is not a bad thing but you have to know that you know
you don't want to make it seem as if
you regret what you did
last summer no last summer you regret what you did then so it's more of you like acknowledging what happened then you guys have moved forward and then starting a new chapter as opposed to you regret and doing what you doing now because of what you regretted is two different things
<malay>dia sama</malay> age <malay>dengan kita</malay> [eh] [oh]
[eh] you don't say that about yourself [lah] you are amazing
(mm) (mm)
[oh] my gosh what a breeze it's like
almost
an hour we should like start a podcast or something [lah] it's like a good outlet you know like to voice out whatever you feeling and to catch up also [lah] <malay>dah lama kita tak jumpa</malay> [kan] and it's like so good to finally you know
[eh] ya [oh] my god I almost forgot about our #makisan#
okay to be fair I'm like facing the other side of the room now so I can't really see that it's like
you know <malay>kat belakang</malay> and not at the front so
ya we only have one minute ya it is a breeze man
easy breezy I don't mind
like different topics every time
this is this has been an enjoyable voice recording session engaging
!wow! if I were to start with mine we need another one more hour
love life <malay>aku boleh</malay> like you can literally write a book out of it man
[oh] my god
my nonsense my O_C_D <malay>lain</malay> my love life <malay>lain</malay>
so basically (um)
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy and (err) so (err)
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything [lah] about his life so
true enough [lah] he is a very (uh) forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an (uh) up point for him [lah] you know in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
number one (err) it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very <malay>macam</malay> like (uh) <malay>abang</malay> why you asking for my name no [ah] just~ upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in (err)
#changi# airport
(um)
and that #changi# airport is what we thought it was [lah] to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why [lah] but of course there's that connotation [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> it's not really
that's why she's so secret~ she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it [lah]
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then (um) so now he is (uh) working at (uh) #novena# H_Q and he is there because (uh) he wants to do office work and rightfully so [lah] because he wants to (uh) spend more time [lah] with your family
(uh) and
since he has going to move towards
getting married (uh) he thought this the right step [ah] as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's very sound [lah] in why he's doing it okay then he talk about (um)
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay [ah] this one [ah] [oh] every time I do as in [ah] like
was it so difficult to [ah] get this out
so [ah] <malay>dia suka</malay> in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here <malay>abah</malay> was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got #zina# to sit right beside me
the mirror side
[ah] middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so [ah] what else (um) okay so I
[ah] that one I didn't get to ask but that one is <malay>tak mai~</malay> important [lah] ya
so the other [ah] important part was about his job experience [lah] so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain [lah] actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he <malay>apa</malay> the sign on agreement and it only came after P_O_P and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole B_M_T process at police again
[ah] okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of his bond this year
[ah] that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
[ah]
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact (uh) do you have connect plan that's he look at me like (uh) what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years [oh] we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and then he said [lah] ya [ah] six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and [ah] okay
<malay>apa yang susah sangat</malay>
that's why exactly that's why I say
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and <malay>abah</malay> were very calm about it <malay>tak ada macam</malay> problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that [eh]
[ah] so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was [ah] number one [ah] <malay>apa</malay> there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then <malay>dia tinggal</malay> #pasir ris#
so at the end they actually end up they have to look for something that is resale [lah] because they want to look for some a place near (err) <malay>istighfar</malay>
because <malay>dekat</malay> (um) the parents place #pasir ris#
ya [lah] but I don't know why they want that place [lah] anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
this is this could have been <malay>boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] [kan] which is to
<malay>bilang</malay> [kan] that you want to (um) do this to both your parents and #zina's# parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that (err) the keys you know then what you have to actually this part <malay>abah</malay> was the one who [ah] already point out I just irr~ reiterated the point
<malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>macam terdesak</malay> [kan] you have to like actually have to push for this [ah] then you are making it difficult for both sides
[ah] then he just nodded [lah] he understood (uh) but I was still <malay>macam</malay> thinking [eh] do you real~ are you apologetic or not about your mistake here [ah] but I think it's in between [lah] it's in between that apologetic but also <malay>macam</malay> like okay
[ah] he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel [what] <malay>begitu</malay> I say it's not about that [lah] it's about you informing do it properly
correct ya
so (um) ya so that part they understood [lah] you know what it's spilt milk ready [lah] [kan] like there's no point to talk about it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
[ah] then I also talk to them [lah] like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan <malay>abah</malay> also want to hear what is his <malay>apa dia punya rancangan</malay> [lah]
(um) then ve~ it was very clear <malay>rancangan</malay> is that
the next year somewhere <malay>dalam</malay> march they intend to <malay>tunang dengan zina</malay>
and then
that's why [lah]
that's why I say I just want to hear him talk #zina# whenever #zina# butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then (err)
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet <malay>abah</malay> probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement [lah]
the <malay>nikah</malay> would be in twenty two end of twenty two
at least <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] revise plan [ah] [ah] correct
[ah] I also don't want to embarrass [lah] #zina# cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing #zina# session but no point [lah] the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
[ah] then okay then at least say that gives proper time [lah] for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the <malay>abah</malay> was saying you know #zina# just got
(err) just finish studying <malay>jadi apa</malay> the plan in these two years for her (uh) then this #azram# <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] ya (uh) this is to would be
for #zina# to actually [ah] secure a job
ya because he and then he explained it before I even need to talk about <malay>macam</malay> like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me #zina# also needs to work to build up a C_P_F
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows [lah] that's why I say it's very easy
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why <malay>macam</malay> it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple <malay>tak payah tak ada</malay> complication
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working [lah] and you #zena# needs to build her C_P_F and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience #zena# hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for #zina# to
work so that she build her C_P_F and then they also talk about children [ah] then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that is a solid plan
[ah] that one okay [lah] they bring about the halal thing [lah] so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the situation right now
ya #zina# needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
and I <malay>pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] that
you
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
grow up
<malay>dia zina pun nak kena</malay> grow up
<malay>asing masing-masing kena</malay> grow up <malay>tersendiri</malay>
<malay>lepas itu</malay>
grew up together
[ah] so you need give that time <malay>untuk</malay> you both <malay>nak kena</malay> grow up [ah] that's the thing <malay>budak itu diam</malay> [jer] so I <malay>tak puas hati</malay> because like you can just be numb about this whole thing [lah] that is a which is (uh) quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that <malay>abah</malay> is there something you want to (uh) anything you want to ask them (uh) I said ya so [ah] let me check in (um) so
#ashraf# you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
so one thing that I brought out is you both <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>tersendiri</malay> grow
and then
[ah] come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you dis~ disagree or what is your perception
[ah] then they say
okay for me I (uh) I feel that
<malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>nak kena apa ada</malay> this (uh)
grow up right <malay>memang nak kena ada</malay> grow up <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) growing up needs to needs <malay>perlu berada dalam</malay>
[ah] context <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dari sendiri sebelum kahwin dan selepas kahwin</malay>
<malay>maksud dia</malay> has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
so it's like if he [lah] in the sense that [ah] so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
a bit like that but also he's trying that (uh) growing up takes place both [lah] during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this [ah] so I made it very clear that don't just lip service <malay>dia perlu perbincangan</malay> further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate <malay>abah dengar ini tak mahu</malay> communicate like <malay>tak boleh nak jumpa</malay> <malay>abah</malay> there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so (um) I think they got it [lah] so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
then after the whole session also I told #zina# and even just now I texted saying that
<malay>kau orang nak kena</malay> sit down <malay>nak kena</malay> plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say [ah] ya [lah] grow but you just gonna
<malay>tak</malay> work on it you just gonna <malay>macam letak kat tepi</malay> [jer] and just <malay>macam</malay> put it into the back of your mind <malay>tak nak macam</malay>
<malay>apa buat kerja</malay> develop this it's not gonna work
so
of course [lah]
of course I'm not <malay>macam</malay> blind to this [ah]
(mmhmm)
because at the end <malay>itu</malay> mama <malay>dekat</malay> kitchen and (mm) mama <malay>malu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti bila kita duduk makan baru</malay> mama <malay>duduk</malay>
anyway I
<malay>dayah tak ada dayah</malay> said she doesn't want to be there also [lah]
so (mm) ya then I told him okay #ashraf# after all that's been said [ah] I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya [lah] I said you have
I didn't say <malay>sembunyi-sembunyi</malay> [lah] I say you have to be upfront you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
(mm)
then
(um) so basically that's it [lah] and then
at least it's clear [lah] that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
body gesture and how he interact with #zina# he is very firm he's just firm [lah] it's that not say very firm [lah] but it's firm <malay>macam</malay> whatever <malay>zina macam nak tanya</malay> [ah] #ashraf# right do you want water then he will just say
na~ no he will just use
very <malay>macam</malay> he won't just he won't say [oh] it's okay #zina# he won't
(mm) like
so I can see [ah] and the way he speaks also is <malay>macam</malay> very direct and very
(mm) ya can see he will be the one leading the marriage [lah]
ya
so
ya
ya so it's not <malay>macam</malay> so as am~ ambiguous as it was [lah] at least it's kind of <malay>macam</malay> very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to [ah] give #zina# time to work [ah] give #zina# time to develop
<malay>kita tak tanya pasal dia punya</malay> family ya I did so his father is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
sister is working as a librarian but at #changi#
#changi# business <malay>apa</malay> #changi# [ah] ya that one warehouse [lah] ya so
ya so it's was very easy [lah] then after when he left also I was telling [lah] see how easy and simple #ashraf#
was
by just being upfront
<malay>dia macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't know that
no #zina# you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
so <malay>jadi macam</malay>
ya [lah] so basically that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
then <malay>abah</malay> is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that <malay>abah</malay> like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay <malay>abah</malay> is comfortable with him already
ya so
like my [ah] that's why it was very simple [lah] because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that [lah] [kan]
so and he also can recognize [lah] the value in it and can recognise why you know #zina# needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that #zina# needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time #zina# would be the one taking care of it
#ashraf# [ah] because (uh)
someone needs to be there at home [lah] he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or #zina's# parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working [lah] and then I ask him so (uh) are you exploring the possibility of #zina# working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay then to me
[ah] that's something that they will have to <malay>macam</malay> resolve [lah] how but at the very least they are giving #zina# time to grow
(um)
okay [lor] then after then the
in the dining
(uh)
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to actually address all these things because
clear [lah] clear and upfront
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been [ah] <malay>apa</malay> been attached to for the three months
[ah] it was okay normal not that <malay>macam</malay> overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that [ah] the past (uh) he has yet to have the chance to go for <malay>jumaat</malay> players
ever since COVID like <malay>macam</malay> basically he's just trying to share [lah] like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the we were talking about it wasn't like <malay>macam</malay> he just brought up we were talking about <malay>jumaat</malay> prayers and then we were sharing
different things
so ya to me it's simple
ya <malay>tak payah macam pening-pening sangat</malay>
[ah] actually after that was a lot more interest <malay>lepas itu lagi</malay> interesting
for example
(um)
was <malay>abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir</malay> [ah] <malay>ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah</malay>
<malay>ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik</malay>
<malay>tolak semua bu~ bu~ budak ini yang terkena</malay> [kan] then I said <malay>abah</malay>
<malay>abah nak kena tengok</malay> [eh]
#hidayah# okay you got two different daughters <malay>abah cakap apa</malay> different both are daughter yes both are your daughters <malay>tapi</malay> there are two different girls two different daughters
okay
#zina# is on the receiving end she is bre~ <malay>zina sudah memang nak menerima</malay>
<malay>apa berkahwin hidayah</malay> I don't think she is there yet <malay>dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu</malay>
<malay>pasal apa</malay>
then <malay>zina pun</malay> add in [ah] ya but she says she wants to get married ya <malay>memang dia nak tapi</malay> is she proactive looking no [what] she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors (uh)
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes she's not proactively looking for it
!huh!
then (uh) then I said so <malay>abah</malay> you need to understand <malay>yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan</malay>
#zina# is receiving #dayah# is not there yet
so <malay>abah kena</malay> recognize that and #dayah# is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say <malay>abah macam habis kita</malay> then I say okay yes I know I <malay>faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana</malay> now <malay>bila habis sampai bila abah kata</malay>
then <malay>abah</malay> let me give you some advice
if you <malay>nak di</malay> to even
<malay>dijalankan</malay>
<malay>abah bi~</malay> (err) mama <malay>bila nak</malay>
<malay>calonkan</malay> or <malay>menunjukkan calon</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> quality
<malay>biar berkualiti orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada</malay> quality <malay>dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik</malay> of course <malay>sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam</malay> give up <malay>dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah</malay> just throw [jer] ya then mama say <malay>tapi</malay> the one <malay>yang dekat</malay> australia <malay>itu abah mama tahu tak</malay> he is just a taxi driver then #dayah# will think <malay>macam bingit</malay> [lah]
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working [ah] [ah]
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he's well educated anytime he can
because he actually (err) <malay>apa</malay> he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to <malay>sewakan rumah ini</malay> so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
#dayah# at is at this stage of her life
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang aku cakap</malay>
that's why I say <malay>cari orang berkualiti</malay> is not just about
(mm)
(mm) so we don't know that [lah] !huh!
ya so anyway <malay>jadi macam</malay>
<malay>abah</malay> understood that [lah] I said <malay>abah tak boleh</malay> control <malay>apa dayah nak ini</malay>
<malay>abah boleh</malay> control <malay>kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh</malay> control <malay>itu yang abah boleh</malay> control
so I said right now it seem that <malay>dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan</malay> fine <malay>tapi cari berkualiti</malay> this if people are not are <malay>ada</malay> quality and I said <malay>pada abah</malay> it's not about social status it's not about <malay>macam kaya tak kaya</malay> ya it's about the peop~ <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match [ah]
basically this guy ya
<malay>jadi budak ini dengan dayah</malay> are two different people so cannot
that's why
so [oh] anyway going back to #zina# I told #zina# like
you need to sit down and you really need to (uh)
figure out the plan on how you gonna
<malay>buat apa mem~ ber~ memperbaiki diri sendiri</malay>
then <malay>membina diri sendiri</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak memper~ bina</malay>
<malay>bersama</malay>
<malay>jangan cakap saja</malay>
plan it out
<malay>tak boleh zina cakap</malay> [ah] ya okay I will look at it [lah] <malay>abang</malay> ya
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>cakap abang</malay> [lah] okay
fair enough [lah] if he (uh) considered (um)
cause he then I say (uh) I
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said [oh] I got to know yes~ I started off the conversation with him I got to know (uh) <malay>semalam</malay> that (err) you are #ashraf# then I was thinking okay how is it <malay>macam mana dia akan menerima ini</malay> [ah] <malay>cara</malay> [eh]
<malay>zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku</malay> like
<malay>nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama</malay> I don't know [lah] but then <malay>lepas itu dia tanya</malay> (err) <malay>abang</malay> your name is #salim# is it [ah] yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me <malay>abang</malay> [ah] like if <malay>macam dia</malay> #satay# <malay>ada banyak</malay> ya then <malay>abang</malay> also can bring back the
so I thought (err) ya that's why it was easy [lah] <malay>macam abang pun cakap</malay> and because like I said
I told #ashraf# that I'm appreciative <malay>yang dia terus terang dia</malay>
<malay>ada apa ada wawasan</malay> [lah] [ah]
<malay>lepas itu abang pun cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak apa tak</malay> clear [ah] <malay>habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini</malay>
(uh)
<malay>encik pun tak nak cakap dengan ashraf ini</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] I thought <malay>macam</malay> the
<malay>macam mana</malay> it went through was good [lah] ya
[ah] az~ #azlina#azlina# need to <malay>macam</malay> grow up [lah] on this
I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how #ashraf# is
because I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're <malay>macam</malay> like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has [lah] correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said just pick it up what #ashraf# has did you see or not how #ashraf# did it
I told her [lah] did you see or not what #ashraf# did
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront <malay>tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi</malay>
[kan] daddy <malay>cerita senang</malay> then I say isn't it simple so that <malay>macam orang tak curiga orang tak ter~ terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru</malay>
[ah] you just have to be upfront [jer] [kan] <malay>senang</malay> and ya [lah] ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
ya
that's why [lah] she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as [oh]
that's me I'm easy-going
I told her off about that
#zina# that is not easy-going
(mm)
<malay>aku cakap dengan dia yang</malay> easy-going <malay>dengan</malay> being firm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going [what]
you are not (um) having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
(mm)
that's why during the
during the discussion <malay>dengan ashraf</malay> I was saying #zina#
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study (mm) [ah] <malay>ashraf dengar</malay> [jer] [lah] what he want to say he just (mm) (mm)
that's why #ashraf#
if
(mm) but whatever it is he is already <malay>macam</malay> he never <malay>macam</malay> like show the reaction of <malay>macam</malay> you know or he didn't show it [lah] of being <malay>tak nak apa</malay> [oh] like shock or what I think he knows [ah] what he's getting into with #zina#
the way
ya [lah] of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya [lah] I agree of course that's why I said they both <malay>tersendiri nak kena</malay> grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed <malay>tersendiri</malay>
ya of course we are happy that this at least he is competent [lah]
<malay>dia</malay>
I don't think he would [lah] if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
if <malay>kalau izat buat gitu</malay> then I will tell him off [lah] [eh] <malay>kau kenal dia ke tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa</malay> so we have to be we have to take this step <malay>kita kena ber~</malay> (uh) <malay>apa kita mesti</malay>
(err)
<malay>ambil</malay> (uh)
<malay>kegiatan begini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak boleh macam apa ambil</malay> scenario [jer]
push #zina# right
pull
pull
ya
consume
I <malay>faham</malay>
step up
no [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan</malay> no
(mm)
so ya basically concludes the whole thing [lah] with
#zina# and #ashraf# then
I was two zero <malay>abah</malay> open this topic about #dayah# then I was asking #zina#zina# what have you been talking to #dayah# [lah] about #dayah's# like (err) relationship or [a'ah] <malay>zina cakap</malay> no we don't talk each other !huh!
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya #dayah# and me then ya I understand that you and #dayah# are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what #hidayah# is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
<malay>sekarang dua-dua sudah</malay> try [kan]
<malay>dua-dua sudah</malay> try
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so you tell me <malay>apa nak kena buat sekarang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>nak buat apa sekarang</malay> then <malay>dia sudah</malay> [ah] ya try again [lah] try no
<malay>sudah</malay> try <malay>sudah sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so nak <malay>kena buat apa</malay>
do what you want me to tell you the answer <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] I have to give you the answer
!huh!
why you must have the <malay>jawapan</malay> for me
I want to hear from your own <malay>mulut</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> ya then <malay>kita nak kena</malay> ask someone to help [ah] then <malay>siapa</malay> this someone to help
you [lah] [ah] then
<malay>kenapa</malay> it has to be me to ask you to
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
you know <malay>abang salim kita ada</malay> problem
okay just kind of <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
see things eye to eye <malay>tak boleh macam bersefahaman</malay>
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why <malay>zina kalau</malay> if this were the reverse that let's say you and #zina# you and #dayah#
I had the same kind of argument with me and #izat# I bet you [ah] you and #dayah# would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least [ah] you see [ah] it me and #izat#
<malay>macam mana pun</malay> that has happen [ah] #izat# would still come and apologize to me
I'm doubting you know whether you and #dayah# would apologise to each other
then you did #zina# was saying <malay>macam</malay> like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to #izat#
<malay>macam</malay> like life [lah] about children about
<malay>apa</malay> marriage like that
ya
na~ [lah] <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like how he (uh) <malay>apa</malay> decided to get married with #salimah# then ya we have ya before even during <malay>apa</malay>
during [ah] our <malay>apa</malay> being after being married also we still talk about <malay>macam</malay> certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not <malay>macam</malay> pen pals is not like <malay>macam</malay> like the way I would talk to #faris# for example but
<malay>macam</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> things about personal things I still can talk to him <malay>macam</malay> I can easily talk to him <malay>macam</malay> [eh] #izat# <malay>kau tengok macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam dayah</malay> is like s~ I can have the conversation with #izat# you know ya I can but <malay>macam</malay>
#dayah# and #zina# will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that <malay>macam</malay>
that's why [lah] that's why it seems it's
ya [lah]
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
no [lah] not really enstranged like even after this one I have <malay>macam</malay> move on and forgive him already like whatever <malay>di~</malay> he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it's it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise <malay>dulu lagi tak boleh</malay> apologise <malay>pun dia punya</malay> ego is so big
what the
like have to see it as steps [lah]
so
that I mean like
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to <malay>macam</malay> make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms #hidayah# and #zina# is different they are just happy with being ignored
<malay>dayah zina sudah</malay> give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring #hidiyah#
that's how bad it is [ah] so at least me and <malay>izat kalau kita</malay> disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like <malay>izat macam</malay> has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that <malay>macam</malay> he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>tak nak berbual dengan si salim</malay> no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
how he <malay>macam</malay> best character he needs to learn to work it out
so okay [lah] I think
<malay>kita semua memang</malay> have your own areas of growth but
#dayah# and #zina# is like they just ignore the problem then I say #zina# especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen <malay>nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi kau orang lagi</malay> will be more separated
I can tell that me and #izat# even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
you and #dayah# ready have a problem <malay>bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi</malay> what do you think
this passive aggressiveness <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah]
and not just <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay> no it's not <malay>tak apa</malay>
(uh huh)
ya I did I did <malay>macam</malay> tell her [lah] that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that (uh)
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>fikir</malay> how
this is important this <malay>memang mustahak</malay>
that family comes first
that you need to see that
you cannot just <malay>macam biarkan</malay> that this issue (err) to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya [lah] so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
<malay>bersetuju tak</malay>
<malay>nak abang salim tolong</malay>
[ah] first you have to you <malay>setuju</malay> if you <malay>setuju</malay>
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask <malay>hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak</malay> then
we will make it happen
<malay>jadi</malay> it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem <malay>masalah yang dia ada ini</malay> is trust issues #hidayah# doesn't trust her because #hidayah# feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what still haven't gone through life experience about what #zina# has trust issues because things #dayah# is no dis~ it all dismiss I'm better than you [ah] so that's why [lah] trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts [ah] so that is the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] it's just not healthy and you cannot just
<malay>biarkan macam gitu</malay> [jer]
yes so I
mama <malay>abah</malay> just listen so good thing was
mama <malay>abah</malay> willing to hear
and then
mama !wah! at one okay at one point
(mm) <malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
nevermind just (mm)
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like (um) there was one point where (um)
#zina# was (uh) no I (uh) #zina# was saying that she was (um) the reason why <malay>apa</malay> she went on to telling #izat# first because she wa~ felt more comfortable talking to #izat#
then I said #zina# since when you are that close to #izat# then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to #izat# then I say rubbish [lah]
then she <malay>sudah bingit</malay> [lah] <malay>bila kena</malay> rubbish then she walk off
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
she <malay>kena</malay> already [lah] then she walk off
so that's why I told her ya #zina# you are close to #izat# because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to #izat#
#izat# is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct [ah] but I say you are close to the boys just because of (uh)
(uh) you are close to #izat# just because the boys (uh) with #izat# you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to #izat#
then I say since when you been talking to #izat# since when
all the
then say ya of recent years it has been the case [ah] that's the part I said [ah] rubbish then stop it since when then she already <malay>sudah kena</malay> then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>mana sa~</malay> !wah! you are the
you are that close to #izat# then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys [kan]
further studies
[ah] then I also
so going back to <malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] we were talking about #zina# and #dayah# and I was asking #zina# who do you think you
need this person the person [ah] to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what #izat# can do this job [ah]
[ah] then #izat# do you think then she's like smile [ah] !aiya! [lah] cannot [lah]
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
(mm) that's why
<malay>jadi sebab dia kena tengok</malay> and understand that this is the situation
(hmm)
<malay>jadi macam bila dayah</malay>
and #zina# sit down together then they can iron this out [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward [one] really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
they just don't see the point in <malay>macam</malay> making sure that they are
you know comfortable
ya of course
true [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh macam</malay> just simply you know say that [oh] this is a one time deal <malay>mesti</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ingat</malay>
ya so obviously it takes steps [lah] it's not <malay>macam</malay> I one time can <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>apa terus langsung</malay>
wish [eh]
so <malay>kalau tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> it's not practical
okay like maybe first would be I want the bank account that will like refresh itself [tau] <malay>tak dia tak</malay> (err) like I don't need to put <malay>duit</malay> inside [lah] <malay>biar dia biar pakai</malay> [jer] refresh to the original amount so <malay>kalau macam gitu</malay> (err) I don't need like a lot of money I just have enough money but enough is good <malay>jadi</malay> like <malay>tak sombong gitu</malay> [ah]
top up [ah] top up <malay>tapi bukan kita yang</malay> top up [ah]
(uh) <malay>tak tahu siapa yang</malay> top up [ah] <malay>tapi terima kasih</malay> [jer]
then for you
<malay>nak kahwin</malay> [oh] <malay>tapi</malay> that's your first wish <malay>tu mesti ada</malay> boyfriend <malay>dulu</malay> [ah]
<malay>terus suami</malay> [eh] <malay>takde</malay> boyfriend <malay>tapi</malay> now you got boyfriend right
<malay>dah berapa lama</malay>
three months
[oh] like how is it
<malay>tapi korang ada pernah macam</malay> (uh) fight <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
so far <malay>belum</malay> [ah] (mm) okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> [kan]
se~ <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan] so cannot really meet each other that much <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] but how frequently <malay>tu</malay>
twice a week
[ah] not bad [lah]
but like for me I remember <malay>bila</malay> I was dating [kan] (uh) we meet everyday <malay>sebab sama sekolah apa</malay> so <malay>kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama</malay> in the weekends so <malay>hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka</malay> so <malay>bila kahwin</malay> I also know that <malay>takkan jelak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak serik</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] <malay>dah</malay> come on [ah] <malay>dah nak sepuluh tahun jadi kalau dah tak serik tak jelak tu</malay> should be fine [lah] [kan]
[oh] you met the mum
okay
[eh] <malay>panggil dia apa makcik cik</malay>
ya [lah]
<malay>lepas tu makcik tu cakap apa</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] <malay>jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>tapi dah</malay> it's like coincidence <malay>ke atau memang nak jumpa dia</malay>
(uh)
(mm)
<malay>bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau</malay> like <malay>atau tak kasi dia jumpa</malay> you
[eh]
[oh] ya [oh] <malay>dia tak tahu</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> [jer] <malay>tahu</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>asal dia tak bilang</malay>
right
ya <malay>macam</malay> why he like want to like keep it secret [seh]
[oh] okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you [ah]
okay so do you guys like <malay>macam</malay>
but you guys haven't fought right okay [lah]
cause they say like you know
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then <malay>kalau</malay> like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know [ah] middle chair honestly I don't know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
problem with that so far <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] K wait so what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
[oh] [eh] <malay>apa bara api tu</malay> scary <malay>juga tu nanti kalau</malay> like if one of you all like <malay>marah habis</malay> [sia] <malay>dua-dua</malay> volcano [seh]
[oh]
so like your chinese [one] your you're what [ah] tiger right ya tiger <malay>memang</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] <malay>bara api gitu</malay> tiger fierce
<malay>tapi belum apa</malay> so <malay>baru tiga bulan</malay> so you don't know [lah] like
I think it will take a while [lah]
one year
K [lah]
(um) I think one year okay maybe six months [ah]
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
cause for me and my husband <malay>kalau kita dah jumpa</malay> everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months <malay>kita macam dah tahu</malay> each other <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
like
fight that okay I did something wrong then <malay>kita orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>kita mesti cakap</malay> [ah] like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys <malay>dia sekarang sekolah</malay> right so he <malay>berapa tahun lagi</malay> [eh]
right ya so he is
[oh] he's just a normal [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> honours [lah]
okay cause I think honours is like five years <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) four years so <malay>dia macam</malay>
okay <malay>dia</malay> start <malay>dia belajar apa</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [ah]
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
(mm)
[oh] first year already <malay>tak</malay> surviving [oh] <malay>rabak hancur</malay> [seh]
exam [ah] okay so <malay>dia sekarang</malay> end of the first year
(mm) so
if he <malay>pergi</malay> counselling the course counselling he might have to restart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
three four more years with something you don't like [kan] <malay>lagi</malay> exams means you have to study for it
(mm)
[oh]
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] and he's still so young he's like what twenty five [kan] so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter [ah] ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then <malay>lagi rabak</malay> then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
I think <malay>macam dia kena fikir betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dia nak</malay> continue <malay>ke atau dia nak</malay>
like <malay>tukar ke</malay> because like one year is still okay <malay>tapi bila dah</malay> two years <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] then I think that's when it's (err) there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay [lah] <malay>kalau nak tukar</malay> right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch educat~ switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no like in for example like <malay>kalau</malay> in N_U_S so actually <malay>kalau</malay> some people right they will (uh) come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first <malay>sebab lagi senang</malay> but you waste one year [lah] but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
(uh) (uh) so like <malay>macam gitu pun boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if you want because a lot of people <malay>kat</malay> poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like (err) some course that they don't like engineering <malay>gitu</malay> then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma <malay>yang dorang nak</malay> and then after <malay>dorang masuk</malay> then they get to go [ah] so it for them is like (um) ya you sacrifice one year [ah] to do what you want then so you can think of it like that <malay>gitu</malay>
but does he know what he want to do
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay so <malay>dia dah tapi dia</malay> electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff <malay>asal dia tak pergi</malay> digipen
(mm)
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
(mm)
ya I mean take a risk [ah] if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
[kan] I mean that's what I would do [lah]
like I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best [lah]
then (um) okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
N_U_S has any of that kind of [ah]
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in N_U_S he has to think properly [lah] what kind of course he wants cause like
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for N_T_U <malay>ada</malay> A_D_M [tau] art design on media that [one] at least [ah] there's some form of creative output but for N_U_S I really don't know
(mm)
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but woo~ where do you want to go
what
[oh] okay
there's a master's in (uh) lasalle
(uh) (err) east asian studies
ya so like <malay>macam</malay> my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that [one] that time <malay>[kan]</malay> she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I didn't want [lah] so [eh] I mean I feel like
(um) I'm okay <malay>tapi</malay> I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so <malay>macam</malay> I felt like I needed to work or at least do something [ah] like not school for once <malay>gitu</malay>
ya pretty much even though like <malay>kat</malay> uni I took a two year break to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff <malay>tapi</malay> then I went back so ya then I think
I think that it's okay [lah] like
cause if you just study [jer] [kan]
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right (um) what I heard from my classmates [ah] <malay>yang dah dorang bekerja</malay> [kan] then <malay>dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun</malay> [ah] at the most <malay>sepuluh tahun gitu</malay> then <malay>dorang</malay> come back to like get just get a degree <malay>dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis</malay> like an essay like how to write essay all that <malay>dorang dah lupa</malay>
ya so (um) that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the hang of it <malay>gitu</malay>
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words <malay>apa</malay>
ya so it's it's not easy [ah]
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
<malay>berapa tahun</malay> [eh] <malay>berapa tahun</malay>
(mm)
[oh] <malay>satu</malay> [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
okay two years [ah]
so <malay>kalau</malay> you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
when
ya
<malay>lepas kahwin</malay> <malay>betul-betul nak kahwin dulu</malay> [eh]
[oh] is there a reason why you want to like <malay>kahwin</malay> first
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
(um) in terms of stress [kan] <malay>lepas kahwin</malay> [eh] you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I <malay>kahwin</malay> and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like I felt very
(um) stressed out <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>nak</malay> our mum she [ah] she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and <malay>ayah</malay> decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking <malay>gitu</malay> so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I
sleep like whenever I want
and things like that [lah] I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
<malay>tapi takde apa-apa</malay> [ah] because [ah] <malay>kalau orang tanya pun</malay> I will just say [oh] my husband he's okay with <malay>apa</malay> so in the end religiously (uh) culturally it's okay ya that's what I think [ah] so
<malay>kau siapa</malay> [seh]
so my <malay>suami</malay> is super like easy going <malay>dia faham</malay> everything I'm very honest to him
<malay>kalau</malay> I'm going to this place <malay>ke apa</malay> I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him [lah] I'm going to overnight <malay>kat tempat ni</malay> with my friends we just wanna chill <malay>kalau nak ikut</malay> [ah] like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so <malay>kalau dia nak keluar ke apa</malay> with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding [lah] so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your (um)
<malay>kahwin</malay> ya
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet [ah]
but for you
(mm)
(uh)
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive [kan] then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare [ah]
<malay>macam dorang punya gitu macam majlis dorang gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
<malay>malangnya</malay> I think you want like my kind of wedding
<malay>kampung</malay>
<malay>ulam</malay> [seh] <malay>kampung kat mana ni kampung apa</malay> malaysia
[oh]
#pulau ubin# <malay>dorang nak tutup apa</malay>
#semakau# <malay>pergi tekong sudah pergi</malay>
<malay>kalau nak pergi kat</malay> malaysia <malay>kita masih ada saudara-saudara kat sana</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak rapat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ada tu ada</malay> [lah]
filter <malay>kau</malay> block yourself you know
<malay>kau</malay> block <malay>sendiri</malay> but then the rental will be insane
[ah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] (uh) then (mm) #pulau ubin# is actually quite interesting for a wedding
ya it is or a park you know I mean if you want to go for something cheap
#tuas#tuas#
like the whole like solemnisation
serious
like are they chinese <malay>ke</malay> malay <malay>ke</malay> [oh]
<malay>takde motor takde kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>bagus kau</malay>
<malay>dia jemput</malay> [jer] <malay>semua orang tapi</malay> actually <malay>tak jemput semua orang</malay> indirectly [lah]
<malay>orang agaknya yang keluarga yang dorang tak suka semua kat</malay> west <malay>kat</malay> east so <malay>dorang pilih yang paling jauh sekali dorang pilih yang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang</malay> (uh) (um) (uh) <malay>kat</malay> #tuas# <malay>situ kat</malay> #johor# <malay>masuk</malay> [ah] #johor# <malay>masuk tapi kalau kau orang</malay> (uh) #tampines#pasir ris# <malay>tak payah datang sudah</malay> waste your time
PayNow (uh) (uh) [seh]
so <malay>dorang kat sana kat mana dorang</malay> the <malay>majlis kat mana</malay>
clubhouse
okay
[oh] okay but it such a weird place [lah] to like get a get married at (uh) at #tuas#
ya I mean if you're up for #pulau tekong# [kan]
like I'm if you're up for #pulau tekong# you're up for pretty much anywhere [seh] but I think you don't want #sentosa# right #sentosa# is too touristy for me
is like you only go there <malay>kalau nak</malay> show off
[kan] like if you just want to show off <malay>cakap</malay> like you got a lot of money then okay [lah] #sentosa# [lah] but if not then why there right there's so many other places in singapore <malay>yang</malay> you can actually get
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] ya you just book the cruise [lah] you just get one cruise (uh) (uh)
then you get married in the on the water
(uh)
(uh) <malay>tapi ada</malay> timer [ah] <malay>dah</malay> reach <malay>dah</malay> reach harbourfront okay <malay>habis</malay> wedding <malay>habis</malay>

[oh] K ya [lah] like buffet [lah] then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
(mm) ya
[eh] but no barbe~ barbecue pineapple is nice
[oh]
[oh] because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly [lah] I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
!aww! it tasted like meat ya
(mm)
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go [ah] even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like (um)
even when it was (um)
during the COVID but it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like [eh] is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so <malay>rabak</malay> so I didn't even K I didn't even like
take them afterwards after the first [one]
(uh) (uh) but okay [lah] it was fun [lah] it was for once you get to feel like <malay>macam orang kaya gitu</malay> (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> like ya that's it [lah] but I don't know [lah] like
<malay>kalau korang nak</malay> (um) <malay>pergi</malay> staycation <malay>ke tak</malay>
I know the <malay>kalau</malay> if the #d'kranji# here is
(um)
clean certified S_G clean certified then maybe <malay>kita boleh pergi sana</malay>
cause there is like very secluded [kan] so it's a different experience <malay>gitu</malay> like out of city life
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
[ah] [seh] or you can go with us [lah] like me and (uh) me and #hafiz# so you as in
(uh) you and me will have this share the room and then he and <malay>abang</malay> #hafiz# will share [lah]
(uh) so <malay>kita halalkan</malay> [lah]
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
[oh] so <malay>susah tu</malay> but no if they like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also [lah] then at least there's some a bit of
(uh) (uh) a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause <malay>kalau</malay> if it's two #hafizes# I mean both <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh]
(uh) (uh) so I think <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] like we can do that but it depends [ah] like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm) january <malay>gitu</malay> okay
(mm)
ya [lah] but I mean okay [lah] we can always go <malay>tapi</malay> the thing is like you said [ah] must plan [lah] ya
(mm)
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay [lah] so it won't be any different
I want to go J_B like staycation in J_B will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that [lah] obviously
really [ah]
like
how bad is it
it is
[oh] ya the one you told me <malay>yang dia</malay>
they had like the music
(err) show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
I mean <malay>dorang pun macam orang melayu</malay> [lah] you have to understand [lah] <malay>kita orang pun macam</malay> everything also <malay>macam</malay> relax <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>kita macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak ikut sangat</malay> [ah] but
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover [seh]
like even
if they recover like if #johor# is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
ya so I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> it will be really <malay>susah</malay> for them to
to get back up
ya
and indonesia <malay>pun teruk</malay> [seh]
like indonesia is <malay>teruk</malay>
<malay>kalau tengok dia punya</malay> cases
if
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
ya like I think like
indonesia is also like quite high death rate [kan] death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else <malay>gitu</malay>
so this is very scary [ah] like <malay>lagi dorang pun</malay> I don't think they care then they are so dense <malay>gitu</malay> the country
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya like even for our~ ours like we have all the preventive measures [kan] (err) then (err) but for them <malay>dorang tak ada pun</malay> I mean <malay>kita bila</malay> we needed the extra space <malay>terus kita pergi tukar</malay> expo [lah] <malay>tukar</malay> all the places that we already have <malay>tapi tak pakai apa</malay> because COVID [kan] so we use that place to (um) immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> indonesia I think <malay>susah</malay> because [kan] singapore [kan] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>asyik</malay> #kiasu# [kan] <malay>kita semua mesti buat cepat tapi kalau</malay> indonesia <malay>semua</malay> relax
<malay>dorang</malay> relax [jer] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] #kiasu# everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
like from what it looks they are not
(mm) (uh) <malay>dorang pun macam kalau mati</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sakit</malay> that's their thinking [ah] <malay>dah sakit apa sakit</malay> so <malay>kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi</malay>
so <malay>dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh</malay> (uh) manage [kan] all these things [ah] so it's very hard for them [ah] like india also is very bad
ya india is like one of the worst I think
ya <malay>yang teruknya</malay> [kan] a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour [ah] saying that it's
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
(uh) (uh)
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it [lah]
[a'ah] but like I feel like it's somewhat true because <malay>dorang</malay> really <malay>tak kesah</malay> for the old people
[ah] then like <malay>dorang macam</malay> they will only like take in like patients <malay>yang</malay> have a chance of survival
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck [ah] [ah] cause like what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
that's how bad their condition is it's like <malay>dulu punya</malay> america
ya during (um) last time when america was quite bad [kan] I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so <malay>macam kesian</malay> [ah] but in india it's like that every day now
(mm)
ya
ya
ya I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more <malay>tapi</malay> they don't so there must be a reason why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that <malay>kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan</malay> like
don't mess [lah] don't mess with other fri~ don't go meet with other people all that <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
ya <malay>tapi orang-orang tua dorang</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>kita orang dah cakap pakai</malay> mask and <malay>jangan</malay> (uh) <malay>jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak keluar</malay> [lah] <malay>apa nak jadi</malay>
(uh) (uh)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so <malay>macam</malay> (um) there was this <malay>atuk</malay> not <malay>atuk</malay> #ah pek# in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like [oh] no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
like we will just like !huh! like what are we supposed to do you know [ah] but like <malay>kita tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad [ah]
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya
[ah] luck luckily like (mm) I alighted much like (err) quite fast [lah] so I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
<malay>orang tak suka pakai</malay> mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
#ah pek# together <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> more than five people and then they will like they will just talk <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>macam tak ada</malay> COVID <malay>gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang</malay> just <malay>biarkan</malay> [jer] [ah]
(uh)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(uh)
ya ya like the do not
sit (uh)
(uh)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(uh)
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do [lah] <malay>dia dah</malay> like bored [lah] I think
okay
(uh)
(uh) and just be aunties [lah]
ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh) [seh]
(uh) (uh)
ya
ya that's why some guards are like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there <malay>dorang tak tengok pun</malay> [tau] <malay>kalau kau</malay> scan <malay>ke kau tak</malay> scan <malay>ke dorang</malay> just <malay>masuk dia kasi masuk</malay> [jer] <malay>dorang tak kesah</malay> [kan] ya so it's like it's so like (uh) jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay [lah] singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not [ah] I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense poulate~ so densely populated like island ya like
(um) but because everyone has to wear mask so <malay>tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> so it's that's why <malay>tak ada macam</malay> transmission not so much of transmission [ah] ya
(mm)
[ah] ya correct because we are so like [oh] my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to [ah] ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the private take Grab or something like that [kan] so (err) it's like already in our we already know you know like (um) the social way to like <malay>macam</malay> social responsibility [lah] ya like so like we are now it's like second nature already cause <malay>dah berapa lama</malay> [seh] <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> going to one year I feel
ya december twenty nineteen
(mm)
that's why then I'm like also like
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau negara lain negeri lain</malay> is like !wow! <malay>betul-betul rabak</malay> like but <malay>kat</malay> singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker <malay>punya</malay> time that time <malay>bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus</malay> [seh] ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) how their conditions were right
[oh] my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
with soap like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa nak cuci tangan dengan</malay> soap I ask you like <malay>tak ada</malay> [seh] all the aunty [ah] wash hand only wash water can already [lah] <malay>dorang memang mesti tak pakai</malay> soap <malay>punya mana ada pakai</malay> soap [seh]
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
now they don't now they're like [ah] ya <malay>kalau</malay> tak wash <malay>nanti</malay> [eh] you never wash you never like use the soap [ah] then <malay>lepas tu baru dorang</malay>
you really <malay>pakai</malay> the soap ya
(mm)
good things comes of it (uh) come out from it [lah] ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] like I think it's (um) inevitable [lah] like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
like I realise that ya because they have to clean it more
so the toilets are generally cleaner [ah] so like okay [ah] it's not bad [ah] (um) mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown [kan] and know france [kan] <malay>dah</malay> second lockdown
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we just have to suck thumb [jer] [ah] cause no choice [kan] ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya rather than <malay>macam kat</malay> sweden where it's like free and easy and then !wow! the death rates are like crazy [seh]
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order [ah] law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then (err) some people made a like sarcastic kind of (err) remark it's like (err) go to hospital
go to heaven ya this [one] they say go to hospital because they found out like
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad <malay>kat</malay> japan [lah] <malay>so dorang kena mula balik</malay> [ah] everything [lah] have to go back the mask and all that (err) I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff [lah] ya I think everywhere is still quite bad [eh] but not only some of the other countries some very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden [kan] <malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
<malay>tapi</malay> for me I <malay>kesian dia macam aku nak makan kat</malay> seoul garden <malay>sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kesian</malay> [seh] [ah] <malay>nasib baik dia pergi</malay> doctor
[ah] <malay>naisb baik dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>lepas tu</malay> you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] so
I mean I think <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> he got more hate than
what he should have gotten <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no <malay>dorang</malay> three tables (uh)
so there were still like <malay>macam</malay> #bergroup# <malay>tapi</malay> (err) it was distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around [lah] <malay>macam kadang-kadang dorang</malay> mix like you sit here I sit there <malay>ke apa</malay> mix food (err) so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the (um) the fear that they have [lah]
ya so <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
(uh)
(uh)
that time [ah]
ya
and <malay>dia sakit</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>bila dah kena</malay> COVID and the check up [oh] at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed [lah] the rules and stuff <malay>kat sini</malay> seoul garden [ah] if me I think I wouldn't say so much [seh] I <malay>diam</malay> [jer] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] but like I feel like <malay>macam</malay> why get myself into more trouble than what I have already [kan] ya so I feel like (um) he's actually good part [ah] for him to be really responsible also
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese P_M he's he actually recommended (err) people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
like what the hell does that even mean <malay>gitu</malay> (uh) (uh) so I was like !wow! this prime minister really wants to like (err) reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
(uh) (uh) I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you <malay>makan</malay> then I'm like but it's so like
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like (err) you don't you can't transmit anything [lah] so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work [seh]
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more [leh] then I'm like [oh] my goodness
(uh)
this kind of like way to combat right (uh) (uh) it's like I read it I cannot forget [seh] then I keep telling people then people like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national T_V so (err) ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> like I don't even I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it [ah] <malay>bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang habis</malay> [ah] [a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> it's
it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous
ya he's just like [ah] give up [lah] <malay>dah mengaku kalah</malay>
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to <malay>macam</malay> (err) cheer up the community <malay>gitu</malay> (um) it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time [lah]
so <malay>mak</malay>
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
why the <malay>sewa murah</malay>
[ah]
S_U_S_S
[ah] okay
how much was the rent for S_U_S_S
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
(mm)
okay
but you can cook [what]
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
so what if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
(uh) good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish
(mm)
of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict
<malay>makan</malay> hotdog <malay>pun dah marah</malay>
in school <malay>setiap kali</malay> I bring back food then you <malay>marah</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm) okay
okay
can so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to trav~ they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
<malay>itu sahaja</malay> I'm not gonna explain or elaborate on my three wishes
it's okay I'll ask the second question
(um)
(err)
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food

(mm)
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
<malay>dekat</malay> cafe #bedok# cafe <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok#

that's something new I learn about you liking to watch twilight
(mmhmm) okay
then
<malay>kau ada tengok ke</malay>
<malay>kau ada tengok ke aku tak pernah nampak engkau tengok pun</malay>
which superhero movies have you watched
[oh] <malay>yang hari itu aku bawa kau tengok</malay> [kan]
okay
so between the three s~ do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
but <malay>dia tua</malay> [kan] <malay>kau suka</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
then
so if you were to
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
<malay>yang dekat</malay>
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for pri~ (err) indivi~ sing~ (err) single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal [lah] his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
and <malay>yang</malay> help them
plan out their
master (err) their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or P_H_D
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as profe~ professor in N_T_U so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no [lah] professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their re~ research [what] like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to N_T_U each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it [lah] and
<malay>tengok kalau dia ada apa-apa nak nasihat nak bagi ke atau apa-apa</malay> then
ya then I'll decide then I also need to ask him about exchange about internship opportunities <malay>itu semua aku nak tanya nak</malay> settle
ya
ya <malay>hari isnin nak pergi</malay> then
probably <malay>jumaat balik</malay>
ya but (err) <malay>isnin</malay> I meet my mentor then <malay>hari selasa aku ada</malay> event
in school
then wednesday
wednesday <malay>aku ada apa-apa tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but probably I come back either on thursday or friday
cause I have events on tuesdays wed~ and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing [lah] because many of my friends
they
<malay>macam dia orang</malay> complain [lah] <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay>
<malay>tak suka apa yang dia orang buat</malay> then which makes it very difficult
not just my A level friends but also my friends from e~ actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they alre~ most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my frien~ A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
man~ many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly their structure is different [what]
for poly they already have a diploma in dip~ their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
A level <malay>mana ada</malay> civil
you mean from my J_C
no <malay>tak ada</malay> as in I on~
I only know one other person who's in N_T_U
was from my J_C also but the rest are all from different en~ (err) J_Cs
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in N_U_S
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like C_S and B_S
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
it's a fifty thing [lah] <malay>ada orang suka ada orang tak suka</malay>
then <malay>yang tak suka itu dia orang</malay> struggle
then <malay>yang suka</malay> they will thrive [lah] so fortunately for me I
I like what I'm doing
(mm)
N_T_U I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education [what]
ya
I'll probably still stay in N_T_U
ya
probably still st~
ya they have P_H_D and masters
but as in I think
ya they talk they <malay>cakap apa itu</malay> they all said something about how N_T_U they send their students overseas for like a short period of time to study overseas and all that <malay>itu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> that's why like I said monday I'm gonna go and talk to my profs to find out more information
also
and it's important to start early [lah] because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also [mah]
then <malay>cepat-cepat datang</malay> then I <malay>dapat</malay> my
degree <malay>cepat-cepat habis</malay> my masters or P_H_D
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I really like teaching
[eh] teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
!huh! go N_I_E
after I graduate go N_I_E
go N_I_E <malay>belajar beberapa tahun</malay> then
<malay>aku ajar dekat</malay> primary school
okay <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay
ya that's why I say as in a good com~ like a balance of me still doing
re~ something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing P_H_D [lah] and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau selalu duduk rumah sahaja</malay>
okay
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh]
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
<malay>percuma</malay>
anything [lah] ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
okay
okay
okay
(mm) actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
<malay>yang macam kau cakap demam ke</malay>
or the <malay>selesema</malay>
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
like <malay>macam demam ke selesema itu semua</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then
<malay>lagi apa</malay>
so
if
<malay>kalau</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> master three new skills what would they be
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
<malay>dekat mana</malay>
okay right
<malay>jauhnya</malay>

but it must be dry cannot be the wet #mee hoon#
<malay>yang basah punya</malay> I <malay>tak boleh makan</malay>

we ordered half of as in
I think hawaiian and super supreme
ya they changed the menu saying you can instead of one full let's say one full super supreme can now do let's say half hawaiian half super supreme
ya at the same price
I think because
I don't know [lah] (mm) (mm) is to cater to people
as in <malay>kalau kau makan satu</malay> pizza <malay>sama rasa bosan apa</malay>
so things to let people
have a bit more variety [lah]
to make their menu more interesting
ya
ya pizza (uh)
<malay>kalau aku yang tadi aku pergi jumpa</malay>

(mm)
<malay>tengok besok</malay> we will see tomorrow
ya
I mean
ya you can bring (um) rice cook~ we can bring prep rice cooker
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>pernah dengar</malay> I've heard of it before is it is electricity powered right
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can (uh) I think you just bring to the room and
ya
ya I've seen it before someone cook like <malay>macam</malay> beef rose
or stew
<malay>berapa itu</malay>
ya no [lah] it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more [what]
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back [what]
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say [what] monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
<malay>kena tengok</malay>
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months [what] it's just one semester six months
[oh] [eh] not six months [lah] three months of school
so
january to april but which is <malay>kalau aku pergi dekat</malay> january on in january right then I finish school in april I can extend my stay there [what]
no school (uh) just come back (uh) three months later
ya
yes and then <malay>kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan</malay> [kan]
she's working in U_K [what]
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
(mm) so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies [lah]
so ya she already graduated [what] she no N_S and then
ya different <malay>dia tak ada</malay> N_S then three years her course was just three years
ya
so she's working in the U_K now
then U_K is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working [lah] and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own house there
she has her own apartment
<malay>dia punya bapak beli untuk dia</malay>
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that [lah] to make money
ya
so <malay>dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana</malay>
ya U_K [kan] just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland [ah]
going for exchange
other options are U_S
ya can go U_S canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
india <malay>pun ada</malay> north india
<malay>tak nak malas</malay> because very expensive [what]
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
U_S
then I U_S also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature [what]
it's more it's less
(uh) that one <malay>aku dah</malay> check <malay>semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil</malay>
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also beside
the interesting countries [what]
and U_K then <malay>bawah itu ada</malay> spain I think <malay>semua</malay>
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
(uh) but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
(uh huh)
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you [eh] school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
so <malay>pergi</malay> N_U_S or I <malay>pergi</malay> S_M_U
no I don't want go U_S [ah]
U_S <malay>ada orang kita tahu ke</malay> do we know anyone in the U_S
we don't have relatives there
<malay>siapa</malay>
I don't know I think it's something related to
I_T related
ya okay
okay
(mm) okay
right so I think that's it we can
end the recording in three two one
!hey! [lah] how are you man <malay>dah lama tak jumpa</malay>
really long time <malay>semenjak aku</malay> last <malay>jumpa</malay> you right so how long do you think <malay>kita dah lama tak jumpa</malay>
no I think <malay>kita tak jumpa</malay> for quite some time I
it's way before COVID so COVID started last year right (err) last year when do you remember <malay>bila dia</malay> start
COVID <malay>bulan sebelas</malay> COVID <malay>bulan</malay>
okay COVID november ya so I definitely did not see you this year at all and now it's already december so <malay>dah lama gila</malay>
right
early last year you know what I can remember from my memory <malay>aku rasa</malay> is that
<malay>aku baru balik daripada</malay> my overseas job I came back then after that I saw you with your wife then after that <malay>kita dah tak jumpa lagi</malay> for a very long time then suddenly the next news that I got from you is that
(err) my mum <malay>bilang aku yang nurul</malay> is pregnant was pregnant and then after that [eh]
it's time to go you should visit your brother he's is over there and he's going be a dad soon and <malay>asal kau tak jumpa dia</malay>
yup
how old is your daughter now
[oh] my god you see
you see
it's [ah] it's he's a it's
he's turning two this coming december so that is how long that I've not seen you
and the irony is that you only live like two blocks away from me
and we used to be very good friends <malay>semenjak kita orang kecil lagi</malay>
[lah] you know what I was actually like in my mind right I was thinking when was the last time <malay>kita orang jumpa</malay> I mean when was the last when did we first meet up
when we this did we first meet <malay>abeh kau nak berbual</malay> english <malay>pun dah susah</malay> [kan]
just after kindergarten okay no no no no no because if you remember correctly right for the longest time
(err) from my memory is that we went for <malay>apa</malay> [tau] performance ya you know that was like some <malay>bengkel kanak-kanak</malay> or some do you know remember <malay>aksi mat yoyo</malay> when we used to be there was remember that show <malay>aksi mat yoyo</malay> it's an entertainment for kids kind of a variety show and then we
(err) we met up at <malay>mak long punya</malay> okay so <malay>mak long aminah suriga</malay> is the like the producer for those kinds of (err) shows in entertainment right
let's put it the main woman yes <malay>pasal dia</malay> it's a woman ya I don't know whether she's still alive I hope that she is you know
(mm) <malay>mak long</malay>
yes we just performed our buttocks off ya and you remembered in her house there was like there's like
a mini stage where she you know it was in like her I don't think that is her living room her house her flat was quite big
then <malay>kita orang</malay> and the stage was in between the living room and the kitchen yup remember that right
ya so <malay>aku</malay> I remembered that [ah] <malay>kita</malay> start performing and then after that we became friends
because our parents are friends not parents our mums are <malay>kawan baik</malay>
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> how they became friends [eh] yes because okay you know what let's not talk about that because okay maybe we can ask them later it's about us because we have not been catching up and we start from where we first from where I first remember
when I met you <malay>dulu</malay>
<malay>rumah mak long</malay> correct so we started dancing and then we did a few shows <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>bengkel kanak-kanak punya macam</malay> performance and then I remembered doing shows <malay>kat situ</malay> with my sister <malay>dengan</malay> your sister <malay>dengan</malay> you together so it's #sriwana# yes you see now it's all coming back
ya lots of memories there but very (err) blur
vague
clou~ cloudy ya you can use the word cloudy because it's (err)
ya it's
cloudy is dark
yes I think <malay>kita orang</malay> were quite active in performance because I remember (um) quite vividly there was this particular show <malay>kita orang semua nak kena</malay> remember that song old mcdonald's had a farm
old mcdonald's had a <malay>kebun</malay> is it <malay>kebun</malay> in malay
yes so that song goes like old macdonald had a farm right so
ya
<malay>engkau ada topeng</malay> [lah] but I do not have a <malay>topeng</malay> so what I need to do was with my face bare out in the open I need to because <malay>lembu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> horns right so I need to be a <malay>lembu</malay> with horns so what I did was during the song of (um) old mcdonald's had a farm while everyone was wearing <malay>dia orang punya topeng</malay>
I had to stick out two of my bloody pointy fingers and put it on my head and pretend I'm a cow that was really traumatising for me [lah]
yes ya
ya but at the same time I was very you know as a kid right the thought of being embarrassed is not
there yet you see
<malay>kita</malay> happy go lucky just go with the flow <malay>mak cakap apa kita buat</malay> then after that <malay>jalan jadi lembu taruh tangan kau jadi lembu</malay> then just <malay>joget</malay>
in front of people
you were a duck I remembered <malay>kau itik</malay> because they had if you remember there was this disney <malay>nya itik</malay>
and then after that the dis~
and which one is donald duck don't know that ya you were donald duck but the one with the sailor blue sailor hat okay that's donald duck okay right just try to be (err) not confirm just to be sure [lah] [kan] <malay>kita orang ni iya</malay> [lah] [kan]
so
(err) I remember that you were donald duck and <malay>kau joget macam biasa</malay> [lah] you were happy confidently you know yes
ya you were it
(err) you were <malay>itik</malay> okay so
I remembered that then the next memory that I had quite vividly
okay make sure you don't that memory don't okay [lah] the word is forget ladies and gentlemen (um)
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] so (err) the next memory is <malay>bila aku dengan kau</malay> we were in your dad's car
<malay>baru balik daripada</malay> some performance that we had because we had a few of those performance right <malay>kat luar</malay> some C_C [lah] community centre <malay>dulu dia orang cakap apa</malay> R_C [ah]
ya P_P_I_S we all P_P_I_S so it was actually quite (err) at that point of time I did remember that <malay>kita orang</malay> we will performing for orphans and all this right so ya we were doing ya bro then I remembered that (err) we were doing good stuff [lah] which we did not know was good at that time
ya (err) <malay>aku pun ingat yang</malay> that we get to perform then after that <malay>balik</malay> so getting back to the memory <malay>yang</malay> in your dad's car <malay>aku ingat bapa kau</malay> because your <malay>bapa</malay> was driving a red colour car a small one do you remember the car that was a honda
so <malay>kereta tu dah takde lagi dalam</malay>
manufacturing
okay cool but I remember <malay>kereta tu kecil</malay> then after that your dad was like you know so he was turning left and right so every time <malay>kalau dia nak pusing kiri ke dia pusing kanan ke</malay> and so we were at the back <malay>dengan aku kita duduk kat belakang</malay> and then after that your father will drive the car and when he turn left we will like to the right you know like [oh] so we made so much noise that the ya the three maybe four five years old ya rollercoaster thing going on very irritating to the to
right no continue no ya
yes it's definitely irritating and looking back at it right now <malay>kita dah tua ni</malay> [kan] it was very it was because it happened by (mm) ya so I'm not sure okay so your
this was another traumatising part (err) on my end
<malay>pasal</malay> your <malay>bapa</malay> suddenly <malay>pusing belakang</malay> then <malay>cakap</malay> can you guys stop it or not
so I was (err) you know I got quite scared of your dad <malay>daripada hari tu aku macam</malay> [eh] hi uncle
ya until now ya I respect him you know not because of that only because he's your dad he's a old man all these [lah] and he's a he's a wonderful malay guy old chap yes <malay>aku rasa</malay>
I guess so ya I guess so
maybe <malay>dia bingit</malay> ya I mean we <malay>kita orang</malay> deserved it <malay>seratus</malay> percent we deserved it
[oh] ya [ah] we were kids we were
just stop [lah] like !whoa!
ya but you know
overall your dad is a wonderful person you know (err) I'm not saying anything bad about him it's just that <malay>nak bilang kau</malay> [jer] that was a memory [ah] ya your turn
right
(hmm) [oh] my god
I remember those moments of education <malay>yang aku tak</malay>
forced that's the word
really [oh] that was so sweet of you <malay>aku</malay> feel so (err) yes

<malay>engkau bukan seorang</malay> ya
[oh] I remember I know where you're going with this I <malay>aku tahu mana kau nak pergi dengan ini benda</malay>
and
ya I I that what that is another memory which is quite traumatising for me as well <malay>pasal aku ingat</malay> at that point of time [kan] you had a bike you had a bicycle and that bicycle <malay>ada</malay> tank <malay>warna kuning</malay> it's a G_T bicycle with a yellow colour tank then <malay>lepas tu ada</malay> seat <malay>kat belakang</malay>
<malay>untuk kau duduk</malay> then after that bicycle <malay>kecil</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi mati-mati kita nak tumpang</malay> each other it's a chopper
what
[oh] my god I remembered
right
right (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
we ya
I remembered
I I try to describe it [ah] so we burn the matches right then after that we as okay we burn the matches we blow the fire out then after that we put it in our mouth so that the smoke will the yes the matchstick into our mouth so that the smoke will accumulate and then when we open our mouth it's as though we are <malay>tengah hisap rokok</malay> [ah]
then we were doing [oh] and you know ya that was
we were very happy
right
[oh] ya
ya it became like a campfire thing did we were we arsonists did we burn any <malay>macam</malay> dustbin <malay>tak</malay> [kan]
but
it [oh] ya yup near our house [ah] ya the one opposite our house <malay>kat rumah bawah</malay> block #farhan# if you remember correctly
yes I remember that part also and another thing which I also remember was that (err)
brother john
<malay>salah</malay> brother love
no
love
brother love
john J A B C D E F G H <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya [eh] same [ah]
ya I <malay>aku</malay> understand what you are trying to say because for example let's say we meet someone right and then <malay>kita lupa nama dia</malay> and then after that <malay>nama dia apa</malay> then we will go through all alpha~ alphabetically just to try and [eh] he looks like a john you know [oh] ya he is a john so we I go through that thing also I believe <malay>apa</malay> [tau] [lah] like they did (err) they did a study about this <malay>dia orang cakap apa</malay> [tau] <malay>siapa yang dulu</malay> (um) <malay>buat</malay> show <malay>dengan mak long gitu</malay>
(mm) <malay>siapa</malay> the kids that <malay>buat</malay> show <malay>dengan</malay> P_P_I_S #sriwana# so they have that it's in it
I think we should say thanks to her ya if (err) if you know like if I get to see her [eh] <malay>mak long</malay> hi remember me she probably wouldn't <malay>pasal</malay> ya
ya you can say that I have a <malay>janggut</malay> it's okay because I saw you staring at my <malay>janggut</malay> and <malay>aku</malay> realise <malay>yang kau tengok dengan macam</malay>
right
okay
you
I mean you are very positive
ya I mean like to continue the whole <malay>janggut</malay> thingy if you want to stick to the topic like for a while if you do <malay>kalau</malay> if you don't mind <malay>janggut ni sebenarnya apa</malay> [tau] if for me [kan] <malay>aku punya janggut ni sebenarnya aku ni pemalas</malay>
<malay>aku malas</malay> (mm)
ya because I realise <malay>bila kau malas kau jadi gemuk</malay>
<malay>kau tak keluar janggut kau jadi gemuk</malay>
ya but <malay>gemuk</malay> is okay because you know (err) I don't mind but
what
right right right I feel that I feel that you are trying not to raise up that whole thing about you know fat people are lazy or whatever ya I (err)
yes (err) I mean my mum is quite
fat and I love her and my dad loves her very much you know (err) ya she's been quite fat for
quite some time
(mmhmm) okay (err) I remembered when we went to primary school together right we went to #xishan# primary school together which is in #yishun#
like I am one year younger than you if <malay>kau ingat betul-betul aku sebenarnya muda engkau setahun tapi muka</malay> [jer] <malay>nampak macam</malay> ten years older from you and of course <malay>aku punya</malay> attitude is very mature
bye
right
(err) yes and vice versa so every year we will go through that thing so we seldom see each other <malay>kita akan jumpa</malay> each other <malay>bila</malay> (err) <malay>macam nak balik sekolah</malay> so <malay>kau balik sekolah aku baru nak pergi sekolah dengan</malay> thing sometimes
you know that kind of thing so
[oh] no
okay I try to I try to from my memory [lah] because I'm one year younger than you so I probably have a bit more okay so (err) what happened was (err) after primary school [kan] <malay>pergi</malay> secondary school <malay>tapi aku</malay> went to a
secondary school which is quite far away from #yishun# you see I went to saint andrew's school (err) which is located <malay>dekat</malay> #potong pasir# so <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] saint andrew's <malay>kat</malay> #potong pasir# so saint andrew's <malay>dekat</malay> #potong pasir# (err) <malay>aku</malay> had to do my early journey blah while you were just you know like early journey to go to school because school [kan] <malay>mula pukul tujuh setengah</malay>
I have to wake up every morning at five or five thirty <malay>pagi</malay> then after that make my way to school by taking the M_R_T or the bus so I start my journey probably around <malay>pukul enam pagi sampai sekolah tujuh setengah</malay> then after that
ya
normal timing correct so during that point of time we <malay>jarang jumpa</malay> each other because I was busy with my school and then you were lucky enough to go to a school which is
<malay>dekat dengan kau punya rumah</malay> so which is northland secondary school
see how lucky you are and you are living in (err) your place right is located whereby it's
it's the view is wonderful from your house right the view is wonderful from your house because (err) there were fields there were schools around it there was no flats blocking <malay>kau punya pemandangan</malay> [kan]
warning sign [ah]
that what you must be like <malay>terkencing dalam seluar</malay> [eh]
confirm <malay>kena rotan</malay> with your mom I remembered because your mom is (err) your mom is very strict (err) woman from <malay>bila aku pergi rumah kau pun mak kau pun macam</malay> quite (err) (err) how to say how should I put it [eh] verbal
ya she's fine with me I I actually you know what I love her until now because <malay>sampai sekarang mak aku dengan mak kau masih</malay> best friends you know I mean not as close [lah] because age and all this perhaps you know then after that you know like all almost all relationship goes I mean you tend to fade away and then after that <malay>datang balik</malay> fade away <malay>datang balik</malay> but I appreciate the
the connection still
you know until now because you know in fact tomorrow is my <malay>mak aku punya</malay> birthday ya and guess how old my <malay>mak aku</malay> is
<malay>mak aku</malay> is sixty six years old [lah] O_M_G that is (err) there's quite a that's quite a an old age sixty six years old you know
so yup
and
your father because I think we did have this conversation
(err) at one point of time
like you know what I remembered that we actually bumped into each other for <malay>bulan puasa punya</malay> time
<malay>bulan puasa punya</malay> time remember we went for during ramadan we went to the mosque I think like once or twice we bumped into each other so we did catch up but just a very short time it's nothing like this
yes either that or <malay>kita pergi sembahyang jumaat</malay>
yes so we did [lah] but not for a very long time [lah] <malay>sekejap aje kita lepak</malay> then after that (err) I bumped into your dad
(err) he went to the friday prayers yes so I bumped into him and I said [eh] uncle (err) how are you because your dad always speaks in english then <malay>mak kau berbual melayu</malay> so you have that both thing right so then after that
[oh] ya my dad also [lah] my dad also speaks english
[ah] then after that (um) ya so (um) your dad <malay>aku jumpa dia</malay> then after that (err) you did ask me this question before [eh] <malay>bapa aku umur</malay> seventy almost eighty years old <malay>kau cakap gitu dengan aku</malay> then <malay>aku ingat macam</malay> [eh]
are you sure your dad is almost eighty years old <malay>kau biar betul dia nampak macam muda</malay> [tau]
like around my dad's age [ah]
mid seventies right so that makes sense you know when you say <malay>bapa aku tak tahu bapa aku umur dalam lapan puluh tahun kau biar betul</malay> your dad doesn't look like you know that ya because he's actually strong you know like he looks alright he doesn't look frail and he still you know he's still can function as a old man
same bro but not my dad [lah] my dad will exercise <malay>tapi bapa kau keluar rumah ke</malay> he should be at home or <malay>dia keluar rumah</malay>
as in to do his exercises right
amazing <malay>macam bapa aku juga</malay> my dad will wake up like early
and he will do the simple exercises with the stretches no I did introduce him to yoga but I don't think he's interested in that
but <malay>tapi</malay> you know looking at him stretching <malay>aku rasa</malay> he is still you know quite active in that sense <malay>pasal sekarang</malay>
(err) during on his birthday right two years ago I think <malay>aku belikan dia basikal</malay> for his birthday present then <malay>sekarang baru nampak tu basikal keluar</malay> as often
ya he starts to like cycle so
like I'm actually happy for him you know because
ya rather than to just stay home watch T_V blah you know it's better to be active outside especially when you are old you know especially the government right now [kan] <malay>dia orang kasih</malay> (err) facilities for the old people <malay>untuk dia orang</malay> workout
correct ya yes correct so (err) what happened was speaking about this right my dad retired so what happened was that he got bored and then he decided to <malay>masuk</malay> class [ah] join a class <malay>yang</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> funding
I forgot what is it called S_G future or something like that skillsfuture ya so <malay>dia orang ada</malay> this skillsfuture <malay>punya</malay> thing so my dad got interested so he sign up for some (err) security course so ya so
I guess I mean
for his retirement he would probably be you know one of those security guards <malay>bila kau nampak kat</malay> condo then after that [eh] uncle how are you
okay [lah] same [lah] like yesterday also <malay>takde ubah sama aje</malay> like that [lah]
ya so (um) (um) he will be one of those and hopefully he be going strong you know like for a few more years [lah]
ya rather than to stay home then after that you know waiting for my mom to scream at him
what do you mean
is this your transition to talking about music are we done talking <malay>pasal kita orang punya</malay> growing up in stages are you sure you want to go down that road [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>asal</malay>
ya
yes that's a good segway actually because (um) I mean it still sticks with me I mean like most people I guess they are you know they love music right so just like us you especially <malay>pasal aku</malay> realise <malay>engkau sampai sekarang masih macam</malay> (err) doing gigs touring and all these do you still tour do you still <malay>buat kau punya</malay> music <malay>semua</malay>
ya
(hmm) okay (err) is it's due to the whole COVID <malay>punya</malay> situation <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan]
[oh] you do (err) facebook <malay>punya</malay> session like live <malay>punya</malay> session is it [oh] that's cool you know what I found out that (err) one of our friend's <malay>apa ni</malay> boy #cazly# because I did meet up (err) met up with him the other time which was like maybe a month back somewhere around that time [lah] so <malay>sekarang dia</malay>
when we hang out that time <malay>dia cakap dengan aku yang dia baru buka</malay> a new studio where he will do live recordings and he will pay he will post it on facebook as in for live show I
believe it or not I do not have a facebook <malay>punya</malay> account I am not a
not say active [lah] like I am not interested in the whole thing I don't know maybe because I'm like you know I like it's weird because okay
it's weird because everyone is in it everyone is in the whole social media thing and you probably get to know information or I mean like current situation information <malay>daripada</malay> you know the social media but <malay>untuk aku</malay> I
I don't get my information from there I go to the news I direct news B_B_C and all this
more reliable that one is more reliable but at the same time <malay>macam</malay>
the reason why I do that is just <malay>tak banyak sangat</malay> information coming in from left to right too many points too many (um) you know opinions from the social media <malay>dia punya</malay> community
so I don't and as you know I'm quite introvert also
am I ya I think so ya I'm quite introvert ya so ya because ya I rather you know
I rather be alone
and I'm not lonely !wow!
<malay>tak</malay> I don't know <malay>kalau</malay> does that make sense to <malay>kalau aku cakap</malay> I like to be alone and I'm not lonely (hmm) do I have an imaginary <malay>kawan</malay>
no
ya I mean but
why
okay so like basically just to be updated <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> [ah]
so what you're telling me that you have like (err) you have you are talking about facebook right okay so <malay>dalam kau punya</malay> facebook <malay>tu</malay> you post like funny things
right
but
ya I ya you know what I definitely one hundred percent
let's even up it a bit more hundred and ten percent agree with you <malay>pasal engkau</malay> I realise I mean knowing you as a friend for a very long time you are very positive (err) person <malay>seseorang yang</malay> positive [lah] <malay>senang cakap</malay>
you know and you are always smiling you always happy and I don't understand that about you sometimes
because how can this guy <malay>selalu macam gembira ke sana ke sini ada</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> funny and nice things to talk about you know nothing dark nothing you know like for me if you were to sit a little bit longer I will start you know coming out with a conspiracy theories and all this
<malay>kelakar seram kadang-kadang ada pontianak kat belakang</malay> whatever [oh] so then you know that's just me but for you right I realise as a person and I really appreciate you for that for being that kind of person because ya <malay>pasal sekarang ni</malay>
you know there are a lot of (um) negative people out there especially you know if you look at comments in youtube I do go to youtube though <malay>tengok</malay> comment comments <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> video guitar [lah] music whatever so there I will I like to read the comments because they are just
stupid and evil
at times
ya this is relative to <malay>dalam bidang kugiran</malay> music <malay>selamat hari raya kepada</malay> all the people in singapore
malaysians really why be careful [ah] [oh] what are you trying to say [lah] can you please be more (hmm)
(hmm) I'm not really sure about what you just said that like are you being truthful <malay>kepada diri engkau</malay>
actually <malay>aku pun suka orang</malay> malaysia [lah] but depends <malay>orang</malay> I mean individual you can be in malaysia you can be in somalia you can be in wherever country africa whatever whichever continent is that is you as a person <malay>macam mana kau</malay> treat <malay>orang tapi orang</malay> malaysia <malay>pasal aku ada banyak sedara</malay> my uncles my aunties in malaysia yes

under a tree <malay>bawah pokok</malay> then after that <malay>balik lari pergi ke</malay> #penang# for them to get married
so they got married they set up a house he became a policeman blah then after that he had I think like nine children
you know because at that point of time during the olden days they liked to have so many children I don't know why you know there was no control so my mum was apparently I think she's like number five or something ya
she's like the one of the middle child
okay
rewind
wait let me get it straight <malay>nenek kau punya kakak</malay> which is your
grand aunty [ah] yes

<malay>kita orang ada luqman orang melayu ada luqman</malay> ya so (err)
my
(err) nephew's name is (err) #luq lucien#
#luq lucien# so that #lucien# <malay>tu</malay> is very particular <malay>pasal orang</malay> french <malay>kau nak kena</malay> pronounce <malay>dia orang punya</malay> language in you know because they love their language so much it's and I agree that it's very sexy language <malay>aku memang suka bila orang</malay> french <malay>berbual</malay>
you know <malay>pasal tak kisah lelaki ke perempuan ke orang tua ke orang muda ke</malay> the language itself is just
very sexy it's not beautiful it's just sexy (hmm) so I like how they pronounce (err) stuff and the way they talk especially <malay>bila dia orang dah</malay> start <malay>berbual</malay> french <malay>abeh nak</malay> start <malay>berbual</malay> english <malay>lagi</malay> sexy [lah] but let's not get too deep on the sexy part <malay>nak kena</malay>
let's go back to the unsexy part
[oh] this so unsexy [lah]
okay music part [oh] so okay sorry you're done with me [ah] with my family alright I guess <malay>aku rasa aku punya</malay> family <malay>tak</malay> interested <malay>tak</malay> interesting <malay>aku rasa</malay> okay [ah] <malay>berbual pasal</malay> music [ah] no [lah] nah I'm just kidding that's why I love you [lah] because you [ah] what~ whatever mean things that I think is quite mean and then when I say it to you right you
you don't mind and you just brush me off with a laugh and whatever and I really appreciate that some people <malay>kau apa ni berbual pasal aku punya keluarga macam gini</malay> you know that kind of thing [ah]
<malay>terbawa-bawa abeh balik rumah</malay> then after that they will scream in the pillow
O_M_G those must be the youtube commenters [oh] my god
let's not get into let's talk about music let's stay above water level and talk about the music that I'm listening to <malay>macam apa yang kau berbual tadi</malay>
yes the punk (err) phase of our life
how did I get into the current music that I'm listening to well okay how did I get
roughly (um) you know (um) (err) as you know I'm working from home right now right so <malay>aku ada banyak</malay> time <malay>kat rumah</malay> then I could been listening to no at first I bought a guitar I don't know guitar <malay>apa nak beli</malay> you know this is a typical (um) you know typical if people were to hear my story it will be quite typical because
why would you know like a mid life guy have a guit~ buy a guitar at this age you know right why what's up it's just <malay>pasal aku ada banyak</malay> time and I just want to pick up a new hobby yes no it's okay
yes
yes [lah] as you know <malay>aku dulu main</malay> drum <malay>asal</malay> it suddenly it's all about me now let's talk about you why I why do I feel that I'm interrogated [oh] ya you do
right
<malay>yang penting kau</malay> terror !wow! that should be your next (err) malay album <malay>punya yang penting kau</malay> terror
<malay>dengar</malay> [lah] <malay>kita orang punya</malay> record <malay>baru</malay> which is called <malay>yang penting kau</malay> terror
ya <malay>dan sekarang aku main</malay> guitar and I have to say that I actually am not good at it even after like a year of learning it takes a lot of dedication <malay>nak kena</malay> invest <malay>kau punya</malay> time <malay>main</malay> guitar and you and I have to say I start I started quite late [lah] I started quite late then after
I when I get to know you again during the secondary school <malay>punya</malay> time at the point of [kan] <malay>kau dah</malay> start <malay>main</malay> guitar you know and all this <malay>kau dah</malay> start <malay>main</malay> cranberries <malay>kau dah</malay> ya you were playing like bar and not like full chords you know full guitar chords which sounds amazing
you know and <malay>aku pula</malay> when I was in saint andrew's school [kan] <malay>aku belajar</malay> drums so after that then we at one point of time we started a band together then you then <malay>bila kita masuk</malay> band together we had a few of our friends then <malay>kita masuk</malay> a few competitions which I mean not to brag but we got you know
<malay>yang penting kita</malay> terror yes just like your the name of your future album
yes correct so
talking about drums right you were talking about drums is it
guitar right [oh] sorry
(mm) that's that phase of my life
ya yes <malay>pasal</malay> okay (err) the reason why I got myself into the whole E_D_M which is electronic dance music <malay>pasal</malay>
at that point of time <malay>kita orang punya</malay> band <malay>dah tak ada lagi</malay> then after that <malay>kita orang</malay> decided to go our own way separate ways then everyone was you know leading their own lives <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> so I got lonely as I usually would and I started listening to (um) dance music
some techno <malay>punya</malay> stuff some (err) defected (err) record stuff which is quite cheesy [lah] to be honest with you like (err) they call it tech house so tech house is just like fall on the floor <malay>punya</malay> beats <malay>macam</malay> that kind of music so (mm)
so <malay>aku dengar</malay> (um) techno <malay>aku dengar</malay> tech house then there were few other house <malay>punya</malay> genres [ah] so they had (err) like different
genres like sub genres [ah] within that genres so I listen to specifically <malay>macam</malay> tech house deep house that kind of thing so (err) it got quite deep and then after that I started listening vinyl so I saved up money got myself a turntable then after that
(err) I had a good friend who used to listen to vinyls as well so we got into it together then we started D_Jing then after that <malay>kita orang dapat</malay> a few gigs <malay>kat</malay> #sentosa# <malay>dapat main kat</malay> club <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> we had fun but to be honest with you that kind of music I mean like yes it's we were growing up you see then it
in my perspective at that point of time I was like doing it
(err) because right
the music is still strong I loved the music actually I love the whole production aspect <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> music <malay>tu</malay> I prefer to do that rather than to listen you know rather than to be a D_J and to mix like
a D_J a disc jockey <malay>dia orang punya kerja ni</malay> is to mix (err) <malay>satu lagu dengan satu lagu</malay>
so <malay>dia tak ada</malay> stop [ah]
right correct
yes for so for example <malay>macam ada satu lagu</malay> if he's playing in turntable A right so that <malay>lagu</malay> belongs to an artist correct so from my (err) end of it I would like to produce my own track I would love to have my music in the playlist
in a playlist you know because the whole thing about
(um) E_D_M or house music or that point of time it's just to get the whole flow the whole energetic flow of dancing you know of having fun in the dance floor
<malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err) I would
<malay>lagu</malay> original it's prefer~ preferable [lah] you know that's the reason why like <malay>kalau nak</malay> have a band to play (err) like cover song I mean you can do that but you know it's like practising is like practising other people's song when you have (err) you know you have your own creativity right you want to express it and you have to want you want to create something on your own so <malay>aku rasa</malay> that is the part where you know we have our own band kind of thing
remember when we had our band we were playing other people song and then <malay>kita orang nak kena macam belajar dia orang punya</malay> chord <malay>belajar dia orang punya</malay> style of music
correct (err) back then yes (err) but
in that kind of genre [lah] in that kind of context (mm) ya I mean the whole E_D_M thing for me <malay>aku rasa tak</malay>
although I did that for quite some time you know I think I did that for probably around like ten years or something like that ya I was playing in like (um) in #sentosa# which is an outdoor <malay>punya</malay> outdoor like
(mm) rest~ not restaurant like a disco
disco discotheque <malay>mak cakap</malay> discotheque <malay>kau pergi</malay> discotheque <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> discotheque [ah] <malay>mak</malay>
ya like a pool party kind of lounge so I went to I was the resident there for every sunday and then <malay>lepas tu aku</malay> manage to do my own company so I hooked up with (err) a friend of mine then after (um) together he was from america then we <malay>kita orang</malay> joined forces
(um) to create to have a company so we brought a brand which is from U_K the brand is called (err)
[oh] my god how can I forget this
(err) <malay>aku rasa aku</malay> wait <malay>sabar aku lupa</malay> that was quite some time ago (err) so we bought that brand then after that
we all hat candy hard candy so we brought that brand hat candy into in singapore then <malay>kita</malay> launched <malay>kita orang punya</malay> own party [ah] so then we had we fly in the we flew in their D_Js to play <malay>gedebak gedebuk</malay> then
ya it was fun because you know you get to create something even though I mean it's not music though that I created art not say I created I mean we me and my friend we managed to bring in more entertainment (err) value to singapore which is at the highest standard (err) at that point of time then <malay>kita orang</malay>
<malay>buat duit</malay> apart from that you know we (err) charged people at the door <malay>kita buat duit dekat dalam dekat</malay> bar
so we managed to make (err) money then after that it went on for quite some time then after that things got sour I don't want to go into too much detail <malay>dalam tu</malay> then ya [lah]
(err) now I'm back in my room listening to some dirty blues and playing <malay>aku punya</malay> guitar
ya I've been listening to what got me interested with there's a lot of guitar driven bands
out there in the youtube world <malay>sekarang kalau kau tengok kat dalam</malay> youtube you know
even from back then [ah] radiohead [lah] you know you have your death tones you have your whatever band which is you know cool at that point of time so that has always been (err) you know I like that but I can't do that
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
<malay>anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik</malay>
ya
be a good children
then
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>buka</malay> business <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
that we work fishing prawn very long time
(mm) ya
(uh) ya
I we went to many schools
schools and also
institute
S_I_T
(uh) then we find it
(err)
S_I_T <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>sewa itu agak tinggi juga sekolah sewa</malay> canteen <malay>itu murah</malay> [lah]
S_U
ya
S_U_S_S
the rent was very cheap just five dollars
per month yes
(uh) actually we can sell anything [lah] but except
except like we cannot sell deep fried items
<malay>tak boleh jual macam ayam goreng</malay>
(uh)
<malay>ikan goreng yang goreng-goreng itu tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kita kena kurangkan minyak</malay>
then we need to use less oil
and then we cannot sell junk food
like processed food
we cannot sell processed food like sausage and all those things
ya
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tapi masalah dia</malay>
we cannot
hi~ no wait we need to look out for local peoples to work there
yes
so I have to find the locals [lah] to work there
ya so
(err) <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang yang nak</malay>
<malay>bagi kita itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia ca~ dia sekarang dia tahu masak dia pandai masak</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau saya ambil alih</malay>
if I take over
I need to learn cooking so it's not that
you know
overnight thing I need to
learn
<malay>macam mana nak masak</malay>
ya
ya <malay>boleh masak</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
the canteen sells malay food
muslim
stall is a muslim stall
(um)
mostly is malay food like #mee soto#mee rebus#
#nasi lemak#
and those kind of things [lah] <malay>macam nasi putih nasi</malay>
<malay>lauk-lauk</malay>
so
(err) <malay>jadi saya kena belajar masak dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>baru saya boleh buka</malay>
(mm)
<malay>sebab</malay> because at schools they have (err)
like quota like unique this stall need to be this kind of food
the other stall need to so this stall is basically for muslim malay food
so <malay>kita kena jual benda yang sama</malay>
ya
so (uh)
<malay>orang yang nak jual itu</malay>
canteen they <malay>cakap</malay> they <malay>ada</malay>
business <malay>lain</malay> so <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada masa nak jaga dekat situ</malay> [lah] because
they need to standby there
it's the requirement the owner need to be there at all times at least one owner
so the guy say
they don't have the time because they also need to look after other business
then
belongs to them [lah]
ya
so <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> now we are
searching for the suitable space [lah] first
so everyday we are going out and finding if there is any
(err) good space to start small
ya
ya
my third wish
I would say everyone to be healthy
that's very important
ya
ya so
ya mak~ (mm)
because
I
<malay>saya tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa itu kalau tak ada</malay>
<malay>tak ada kesihatan itu</malay>
we cannot do anything in life
everything will be very difficult and miserable
ya
<malay>duit itu kita boleh cari tapi kalau kesihatan tak ada</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
ya
so in order to live a life we need
help
ya (mm) <malay>maksud saya yang</malay> my first wish <malay>yang anak-anak jadi baik itu</malay>
<malay>bukan baik</malay> I mean it's <malay>baik</malay> overall [lah] it's good
to the society good to the family
you know it's not there's just the kids
not just the children but also the
parents also need to be
nice to the children
you know
ya so <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>awak ada apa-apa awak boleh cakap dengan saya kalau saya boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
ya so it's best either you share everything [lah]
rather than you
just doing by yourself sometimes you get lost also
[ah]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so what I can ask you
I ask you now what are your three wishes
ya
okay
(mm)
(mm)

I think everyday we are repeating the whole food that it's nothing like very extraordinary
things that I had

you know we are keep having this (um) same food
to recall anything that
extra ordinary kind I think
(err) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ingat</malay>
(mmhmm)
smoked duck
<malay>dekat mana</malay>
(uh)
was it good
(mm) but I'm not a person who like to explore like you know the things that I didn't
(err)
I didn't had before like
I will only take the normal meat like chicken mutton or beef or fish

person who will go and try like
new kind of meat like duck meat or
other than
the meat I mentioned before
ya (err) but if it's like fruits and vegetables I'm okay to try
like salads
and all those things like cakes all I'm fine with that

if you are considering higher education <malay>mana awak nak belajar</malay> singapore <malay>ke</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] they have P_H_D and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how N_T_U they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
N_I_E
[eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini</malay> then go
<malay>ajar budak</malay> primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya nak</malay> like I said
<malay>nak buka</malay> business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
<malay>kalau tak</malay> another option would be like <malay>macam</malay> work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay>
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
<malay>dekat sini</malay>
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
<malay>bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang</malay>
normal <malay>macam demam macam</malay> the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
<malay>tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you know un~ unexpected
so like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
<malay>mahal sangat</malay>
so let's
(err) <malay>bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit</malay>
then <malay>memang orang itu dah</malay> stress because of the illness
ya so <malay>kalau dia tak ada duit</malay>
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
I wish [lah] if <malay>orang yang macam</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat</malay>
so they get I think government <malay>ada juga</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi</malay> I wish they
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you mean the outpatient
ya
ya <malay>itu</malay> maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
<malay>tapi yang macam</malay> chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
<malay>lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>nanti kena</malay>
master
[oh] okay
<malay>itu satu</malay> (err) swimming <malay>sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar</malay> swimming
<malay>berenang</malay>
(err) is with a private coach
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat itu</malay>
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya <malay>sebab</malay> (err) coach <malay>itu boleh datang</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ</malay>
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coa~ coach is quite hands on [lah]
I mean (uh) last time <malay>saya pernah ada juga pergi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dua tahun sebe~ selepas</malay>
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
<malay>tapi</malay> coach <malay>itu walaupun</malay> <malay>dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh</malay> lessons
<malay>tapi</malay> the coach is like (uh) not hands on he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven <malay>tapi</malay> each lesson <malay>itu</malay>
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
<malay>ada dia punya itu</malay> [lah] result
so (um) <malay>berenang itu</malay>
(uh) so I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
<malay>lagi satu itu saya</malay>
because <malay>sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima</malay>
so <malay>sekarang</malay>
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do ac~ I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
your you know like <malay>macam</malay>
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active S_G
<malay>ada</malay> pilates

ya
active S_G <malay>itu saya kena</malay> check <malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> the same kind of pilates

very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of <malay>minyak sapi</malay>
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all <malay>minyak sapi</malay> or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small rice
okay you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion sh~ you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy

[oh] right ya I invite I mean in the first place also you never watch
so I did not invite you
right
no [lah] yo~
you still hype <malay>dia masih ada</malay> serious because right now (um) the movie just came out <malay>abeh macam</malay>
all of us (uh) <malay>kita pergi tengok</malay> movie <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
there are some of our friends also <malay>dorang masih belum tengok</malay>
but they still do watch the anime [ah]
and also <malay>tak salah aku</malay> the season two <malay>pun belum keluar kalau kau belum</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau baru nak</malay> start the hype you still [ah] don't have to wait so long for the season two
but
but don't I don't know I feel like you should wait for season two come out <malay>sebab tadi aku baru dapat tahu</malay> season two possibly <malay>dorang akan keluar</malay> like
(err) cause season one it came out like april twenty nineteen
(uh) september twenty nineteen
ya Netflix it came out [ah] slow but it came out right april <malay>tak salah</malay> april twenty that's when the hype <malay>betul-betul naik</malay> [ah] [sia] and <malay>apa</malay> everytime
like (uh) there's some <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] I read cause I think it release per episode or maybe the whole thing at once but because of that [ah] the popularity really skyrocketed man and also (err) <malay>dia nya</malay> #manga# because normally #mangas# like <malay>macam</malay> for example you know the big three of anime the one piece bleach (uh) #naruto#
<malay>dorang punya</malay> like the amount of copies that they [kan]
is more than hundred million copies
and they took
<malay>berapa lama</malay> [eh] <malay>tak salah aku</malay> one piece is nineteen ninety seven out like okay [lah] this is just a rough gauge all of them [ah] took like at least ten years plus to reach at least hundred million copies
<malay>untuk</malay> demon slayer for the #manga# <malay>aje</malay> [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> !wah! it's only four years [ah]
<malay>dah</malay> hundred and twenty million <malay>dah</malay>
[orh] ya
exactly
[oh]
[ah]
[oh]
[ah] at the sorry [ah] at the mountain right
[oh] ya
!wah!
so
does that mean [ah] in the future will be a demand also
with drums [ah] [ah] <malay>tapi pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] japanese [kan] <malay>kita melayu kita kompang</malay>
<malay>masuk rumah kau selamat hari raya</malay> [eh] <malay>asal bilik-bilik semua tukar-tukar</malay> [eh]
[oh] ya
[orh] ya that [one] is a lumen six
and
the fact that there is only lumen six [eh] !wah! he's really strong
ya
such coward
!wah!
O_P man
even
even though he doesn't speak much but
ya the like what they say [ah] <malay>apa</malay> ac~ actions speak louder than words
that is exactly how <malay>apa</malay> #gui# is [ah] as a person
but
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dia nya</malay> other than the anime
(um) <malay>apa</malay> soundtrack <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
it really blews me away [ah] blows me away sorry
because one thing about (uh) anything in general [ah] <malay>kalau kau tengok</malay> a show or something [kan]
it is more emotional <malay>kalau dia nya</malay> soundtrack is a very <malay>macam</malay> it's a good soundtrack it can relate to you like how demon slayer <malay>sekarang</malay> the one thing people can relate to at first is the song
the by sung by lisa <malay>yang</malay> the opening
[ah] opening [ah]
(mm)
(mm) ya
ya
it's like (err) one thing good about anime is like there's no
[ah] pure evil or pure good cause normally those pure evil inside the anime turns out that
they were corrupted in the first place because of c~ certain events in their life
and <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
like those people like they've seen too much hatred until it becomes something that they're used to
that it becomes like everyday object everyday [ah] actions are <malay>sampai</malay> they don't know [ah] they can't determine what is right or wrong anymore but !wah! it's
mind blowing [ah] legit
ya
ya
ya
(um)
(mm) ya
(uh) one piece
ya
[oh] ya
not too much
it's (uh) it's not like those dramas like one episode is like one hour
[orh] ya
ya it has been I mean I don't know if it's the usual but
for all the #animes# [ah] I watch <malay>semua ikut yang</malay> this <malay>dua puluh minit tapi ada yang</malay>
<malay>macam aku rasa</malay> like one shot there's this thing called one shot #animes# <malay>dorang</malay> usually <malay>macam</malay> forty plus minutes <malay>abeh dah tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>dia macam</malay> a short film [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay> but it the som~ sometimes like
<malay>orang fikir</malay> like [oh] the longer the anime is the better it will be but some people might not know actually the quality of how you
tell a story in a in a film is what matters [ah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> even like those thirty or ten minute films [kan] it leaves a very
(uh) everlasting mark in your memory <malay>macam tak boleh lupakan</malay> it's that good [ah] like the story storytelling even (uh) the soundtrack cause come on man [ah] without soundtrack anything will be boring [lah]
exactly cause that's why I always [ah]
I always en~ envy those people who can like make great soundtracks for [ah] films or anime to make it bring to life especially with all the great animation or like the great actors in shows or something but I know it will take a while for me to get up to that standard the level
[ah] ya
[ah] ya
ya correct
no no no
if it's bachelor of science I think I'll fail a lot of modules already
[oh] ya man
luckily that is like
one prerequisite of maths I have to take [oh] wait no other than that got physics [lah] but that's all [lah] physics should be simpler because this [one]
its pre-calculus [sia] what the heck is that it's like A maths which I never learn before in secondary school
ya
[oh] is it the
the position vector [eh]
!wow!
it's okay man it's okay <malay>aku nya</malay> A math <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>bila entah</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> there's this kind of stigma [ah] whenever you go to school or like university [ah] in that case
you will understand that there are many more things that you don't know
so whenever you go to university you have that curtai~ certain feeling that <malay>macam kau rasa bodoh</malay>
[ah] I shared this with my one of my friends [ah] <malay>dia pun tengah ambil</malay> university but I think is like N_U_S I think ya so ya [ah] bro that [one] is just that's just one person [lah] don't let it bring bad image to the school man
ya so (err) ya that's why exactly but okay [lah] the one thing that we can generalise is like whenever you go to university you feel stupid at first you might feel stupid afterwards but the process makes you feel less stupid
especially when you (err) encounter like many problem solving [ah] methods or like
especially <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> coding <malay>atau</malay> math [kan] there's definitely
tend to be like some parts where <malay>macam</malay> [oh] wait what's going on I don't understand [sia] and then you have to seek for help from other people it's not the same as like poly <malay>atau</malay> secondary school [tau]
independent
yes exactly ya
it's quite hard
it's quite hard for me [ah] because one thing (um)
I'm a I'm an introvert so I don't really mingle much with (um) other people or like
(uh) actively seek out for help or talk to other people so it's kind of hard on my case it really force me to you know step out of my comfort zone talk to other people and
I don't know why maybe it's because my ego like
I know I have to try it out first to [ah] do it whether I don't know or know then after that seek for help because sometimes I feel like
like (mm) I don't want to tell people that I cannot do this
that mindset is the one that holds me back a lot everytime want to seek for help
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
<malay>sebab mak aku</malay> english teacher
(uh) ya
(mm)
that sounds
crystallisation thinking [eh]
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
ya and also <malay>macam</malay> being an introvert you have this certain set of skill it's called (err) from what I learn in psychology like different people have different
(uh) soft skills that they're born with
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's this thing called intrapersonal skill that's it that is !huh!
ya
ya there's interpersonal skill and intrapersonal skill intrapersonal if I'm not wrong is skill [lah] but the term for intrapersonal is like you observe
(uh) your surroundings like you can read the feelings of the room like the people around you and you understand that the mood [lah] in a way
ya
it's for interpersonal it's slightly different this more to like you think of your own (uh) thoughts you try to make sure you're careful on what you say because you [ah] in a way it's like you think a lot about what you want to say or like in your own thoughts your thought process everything
(uh) you just you don't want to bring up the (uh) negative (uh) vibe when you speak up
so this the intre~ intrapersonal skill is for people whom I guess are introverts [lah] so they tend to be more aware of other people like
how to say it might be a different way of saying like you judge people
but you are more conserved
you are more conservative
[ah] ya
(mm) ya
<malay>macam apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dia ni</malay> like <malay>asal</malay> [ah] <malay>kecil hati</malay> exactly and like some people might not know like whatever they do right if people don't give them feedback like [eh] don't be so abrupt don't be so <malay>macam</malay> rude [ah] <malay>kalau dorang tak ada orang cakap gini</malay> [kan] the person who speak all those abrupt words or <malay>macam kasar</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak akan rasa apa-apa dia fikir macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] normal [lah] <malay>takde orang cakap apa-apa [pe]</malay> so I'll just continue with what I'm doing [ah]
(mm)
[ah] ya ya ya
(mm)
ya and in okay [ah] in university especially
adapting and also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] wh~ what's that word again (uh) you have to manage your time ya time management is the utmost priority in a university life
okay
cannot
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
drop
(mm)
ya
[orh]
[oh] !wow!
!wow!
it's (uh) it's the same thing for my school also cause (err) if I'm not wrong [ah] is (err) when you said academic warning right ya at that time also I think it is certain in all university [lah] if you never meet their G_P_A requirement after like every semester or something
but (uh) if I'm not wrong for my case cause yours is part time and I'm full time (um) if you are if you have a academic warning already
<malay>abeh kalau</malay> your G_P_A
<malay>dah macam</malay>
lesser than two point eight
then <malay>kau akan dapat</malay> suspension
suspension meaning
<malay>satu tahun kau</malay>
[ah] <malay>kau</malay> [ah] [eh] sorry
after one year then <malay>kau kena</malay> re-enroll
ya
(um) when you are in a academic warning <malay>punya ni</malay> [ah] ya
if you haven't get a~ academic warning then <malay>asalkan</malay> your G_P_A is not lesser than two point O or maybe one point eight then you're still save [lah]
[ah] ya better
if not in the future you must study harder and much harder just to get that G_P_A to increase by a bit
ya
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
some
ya some still have exams like math we still have exam [ah]
but your course don't have math right
subject verb agreement
[oh] [eh]
!wah!
[orh] okay I mea~
<malay>ada</malay> is that <malay>macam kau nya</malay> topic <malay>bukan</malay> topic <malay>apa</malay> module is that module <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kau nak kena belajar pasal</malay> another language
like <malay>macam</malay> malay <malay>atau</malay> mandarin
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[orh] is it the same as <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau nak berbual melayu</malay>
<malay>ada benda kita nak kena</malay> reverse the structure of a e~ of a word
!huh!
[oh]
ya
<malay>macam nak cakap</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> english post office <malay>abeh melayu pejabat</malay> post <malay>dia macam</malay> reverse [ah] it's in that way [ah] like <malay>buat orang macam</malay> confusing
but is it mean the same thing
prof [oh] professor
french
[orh] is it
<malay>pejabat</malay> post
ah~
geo~
[oh] like <malay>apa</malay> dialects [ah] slang
(mm)
[oh] I
[ah]
(mm)
a~ (um) is the same for certain schools also like my
my course also I mean initially it's called bachelor of arts in (uh) game design right but I think the first the freshman batch this year
it is (uh) user experience in game design so what I get from that
is actually what you have been experience [ah] since primary school secondary school like right now
the syllabus is ever changing
so that's why there are certain things that we have to keep up to date
because of that they also update the name of the course to fit in with all the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>baru-baru punya</malay> module <malay>yang apa nak kena ajar</malay> like <malay>aku rasa</malay> for example like
(uh) in the market I guess one thing <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam banyak-banyak tukar</malay> is the job finding
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say (err) user experience [kan]
normally <malay>macam tak banyak kerja pasal</malay> user experience [mah] because it's not that known to be (uh) to be like a proper job <malay>orang fikir macam</malay> !alah! <malay>ni orang lain buat boleh buat</malay> [pe] <malay>macam</malay> it's another job
on top of the job that <malay>orang tengah buat</malay> but now it's a good thing that they realise user experience is the most important thing in anything in games in apps in like even in everyday object <malay>macam kau pegang cawan</malay>
the user experience is for you to hold the cup right <malay>abeh kau imagine kalau</malay> they handle <malay>ada duri</malay> <malay>tak</malay> comfortable and that's the user experience it's a ergonomics (err) e~ the design of the cup that makes your experience in holding the cup
even though <malay>macam</malay> it sounds so simple but it actually helps to make it feel good
<malay>macam kau tengah</malay> bad mood <malay>abeh kau pegang cawan abeh duri kau tak rasa</malay>
[ah] [kan] so in a way all these little things help to improve your mood even by a slight chance that it may increase your mood but overall is all this (uh) tiny things that actually make us feel better like what they say (um) enjoyed the little hap~ happiness in life
because if you [ah] if you just enjoyed something that is so hard to achieve
like (err) happiness like for example <malay>kau nak dapat macam aku nak kerja</malay>
<malay>dekat tempat kerja ni yang gaji dia bagi tujuh ribu abeh kau sekarang tengah kerja kat tempat kerja ni yang bagi kau seribu lapan ratus</malay>
<malay>abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] how am I gonna ge~ get to that level so <malay>kau</malay> (uh) <malay>bertungkus-lumus kau</malay> (uh) <malay>cari-cari kerja banyak</malay> and that process <malay>buat kau</malay> bad mood
but you never enjoyed the little happiness in life
[ah]
ya
[ah]
it all comes down to your mindset in what you think brings you happiness [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
some people <malay>dorang dah</malay> so into earning money
that their greed in~ is imposed onto them to make more money <malay>walaupun dorang banyak duit tapi dorang masih nak lebih</malay>
ya they are tuned to that mind mindset <malay>macam</malay> [oh] since I have this mu~ much money and it gives me a lot of happiness because it can allow me to buy the things that I have wanted since I was a kid
that means if I have more money that will buy me more things that can make me happy but in the end it's actually brainwashing them that those things are not what they need
to make them happy
it's just something that they feel like they lust for it just because
it (uh)
they imagine them like [eh] with this
I'll look good [ah] like [ah] with a car like Porsche ya you are satisfied but for how long
(mm)
ya
exactly
but I guess (um)
there's no certain way of like finding happiness like some people because of the happiness that they are trying to achieve that is so far away it allows them to
push boundaries like for example
(um) elon musk [eh] he's a good example because one thing his happiness or his like the end goal for him
is to be buried on mars and that to him is like his true happiness but the process of going there is so extensively or it's so excruciating and
you have to
you have to be like one of the top most like the better humans on earth to actually go beyond what humans can an~ [ah] achieve
like <malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] like he said in two years [eh]
four years time like humans will be flying to mars like who
[ah] if you tell me ya if you tell me this when I was (err) I okay [lah] when I was kid you tell me this I'll be damn happy [lah] of course but for people with you know they lived through like
generations of like
[ah] their life like twenty thirty years they have to like go through
especially in our previous generation I think it's like our gen Y
ya
[oh] [ah] sorry millennial so the millennials
our usual mindset is like work hard
play hard then if you work hard definitely yo~ all the
<malay>cam rezeki akan di diberikan</malay> like don't focus always on the <malay>rezeki</malay> focus on like
what make things work in the last time [ah] <malay>macam</malay> retrospect [ah] but for now it's more like
(uh) we focus on little happiness but also
the there's always a yin and yang if you focus on little happiness you can't always get big bigger things
but for those people who focus on the big happiness they might not appreciate the little things
I guess that's how human works
which is why I appreciate like all those people <malay>yang</malay> even though it's just [ah] comic books or like anime [kan] it brings certain joy to you like you feel
like even though this does not improve humanity in a large way but it does give you some things to actually look forward to [lah]
[ah] [ah] ya roller coaster
(mm) ya y~ you have to take a break [ah]
that's why I feel
[ah] for this anime <malay>macam</malay> all these [one]
(uh)
even though it doesn't give much but actually it also in their own sense they are also improving
like they impose many real life things into their anime to make it to make you feel more relevant to it
that's why like [ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] ya <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer like the like what you said the experience then it's the user experience [lah] the soundtrack visual effects graphics and the characters storyline all that takes into account of the whole topic of user experience
which is why I also like how (um) okay [lah] not demon slayer something much more loar~ large scale which is Marvel
!wow!
Marvel is (uh) huge scale of
all the things that you [ah]
you imagine it to happen
it's happening in that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] alternate universe [lah] in a way [ah] that~ ya M_C_U Marvel cinematic universe
so what I like about Marvel is <malay>dorang</malay> they <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dorang suka letak macam orang-orang biasa dalam</malay> the movie <malay>walaupun</malay> that movie <malay>ada banyak orang macam</malay> superpower [kan] <malay>tapi dorang buatkan</malay> character <malay>tu macam</malay> he goes through everyday life as per normal but (uh) they somehow <malay>macam</malay> in a turn of events they stumble upon something which ma~ made them into a superhero of some sort even though <malay>ada orang dorang tak ada</malay> super~ [ah] superpower <malay>tapi</malay> a certain grudge or a certain bond towards something <malay>yang buatkan kau macam</malay> strongly
you feel strongly towards that thing
and then it somehow made you into a so called superhero [ah] but with no actual superpower
(uh huh) game of thrones [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
[orh] ya
cool
[orh]
[ah]
(mm)
ya
the black widow and iron man started
(mm)
[oh] ya
gauntlet
ya
(um) assassin
ya
ya it comes down with
the stronger your drive to work toward something the more things you can achieve and sometimes also like the things you achieve right you might not even notice that it's a huge achievement until people
tell you about it like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam orang gemuk</malay> like they want to achieve being slim like have that f~ [ah] that the beach body
and because of that people like the process is long but people who rarely meet you when they meet you after like a few months something like that then they will say like [eh] <malay>dah kurus</malay> [eh] [sia] <malay>baik [pe]</malay> but actually <malay>kau tak tahu</malay> like th~ the process itself <malay>buatkan kau nak</malay> slim <malay>kau belum habis tapi pasal orang cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau dah kurus</malay> [kan]
you'll feel good [lah]
ya it motivates you even though it's not the like you haven't reach your optimal (uh) weight your optimal image <malay>tapi</malay> the
the thought of people <malay>macam dorang perasan</malay> like <malay>kau tengah berubah</malay> a~ a~ at least <malay>macam</malay> you looking more slim or looking more [ah] toned your body looks so toned then <malay>kau</malay> you'll feel better and it helps to
make your drive even
(uh)
higher
<malay>tapi</malay> i~ it's I guess this little happiness <malay>macam kalau nak</malay> go back to what I said earlier like the little happiness <malay>buat kau macam</malay> maintain your course cause <malay>ada orang</malay> let's say <malay>pasal yang</malay> language [one] <malay>aku pun tengah</malay> another language is called C sharp programming language
so that [one] (err) I'm not a tech savvy kind of person not saying tech savvy it's like I'm not a person who is
(uh) good in you know programming in that case but because of this course
I have to force myself to learn because that's part of the like requirements [ah] but in that case also like if you were to think about it [ah]
for this different generations like <malay>sejak</malay> okay [ah] this past few hundred years [ah] there has been certain developments in (uh) certain parts of (uh) humanity like last time there's (uh) ag~ agriculture industrial evolution [kan] then there's (uh)
now [eh] ya industrial revolution is what we went through first or is it second then now is a digital evolution
so this digital evolution it requires you to have some I_T knowledge so I thought okay [lah] maybe
I learned this programming it might be useful or it might be very useful for me in the future if <malay>aku tengah cari kerja ke atau kalau macam</malay>
<malay>aku nak</malay> keep up to date to certain things <malay>jadi macam</malay> I'm not
(uh) losing in the race for finding jobs <malay>atau</malay> (uh) skill sets so
<malay>aku</malay> push myself [ah] I push myself to learn the programming but sometimes <malay>kalau kau buat benda sorang</malay> like what I said being an introvert is not a good thing if you want to seek for help
so I
ya and also because you know that if you reach out to people you know it's gonna make [ah] it's gonna help you to actually learn the language because some people they know better than you so that process is the one that is the most
(uh) it's hard [ah] is the most hardest thing for me
[orh]
I always I try push myself with that mindset because I keep on hearing like
a lot of peop~ there are more people that are saying like [ah] if I was younger I would have taken a programming course if I would've known that this will be very re~ relevant like ten years time or like now so
with that in mind it makes me motivated at least to maintain my course I there lot of times that I feel like dropping out but because of certain people like they helped to push you through
like together cause you know they are also going through the same thing they might not be [ah] okay they might be savvy in programming but they are also not good in certain areas where you can help you know it's like a
I help you help me kind of situations but for those case sometimes people
[ah] [ah] too intro~ introvert that they wan~ they don't want to show their weaknesses [lah] there are certain people in my course who are like that but I don't want to say any names but of course
(mm) can say [lah]
ya
especially if you okay [lah] probably <malay>yang buatkan kau malu</malay> is <malay>kalau macam kau buat abeh kau rasa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>ni aku takyah tanya orang kau aku</malay> assume that <malay>walaupun susah</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> I can just Google <malay>apa</malay> Google is there for me to help <malay>boleh</malay> search <malay>senang-senang takyah kacau orang yang nak buat kerja dorang sendiri</malay>
but in
in that case that process is harder cause you are not
(uh) the amid the Google search <malay>yang kau buat</malay>
it won't give you the exact results
cause the one that they show at Google and the one that you are doing it's not the same
so you'd have to nit pick some things properly for it to work <malay>kalau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau ikut</malay> [jer] it will definitely not work
ya which is hard for a person like me who does not
know programming that much
cause since okay [lah] becaus~ before
uni [ah] you and me we went through that same course in poly it's ya it's all in about design art th~ the aesthetics make it nice but go uni suddenly like (uh) you learn programming all this and that it's useful because [ah] we really learned through learn about design and all that so you have programming
in a way you can make your own game
but
(uh) how good is a game and like what I said the user experience must be
(uh) good ya must be in tip top condition cause if not right then you're just wasting your time just made the game but
[ah] exactly you're making a game for yourself but not for the people that's the one
(uh) biggest mistake that everyone who goes through this course or like everyone who makes a game
would not want to do because making a game especially if you want to sell the game you have to have a target audience and that target audience is what you have to make your game to work towards to
like if they are not happy with the game like your target audience <malay>macam budak-budak lima tahun sepuluh tahun</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam</malay> G_T_A five <malay>dorang main ke</malay> I mean
for educational purpose
ya like okay <malay>kalau aku</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> aim for
<malay>apa budak-budak yang dorang tak tahu belajar</malay> like <malay>tiga tahun empat tahun</malay> [ah] not not <malay>tak tahu belajar</malay> I mean <malay>tak tahu buat</malay> math like <malay>aku bagi dorang</malay> game <malay>pasal</malay> math <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nya macam</malay> quizzes <malay>aku bagi</malay> chemistry
<malay>lari</malay> [kan] that's why (err) that target audience is the most important thing when <malay>kau buat</malay> game <malay>macam untuk kau</malay> [eh] best [sia] game <malay>ni ada</malay> chemistry <malay>tapi kau tak tahu</malay> actually your audience is <malay>yang orang yang nak belajar pasal</malay> math
[oh] but okay [lah] cone
like iron man okay <malay>ni betul-betul</malay> (uh) off track
[ah] iron~ ironman like even though he's a millionaire but he's damn smart [lah] like he might be one of the inspiration where <malay>aku</malay> will continue programming because
in a way like M_C_U the universe even though is an alternate universe but it's an extreme point for people who pushed themselves like that is a
possible
scenario <malay>kalau orang betul-betul</malay> don't have that drive to make suits to make all these right there is a possible future that we can aim for so <malay>aku rasa</malay> like programming is a
it's a good it's a
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
ya in~ ingredient for humanity to take a step forward
[ah] ya same goes for elon musk actually elon musk is like the tony stark of our earth [sia]
that's why <malay>aku</malay> really appreciate what elon musk has been doing now
that's why I also like Marvel and elon musk besides so hopefully we can go to mars in
at least twenty years [lah] give or take
in
[oh]
ya
strap [eh]
[orh] [oh] ya
probably they
I mean they will have a controlled environment <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dia nya apa tu</malay>
<malay>apa tu</malay> [ah] <malay>udara dia macam ada dekat dalam</malay> this sphere <malay>abeh kalau ada ikut macam</malay> earth <malay>punya udara</malay> in~ inside that sphere <malay>aku rasa</malay> everything should be fine <malay>kalau orang kena tanam ke apa</malay> there might be a proper grave for them <malay>cuma</malay>
it's weird [lah] it's weird [ah] cause <malay>tak pernah dengar orang</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>mana kubur kau bukan kau</malay> [ah] <malay>mana kubur apa nenek kau ke apa</malay> [oh] <malay>dekat</malay> mars [ah] <malay>aku nak merawat</malay>
<malay>naik</malay> spaceship but that is a possible future also like <malay>kalau</malay> let's say when elon musk <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) human will be interplan~ planetary existence in the universe so imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you have your own spaceship <malay>macam kereta sekarang</malay> but <malay>kau nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak pergi</malay> [ah] moon <malay>jap kau nak makan</malay> [ah] moon burger [eh] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kita gi makan sekarang</malay> K <malay>jap aku ambil</malay> spaceship <malay>aku</malay>
ya <malay>abeh kau</malay> [ah] fly [ah] okay [ah] <malay>ni</malay> set [ah] G_P_S to moon then <malay>dia nya</malay> spaceship <malay>kau cakap</malay> okay (uh) ten minutes ride okay
<malay>abeh kadang-kadang pasal ni sekarang</malay> Grab [pe] so <malay>kau</malay> call (uh) space Grab
[eh] [eh] best [sia]
[oh] man I don't know I don't know but it's not I think it's not light years
because I one light year if I'm not wrong is more than a thousand
no I don't know
ya
exactly
probably with that technology we might not be alive [ah] to experience it
unless <malay>bila</malay> mars <malay>dah ada</malay> a way to like
persevere humanity to maintain young
[orh]
[ah] ya mine but then would it
actually be good
cause maybe some people
[oh]
[a'ah] ak~ #akaza#
a demon
[orh]
[oh] ya mayb~
maybe the thought of that like <malay>macam aku tahu aku tak mati</malay> so <malay>buat apa aku buat kerja ni semua</malay> you become complacent
then <malay>kau</malay> complacent then there's no progress in life [lah] <malay>macam semua dah</malay> convenient <malay>untuk kau [pe]</malay> or <malay>aku boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>aku boleh tengok</malay> anime <malay>hari-hari aku tahu aku takkan mati</malay> [pe] so <malay>takyah belajar</malay> [ah] <malay>takyah belajar apa takyah mandi</malay> cause whatever it is even though I am smelly or even though how much I don't brush my teeth
I will still stay young [what] I won't get sick right
so that complacency probably is what
makes humanity not to deserve to have a (um) <malay>apa</malay> eternal life
[ah]
[ah] upper moon
ya
same
(mm)
ya I guess that's the true meaning of like the beauty behind
not being able to live a~ [ah] eternally or forever
because of complacency and also like
ya like what you said you'll feel stagnant so there's no progress which is why humans they keep on trying they know their life here is limited so they try their best as much as possible before they go off
like what they said (um)
wo~ the things that you do the actions that you do
they are the ones that people will remember off when you die
but not the things like <malay>macam sekarang kau masih hidup abeh kau buat benda macam bagus macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni bagus</malay> [sia] okay <malay>dah tu</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> for example <malay>kalau</malay> michael jackson
<malay>dia buat lagu semua macam</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia tak mati</malay> it's still there [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> he died at the time when he's still popular
so that makes his popularity increase because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] a legend it has it is a legend because
(err) people who die I don't know [ah] this is like a way of people saying like it's a legend its when people die [lah] normally
ya
that's humans [lah] in a way [ah] that it's a beauty [ah] like when you die i~ you leave a mark on human history so much that you become a figure
in the afterlife
not saying in the afterlife like don't know [lah] but
even if you die you're you're you'll still remain in people's memory
[ah] set the bar
ya
so imagine if like [ah] the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] wrestling or any person in interest [lah] like [oh]
aha undertaker
even if he like die one day then he will
be considered a proper legend already [lah] even now he's a legend but the legend to me does not have any (uh)
impact yet
the same goes for <malay>ni</malay> [ah] the football legend
ya #maradona#
previously he did a lot of things that people don't really like
but when he die like a few (uh) weeks ago then suddenly like people respect him so much they bring about all the successes that he did but they don't think they don't talk much about his bad stuff
so what does that tell you
ya
[ah]
passing
[ah] ya
it's like it heightens your
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ada buat aku susah</malay> but
[ah] I guess you can say that
I guess that is can be applied for all the people who
does anime like demon slayer if the person really dies in the future then he'll definitely be remembered
for doing demon slayer
exactly bro four years imagine four years he does he (uh) that person does all this success and it's like right now the highest grossing anime film [eh] or highest grossing film in japan history like right now
which is why I love demon slayer
[ah]
exactly
which is why I like anime
ya so okay [lah] <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> time [ah] <malay>ni tak banyak</malay> time sorry
stop [lah] am I at taiwan at times already [ah] okay [lah] hello [ah] actually [ah] K bye
