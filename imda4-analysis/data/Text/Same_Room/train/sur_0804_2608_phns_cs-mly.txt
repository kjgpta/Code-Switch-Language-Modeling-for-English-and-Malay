I mean like fan fiction I know but I didn't know that I didn't know like kind of like the purpose of it is like for the after
<malay>pernah pernah</malay>
I guess yang the old [ah]
actually now that I think about it <malay>aku rasa aku tak tengok dia punya</malay> spiderman tom holland I just saw you know like <malay>macam</malay> all the the marvel the big big shows like the what is it called captain america [eh] not captain america ya civil the civil wars the last [one] endgame so I only like I only like <malay>apa</malay> saw that big big one are the main main shows [lah] I don't really watch the specific (um) only
ya like you know got the batman [lah] all that different different [one] right so I don't really watch <malay>yang macam tu</malay>
!wah! but [eh] but you know because of COVID also right <malay>aku</malay> this year <malay>aku</malay> binge watch <malay>banyak gila</malay> korean drama
okay <malay>jap aku okay first aku tengok</malay> doctor romantic doctor romantic one
it's a good it's really a good show it's like doctor romantic [kan] so it's like <malay>macam</malay> (um) is obviously there's but but obviously korean drama obviously <malay>ada</malay> that love scene and stuff right cause it's between two people right but then (um) I wouldn't really say so I feel it's okay though
korean drama in general I think it's quite ok~ I mean for the ones that I have seen I think <malay>kirakan</malay> about the love scene the love story all that is quite okay [ah] ya to me [ah] so I watched the doctor romantic first [lah] <malay>yang</malay> first <malay>tu</malay> so it was that that show is about <malay>apa banyak</malay> doctor doctor <malay>punya</malay> scene [ah] so it's like <malay>banyak</malay> so <malay>jadi punya tempat punya</malay> scene !wah! you know at first I was like when I first thought about that show was like [eh] can I actually watch because if I'm not wrong I used to be a bit disgusted by like surgery <malay>punya punya apa nama dia</malay> what do you call it (uh) surgery <malay>punya</malay>
ya the videos and scene
it's it's it's really they they they really take a video of you like cutting the cutting the
it's very cool I tell you [ah] you know when I watching I was like bro this is
grey's [oh] grey's atano~ (uh) (uh) anatomy is it is is it like
#weh# maybe I should maybe I should watch that because I really love doctor romantic
so doctor doct~
[ah] I see I see
k
ya I don't I don't know [ah] K drama I feel right
right you know even the cinematography the sound the the music
I'm just I'm just like bro I really love K drama <malay>punya</malay> they are so tip top bro
everything
everything everything in K drama is tip top I really love it
it's jut so even though is like just hoodie and like
I guess because when you see the like the actress and actors <malay>pakai</malay> [oh] my god <malay>cantik</malay>
[kan]
just pleasing to the eyes [lah]
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can buy the same clothes and like everything can be the same [tau] like as in like but it's just that why can't it why <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>macam tak sama</malay> [tau] <malay>aku aku pun macam</malay>
[ah] ya
[oh] true true true true true
[kan] [oh] my god but hotel #del luna# though [oh] shit
you know I was like okay so is that a is there something gonna pop out like cause they say (uh) the last is it is it it called a cameo right
ya so I was like shit okay so <malay>dia cakap ada</malay> hotel bloom I'm like <malay>sabar</malay> am I am I suppose to wait for it <malay>macam</malay> happen like
ya
that will be so cool [sia] I mean I thought what's the point of cameo right you know usually cameo is like to have another season I'm like [oh] my god
[oh] no
I don't watch I don't watch
so <malay>dia macam tak ada tak ada</malay>
[ah] I see
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> [kan] <malay>aku ada buat aku tengok</malay> doctor romantic two <malay>dia ada dua dua</malay>
[ah]
I mean maybe not so because <malay>kadang-kadang orang nak</malay> [kan] people want more so like they will keep requesting right
I want to request but I tell you korean drama [eh] <malay>dia banyak</malay> international fans [tau]
<malay>banyak gila</malay> international fans
[eh] even <malay>suria dorang tunjuk</malay> [tau] <malay>aku macam</malay>
ya ya you know <malay>cerita</malay> (um) my I_D is #gangnam# beauty
[eh] #park seo joon# [eh] bro my I_D is #gangnam# beauty <malay>yang</malay>
#cha eun woo# #cha eun woo# ya
(uh) [ah] yes ya sure it's that
ya but it's that <malay>apa</malay> ce~ <malay>cerita pun dekat suria</malay> then I was like <malay>sabar</malay>
(uh) no no no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] [oh] my god that [one]
(uh) I think so
[oh]
<malay>itu itu cerita-cerita macam gitu aku tak suka</malay> but I think I remember <malay>dulu bila</malay> back then also <malay>selalu tengok</malay> because <malay>selalu bila kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] <malay>mana kita ada macam sekarang ada ada</malay> box [kan] you know the android box that kind of thing
the [one] that can like watch all the channels and all the different [one]
ya ya you can watch movie use that also so it's like
<malay>dulu mana ada benda tu semua</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam</malay>
ya so there's always a singapore <malay>nya</malay> channel so <malay>dah tengok</malay> singapore <malay>nya</malay> channel <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> T_V like <malay>main tekan-tekan dengan dia punya</malay> button <malay>tu semua</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita tengok</malay> [ah] like some of it <malay>macam</malay> all the <malay>apa nama dia</malay> channel one is it <malay>yang</malay> all that dub basically that thing [lah]
ya you know I was you know I was looking at it I think I remember [ah] when I first like came upon on that that <malay>apa</malay> T_V channel [lah] <malay>aku macam apa benda</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
it's it's just not pleasing to the ears ya it's it's like it's not synchronise same to your~ like you look you look but you hear you different
I think ya [oh] my god okay even <malay>aku rasa</malay> even <malay>kalau dorang kalau</malay> #park seo joon# <malay>cakap dalam bahasa melayu aku pun tak suka</malay>
!huh! but imagine he talking malay though
but ya I cannot [lah] watch that kind of show I just need the original <malay>punya</malay>
actually okay
[oh] ya
ya
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but honestly for me also [kan] <malay>kalau tengok</malay> (um) subtitle <malay>dengan</malay> drama at the same time <malay>macam kadang-kadang aku tak suka juga</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> you know you wanna
for real
okay I guess I I am I am like that to a certain extent
because okay honestly right okay I feel I'm (uh) is it called visual learner visual visual person I have to ya because <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>
<malay>aku dengar</malay> [jer] [kan]
[kan] <malay>sama sama</malay>
ya
ya exactly
but then but then you know sometimes <malay>kalau macam</malay> I mean not not (um) not korean drama also like like anything [ah] because I also want to see their facial expression their like the way they like <malay>macam</malay> make faces so is like <malay>macam</malay> if you keep looking at this subtitle then like and like and like like the drama then <malay>macam</malay> you skip some parts of the cute cute moment or like the funny funny moment so I'm like
what you mean I <malay>tak faham</malay>
[oh] no the the translation the translation is like very <malay>macam</malay> so formal right the word
big word
yo same [ah] same even in like maybe cause it's like netflix <malay>aku tengok</malay> malay drama but with the english subtitle I had to google the meaning even though I understand cause it's malay I have to google the word in english I'm like !whoa! what are saying translation <malay>ni apa dia cakap ni tak faham</malay> [seh]
[oh]
using that big big words
I think it's because of the translation [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> like <malay>kalau kalau apa</malay> malay drama pun <malay>kadang-kadang dorang guna</malay> all the <malay>peribahasa ke</malay> or like the
which are black colour okay singapore you talk sang her [ah] singapore ya
like <malay>kalau</malay> okay singapore <malay>nya tak sangat</malay> [ah] singapore <malay>nya</malay>
I've never watched a singapore malay drama
[oh] my god I love <malay>anak metropolitan</malay>
it's not it's not kids bro
not even teenagers it's it's like

youths okay ya so [oh] my god but I love that show though it's like so cool so <malay>gerek</malay>

ya but if I'm not wrong <malay>anak metropolitan</malay> actually <malay>ada dua dua</malay> season [kan] <malay>dua ke tiga</malay> season but the one <malay>yang dorang tunjuk kat</malay> youtube <malay>sebab</malay> if I'm not wrong <malay>sekarang</malay> youtube <malay>ada</malay> then me watch <malay>pun ada tapi aku tak tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] toggle [kan] I think toggle <malay>pun ada</malay> [ah] but like
who actually I don't know who uses me watch or toggle though honestly [ah] cause like <malay>kirakan dorang punya</malay> platform I don't think is that is that <malay>apa nama dia</malay> friendly is it

[ah] ya <malay>memang memang macam tu</malay> because that time <malay>aku kat</malay> malaysia then <malay>aku nak tengok</malay> viu [tau] then <malay>aku tak boleh tengok sebab</malay> I'm not in singapore

ya [lah] ya [lah] I mean that's why I was like wondering <malay>asal sampai</malay> science centre <malay>sebab</malay> from here but
(um) it's I guess it's (um)
ya ya ya but I wouldn't say it's behind [lah]
ya
ya to the side ya
so it's like ya #taman jurong# so I'm like <malay>dari situ</malay> then <malay>boleh jalan</malay> [pe] that's why I was like science centre <malay>asal</malay> [seh]
for real
(hmm)
(hmm)
(uh) ya
[ah]
gosh I hate myself
!wah!
<malay>aku sedih tengok kau</malay>
because there's two short cuts
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>semalam kau pergi datang rumah aku kau</malay> confident <malay>sangat tu blok aku aku macam mana kau</malay> [eh] <malay>kau cakap kau dah sampai</malay>
that's why bro what the hell
[oh] my god
how how dumb ass can you be [sia]
what bull bull ass is that I don't think that's a good reason though
I mean~
ya I mean <malay>kau dah berapa tahun kau dah berapa tahun</malay> [eh] <malay>kita semua dah berapa tahun</malay> obviously we have to be like independent
ya
ya
[oh] ya
!wah! you know I know had like that dream or like that thought of like <malay>macam</malay> okay so <malay>dah nak dekat kiamat</malay> [kan] so like why not I <malay>apa pergi apa nama dia orang cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak kiamat nanti kalau pergi kalau duduk dekat</malay> #madinah# <malay>ke</malay> #makkah# <malay>ke kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>jumpa dengan dajjal</malay> [kan] so I was like okay yes but then you know what I didn't know the thing about this when (uh) one thing <malay>yang aku tak tahu</malay> is that <malay>dorang cakap</malay> that <malay>apa nama dia</malay> even even <malay>orang yang duduk kat</malay> #makkah# <malay>dengan</malay> #madinah# (um)
no no no you <malay>dajjal</malay> can never go inside never never because it's really ya it's protected by all the <malay>apa malaikat</malay> [ah] so like <malay>macam</malay> but then the thing is within #makkah# and #madinah# there will be a a earthquake or there will be tsunami [tau]
in in the end of times [ah] so there will be so (uh) because of that tsunami or earthquake it will <malay>keluarkan orang-orang yang</malay>
<malay>beriman gitu</malay> [ah]
you wear this strong enough to you [ah] can react how which way because you can never picture yourself on that day itself [what]
[ah] that means because of the tsunami and earthquake that is inside #madinah# and #makkah#
no no they will they will stay in they will stay in <malay>itu</malay> so <malay>yang yang kirakan yang nak selamatkan diri</malay> they will <malay>keluar</malay>
so the
<malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dorang akan</malay> stay inside so that's why <malay>yang</malay> so that's why I was like thinking <malay>abeh kalau macam tu kalau</malay> in the end of times <malay>kalau aku pergi sana juga</malay> then what's the point though <malay>sebab</malay> because I own self don't know whether I am
the thing is in singapore <malay>kau mana ada</malay> experience tsunami or earthquake <malay>pun</malay> [kan]
ya you know you know that time <malay>aku pernah pergi</malay> japan <malay>dengan sekolah aku pergi sana</malay> for school trip [lah] [kan] so then <malay>lepas itu aku</malay>
[oh] <malay>itu pun</malay>
[ah] australia <malay>dorang apa</malay> #afini# (uh) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>tak bukan</malay> #atikah# #ella# <malay>dengan</malay> #alia# <malay>dorang pergi</malay> melbourne so <malay>aku pergi</malay> japan <malay>dengan</malay> #puteri# <malay>dengan</malay> #ifa# so <malay>aku pergi sana</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) [kan] you know japan always earthquake tsunami all that big big <malay>apa gitu</malay> [kan] so
so
ya so <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>yang aku pergi masa tu aku pergi</malay> #hiroshima# <malay>dengan aku pergi</malay> #osaka#
ya ya ya ya ya so exact obviously it's a school trip so obviously you have to learn about all the
yes history all that so <malay>dah pergi sana tu nak kena belajar pasal</malay> history [kan] so <malay>dah alang-alang belajar</malay> history <malay>kita nak kena belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> we went to this <malay>macam</malay> ambulance place [eh] not ambulance <malay>macam</malay> fire place <malay>gitu</malay> to like learn about <malay>macam</malay> ways to like save yourself from like <malay>apa</malay>
ya all that so the was this simulation when we did wait actually [ah] we did a earthquake <malay>punya</malay> simul~ simul~ simulation
bro <malay>kau tahu sebab dia ada</malay> stages [tau] <malay>bila</malay> that simulation [kan] <malay>aku pergi</malay> we all had to take turns going [ah] I try [ah] because they say when you go you have to like protect yourself [ah] just anything to protect yourself
so <malay>aku pergi sana aku macam</malay> so there's like different different (um)
<malay>apa</malay> ya
ya so it's like (uh) they all of us if I'm not wrong all of us they give us (uh) <malay>yang</malay> medium or towards the high a bit just to <malay>rasa rasa</malay> [kan]
not not even the worst bro because it's because I think that's
it's just the tip of the iceberg [ah] you think just a bit [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
it's not the worst [ah] it's not the level seven [ah] it's like level four or five <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia kasi kita</malay> try [kan] <malay>kau tahu aku dekat situ aku bergegar</malay> [siol] it's really it's really like <malay>bergegar</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> I can't even like
are you sure
I see I see I see
<malay>jap</malay> so <malay>kalau kita</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> okay so <malay>kalau kita tengah</malay> earthquake <malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>kita boleh masuk sini tak</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> as in like as in like it's not a good place right <malay>sebab benda ni</malay> [kan]
right so like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kat bawa</malay> [jer] [kan] but then <malay>jatuh juga</malay> so like
<malay>tak dorang cakap</malay> [kan] because <malay>kalau kau tak ada tempat untuk</malay> cover [kan]
[ah] <malay>kau kau guna</malay> anything to cover yourself just to like <malay>macam elakkan benda jatuh kat kau</malay>
ya ya ya so because <malay>kau punya</malay> head <malay>yang paling</malay> important [pe] <malay>dia yang dia yang</malay> control everything right
ya so that should be fine already so that's why [ah] <malay>macam apa nama dia</malay> (um) they just say make sure just protect your head with anything and everything that is hard or like <malay>macam</malay> wooden <malay>ke apa ke</malay> as long as you protect your head then it should be fine already
[oh] I know
ya [oh] my god that [one] <malay>sedih juga</malay> though <malay>kalau kau punya kalau kau punya kepala sakit tapi</malay> I mean okay <malay>tapi kau punya kaki dah</malay>
[ah] and like <malay>kalau dah penyek kau</malay> confirm <malay>nak kena</malay> amputate
[kan] but I mean
you know I was like thinking how can I be so lucky to be in this country in this religion in this like family
I'm like
what a what a blessing [sia] so much blessing in one time [tau]
ya
it wasn't a couple years back
but a few years
[ah] I see I see
pandemic
but
but it's not as bad as this [oh] that [one] was it before SARS or no
I think it's before SARS
[ah] <malay>itu itu lama gila</malay>
(mm)
[ah] it wasn't
[oh]
I know it was a big thing in singapore [ah] but it's just for what because we were
ya so that's why a bit scary [ah] <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
I think ya it it wasn't a pandemic [lah] but if I'm not wrong from what we heard is <malay>apa kirakan</malay> it was a sudden thing right that's why
I think they after awhile they handle it quite well [lah] like <malay>sekarang</malay>
[eh] is there I'm not sure though is there I mean I don't think so if I'm not wrong they say there isn't any
it looks a like flu [ah] like you know COVID is like a flu also
ya if I'm not wrong if I not mistaken
ya ya so
[kan] [kan]
[kan]
<malay>kesian dok</malay>
[kan]
but then again if you think about it the possibilities of you getting the virus in singapore what's the possibility though
singapore actually <malay>dapat</malay>
[kan]
it's good that <malay>kita kecil</malay> [ah] cause <malay>kalau kita kalau kita besar</malay> confirm <malay>tak boleh</malay> control [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
(hmm) <malay>lagi nasib baik kat</malay> singapore <malay>ada banyak</malay> quite a number of (uh) hospital [kan] and the hospital is like
ya then every region I think <malay>ada</malay> quite a number at least at least two [ah] ya then now cause <malay>sekarang</malay> they are all starting to built community hospital
ya
community hospital basically
if I'm not mistaken community hospital <malay>yang</malay> all the firstly is all the very minor minor <malay>punya</malay> sickness [ah] are like fever all that flu I mean just that small small thing [lah]
yes not for surgery kind of thing
ya it's also
ya ya
and it's also for people <malay>yang</malay> from the major hospital transfer to
yes yes yes
ya that's why
I mean #ng teng fong# <malay>ada</malay> community hospital
ya
that's why
ya
<malay>tak apa pun</malay>
ya so that's why so <malay>sekarang dorang dah buat</malay> community hospital <malay>kat sini</malay> so I guess if I'm not that time <malay>aku pergi</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> [eh] woodlands <malay>ke</malay> east side east side or north side <malay>aku pergi aku pun nampak</malay> they are like trying to built something then it looks like <malay>macam</malay> community hospital also <malay>dari luar</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab kadang-kadang kalau kau tengok</malay> renovation [kan] then <malay>nanti dorang akan kepung tempat tu</malay> [kan]
so like you can see like all the you know like <malay>kalau</malay> for houses I don't know if you know [ah] but for houses [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> they will show like pictures of houses ya houses
ya that kind of thing then <malay>kalau</malay> for hospital they would show hospital <malay>punya itu</malay> ya so <malay>macam</malay> from the outside we can
I kind of saw like <malay>macam</malay> that that thing [lah] so I was like [oh] I guess because <malay>kalau rumah pun sekarang rumah rumah</malay>
I mean is <malay>sekarang banyak gila</malay> foreigner <malay>datang sini</malay> [seh] like <malay>banyak gila</malay>
ya but in the first place there is so many
ya
expats expats
I didn't know expats were okay sorry expats ya
actually <malay>sekarang</malay>
wait so <malay>bapa kau masih kat sana</malay>
!alah! <malay>sedihnya sorang-sorang</malay>
ya
true true true
[oh]
oil <malay>abeh kalau kat sini masa itu dia kerja apa</malay>
[oh] #jurong# island
[ah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> oil but he's not really in contact with oil [lah] right he's just like
I mean <malay>baju dia kau dah cuci</malay> actually that time [kan] <malay>bapa aku sebab bapa aku kerja</malay> airline [kan] so <malay>dia pun nak kena</malay> fix fix all the aeroplane <malay>punya</malay> stuff right
ya then that's why that time [ah] I don't know don't know whether it's a
[ah] ya it's time <malay>kerja</malay> cause <malay>dia cakap dia balik rumah</malay> then <malay>dia nak kena tukar baju</malay> because <malay>apa dia terjatuh</malay> oil ya then I was like I was like shit <malay>apa bau</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay> bus~
it so strong <malay>macam</malay> toxic
ya but then actually <malay>kalau kau pergi</malay> I don't for you but for me <malay>aku kalau pergi</malay> what is it called petrol station <malay>aku suka bau dia</malay>
low-key <malay>tapi aku macam</malay>
should be [lah] right
ya
ya so but then that time <malay>apa dia kena kat dia punya baju</malay> [kan] so <malay>baju</malay> obviously <malay>aku rasa dah</malay> in contact with the skin <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
it's not good [ah]
should be [lah] I don't know
oil right why is oil good
ya so it's like <malay>dia dah mandi</malay> [kan] then <malay>dia dia dia tanya aku</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>ni bau lagi tak aku bau tangan dia macam asal macam bau lagi</malay> [eh]
that's the thing
ya
