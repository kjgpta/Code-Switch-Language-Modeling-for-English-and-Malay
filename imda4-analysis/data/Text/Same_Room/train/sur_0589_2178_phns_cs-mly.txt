!hey! sorry I know I came I'm supposed to come like an hour earlier but I came timing <malay>gini</malay>
ye~ yeah <malay>tapi</malay> like luckily I got like direct bus [ah] I mean it's a long bus ride but it was a nice long bus rides
one eight seven
yeah <malay>macam</malay>
like forty minutes then like I was thinking to myself like shall I take a train or what then <malay>macam</malay> like
I don't want to like rush myself so I was just like okay never mind just take direct bus
suprisingly <malay>ada</malay> [eh] cause <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>apa</malay>
one eight seven [kan] normally is the single deck right so
like there's no space right even if like the seat is very crowded
but this one I got like the double deck one
cause you always Grab here is it or you don't really have a purpose to come to #jurong#
(uh huh)
side [lah]
(mmhmm)
so what you just have to take the train and then you take a bus or you still like you have to switch buses
some more peak hours right I cannot [sia] like there was once I worked at at like I think
newton or something then I have to keep like <malay>tukar tukar</malay> actually no like last year I w~ at dhoby right and like my line is the green line then I have to keep like switching and stuff
like it was just tiring I was just more tired I dreaded going to school I don't mind being in school but then like I just dreaded being in sch~ like going to school
yeah I feel like I mean like I understand that we have to wear the mask and stuff <malay>tapi</malay> like
<malay>macam</malay> so <malay>leceh</malay> you know like I'm still so
like my makeup gets smudged at the mask and all that
(mm)
(mmhmm)
honestly yeah I can understand
what's your plan I mean like (err) I don~ there was like I wanted to ask you about something like I had plans
the other day
but (uh) I forgot
to I mean like I had pla~ I wanted to do plans with you but then I forgot about it then after that I remembered
(err) like a few months ago and then like COVID happened and then I feel like it just took
way longer for me to like text you about it
it's okay
yeah
yeah I was supposed to go for like two concerts this year you know I was supposed to go for #yungblud# and rex orange county <malay>tapi</malay> like COVID
(mm) <malay>begitu</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
yeah like (uh) I also was supposed to travel a lot this year
then like
then like (err) I was supposed to like travel for a few countries and stuff but then like
I I just didn't have I mean because of COVID it didn't happen and also like
like
I was supposed to go I think like (um)
you know the good vibes fest at (um) #genting#
yeah I was supposed to go there and I mean and I mean it was like my first
apparently like supposedly my fi~ [ah] first [ah] music festival [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> like excited [kan]
<malay>habis</malay> COVID <malay>habis</malay> like J_B <malay>pun tak boleh masuk</malay> I really miss J_B you know I want to go like
you know <malay>makan sate malam malam</malay>
(mmhmm)
yeah Ramly burger at the side of the road [oh] my god I miss that you know it's always like
<malay>murah</malay> and it's like so nice to
eat at night
(mmhmm)
[oh] yeah like that's really sad it's like those like side
of the road thingy right I had
a maid like who like lives in like she we still keep in contact with her after like
you know after she left malay~ (um) indonesia
then like she sell (err) she her husband sold those like <malay>bakso</malay> cuts you know
and because of COVID cafe [dah] <malay>tutup</malay> [seh] then <malay>macam</malay> like we feel very bad because it's like
she's kind of like she lives in a <malay>kampung</malay> right then she just like gave birth and then like
<malay>tak ada duit</malay> like the only source of income was like
from her husband then <malay>macam</malay> like baby <malay>tak ada duit</malay> then the other time
we called her during <malay>raya</malay> the baby <malay>tengah demam</malay> [seh]
but
yeah I mean like my we sent her some money [lah] like me and my
like mum's siblings and stuff cause we like <malay>kita</malay> like very <malay>rapat dengan dia</malay>
(mm)
I have an uncle that lives there like I remember like (um) during
<malay>bila raya</malay> right like <malay>dia orang tak boleh keluar negeri</malay> you know like I mean
K_L if they live in K_L you have to stay in K_L then after that like you like for <malay>raya</malay> you cannot <malay>balik kampung</malay> which is like
because for them it's like
their <malay>bandar</malay> is K_L right so like thei~ thei~ their family members are all back in like #kampungs# and stuff
so like they couldn't leave they just like stayed there
yeah that's not the case but I think I mean like I think it's also just because (uh) during like <malay>hari raya</malay> like that time
like it was like still not stable at all you know I mean it was like the same here [lah] we couldn't like leave anything
I mean we could not like leave the house or anything for them it's just like
they can't do anything I mean they from what I know it's like theirs more strict
but everybody still tries to get out
which is really bad you know what I heard though like there are people who
like try to leave by car right and then like there were like the police or something that dress up like <malay>pocong</malay> just for them to go home
yeah like you know the police or some volunteers [lah] you know <malay>macam</malay> they dress up <malay>macam pocong gitu habis</malay> just to like
scare cause like <malay>malam malam</malay> [kan] <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>dekat hutan semua tu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> like it scared them and then like
<malay>patah balik</malay> [sia] I got see a video of it it was kind of funny
yeah
(mm)
I think they did tried to do the same <malay>kat</malay> indonesia also during like the whole lock down thing but then
like honestly indonesians are not fazed by the
by like any sort of ghost
(hmm)
why I mean like yeah I mean like I think in singapore it's not too bad like compared to like maybe in the west <malay>gitu</malay>
but like okay [lah] I mean like it's still a big change in the life right
what do you mean you're not you don't you're not in school like I mean don't you have like
you don't need you no you don't need to go to campus is it
(mm)
how is the exam going to be conducted do you have to go to campus this time
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
it's all <malay>pakai</malay> laptop [eh]
like
like you <malay>pakai</malay> laptop then like it's just what like
in the classroom then it's like just like everybody has to social distance
[oh]
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean like
it's hard to be motivated at a time like this right then like most of my classes now since I'm like self studying and then like and stuff like that like it's not
physical so it's always just like online
so it's like like you said [lah] it's like same goes to you I guess it's like really hard to focus and then it's just like for me I work best with one to one
but like technically this is one to one but not like directly in front of me so it's like a bit
hard to focus but I think I'm okay it's like
since it's september [eh] september now right it's like
end of next month which is like like the exams is end of next month which is like super fast in my opinion
G_C_S_E is I think is in England it's G_C_E here
yeah so but like they did
make amendments [lah] for the topics I guess cause is like
for example like the sec four topics right like some of them are redacted
removed and stuff because it's like they we don't have the time to like
they didn't have the time to like properly like teach us stuff
then like I know my P_O_A paper they are removing a big
big question from like
I think supposedly a topic that was supposed to be like taught this year
actually I can do I mean like I'm not very good with numbers in general but like
I could do math better than I do P_O_A like I
back then like I was so bad at it but like I'm just giving myself a shot cause
it's like I'm just trying to work for my future at this point
but
yeah I mean like
even if with the topics being redacted and stuff like
I think the bell curve is going to be higher which kind of is going to suck so
(mmhmm)
yeah that's like my second time taking it so it like really sucks I mean like
I hope they understand the whole situation and also like maybe in future like
next year when they're like you know the intake for like tertiary education I hope there will be more lenient on it because it's like we
everybody is having a bad year this year I feel
but I mean
I understand what you feel [lah] like I also cannot like focus at home because like I have like four siblings and I have a naggy mother if I'm being honest
so it's like
sometimes when I'm doing my work and she's just my mum's always at home just like <malay>kenapa tak buat</malay>
you know like <malay>kenapa tak buat</malay>
(err) <malay>tak ci~ tak tak tolong mak</malay> or something like that you know so I'm just like
you know I can never focus but then again like I'm better on my own
no matter the place like it doesn't have to be at home or anything
(mm)
only time will tell how we'll be like as marks you know in future
hopefully we're still friends by then
what were you doing yesterday
like
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yeah I mean like same goe~ I mean like I met
(err) #rifky# in the morning because like
I told you [kan] like the day before I <malay>pergi</malay> (err) the malayan council
then (err) you know portion <malay>dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>besar</malay> [kan] so like I couldn't finish it so I brought home
and then I tried eating like that night itself I tried eating it again and it's still so much so like
#rifky# (err) I called #rifky# in the morning I said like !hey! do you want food
like you know I cannot finish and I don't want to throw it away because like <malay>mahal</malay> [kan]
then (uh) he's like okay so I just met him and then like <malay>kita lepak</malay>
<malay>sekejap</malay> I got screened by an officer at like that hour I thought like I also like to <malay>panjat</malay> you know cause like
they were just doing their roundings [ah] but I didn't expect them to be like there that hour
but yeah I mean it was nothing
then after that like afterwards I just like stayed at home I didn't really do much
also then after that like at night I went to like <malay>jumpa kawan</malay> you know just to <malay>lepak</malay> also
like
late at night [lah]
I don't know there's this thing called the the <malay>rendang daging salai</malay> or something
like it was so it's super nice it's like (um)
it taste like you know the <malay>kuah</malay> is sort of like <malay>rendang</malay> then with linguine with like scallops
<malay>sotong</malay> and then there's like <malay>daging salai</malay> on top [lah] which is like I don't know
very innovative in my opinion
really <malay>sedap</malay> [lah] it's like a taste of like you know you I feel like a lot of fusion foods don't really work out <malay>tapi</malay> for them is like for western and malay food to work it's like
it's nice
(mmhmm)
yeah I mean like I'm not sure about <malay>rendang</malay> being the nicest but
I mean I've been there a few times and then like generally I feel like nothing there is
<malay>tak sedap</malay> you know everything is <malay>sedap</malay>
and yeah I mean like I recommend you to eat it but then it is a very big portion so that's one thing
and yeah I mean like I went to arab street like technically it was a sunday that I went there right
I kind of just don't really like going to these places in general in like
no I mean like I I'm fine with it but if it's like a weekday cause <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>tak ramai orang</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> especially with the whole COVID thing I <malay>pun</malay> like a bit paranoid you know there's like so many people
but it's okay [lah] I mean like I still like the atmosphere there [lah] it's just that it was like very hot and there were so many people so I got a bit like fussy
[oh] I ate with my family because it's like my it was my sister's birthday
then after that my sister like just requested that she wanted to eat there because like
ever since we tried there once like it became like our favorite place to eat
(mmhmm)
yeah that's what I feel also like
cause like I don't mind like paying for that price cause like it's <malay>sedap</malay> you know and then like
they from my experience right whenever like we go there like I think
pre pre COVID [lah] they like to give us like free stuff like for example like free cake or like sometimes they give free mussels <malay>gitu</malay>
(um) but yeah [lah] but I I think after COVID like they kind of cut down on it and stuff
but
I mean it is arab street [lah] everything there is like <malay>mahal</malay> and yeah it's a once in a while thing so
[ah] you get it [lah]
you know [ah] there's this place I like to eat also it's called (um) indobowl
okay so like asides from indonesian food right they actually have this twist on like
[ah] Indomie then after that they have like for example like
<malay>ayam madura</malay> which is like [oh] yeah
<malay>ayam geprek</malay> you know something like that like very indonesian based
side dishes and then they just infuse it together
it's a really nice concept honestly and it's really nice and the price is not so bad you know not as expensive as (um)
like (um) malayan council I mean like
a meal can go up to like eight to fifteen dollars for one it's not bad really
yeah basically then there's this [ah] I mean they have this platter thingy which I believe is
about forty dollars but it's meant to be shared but I tell you it's super nice and I don't know
I've always had good experiences with it I went there once and I kept going a few times it was just like not it's like the price point also not so bad you know
but it's just a bit <malay>leceh</malay> cause like arab street and some of like it's in the middle of the road
yeah actually same [lah] the other time when I was like you know because before COVID I had a job and then like
you know I could like treat myself to these kind of things like once a month at least
but now like ever since COVID I also have no money
and like
yeah so I've been trying to apply for jobs you know but I've been very access unsuccessful about it
what about you
I don't know I use you know like <malay>kat</malay> Telegram they have those <malay>macam</malay> groups [kan] then <malay>macam</malay>
the thing about that is they advertise it to make it sound really like attractive you know then okay to be fair like I tried to
(uh) applied for a lot also then like some a lot also never get back to me then some of them like
you know they mention things like for example like [oh] they never mentioned the pay like <malay>berapa</malay> or just like
[oh] you have to go through this course first and we won't pay you for it and stuff and then <malay>macam</malay> like
<malay>benda gini</malay> all should be like you know when you advertise it should like it should be there [what]
<malay>habis dia orang tak ni</malay> so I was just like
like is it worth like doing something like that I mean like as much as I'm desperate for a job also I'm just like is it still worth it
(mm)
yeah and then it's like <malay>macam</malay> cause like sometimes like
they will say like [oh] we'll get back to you if we need you so~ something like that in my opinion I feel like
because the waiting is very dreadful you know so I rather you just text me and say like you~ I didn't get the job like
at least <malay>tak payah</malay> you know <malay>terfikir fikir</malay> you know <malay>kalau dapat ke tak</malay>
and like in the meantime at least I know
whether I should be applying for more jobs or I should like you know stop finding because like knowing I'll have the job or something
and yeah [lah] I mean like it's just
frustrating [lah] and then like you know these agents also sometimes they just
don't tell you the full truth then <malay>macam</malay> like I feel so cheated by it if I'm being honest
(mmhmm)
yeah I agree with that I mean like
I mean like I've worked a few jobs and stuff and then like you know so far I've been successful at getting it so like
this really hurts my heart that I've been so I've been rejected so many times
but and also like in a time like this you know like
everybody needs something but at the same time I understand why it's hard to hire people but at the same
time everybody's also broke so like
I don't know [lah] hopefully we'll get a job soon [lah] hopefully
actually [ah] I also under like over ove~ underestimated the fact that you know like COVID
<malay>akan lama gini</malay> you know
cause like I thought like when it first came to singapore I'm like okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
just like outside people right and then after that there are people like singaporeans that got it then suddenly like
there was a spike and all that and it got (mm) like I was thinking to myself like okay this like whole [ah]
thing is not gonna die it's not going to
like go away any time soon
but I thought like okay [lah] like <malay>lama lama pun</malay> maybe by the end of august or something but look it's september and it's still the same thing
and at most <malay>apa apa boleh makan kat luar</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> still need to wear mask and then like I'm just like
I al~ like I also did a lot of online shopping I also did a lot like
Grab delivery and stuff because then I mean like Grab
I ordered Grab cause like
I was just so lazy to cook like it was so hard to be productive during circuit breaker
then all I did was just like
order food and order a lot of things online so I thought like maybe after circuit breaker I'll also get a job but
I didn't know it was still going to be hard
yeah
(hmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
then it's like they
like they prioritize so much about being like you know like
they prioritise so much about their free speech and then you know their rights as like you know doing this and that
but it's more of just like
you know you're like okay yeah you have your rights but at the same time like
look at the situation [lah] like you not using your mask and stuff like that like okay you want to die that's your problem but then don't
be hard on other people you know there are like people who are like you know auto immune you know which are more prone to the virus and stuff like that and
if it hits them it will be like ten times harder on them as well like you know average person
so yeah I mean
then like the other time also like I was watching the news
like cause like
(err) they were (err) the leading
doctor or scientist of
the whole like COVID situation in
(um) the U_S right they were I think explaining to donald trump saying that
[oh] if you leave if you like you know stay out in the hot or the sun it will like you know
kill the bacteria of like the COVID faster
so like on surface you know like technically it can be passed through surfaces right but if it's a hot or if you sanitize it and stuff it will like die
so that stupid idiot of a president wou~ <malay>cakap</malay> [kan] like
like I don't know whether like how he read it or something but he was saying like
[oh] maybe (uh) we can look into like injecting ourselves with sanitizers with bleach and stuff like there were actua~ like you know
like the president <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] and then the next day
really <malay>ada orang ni</malay> [seh] like actually drank bleach and stuff
hoping to not get the (uh) virus then I'm like thinking to myself just like how are you
how is it possible that you even entered politics you know
like from what I heard right
like when he was making the speech
the doctor was just like staring at him sayin~ like you know thinking like you know just like
why did I get myself into this into this
yeah
and then like it was really bad to the point that you know like mayors of different states
had to like
even tweet it out and say like you know
I can't believe I need to say this but please do not
drink detergent or like don't drink sanitizers or cleaning products
(mm) <malay>tapi macam</malay> like a bit
I don't know [ah] cause I feel like
that this like donald trump like <malay>macam dia punya</malay> priorities is just not
the people like he's so I guess business forward
to the point that he was like more focused on
like the economy and stuff like
that I mean I get it [lah] like the economy is like important and stuff but then like
you can't have an economy if you don't have people right
so is like I think he was briefed and I watched this TikTok somewhere that he was briefed
about the whole COVID situation
(um) way like in like january like before he was
like before it wa~ like it it wouldn't really like stepped into
(um) the U_S (err) the U_S or like the just the western world in general
then like
he only took action like during may
you know then [ah] before that like I was watching like patriot act or something right then he was
there was this like whole like cause like the
it started spreading through like beef
industries and stuff like that because like
they didn't (err) they didn't let
the (uh) the workers like not
like you know social distance and stuff like that and then they were like
and then like
there's this like act I forgot like what
it's called but it's like
you
can mass produce stuff
in times of like crisis or war for example like when there's a war the act
then like the (mm)
president can (uh) enable this act so that you know they can mass produce like maybe like
metals and stuff like
war planes and stuff like that so I don't know why but it mass him
enabled that for the beef industry
which was so bad cause like you know like it was already <malay>tengah</malay> COVID
and then like I don't know why he decided to do it for you know then he was saying like cause
(um)
most of the things are like you know li~ like they are running out of food of something like that
something like that and plus like the cows
because of COVID like
they're all like
unattended because of the thingy but like the thing is like he put an act on that and not on like
for example like masks and like medical supplies because like
(uh) most medical supplies were from China and stuff and then the~ they were like you know
there wasn't a shipment at that point of time but then in the U_S have their own manufacturers but the thing is that
I don't know why it wasn't
acted on that and then for a moment there wasn't enough like
supplies for the medical team back in the U_S
so I feel so <malay>macam kasihan</malay> for them [lah] that they have such a bad president like this
and then also like with the whole like drinking bleach thing like it's a common sense [kan] apparently common sense isn't not
common at all you know like so <malay>kasihan</malay> !huh!
who
I don't know dinosaur
[oh] okay that is so stupid
what's his name
!hey! that's not bad I mean like no offence [lah] but for an average <malay>melayu</malay> you know it's
okay [lah] like you know you cannot expect much from <malay>orang melayu</malay> [lah] honestly sorry but yeah
yeah [lah] I mean like you put in effort also right so it's like then like
for them like to not
reci~ you know reciprocate also it's a bit like <malay>sakit hati</malay>
but yeah I mean like how's your time I mean li~ like how how long have you been on OkCupid
yeah I mean I used to be on OkCupid also and then I received like the
funniest things I also I don't feel like I'm so picky also [lah] but then like yeah those like
#yo# and boring one like okay [lah] maybe I close one eye if you are good looking but like
<malay>kau tahu macam</malay> boring [seh] like
you I don't know I mean like you want to like capture somebody's attention [lah] like
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>benda</malay> interesting you know I received a joke once like
okay (err) there was [ah]
this person said
(uh) what did the okay cause like
(um) what did (err) what did the drummer name his daughters
yeah
so like you know my name is anna right so it's like
hin~ (uh) the answer is anna one anna two
anna one two three four
(mm)
(hmm)
yeah I mean like I I mean like I don't know how he
like got it maybe like it's a typical joke but then like it only works for people with the name anna I mean like how often do you know
of a girl named anna right
then also like I don't know that got me started talking
to him you know he was like really interesting and stuff but like I think it didn't really move on from there because like you know dating apps
you don't really move on that far
<malay>cinta</malay> like I that time like during I was on like dating apps like
literally I was on all like I was on Tinder Bumble OkCupid because I was so bored during circuit breaker
[oh] okay so Bumble right
basically right for example like
okay as like
ass~ like for example if I (uh) if a guy like I swipe right to either like guys or girls
and for example like
if it's a guy the guy cannot text first
like it's always the girl that has to like initiate <malay>dulu</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> for a girl I don't know how it works but I believe
if you are the first one to swipe then like you haven't like
matched yet right then you don't have to start the conversation but if you are the one who swipes later and
you get the match right you have to be the one who starts a conversation and there's a time limit for you
like for example like there's
from the second you match <malay>ada</malay> like
<malay>dua puluh empat jam</malay> for you to (uh) respond then like
(uh) I mean (err) for you to text then the second you text
the person has twenty four hours to respond then from then there's just no timer
it's a very interesting concept actually
no I think it's <malay>macam</malay> like concept <malay>baru</malay> because <malay>macam</malay> like typically it's always like the guys that have to like
create a like you know an intro or like you know they are the ones that have like
start a conversation but this time it's like the
it's a reverse role so it forces you to want to text people
which is interesting [lah] but honestly I find like Bumble has like more good looking guys
I feel like not the typical like you know
like wipey <malay>mat melayu</malay> sort of things like you'll actually find like
I don't know cause like not a lot of people use Bumble compared to OkCupid and Tinder
so <malay>macam</malay>
yeah [lah] like
(err) there's I find more like foreigners there and stuff <malay>tapi</malay> now I don't know [lah] I mean like cause
[dah]
[dah] [dah] like COVID [eh] so I don't know how many foreigners are still left in singapore
yeah I tried K Fry but okay honestly
maybe I had my expectations too high or something or maybe
I have like an like an idea of how it tastes in my head
it was a bit disappointing [eh]
but maybe I mean like maybe you'll enjoy maybe I'll enjoy it but maybe I just wouldn't put
like it's just not as nice as I thought it would be
but [ah] there's this thing called like a rice ball or something they mix it with like
sushi and like [eh] not sushi sorry (um)
like rice seaweed and like different stuff that one was nice but then like
would I go there for the chicken again I'm not sure
but like
the vibes is nice if I'm being honest and it's
okay [lah] for malaysia standard it's slightly pricey
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
no
you caught me at salted egg
I want to try the Din Tai Fung
cause like Din Tai Fung <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>halal</malay> right so like I want to give it a try but like
never got the chance to like I normally every year always <malay>naik</malay> K_L like with my family
it just became like an unknown tradition then this year <malay>tak dapat pergi</malay> it feels so weird you know cause like
(um)
normally when I go to K_L I get very like <malay>jelak</malay> because it's like there's not really much to do besides like you know chill
and just like you know go shopping and stuff
<malay>tapi</malay> like
this year <malay>tak dapat pergi</malay> it's just like I want to go back
so bad you know I want to see family enjoy the cheap food
then sometimes I like to like you know just make a little trip to J_B like at night
and then like you know just
have fun [lah] you know cause like
I have friends now who
have motorcycles
I sneak out I just like take my passport and I just go but like
it's fun it's fun
yeah I love pepper lunch okay I accidentally tried it in singapore before cause like
I thought <malay>halal tapi tak halal</malay> then after that I tried in malaysia and like I'm just like I'm so in love I can't believe this is not <malay>halal</malay> in singapore
yeah but didn't did like the last time I think the last time I went to K_L didn't like we see each other by accident
it was like at K_L_C_C or something right
(mm)
yeah it was so funny I remember I waved at you and then my family all just like turned around just like
(oo) who is that why do you have friends I'm like no
but I was from a wedding <malay>tu</malay> I like
I came in like my <malay>kebaya</malay> so it's kind of funny but then at the same time like I think it's kind of normal
I mean it was fun (uh) I mean like (err) I think at the point of time I was at
a wedding near K_L_C_C right but then like
me and my cousins all <malay>nak cabut</malay> because like
we just didn't have the social battery to like you know like
just have like (uh)
to communicate with like our other (uh) relatives cause this is like a bit of like extended family it's like my dad's
cousins so it's like <malay>rapat</malay> but
not very <malay>rapat</malay>
but yeah cool [lah] then after Starbucks we like went to the Apple store
like then my unc~ (uh) my cousin bought like a macbook there which is like cheaper you know apparently
yeah then after that like just nice [lah] like he just bought everything there cause he was like starting school also
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
yeah I think I get you I mean okay honestly I'm not like the biggest fan of like
going for like #jemputans# and stuff like that <malay>pasal macam</malay> like when growing up <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I don't know I'm like very <malay>rimas</malay> cause <malay>macam panas</malay> [kan] then you have to like dress up <malay>semua</malay> and then like
<malay>pergi</malay> [ah] wedding <malay>tapi tak kenal siapa</malay> you know then <malay>macam</malay> I
told my parents I said like yeah I'm not going to go anymore <malay>tapi</malay> I do enjoy if it's like
my family members you know I really miss it too
then you talking about the <malay>biryani</malay> like I think it's always a star of the show right then (um)
<malay>satu kali</malay> that time (uh) my aun~ my aunt I think
yeah no my aunt's (um) cousin
like from her other side then like we
just I just decided to go [lah] because like <malay>macam</malay> I was I I know her [what]
then she <malay>kahwin</malay>
(err) an indian muslim guy and the food was so good like
the <malay>biryani</malay> was just like next level
and yeah I kind of miss it like you know like it's also like free food right
so like <malay>tak payah makan</malay> for the rest of the day
and then like sometimes they always like <malay>kasi kita bawa balik</malay> then like got the <malay>ayam masak merah</malay> then the <malay>nasi minyak</malay> and all that
I love it
[ah]
yeah yeah yeah for me it's like
okay okay <malay>nasi biryani</malay> would be the first one I think of then next will probably be like <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
then like <malay>rendang</malay> and <malay>ayam masak merah</malay> that is like the three I mean that's like the staples I mean then maybe like
I don't know
like from [ah] (um) you know <malay>ikan tiga rasa</malay> like you know the crispy fish and stuff like that
other than that I feel like what else is not like why wouldn't there be <malay>biryani</malay> and stuff like that's so weird
yes [oh] my god like
I mean it's it's stated in the name already you know it has to be there
okay but I remember some (um) the other time like I had an aunt
who like got married like during like the second week of <malay>raya</malay> and I feel like
okay [lah] I mean like for (mm) for me for for you like you want to do anything like
you know it's your wedding right go ahead but I very <malay>pantang</malay> you know cause I feel like I'm from a
very big family then like I always need to finish like my visiting and stuff like that
then like to have a wedding <malay>macam</malay> like no offence [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> like spoil [seh]
there's such thing
then might as well don't do a big wedding right just <malay>kahwin</malay> like R_O_M or something you know
like your focuses are wrong [seh] but
I mean like why why do people do it <malay>buat penat</malay> [jer] cause like normally like
people are just more tired during <malay>ramadhan</malay> you know and then like
you know people want to like you know
<malay>kejar maghrib</malay> and stuff like that just to eat with their family then like you know there's <malay>terawih</malay> and stuff like that I think this
wedding would really spoil that I don't know how that works
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I
[ah] I think recently they (uh) <malay>naikkan</malay> to maybe I think fifty
<malay>yang</malay>
(mm)
that's what I thought also like at first cause like
I I mean like the idea of it being small it's like okay I get it you know like small wedding then <malay>macam</malay> bigger honeymoon [lah] <malay>kirakan tapi macam</malay>
I think about it [eh] it's like
I'm also like the first child right so <malay>macam</malay> I feel like I understand my parents point <malay>macam dia nak</malay> you know show us off or something
and then also like personally I feel like I have a lot of friends too and I feel like you know <malay>kalau tak</malay>
invite <malay>satu</malay> like if I invite like <malay>sikit sikit tu</malay> I don't want like <malay>dia orang sakit hati ke apa</malay>
you know but at the end of the day like I mean like
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay> if anything also just like <malay>kahwin sikit sikit</malay> then like you know like
have a reception afterwards then like have a bigger honeymoon right it's always better
(mm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
for me like
cause like I come my parents (uh) my grandparents are originally like from like malacca
you know so <malay>macam</malay> like a lot of like the <malay>kampung kampung</malay> roots are still in within my family
so <malay>macam</malay> like a lot of things I do is still very traditional like personally I would still want that whole
you know <malay>macam</malay> gantry thing like you know you have to like fight your way to get in to see the bride and then like the whole
<malay>silat</malay> thing I think I I it's just for traditional purposes you know but then like
I don't know for for me I guess a tradition
like the tradition I would want to omit out is just it being very big and with people I don't know
or like but at the end of the day it's just like I'm I mean like it's
if I were to get married in future you know it's like I <malay>pengantin apa</malay> like it's like I will be <malay>pengantin</malay> wha~ once in my life only [what] so <malay>macam</malay> like
to make it like stand out okay [lah] maybe I'm a bit narcissistic also I just want it to be like that wedding that people will never forget you know and I want ice cream
(hmm)
<malay>kirakan</malay>
actually I don't want to I don't want do it under the block though cause personally I just feel like <malay>panas</malay> cause like
I~ I'm just not a fan of that maybe at most like you know
see see at least got like hot~ (err) got aircond then you know
like you can still house like a lot of people and stuff and also like I'm pretty sure there's a playground nearby so like <malay>budak kecil</malay> all can like run around
yeah I don't know I'm like everytime I go like weddings or something I'm always like in my head like
planning my own wedding like okay how is this going to pan out and stuff
(oo) !ee!
is it the one with eddie murphy
is it
(mm)
it's okay man like I~ I've been thinking about my like future since I was like
since I was like you know really young too like eleven you know like I have a name from my
first daughter you know I mean like this sounds super <malay>geli</malay> and it's so <malay>merepek</malay> cause like considering I'm only like ninety right but like
yeah I mean I have (err) I have names for like maybe my future children then like (uh) (um)
my first child I plan it to I plan for it to be like luna #malika#
I haven't thought of like a guy's name but pretty sure I like the name #maliki#
and I don't know I like the name like
#ayla# like A Y L A you know because I feel like
[ah] it's such a nice name you know it's like a unique but like not so hard to pronounce name
I feel especially with the fact that you know you you're just at home alone and then you don't really think much
it happens you know like for me is like I already picture what kind of house I want to have and stuff like where I want it to be located and stuff
like you know like in a singaporean like you know setting [lah] obviously like
but as much as I want to have like a
five storey bungalow something like
I'm pretty sure it's possible here but also like I I need to hustle way too much I mean way too hard to get there
(mmhmm)
sometimes I think about it also like
isn't it like for me like I think if it's like better for me to just my migrate because it's like
you know <malay>macam</malay> like considering like the financial and stuff like that like is it like worth
you know having everything but then I think again like all my family is here
then after with the whole COVID situation like so many like governments just like you know all the problems just came up
as much as I feel like it's a bad thing that but it's so [ah] it's also like a good thing that I feel like you know like the problems are being addressed but yeah mean like
for now at least I feel like
(mm) I'll just stay here
for the time being if not then
I'm [oh] I mean I'll just pack up and leave
yeah I mean (um)
I mean I don't understand [ah] for me is like I've always wanted to go overseas also and study but like
I thought about it like aus~ australia is a bit too near I mean like it's not to near it's more of like [dah] <malay>banyak</malay>
singaporeans there's <malay>banyak</malay> asians then like you know the whole like #kiasu# thing going on
and competivene~ competito~ compet~
like you know it's just very competitive like in within the asian culture
so I think to myself just like you know okay [lah] then <malay>mat salleh</malay> at least I know I got chance to be the top right <malay>tapi</malay> like
<malay>dengan</malay> asians maybe not you know so I I've always thought like maybe I want to
go europe or something you know with like a whole different language like I want to learn som~ a new language and stuff but then I thought about it [lah] like
<malay>nak</malay> migrate like like you said [lah] with the whole like tradition
(uh) like you know it's like very like new like you [dah] <malay>biasa</malay> with the whole family gathering then I thought about it like
cause I did early childhood before and then like
to be in the environment with like your culture and stuff will like
it's better [lah] cause like the child will grow up like you know understanding it better so like for me if I'm like let's just say I move to europe
my it's going to be hard for my child to learn like
basically like three languages like for example like if I don't speak the language
like of that european country let's just say it's Spain right then like my child have to learn to like
learn malay learn it's like english and also like
spanish and also like learn the culture there then they won't have like any ties to like
singapore cause like you know they never grew up in singapore which is like a bit sad [lah] cause it's like you know it is my culture and then I want to bring it down also so
I guess like
staying in singapore is always like the best option and plus like you know being a singaporeans there's always like benefits
with like the whole like healthcare and stuff like you know
like housing healthcare
as much as it's expensive it's still like beneficial
(mmhmm)
yeah [oh] my same [lah] cause like I my eng~ my mum's malay is like super good like apparently she got like A one or something back in
secondary school and then she became a malay teacher once and then she was saying [ah] like
[oh] my god like none of my children can speak malay and she was like especially you you know
like I've also been called like <malay>celup</malay> [lah] like back in secondary school like I couldn't do malay at all you know
and then like my mum was saying [lah] like
(um) wha~ [ah] my mum was saying saying like [ah] like
in future she wants to take care of my children and for the main purpose is because
she wants to pass down her malay down because she said I don't trust you <malay>dengan</malay> your <malay>melayu</malay>
<malay>gitu</malay> but I feel like if I think about it if I ever get married to a malay guy he like one requirement is that he has to speak better malay than I am because I
for sure cannot help them with their malay
(mmhmm)
sw~
(mm)
[oh]
no [lah] I feel like it's also important cause <malay>macam</malay> like it's just like your self identity <malay>juga apa</malay> then like
I feel like at least in singapore also <malay>macam</malay> like the malay community is like
rapidly <malay>macam</malay> the language is dying you know I feel like per~
personally because <malay>macam</malay> like okay [lah] like if you were to
make me like you know sit in a malay class in malay in <malay>bahasa</malay> (err) in malaysia or something I feel like even the top scorer of my malay class
would not be able to do as well
because it's like
it's just different [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>melayu sini</malay> the standard <malay>macam</malay> lower you know then <malay>macam</malay> a lot of people like just
[dah] <malay>tak tahu pakai</malay> like they don't really speak
then also <malay>macam</malay> like some of them like don't even know how to <malay>cakap</malay> you know
so yeah [lah] then like <malay>macam</malay> a lot of like little tradi~ like cul~ [ah] traditional things are like dying too
like <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>anyam ketupat</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like
my family [ah] <malay>bila raya</malay> we still make it a thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> every year we still do it you know and it's like
I'm not very good at it but it's like you know I like the whole
idea that we still do it then like it kind of just like it surprised me that a lot of my friends like don't
like you know they don't know how to do it
and then like sometimes also like sometimes they tell me like you know they don't even celebrate like the first day or like they don't celebrate at all then I'm like
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sedih</malay> [ah] because it's like you know I grew up with such like memorable (err) like memory [ah] you know with a lot of like memorable stuff from the first day of <malay>raya</malay> and I feel like for me
even though like growing up like you know
holidays just like I mean like <malay>hari raya</malay> and all like becomes like less enjoyable I always enjoy getting ready you know like
the whole you know <malay>buat kuih raya</malay> and like <malay>ayam ketupat</malay> and like just like getting already get~ getting the house like <malay>raya</malay> ready
<malay>macam</malay> best [ah] like you know but like
the fact that I know that there are malay people in this day and age like who don't do it just makes me so sad
