(mm)
okay so okay then
!alah! then <malay>tak ada</malay> swing
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] swing <malay>tu tak bergerak sendiri</malay> [lah]
okay fine
<malay>atau</malay> swing <malay>taruk dekat</malay> living room [ah] living room <malay>lagi nampak</malay>
(hmm)
okay so T_V you want to put on the wall
the T_V <malay>yang</malay>
okay okay
[eh] but but
but they provide the
mount <malay>nak kena</malay> pay extra [eh]
mount <malay>cuba kalau</malay> because if we mount <malay>kita tak boleh alih-alih</malay> [kan]
<malay>faham tak</malay>
why do I want to <malay>alih-alih</malay> [kan]
if let's say ya <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>macam kat rumah awak</malay>
[kan] <malay>macam mak</malay>
from this side then <malay>dia nak</malay> change to the other side
[ah] <malay>lepastu ni sekarang dia nak</malay> change to this side <malay>balik</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam dia boleh</malay> change <malay>tapi kalau</malay> [dah] mount
[dah] <malay>tak boleh tukar</malay> [dah] <malay>tak boleh ubah</malay>
the mount is inside the wall
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down <malay>mana nak taruk</malay> T_V <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>boleh memang betul</malay> but then
if we want to mount
<malay>dekat</malay> wall the other side is not
is not a wall it's a
wooden wall <malay>faham tak</malay>
it's not a actual wall it's a wooden wall
(mm)
but if you put it on a console
<malay>dia boleh alih</malay> even with the console <malay>dia boleh alih</malay>
[ah]
like that
<malay>sama juga</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>kalau kita ada</malay> console
we can move it to the window <malay>macam</malay> my house
ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> my house <malay>dia tak</malay> mount T_V [kan] then on on top the console [pe]
[ah] so <malay>dia boleh alih-alih</malay>
so from there <malay>dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat</malay> wall <malay>atau dia boleh dekat</malay> this wall
[ah]
that's what I mean so
so you can you can actually <malay>macam</malay> if let's say this year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay> then next year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay>
[ah] <malay>tukar</malay> mood you know <malay>tukar tukar tempat ke</malay>
it it might you know we don't know which which [one] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kena dengan kita</malay> [pe]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) correct correct
no L_E_D lights can just <malay>tampal belakang</malay> T_V [jer]
<malay>tampal belakang</malay> T_V
so the light shine <malay>dekat tembok</malay>
it moves with the it moves with the console [mah]
so it it if <malay>kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tak</malay> shine
<malay>dia boleh</malay> shine <malay>boleh boleh</malay> shine <malay>tapi tak nampak sangat</malay> [ah]
not that not that really nice [lah]
but if you put on the wall <malay>kalau</malay> [ah] facing the wall
then the the light will show <malay>apa</malay>
will <malay>memacarkan</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dia punya dia punya cahaya dia memacar</malay>
<malay>cahaya dia boleh memacar</malay>
<malay>dekat</malay> wall
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya true
<malay>memang nanti nanti pun pasal belum</malay>
<malay>belum apa belum tahu nak pasang ke tak</malay>
but it will be cool [lah]
<malay>kalau pasang</malay>
(mm)
of course [lah] <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
of course not [lah]
<malay>tu</malay> [dah] colour colour
[eh] that would be nice
yes
it would be nice
karaoke one one colour [what]
no okay <malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>sini</malay>
<malay>putih</malay> [eh]
then <malay>sini macam</malay> grey
and then <malay>sini putih sini</malay> grey
so that it will look <malay>macam apa</malay> [tau] how to say [eh]
it can make your room smaller or it can make your room bigger depends on the colour that you choose or depends on the wall that you
I love it [lah]
(mm) okay
(mm)
okay
okay even if we are sick and tired of it we can just change [what]
true
okay [lah] I mean we can change slowly [lah]
[ah] okay
never mind
we see how we see how
okay then so you mean that you want the same colour but in a different
tone of the colour
so that means this [one] is light grey this one is grey
then this [one] is light grey then this [one] is you know something like that [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay okay
(mmhmm)
because
[orh] [ah] understand understand
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
why
<malay>tak payah</malay>
because your okay because you said you don't want the colour to <malay>lari jauh</malay> [pe] it's medium grey and light grey
so from medium to light grey it's very near [tau]
so okay if you even if you put it together <malay>macam gini dua dua</malay> and then in the middle you <malay>taruk</malay>
you <malay>campur dua dua</malay>
and then you go and paste [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
