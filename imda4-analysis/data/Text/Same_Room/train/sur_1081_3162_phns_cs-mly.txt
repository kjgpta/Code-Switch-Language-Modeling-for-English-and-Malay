[ah] get a job
get a get a real job yes [ha] <malay>susah</malay> [sia] <malay>nak cari kerja sekarang</malay>
(err) I ya [lah] but I think it's the same right now right now it's the same for me (uh) <malay>pasal</malay> my wish is my need [ah] right now unless I really the the secure that that job then obviously I'm gonna change that wish [ah] to something else I <malay>tak tahu apa</malay> [ah]
you
<malay>dia orang cakap</malay> by in your first year it's gonna be an uphill climb (err)
it's gonna be I think we target one thousand in the first year one thousand you know [oh] my god I don't know how we gonna do it [lah] but [ah] I <malay>rasa dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> the struggle is gonna be real [lah] like the the views are gonna be super low I think the numbers are gonna be very discouraging unless <malay>kita</malay> hop on trends or unless
we have quality content [lah] but I think we have quality content [eh] I know the edits are gonna be super polished and all that stuff just that (err) getting people's eyeballs on it I think too I I <malay>rasa itu paling susah</malay> [lah] [sia]
I think you are confusing streaming <malay>dengan</malay> video <malay>kita memang buat</malay> video we are doing the highlights video the streaming part is just for the (err) console to record the whole the whole the whole session
and then after the record like the two hours long session it will be uploaded on youtube then I download the video and then I will cut the parts where I want to use for my highlights video [lah]
so that's that's the entirety of the whole thing [ah] so streaming is just for recording purposes streaming is not for like people watch me play [lah] because I don't think people wanna do that yet <malay>kita kita</malay> not at that level [lah] nor we want to venture there <malay>pasal kita</malay> I think
streamers <malay>orang</malay> they are like deejays they are like radio deejays <malay>dia orang pandai berbual kita tak banyak berbual kita banyak</malay> inside jokes [ah] where we like to talk about among ourselves and all that stuff [lah] but I think the radio deejays job the streamer job is very difficult so ya you have to be a personality [ah] ya I think we have personality is just that I think we do better
in in the videos in the edited videos ya I think I think our creativity will come out more than we are when we are streaming [lor]
something like that ya ya
so besides the highlights so each video will have a particular game that we are focusing on and then we have to create content around that particular game
so people will be interested [lah] I I I <malay>baca dekat dalam dekat</malay> youtube <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> if you want to start something like this [ah] you have to be you have to know what you are
(uh) like you are trying to focus on [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macm kita kita nak kena main</malay> this specific game [jer] [tau] because what people want is people want
this content from you [jer] so you <malay>macam</malay> the speciality [ah] so ya <malay>macam</malay> they they look to you as a logistic person then they don't look for you as a <malay>macam</malay> a doctor advising sickness [what] that's not your speciality
they just look to you as logistics so same here for the the youtube thingy <malay>kita nak kena</malay> like specialise in this one game [jer] and then like a random <malay>kadang-kadang kita</malay> we see if we can <malay>selit</malay> one or two games inside
you need to give like variety like that [lah] ya so we are supposed to be the subject experts on that
ya but picking that game and being good at it (err)
<malay>apa</malay> like cracking jokes or or winning it's a whole different ball game [lah] ya and then we have to come up with like content around that game different topics around that game I <malay>rasa</malay> challenging [sia]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] of course not man
<malay>kita punya tak begitu</malay> [sia] I I make sure the content that we <malay>kita</malay> push out <malay>semua</malay> quality [sia] I mean it it should provoke a feeling [lah] and emotion for you hopefully there is like temporary happiness (err) like you <malay>kalau ketawa</malay> I think that's that's quite good already [ah] where we <malay>ini kerja keras</malay> like a no brainer you just <malay>tengok habis</malay> doesn't
you don't feel anything I think that's quite sad [lah] <malay>pasal kita</malay> edit <malay>susah payah kerja keras</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] the live stream [one] <malay>memang tak ada apa-apa</malay> like only live stream [one] is really moments [lor] the moments that are captured but that one once in a while ya very very hard to generate like content like that unless you plan
I didn't say any
ya hand me down
unless
ya wear for swimming
ya man I think
settle [sia] I <malay>dah belikan</malay> #safwan# <malay>dah</malay>
which one
(err) I <malay>rasa</malay> like fifty (err) so ya I think fifty to hundred and fifty ya it was quite cheap
because <malay>kalau pergi yang kedai betul punya</malay>
can reach like
it can range from two hundred plus to like five hundred dollars [sia]
but this [one] I got it for cheap [lah] like <malay>dekat</malay> Ali Express so that was good
I think three weeks cause it was custom made
so I think they have to like get the measurements right actually I also don't know whether they got the measurements right cause (err) I mean it fits [ah] I have no complains [ah] so I assume they the custom made it [ah] cause they they asked to put the measurement and I did measure myself <malay>ukur ukur ukur</malay> ya
got your help with that [ah] you <malay>ukur kepala ukur</malay> shoulder <malay>ukur</malay> my forearms
for the kids is just S M L I <malay>dah belikan</malay> #safwan# <malay>tengah</malay> on the way #safi# <malay>tak tahu kalau dia nak pakai ke tak</malay> maybe when he's older a bit

take [lah] half day <malay>bila lagi nak ambil</malay>
next two weeks <malay>baru</malay> christmas
next week <malay>ada apa</malay>
ya is it <malay>bila</malay> you on leave right I thought you have long leave like
!wah! shiok [sia] !alamak! I want to do that
I accumulate <malay>dua puluh hari</malay> [sia] you
I <malay>selalu</malay> I <malay>selalu</malay> (err) <malay>selalu</malay> like <malay>fikir macam</malay> like last year <malay>punya tu</malay> I <malay>selalu tak nak habiskan</malay> I <malay>selalu simpan</malay> for the day that I want to leave the company
ya that's the plan
my plan is always to keep leave so I can <malay>macam ni</malay> I have to serve notice two months [sia] you now at least I clear leave I serve like
one month [jer] [sia]
no [lah] from <malay>dulu</malay> [sia] I <malay>macam itu</malay>
I <malay>selalu tak nak habiskan</malay> if I can bring forward I will bring forward
there is no point in I don't know [lah] to me <malay>macam kalau kita tak kalau kita ambil</malay> leave to not go on holiday why would you want to take that leave
some more <malay>kita tengah</malay> work from home [kan]
ya
<malay>bila dia</malay> hospitalised [eh]

ya we change the sink we change a sink that has a cabinet
it has to include installation
and we have to do for both
because <malay>kalau buat satu</malay> then the other one <malay>tak buat</malay> then the next time <malay>kena buat</malay> then is like (err) what <malay>buang masa</malay> but I think it's fast [kan] <malay>yang</malay> that time your father <malay>tukar jamban</malay> knock knock knock <malay>letak jamban baru macam cepat</malay> [sia] like in less less than a day <malay>dah habis</malay> [sia] ya that time remember ya [lah] he call somebody [ah] your (err) <malay>abang punya</malay> father
