[eh] but you know
because of COVID also I'm watching a lot of malay dramas
for real
so perfect I don't know I was so bored ya
even though I <malay>tak suka pun</malay> I <malay>akan tengok</malay> [seh] super bored
the one that I watch
no I just know that [eh] I only watch if I know the <malay>pelakon</malay> or if I like <malay>dia berlakon</malay>
no I don't know why
did you even know there's like dramas like halted <malay>dia punya</malay> then I was [ah] before this I also like quarantine different time <malay>kat</malay> saudi [kan] so I was also keeping up to this malay drama <malay>dia</malay> I think episode thirteen <malay>pasal</malay> because of COVID <malay>dorang tak boleh</malay> film so nearly the drama is been like three months or four months it's like stuck at episode thirteen I think so I don't know how they gonna continue back or what
I know I've never seen that happen before
like when the drama the drama gets halted cause of like
influence
[oh] my god but <malay>aku pun</malay> before this I don't even like to watch K drama like I just I watch malay drama [lah] K drama <malay>malas gila</malay> so damn long
ya one hour one hour for an episode but
no but it's so annoying is like [ah] no but I only watch it if it's like if I like the main actor together <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] ya [lah] I know but like I just I cannot no but that [one] I watch one I watch so far the one that I watch so far is okay to not be okay that [one] I like and then the other [one] (uh) was when this dude <malay>ada</malay> breast cancer or something (uh) ya breast cancer [ah]
I mean ya it was so cute
ya <malay>cerita lama</malay>
(um) <malay>apa</malay> like what <malay>cerita</malay>
I know I mean I I understand the show where it's so damn long I swear
that's why I <malay>cakap</malay> I <malay>tak suka tengok</malay> K drama cause it's so draggy
yo but my mum watched the drama like six times
six times I swear every time she <malay>macam</malay> [ah] I don't know what to watch goblin then I'm like bro are you in this month in this like in this year because of COVID it because <malay>kita tak boleh keluar</malay> right and cannot do anything right I literally watch the watch goblin three or four times I'm not kidding
ya ya ya exactly
like even if I like a show pun I would like I probably like watch the person inside the show instead you know like I would search up other shows of that person
than watching the show again I cannot even no matter how much I like cannot
ya wait especially if it's like if it's like a korean drama like or like anime <malay>ke</malay> or a cartoon <malay>macam</malay> disney you know those kind of thing [oh] my god like <malay>macam</malay> fictional <malay>punya</malay> movies you know people write like fan fiction over them
for real for real I like <malay>macam</malay> one hour so attached to freaking marvel <malay>punya</malay> [ah] like you know because of like I was so attached to that because like whenever [ah] <malay>bila apa</malay> (uh) (uh) ironman died right so I was like damn I need closure I seriously need to like closure so I read a fan fiction on like how like after tony died like <malay>dia punya macam</malay> fake <malay>anak macam</malay> you know work to spiderman [lah] other than that like than I was like !wah!
that makes me <malay>macam</malay> happy already
for real I slept at I I started at like nine P_M and I slept at nine A_M reading like the fan fiction I'm not kidding
I'm not it was it saudi [eh] it was in saudi for real
wrong twelve
twelve
it was a series it was a really long series
but it was so cool [ah]
I don't know but like as as for me if I'm like so into something right especially like <malay>macam</malay> marvel like after <malay>ni</malay> before I <malay>masuk</malay> (uh) I watch end game <malay>aku tengok</malay> like the whole movie sequence before that
like the whole marvel~ as as much as like marvel movies I could watch I really watch all that in order to understand or whatever [lah] the end game thingy
then <malay>aku baca</malay> just to make myself feel like happier
why boring it literally gives me so much like pleasure and like <malay>macam</malay> warmth and comfort knowing that <malay>macam</malay> whatever at least spiderman <malay>ada</malay> girlfriend even though it's fake and it's not like real but like you know whatever
like I mean like even K dramas I saw like <malay>macam</malay> they did like alternate these stories of like that story
like fan fiction
but the
I mean the purpose <malay>tak semestinya untuk</malay> for that but <malay>macam</malay> mostly people <malay>macam</malay> when you like something so much like you crave for more [what] <malay>macam</malay> if you <malay>kau pernah tengok</malay> spiderman [kan]
you know how spiderman (uh) bef~ (uh) spiderman before this is like spiderman when gwen right <malay>macam</malay> peter parker and gwen right like ya but the one with tom holland <malay>sekarang ni</malay> is like peter parker and M_J but <malay>tak banyak</malay> movie of peter parker and M_J [what] so people make fan fiction of it then <malay>kita macam</malay> [oh] my god imagine [ah] so happy
(hmm)
yes
(hmm) the main main main [one] the main main ones [ah]
endgame
like the solo characters the specific characters
(hmm)
that's why
ya it's okay <malay>tapi aku baca</malay> fan fiction just like just to make myself happy [lah] you know satisfy myself even though it's like not true not real but like it's okay
K drama
like what korean dramas <malay>kau tengok</malay>
what is that
ya
but damn draggy
that specific drama or like korean drama in general
(hmm)
(hmm)
(hmm)
like scenes
how about is it that intrigued <malay>macam</malay> like
[oh] my god that's so cool
that is interesting I like to watch video like you know like grey's anatomy or chicago med
ya
similar it's like basically everything that happens in like the E_R in the hospital
got romance also
but I only watch but I only watch grey's anatomy I watch chicago med I don't know why I didn't watch
it's similar [lah] like the same
ya but to be honest I think it'll like K drama ones are better I don't know why
everything about K drama is so cool right
like it's okay to not be okay !wah! I was so impress
even the settings like
ya like from like basically everytime like the settings like the clothes you wear bro it !wow!
but is like probably like two a two hundred dollar hoodie you know like there (uh) so premium quality [one] just to make it really pretty and really nice
<malay>tak pernah</malay> like <malay>tak</malay> classy
like everytime [hor] I want I compare like malay dramas and korean dramas I mean since I am malay so obviously I would compare [what] like really like I don't know maybe it like speaks for the way like koreans dress in general they so aesthetic so <malay>macam</malay>
so ya and then I'm like imagine that in malay dramas
but honestly though to think about it right they use the same equipment and they can
(hmm) true
I don't know
true
no but general in general like if you want to <malay>buat</malay> like if you want to <malay>macam buat</malay> the drama [tau] like K drama they very they like go out from like they very they like they they there's no boundaries like you know how like hotel del~ <malay>kau pernah tengok</malay> hotel #del luna# right
like bro imagine that but in a malay drama I don't think so I don't think you can do that because you know why because in malay dramas there's like limits and boundaries that you cannot <malay>pasal</malay> religion that's why
I just
I didn't watch it but I saw and I saw #kim soo hyun# at the end [oh] my god
ya cameo then he <malay>datang</malay> right
[oh] like a second season
[oh] my god I remember <malay>aku tak</malay> think of that [sia]
no but usually no that cameos in K drama in like one and the~ in an extra character at the end in american dramas like probably means there's a second like you know stranger things
you know how there is max
at the end okay [lah] it's okay but <malay>kalau</malay> K dramas usually <malay>kalau</malay> cameo <malay>dia datang</malay> just to for fun like just there to like for that one episode one episode [jer]
second season
and also I've never heard of like <malay>macam</malay> korean drama <malay>buat</malay> second season
for real <malay>abeh</malay> maybe <malay>sebab dia macam</malay> hospital hospital
bro I would
of course <malay>[lah]</malay>
now like it's way ba~ even at like this malay station [ah] some T_V <malay>tiga atau</malay> T_V <malay>sembilan</malay> they they showing hotel #del luna# now you know
what K drama
[oh] my god [oh] my god #park seo joon# <malay>dekat suria</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh] I don't know
[oh] the astro [ah] older like older woman
[oh] my [oh] okay
<malay>dekat suria</malay>
it's not dub right it's not dub right
what you mean
like dub <malay>macam orang lain cakap</malay> take over <malay>orang melayu</malay> is talking like they speaking in <malay>melayu</malay>
take over the no but it's so weird
no but <malay>dulu-dulu</malay> when my <malay>nenek</malay> watch <malay>cerita</malay> like <malay>macam apa</malay> (uh) you know the channel one
so it's a korean singa~ singapore <malay>punya</malay> channel but <malay>dia cuma apa tunjuk</malay> like korean show like they dub you in malay so weird
no
[oh] you can like ya
we ever watch movie there right
limited things to watch
ya
is it one ya
ya
<malay>tak suka</malay> [seh] it's so it's so
channel
like so uncomfortable I don't know I don't like watching dub [one] even anime <malay>macam</malay> english (hmm) weird
ya
ya
imagine #park seo joon# face but not his voice
that is so weird
but ya !eww! weird <malay>nya</malay>
ya
like audio original I mean I mean that's why they like like over the time like I don't understand when like people especially in the western areas who cannot watch movies that are not in english like you what if you cannot watch any (uh) sub~ subtitle (uh) the subtitle at the same time like hello it's not that hard <malay>macam buat</malay> [jer] [lah] like
like do you know like this there's this one time this I don't know this what this person <malay>daripada</malay> this (uh) are actor <malay>ke apa entah dia macam</malay> [oh] ya no no not even actor I think they were in general like <malay>kau tahu</malay> parasite <malay>menang</malay> (uh) a few awards [kan] <malay>dekat</malay> america
so like (uh) I think even the the actors there or like you know a few known people there and the people <malay>yang selalu macam dorang tak</malay> happy [tau] <malay>sebab</malay> a korean movie won like an a prestigious award
ya and then people <malay>pun macam</malay> but why though <malay>pastu dorang macam cakap</malay> [lah] like like it's not in english like how you watch a movie if it's not in english how you understand and then like bro you guys are dumb or what like you can really watch and read the subtitles at the same time but I mean because you guys are so used to only your own like only english which is so sad like
even I <malay>tengok</malay> even I I <malay>tengok</malay> malay drama I <malay>pakai</malay> english subtitle [tau]
like even though I understand what <malay>droang cakap</malay> I still put english subtitles because I'm so used to seeing like subtitle and the video itself
even if even if it's english I english subtitles also I don't know why
visual like need to see right same same same same
<malay>aku tak aku tak</malay> [kan] <malay>masuk</malay> [tau] <malay>aku kena dia aku kena tengok cakap apa</malay>
I mean I hear you and I understand you but it just it just doesn't understand to me it doesn't make sense to me what you say so I have to like read it also so I have to like read it also
(hmm)
ya
but I
right I can I watched I I I scared I can see both you know I don't know how to explain is not I see both it's just like I can like if I hold my phone I just like <malay>tengok</malay> I can see both like I don't know how to explain but like I see both
<malay>tak ada</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab kadang-kadang</malay> okay because <malay>ada</malay> korean drama for me [ah] <malay>ada</malay> korean drama [kan] I don't know about you [ah] but from what I see right korean drama [kan] <malay>dorang ada banyak kalau</malay> you use the subtitle [ah] translation [kan] <malay>dorang banyak guna</malay> bombastic word [tau]
no I mean I guess like
ya big word so I was like sometimes I take a few I take a few quite a long time to process [tau] <malay>apa yang dia tengah cakap ni</malay> [tau]
that's why I was like that's why that's why it took me quite awhile that's why I because that's because of that I have to like <malay>macam</malay> read it slowly ya so that's why <malay>macam kadang-kadang</malay> #termiss# <malay>apa dia cakap</malay> ya so I was like thinking are they actually <malay>memang</malay>
ya bombastic words <malay>atau dorang</malay> actually because of the translation then <malay>dorang guna</malay> big words
but I was like thinking <malay>macam</malay> if you watch malay drama english drama like I don't think they use very big big words
!huh! really <malay>macam apa</malay> [seh]
singapore <malay>punya</malay> [oh] my god malay drama <malay>tak boleh</malay> [sia]
<malay>paling tak aku tengok anak</malay> <malay>anak metropolitan</malay> that was long ago but I never even keep up I just

ya I know
<malay>masha allah</malay>
[oh] my god [kan]
this COVID [jer] I don't expect all this to happen but I guess it's way it is I mean like a couple years back <malay>pun ada</malay> the spanish flu which was also like
not couple years back [lah] but like
<malay>macam</malay> a few decades ago I guess
like it was also a pandemic and ya
ya was also a pandemic if I'm not wrong
I think no [oh] my god (um)
that was like way long that was like during world war or something after the spanish flu
ya but still <malay>macam</malay> like the way it's like I mean I mean it's a history <malay>macam memang</malay> tings like this happen like even if it's not common
like SARS a pandemic no right
but it was a big thing in saudi [seh] in like middle east for real ya I was so surprised <malay>aku tak tahu yang</malay> SARS is a big thing in middle east
young right it happen during when we were like young
ya
and but I don't think when it happen <malay>kat</malay> singapore it was like that like wasn't academic also
but I think it was okay right
<malay>dorang ada</malay> vaccination wasn't there a vaccination for SARS
but it's a like a it's like a like a <malay>macam</malay> what is it called like a respiratory
but isn't it a respiratory <malay>punya</malay> virus
the same thing right asthma right ya
like I even when I saw when I heard about SARS about like when I was in school I I didn't know like it was that serious I thought it was just <malay>orang sakit tiba-tiba</malay>
I didn't know it was actually that serious then now that I'm living through a pandemic which <malay>aku</malay> still <malay>tak boleh</malay> brain
like that is so
why
you know one of my assign~ (uh) one
we have to do an assignment and it was like [oh] what what do you what what can you write a <malay>macam</malay> essay about like how like a diary like a letter to your future self <malay>macam</malay> like what if feels like to be living in a pandemic or going to a pandemic then I'm like dude I can never imagine like twenty twenty like dear future self I am living through a pandemic like that is so <malay>gila</malay> like I cannot do you understand like how we're still alive it's so weird <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh]
no but then I'm so impressed with the I was I was so shock when I saw like the news I was so shh~ impressed that after three months this was like the twenty seventh obvious~ obviously [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I mean it's death like it's not good no matter how much how much or how little like it's not great but compared to other places I'm so impressed that
it's like very controlled [seh]
like well managed
ya ya maybe that's why also
like america
region also
really
for like base~ not for like what what's the difference
it's like it's like serious that you have to go to hospital but not as serious you have to go to a like major hospital <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
like the one day two day stay that <malay>dekat</malay> hospital that kind of thing
when they are better
just for just for
ya but when [ah]
I <malay>tak dengar</malay> [seh] I didn't know that
wait #ng teng fong# really
[oh] that's why it's like so big
so like east wing is basically like the major [one] and the other wing is actually the community hospital [lah]
!chey! I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] I thought that was like a centre research centre or something I was like why this hospital is so damn big
(hmm)
ya
the house itself and how it's suppose to look like later
[oh]
so <malay>kau nampak yang</malay> hospital
how many <malay>rumah dorang nak</malay> [seh] there are so many <malay>rumah sekarang kat</malay> singapore <malay>tak apa pun</malay>
I mean now because of COVID I don't think so
they take a lot of aspect to be honest
same [lah] same like saudi like they take a lot of ex~ expats
ya ya foreigners to come work ya
but then like they now this now slowly right where like for my situation right now like in saudi they do this like <malay>apa</malay> saudi I don't know [lah] basically <malay>dorang nak</malay> kick out <malay>semua</malay> foreigners and they want to make the their own people work
that's why my dad <malay>suruh</malay> I <malay>pindah balik kat</malay> singapore cause he <malay>takut yang kalau dia tiba-tiba kena buang</malay> then like I'm in the middle of school then <malay>macam tak baik tak tak</malay> nice right for me to suddenly like ditch
ya
I know so sad [kan]
but I mean <malay>alhamdulilah</malay> [lah] maybe <malay>rezeki</malay> it's better to also
ya
actually <malay>dia kerja sana buat apa</malay> [eh]
