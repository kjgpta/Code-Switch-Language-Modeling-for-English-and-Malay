(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh] okay okay okay <malay>aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni</malay> mystery shopper that was many years back [lah] then after that (uh) the I only did once
because (uh) <malay>lepas tu</malay> like there's no job and nobody call me [lah] I did the [ah] <malay>aku pernah buat yang apa yang</malay> shopping <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
I did the one for (uh) one of the retailers in singapore [lah] but I have to go it's a it's a one brand <malay>tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak</malay> outlet [tau] <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan]
(uh) it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's (uh) the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer [lah]
then (uh) I have there's a whole checklist of things [lah] that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
one of the important one is the customer service [ah] because they are rating customer service <malay>punya</malay> survey
so you actually depends [ah] <malay>macam</malay> when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things (err) they are looking out for
and then (err) ya but for me is I just co~ concentrate one brand <malay>tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak</malay> outlet [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) after that they never call me [oh] for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> product is
(err) groceries she have to go to a few (uh) supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing (uh) all within her area
then (uh) she's given one product so it actually varies <malay>macam kau buat</malay> (uh) mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like (err) basic necessity <malay>macam</malay> for your home
so it can be like anything [lah] depends on the product they are doing the survey for
but (uh) my friend one is quite interesting <malay>dia pergi</malay> <malay>dia buat pasal</malay> (uh) food product [ah] I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think <malay>macam</malay> like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> maggi then with a se~ pa~ a particular brand specific brand
<malay>lepas tu nanti</malay> (uh) <malay>dia kena pergi</malay> (uh) two or three no three or four different (err) supermarket
to actually (err)
(err) do a survey on the product pricing
so it depends [ah] <malay>macam mana kau punya</malay> what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] [sia] upfront
(mm)
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result [lah] responses [ah]
so it's your own free time <malay>bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila</malay> once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
ya it's quite fast <malay>cuma</malay> (uh) they will give you a deadline [lah] by this date <malay>kau kena</malay> submit back come back to the office and submit [ah]
<malay>lama</malay> [seh] but I think that time was not hundred [ah] less than that
but it was just like say (uh) one retailer then I think two three diff~ usually it's three and more [lah] three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred [lah] is only but it's the pay is good [lah] for that time
(mm) assignment <malay>tapi</malay> the assignment (uh) <malay>dia kasih macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay>
outlet [kan] then (um)
the one the ya then the questions is all similar [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> three different outlet <malay>kau kena pergi</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> outlet A outlet B outlet C <malay>lepas tu</malay> the questions are the same [ah]
ya
(uh) price about it it's the same [lah] because it's the same retailer [pe]
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that <malay>macam berselerak ke ataupun</malay> very neat always very neat
and then (err) I had (uh) my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper [lah] like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience [eh]
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything [what] at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so (err) it was interesting then after that (err)
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them [lah] then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya [lah] but then no choice [what] and then is this this is like (uh) you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also (uh)
they they know that mean their their company already inform them [lah] like
maybe informed the manager [lah] not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
(uh) [eh] this date this thi~ or this week right got this date this time (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> sur~ surveyor coming
that kind of thing [lah] they don't say like mystery shopper [lah] maybe surveyor [lah]
[ah] they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one (uh) su~ (uh) a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
(mm)
then too bad [lah] then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
so it's like cons~ (uh) consistency [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know [lah] that this week (uh) got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
(uh) customer service you know that they can give but then (uh) other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that [lor]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
one year [eh]
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
it's like part time [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> like the working hours how
[oh]
!wow!
okay
(mm)
<malay>cuma</malay> it's like quite far [lah] I mean (uh) I think I feel like it's quite far <malay>tapi</malay> three times a week okay [what] [ah]
(mm)
just nice
(mm)
ya [lah]
that's why
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah]
(mm)
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
(mm)
ya but
!wah! that's nothing new [lah] because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] but I heard that the pay is quite good you know (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
and then like (uh) my friend was saying [ah] like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good [lah]
ya [lah] no it's more than ten I think
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like <malay>macam</malay> dormitories [eh] the they can even pay up to <malay>macam</malay> I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend (uh) and my friend was saying [lah] <malay>macam gini</malay> like (uh) she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
(mm)
true [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
(mm)
[oh]
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance [ah] like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only [ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[orh]
ya [lah]
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift whenev~ I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
(mmhmm)
!huh!
[ah]
!wow! lucky [sia]
(hmm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[oh] ya
ya [ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] like they have to save cost [lah] if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like (uh) reduce the
the
the rental right ya [lor]
(mm) (mm)
why
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so interesting
(mm)
[oh]
[ah] okay
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>rumah dia berapa bilik</malay> [seh]
[oh]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah] that's smart
ya [lah]
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outside~ outsiders [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah] ya [lah] true
(mm)
[oh] he's staying alone now is it
(mm)
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
(mm)
ya [lah] true
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm)
but it's good [lah] I mean ho~ like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
(mm) it's so far it's still okay [lah] we don't have any pay cut <malay>tapi macam</malay>
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) like how long can we <malay>tahan</malay> like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical [lah]
so like (uh) and then plus being in the fintech [kan] <malay>macam</malay> don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
and then (uh) we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in [eh]
then (uh) like other products <malay>macam</malay> very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
and
ya [lah] I mean rumours have been going around [lah] it's better to look for something else but again in this situation <malay>macam mana nak cari</malay> [seh]
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see [lah] like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
<malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> right now like right now I'm still okay [lah] I still have a job [what] but then
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then (uh) don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking [lah] but
yesterday I I just brow~ yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin [ah] so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and (uh) and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel (uh) travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know [lah] but my whole company is like they freeze travel [lah]
so I was like [eh] when I look at linkedin I was like [eh] <malay>ada</malay> [eh] <malay>orang masih nak masih nak cari ni</malay> [ah]
like E_A for to do travel booking [lah] visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing [lah] basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter [eh]
from like head~ [ah] [ah] head~ headhunter agency [eh] no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[kan] I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight [ah] I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got (uh) really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya [lor] makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is (uh) four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can [lah] #wei# cause (uh) like more senior level [lah] like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky [lah] they get a very easy boss
with
[eh] you never know you know my previous company there's this one (err) (uh) E old E_A she's not just senior she's also old
<malay>dia jaga macam</malay> (uh) one of the creative (uh) asia pacific <malay>punya</malay> director [eh] APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas <malay>pergi</malay> overseas <malay>punya</malay> office [kan]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do [lah]
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
basically <malay>aku tengok macam</malay>
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
I was like [oh] my gosh <malay>macam</malay> some people are just so lucky
<malay>lepas tu macam</malay> new joiner new secretary join [kan] <malay>lepas tu dia tak nak</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> she she will be the mentor [lah] because she senior [what]
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
and then (uh) <malay>selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak</malay> [jer] [lah] like like just ask people to do [ah] ask people to do the powerpoint
(uh) ask people to change the <malay>apa</malay> send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay <malay>sekali</malay> it in the end <malay>bila dia punya</malay> boss <malay>tu dah tua</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali</malay> just before I left (uh) boss <malay>dia kena macam apa macam apa tu</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> retrench <malay>apa tu macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dah dah tua</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) <malay>kena</malay>
[ah] yes yes yes they say golden handshake [lah] but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
so (uh) they we speculated [ah] <malay>dia dia kata</malay> golden handshake so the boss leave right
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department [eh]
because obviously you are being paid too high [lah] and people have eyes to see [what] so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall [lah] like too bad
[kan] <malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kayanya dia ni lepas tu dia tak ada anak</malay>
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every (uh) I think september october period she will go
for her europe trip [lah] this trip [lah] that trip [lah] I was like <malay>lepas tu</malay> the worst part is <malay>kerja lepak gila</malay>
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
but who the she was the one who supposed to do the powerpoint you know in the end she ask the other people <malay>yang macam</malay> very (uh) <malay>pandai buat</malay> powerpoint [kan]
[ah] then <malay>buat lepas tu dia dia</malay> just submit to the boss that's all her job like that I also can do and I can still earn eight nine K you know
(uh)
[oh] my gosh ya [lah] she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive [lah] because she's such she's so rich [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
<malay>gila</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] that's why I was like (uh) [oh] my gosh like so some people are so lucky
no [lah] but she was she was okay [lah] it's just that she's an okay friend but then it's just that working wise <malay>macam suka</malay> ask people to do <malay>buat ni buat tu</malay> [eh]
<malay>lepas tu bila kita minta dia tolong</malay>
then she will be like (uh) sorry I have a a lunch appointment sorry I have this appointment that appointment <malay>lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap</malay> okay <malay>dia tolong</malay> [kan]
<malay>sekali</malay> apparently that day she's on leave and she never tell you know <malay>macam</malay> bastard [kan] then then I will be like [oh] my god gosh like
[eh] when you ask me to ask you to to help you I help you [seh] then I was like okay [lah] then just <malay>telan</malay> [jer] [lah] because we are all junior level [what] she's the senior [one] [what]
[oh] she's been there for a long very long [lah] usually those (uh) E_As who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
(mm)
(mm)
really [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya that time my friend got told me the (uh) one of her experience [kan]
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the P_A or something then she was then the but she already got the authority [lah] the the boss will give her the sup~ supplementary card [eh] but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever [lah] whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her (uh) [eh] later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like !wah! so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool [lah] like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
(uh) ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's (uh) he already ask me to pass you I was like
<malay>macam merepek</malay> [kan] like so funny
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) ya
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
!huh!
and then she never tell him <malay>ke</malay>
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] at least can just must tell him right
ya [lah] irritating because usually when they travel it's (uh) company [what] so but they can accumulate their own points
!haiya!
yes <malay>yang dulu tu</malay> (uh) every time want to travel on S_Q only
<malay>kecoh</malay> [seh] but actually because I want to collect the points [ah]
ya [lah]
so funny but they are allowed to travel on S_Q [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> [ah] cannot the expensive (uh) like whatever flight [eh] <malay>kau tahu dari</malay> like expensive flights and all that right
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>macam yang boleh</malay> cancel <malay>boleh</malay> change <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing [one] then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one [ah]
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right [ah] okay then we can get the cheapest [ah] like more less less risk
ya [lor]
ya [lah] <malay>tu pasal kadang-kadang</malay> [ah] like what like especially the boss that likes to change every time will change [lah] or confirm will change his flight [one] right
<malay>aku nak</malay> book <malay>macam</malay> [ah] so scary then I will always wait until like really last minute [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> cannot so last minute [what]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
cannot [lah] cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because (uh) it's I think [oh] that one is because the name
the name is (uh) typo error or something typo
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the first name and last name <malay>terbalik apa</malay> and then got one alphab~ or like I think two alphabet [lah] typo error
but it's so irritating [seh] because we went back and forth then I was telling them like (uh) when [oh] no the
<malay>salah salah salah</malay> the name (uh) of the passenger becomes my name
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
the traveller's name to my name because I cannot use that (uh) <malay>apa macam</malay>
back button [ah]
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one [ah] the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name [what] I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly [what]
so after that I went ahead and pay pay pay pay pay after that when I paid then they came out the passenger's name is my name then I was like [oh] shit
<malay>lagi pergi</malay> #hong kong# <malay>siak tu kalau pergi</malay> indonesia <malay>ke pergi mana mana</malay> like okay [lah] got potential to keep (uh) at most I pay back the company [what]
<malay>sekali tu</malay> that one is like like (uh) to #hong kong# and then is like completely different name [ah] so I called them up and asked to change right
and then (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> they say cannot then I said
is I explained the whole situation [lah] I said I when I fill up I already fill up the correct name the correct passport nu~ the date of birth passport number <malay>semua</malay>
then <malay>cuma</malay> the last part the contact person the contact person when I fill up my (uh) I fill up my name
then (uh) there's one part that they they auto <malay>macam</malay> auto fill [eh]
auto fill so (uh) I put in the alphabet then after that they auto they prompt me is it like this email address so I click the auto fill [lah]
how would I know when I click auto fill like
the passenger name also got change
<malay>sekali</malay> I go and pay everything then I realise and then after [ah] but they don't they didn't they didn't bother to listen to my explanation [lah]
anyway so I still have to pay [ah] I have to purchase a a brand new ticket and this ticket is forfeited [ah] no show [ah]
<malay>tak baik</malay> [seh]
<malay>aku bilang aku punya tu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> senior E_A <malay>tu makcik tu makcik makcik</malay> #kaypoh# <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku</malay> (uh) it's okay [lah] everybody make mistake don't worry <malay>tapi dia baik cuma macam dia</malay> #kaypoh# [eh]
<malay>lepas tu dia cakap dengan aku</malay> just tell the (uh) C_F_O <malay>pula tu aku kena bilang</malay>
<malay>dia cakap</malay> just tell the C_F_O he's a very nice person (uh) I will back you up anyway you just started
<malay>cakap</malay> okay [lah] <malay>selamat</malay> [ah] first time [kan] so <malay>aku cakap abeh tapi aku</malay> offer [lah] if you want I can pay half of the flight ticket [ah] <malay>muka sedih</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> C_F_O <malay>tu baik gila</malay> [sia] <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) nevermind it's okay (uh) just make sure next time you don't repeat the same mistake <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] blah blah blah that one I was less than three months old in the company you know like I see how much was the ticket
I see
I think four hundred plus is it
(mm) luckily like promotion and cheapest [eh]
ya [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> irritating <malay>tak boleh kasih</malay> chance [seh]
irritating <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi sekali</malay> (uh) is what [ah]
