it was initially ya it stopped I could have done it I could have done it [lah] but then because tonight my wife works night shift so she's gonna go to work at roughly
seven thirty so <malay>kira</malay> since I'm not going to see her tonight you see so just make it one day and then we just spend the whole day together
did my bookings for my staycation pan pac because my friend <malay>dia</malay> celebrating
no because my friend did (err) is doing [ah] his daughter's birthday party <malay>kat situ</malay> like the same one I did for my son ya so like [eh] like he's some relative also like staying over [lah] they actually asked us to I think just they book <malay>dua bilik</malay> back to back because the the room can actually you know you book it together
the rooms actually always separate there's outside door <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>boleh tutup</malay> then you can remove the <malay>bilik macam besar</malay> so that's what I did during combined but I think they are doing something like that actually they just said to just sleepover
no [lah] then ask us to stay over for <malay>dua malam mesti dia ada</malay> ya so we so we booked a room on the twenty first twenty second monday tuesday ya the celebration is on sunday so sunday stay over then monday morning we check in
early check in [ah] I've been there before no no the pools were but <malay>dia</malay> limited so you need to book when you're there [lah] so basically [ah] I want to go to the pool do you have any like
no they got time limit so when you book your time right it's one hour when you book then you don't want to go always right waste time but I didn't but that time when I went was okay [lah] but it's a it's a service free
so <malay>ada</malay> kitchenette <malay>ada apa</malay> no no I don't know that's my friend
one room I mean I just bring my wife so we can still hang out with my friend [ah] !yay! do the what first ya
no no no no I still need to send it to let them go and
endorse then present it on saturday <malay>tu</malay> saturday ya cause saturday we got video shoot with #suhaimi yusof#
so like most of us will be there [lah] I think it's #suraya#
could be five I'm not too sure depends on what language they speak on that day I mean I actually grew up with it what my mum
(err) there's a lot of groups [lah] yeah #sheik alauddin# group he sea games ya I mean he's like the he was like he's like the same like #fandi ahmad# he was the first <malay>melayu</malay> who got the spot [ah] so called went on international platform
and stuff but when it comes to #sheik# questionable [ah] there are but not a lot there's not a lot <malay>ajak-ajak ayam</malay> but now my
my guy I got one I think I I got one [ah]
british guy
<malay>bertanding</malay>
he's from fulham fulham
salad singapore I want to do the salad
no [oh] my god he is he is kind of two left feet actually ya but that's the thing I feel like he's like he he okay like two left feet but then I think he plays soccer actually he he plays soccer so [ah] the thing is that they said he started coming like more often ever since circuit breaker I think like his normal amateur soccer games or whatever is like so common nowadays so that's why he every saturday will be there for training
so that's what I'm like telling my guy he said okay
[ah] supposedly there is [lah] but because it's been so long since that we we go no it's not that and
it's been so long that they there was a structured
way of doing things you know so it was very fragmented but this month woodlands so it was
it was quite fragmented especially after my dad passed away
because it was actually started back by my dad's friend and too bad [lah] ya
what
!huh!
!hais! can't change this two buttons around because control is actually on the left and I'm so used to not it being on the extreme left so my fingers are always here when actually it should be here
then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like copy paste copy paste <malay>apasal ni tak</malay> copy paste to me it's [oh] ya ya you use Macbook that's why I think I did use Mac computer before last time when I was working for this one company
then
so that's where I learn photoshop [lah] but then like forget how to do photoshop
I used to do photography in schools
ya you will but I think like it's like so far it was like primary school ya forget it anyway I stop doing it when my friend passed away because we used to be partners together then he passed away in secondary school
<malay>lepas tu tak buat lagi</malay>
ya something like no <malay>dia punya urat hati dia putus</malay>
<malay>sedih</malay> [kan]
it's only like what time <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dua belas</malay> [eh] <malay>tiga belas</malay>
and then after that because I I know the whole I know the whole family [lah] yeah because after that I I found out from my mum that actually
his parents used to stay two [ah] levels up from my <malay>rumah lama</malay> in west coast
so in a way I think we we were like we were so called growing up playing together when younger after that we went our own ways then <malay>dah tak</malay> apparently we meet back in the same school so that's why I know the whole family so the brother passed away one year after
yup I forgot why the brother passed away but it's really sad [ah] then I only found out cause after he passed away then he contact no [lah]
only one only one one one of my girlfriends
yeah she was a good friend [lah] we've been friends now I think twenty odd years twenty one years
but now we we talk to each other lesser
I don't really need I mean sometimes I envy [tau] <malay>orang yang macam</malay> they got friends basically hang out with school friends but for me I don't because actually after my O-levels after so I just went my own ways then just like did my ya cause I wasn't really that close to my secondary school friends
[ah] I didn't really have a good reputation in school
yeah it doesn't really matter to me [lah]
I don't I don't I don't really care what people think about me
ya in a way I mean in a way like if you want to talk bad about me so be it [lah] I won't I won't lose sleep over it
<malay>suka hati kau kau dah besar</malay>
ya
even my friends also okay [lah] last time we were closed always hang out but then now like those around my batch and stuff everyone is like doing their own things so we like so we like one down do our own stuff if we meet up we meet up because of whatever reason on that day my friend's father passed away then <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>jumpa gitu</malay> [jer] [lah] like you know

so basically it's like amazon prime then like you know ya
so did you sign up for the starhub plus <malay>ada macam</malay> free so you can watch on your phone
but that [one] starhub T_V [what] I don't know
[oh]
is it now a good time to spend on this
there is what now
ya have to [lah] have to I got my parasites at home ya ya you can the T_V can link to Netflix
to watch Netflix
ya my T_V is like to watch Netflix YouTube
and since I bought the antenna so now can watch channel five ya cause I didn't get the set up box I did last time no no it's like every year thingy [lah] you have to but this [one] because that time when I bought it when it first came out it was really wonky
then <malay>susah nak</malay> just imagine like chinese I don't know which part of chinese
very actually laggy [lah] the processor is but I but I actually downloaded an app which on my phone which exactly the same as that
ya can do the exact same thing so it's basically what you have in your general box which is just an app the data key so I have the app and memory of my phone
and on this [one] but it's been awhile since I turn it on no it's like after awhile you went on then you have to like download the new software (err) no it's in english
depends [lah] that time I bought it for for my in laws then like <malay>macam tak payah nak bayar</malay> Astro but then (err) they didn't turn on the Astro [lah] of course it was still on contract so I just bought so they can watch other stuff my father in law signed up for
but then after awhile they got home key so like nevermind [lah] then like so difficult for them <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>bayar</malay> Astro <malay>bayar</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>takpe</malay>
of course M_I_O of course it is still on I mean cable T_V cable T_V in a way has died because of Netflix cause of streaming so nobody watch T_V per say when is the last time you watch H_B_O
or cinemax or
that's why my mother in law also watching <malay>dengan ibu</malay> I mean #Suria#
[eh] were you the one who send the message about the [oh] ya no about what <malay>yang</malay> the troops [kan] after the cruise ship [oh] no no what actually what is it about this <malay>tulisan jawi jawi</malay> is not arab <malay>tulisan jawi jawi</malay> is translated to malay ya in another words but I think
okay [lah]
you want to take it up is it free really but is it one year course I mean like one day course [lah]
nineteen nineteen is <malay>apa</malay> fri~ [ah] saturday [oh] ya [ah] <malay>sudah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada</malay> time

<malay>buta cikgu mati</malay> [seh]
and that ya but the chinese people can can function with their language (uh)
but I think that's the reason why you can like you you see more instances of chinese people
<malay>tak pandai berbual</malay> english at the later age in their life <malay>tapi orang melayu makcik-makcik</malay> still can talk english <malay>lebih kurang</malay> because I think I think it's because <malay>dorang ada apa tu</malay>
it's in
latin form [ah] so
<malay>dorang belajar</malay> latin form alphabets and everything
which one
[oh] ya
they are malaysians !huh! [oh] then and surprisingly because I was attending to the one lady <malay>kat depan tu</malay> no T_W_G cause october <malay>banyak</malay> because okay actually they have consistent salary loss
[ah] no because in october
<malay>ada orang</malay> M_C
so because the people the colleagues M_C so she was called back to cover and then that's why the salary will be up
if M_C for four days she cover is enough to bring back out of threshold already so
!siala! no I just I just told her you try december [lah] no she stuck in october so so it's like so now if you want september october november october is the one that stuck so okay [lah] november december
[oh] <malay>nasib</malay> [ah]
I don't know [lah] but I told her I said you get your payslip you quickly come down and apply [lah] said I cannot promise anything I cannot promise it will extend or whatsoever but you know the matter the fact is that as of now you can't [lah] cause it's like if let's say if let's say you if your salary spike up in september that's not too bad you see
ya I think they will I don't think they will just I think they will give a buffer cause previously come on [lah] even with our colleagues also some of them also !huh! what's that it's been how many months been around what still don't know what's going on
should I straighten my hair I think I want to try trim trim my hair again just for the fun of it [lah] <malay>lama</malay> [seh]
