[oh]
talking about it I don't whether can say it here but anyways
I mean I don't know but ya okay but never mind I just say [lah] I think it doesn't go anywhere but what's this
you were from griffiths right
then you should know
ama~ #amalina#
she was from griffiths primary
your age
<malay>perempuan ada</malay> #amalina# <malay>perempuan</malay>
[eh] <malay>ada</malay> #amalina# <malay>lelaki</malay>
why would a guy be named #amalina#
I don't know whether you will remember cause a~ ya it's primary school so I'm not so sure
(mm)
ya so you don't remember [lah]
ya
ya so anyways ya the cousin m~
my cousin got married to this #amalina# [lah] ya
yes
ya
ya but after that she went to (err) #ngee ann# secondary [ah]
and then (uh)
[oh] no no no because that time like [ah] the <malay>minggu sebelum dorang apa ni kahwin</malay> I I just went to their new house [ah]
ya <malay>dia jemput</malay> then just <malay>duduk berbual-bual</malay> then he was saying about (err) I think we're just asking like the school [lah] ya then I said [oh] I'm from #zhong zheng# then say [oh] #zhong zheng# I w~ I wanted I wanted that actually she said [ah] ya but (uh) <malay>akak apa</malay> (err) <malay>macam pergi sana tapi tengok macam dah ramai orang</malay> then <malay>mak dia cakap takpe takpe</malay> apply~ apply different school so she said she applied for griffiths ya then ya I don't know sud~ suddenly it dawned on me just now like [eh] <malay>macam</malay> that I know ch~ if I'm not wrong <malay>kau pula</malay> as in <malay>kau apa</malay> your primary school was in griffiths so ya
(mm) ya
[eh] is it still existent <malay>dah tak</malay> right
[oh] #angsana# yes
ya
#zhong zheng# or uni~
why [ah]
is it
that's why I don't understand why primary schools like are considered like there are better schools and not better schools I'm like in my head it's like it's primary school like how how better can better be
I mean children are still
so they depend on you P_S_L_E grade [lah]
no cause last time [kan] I mean I handled K two right and then like I I see like parents some like really <malay>macam</malay> #kanchiong# <malay>macam</malay> want to push the children
like to get to a good school but in my head like it's just primary school like how
how what how as in how good can good be and how bad can bad be
!huh!
tiger parents it's just parents nowadays [ah]
#kiasu#
(mm)
[oh] no <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>asal dia masuk</malay> #angsana# <malay>pula</malay> [eh]
what is the <malay>tempat baru</malay>
<malay>dua</malay>
<malay>rumah abang kau kat mana</malay>
[orh] [eh] (mm) green ridges #tampines# green <malay>banyak</malay> [ah] #tampines# green <malay>banyak sangat</malay>
[orh]
[orh]
as in <malay>dekat blok kau</malay> [ah] <malay>dulu</malay>
for for one year [ah]
one year
(mm)
how much is school bus [eh]
(hmm)
ya
(mm)
no like <malay>takut apa</malay>
<malay>termati ke apa</malay> <malay>dia macam</malay> wasted all the recor~ recording
(hmm)
I think should be fine
I don't know [lah] should be fine
ya it's not red yet so it's fine ya
[ah]
nearly
then I have to move also
ya
[oh] yes I forgot that I got one good news today
(um) ya my <malay>budak nakal dia</malay> withdraw
ya but the reason was like they say it's not because of the school or anything [lah] is because like the grandpa <malay>macam</malay> is sick or something like [oh] having surgery and then (um) it's difficult for them to travel back and forth
and then like now the parents are working from home but they're gonna work from office soon so it'll be quite difficult for them to like send and fetch him ya from school that kind of thing
so I was like yes [ah]
so the kid I mean [ah] over for <malay>macam</malay> child care centre <malay>punya</malay> (um) like have to serve two months' notice so they still have to come to school for two months [ah] and they still have to pay the school fees for two months ya then they can
ya he's present he's pre~ rent ya definitely ya but I'm thinking maybe
like if once like january like the new school year start maybe he will not want he will not really come to school because it's a bit weird to like start <malay>macam</malay> you know february
ya he's going to another school h~ he <malay>dia</malay> [kan] very smart [kan] so <malay>dia berbual-bual</malay> [lah] <malay>tadi</malay> [jer] (uh) <malay>apa sebelum</malay> my shi</mandarin> come for work <malay>dia dah bilang ni dah</malay> [oh] [ah] you're going to a new school (um) ya it's called little school house (uh) it's at #tampines# #tampines# M_R_T station and like okay ya imagine three years old ya he's like crazy smart <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] like nonstop
ya so I have got that off my hands so maybe it's a sign also that I should just stay on the class for another year
ya
the down~ ya is him
ya not exactly h~ okay it is him but like other children also but then again I cannot complain because all children are different and I should learn to accept them so
ya
and and and every and every class has its challenges so
ya
ya but whatever it is ya I'm hoping maybe (uh) <malay>macam dah tengok macam gini</malay> [kan] maybe I could just stay for like
one one more year and then ya I'll leave [lah]
ya see how it goes
ya
I told you right my my colleague <malay>apa mengandung</malay> I think <malay>dah tujuh bulan</malay> [eh] <malay>nampak perut besar gila</malay> then <malay>kena</malay> handle <malay>budak kecil</malay> [tau]
it's like
amazing then I was telling her I don't know how you do it man like
then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>penat</malay> [ah] <malay>penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dia cakap kalau boleh dia cakap kalau apa dah apa ni</malay> pregnant <malay>macam ni jangan jangan jangan kerja ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> [kan] of course
I mean if you handle older kids okay [ah] but if you handle younger kids <malay>susah</malay> [seh]
but if you handle older kids also the downside is like the stress from you know if you deal with
older kids [lah] also it does affect right ya
so ya
yes true
ya
but for like my line is like more how to say (um)
<malay>kalau</malay> younger kids yes definitely <malay>pasal aku cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> bend <malay>asyik bongkok naik bongkok naik</malay> ya it's very <malay>sakit</malay> [ah] <malay>belakang</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>tak kalau macam</malay> (um) <malay>budak kecil</malay> like P_G play group like <malay>kau kena cebokkan</malay> nak <malay>tukar</malay> diaper <malay>semua</malay> ya you're constantly using your back [leh] [ah]
ya <malay>kita orang macam gini</malay> okay [lah] <malay>habis kalau kau</malay> pregnant <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh]
older kids [ah] I think can but then depends also on
the boss and whatever not ya but like for her because her cert is only covers (err)
the younger age group ya
ya what were you trying to say sorry
(mm)
[orh]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
approval [lah]
so who decides
the deployment
okay
actually what do head of departments do th~ last like last time I was in primary school I always wondering <malay>apa</malay> H_O_D <malay>punya orang buat</malay> [seh] like they like always always in the office like you see
you see the teachers but you don't see the
H_O_D people like rarely right
[oh] so they do teach
!wah!
consider own free time <malay>lepak minum teh</malay> <malay>minum teh kat</malay> [lah] canteen
busy [ah]
[orh] [eh] then usually consider <malay>gaji besar</malay> [eh] <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
like
[oh] <malay>banyak</malay> five K
<malay>takpe biarkan dorang tahu</malay>
(mm)
trust me i~ I think you told me before ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm)
it's set auto [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
you say it's (uh)
<malay>tanah besar</malay> [kan] is it
ya
ya
ya
[ah] <malay>tak potong</malay> C_P_F
[a'ah] [sia] <malay>dorang gaji tak potong</malay> C_P_F
<malay>apa gaji tak potong</malay> C_P_F !wah! #shiok# [seh] <malay>bawa balik</malay>
(oo)
I I mean I'm not surprised that like ya H_O_D earn five K because <malay>macam</malay> childcare <malay>punya</malay> principal also they earn like they can earn up to four K you know
ya they earn quite a lot imagine if a childcare teacher okay ca~ can earn three K max is three point two
ya so what more if it's like a principal a higher position
ya
ranking
so there's (um)
so it's like a just the level teachers so like
(uh)
I wouldn't say nursery is the lower level but basically just preschool teacher then there's a senior teacher who usually depends on the centre so there's a senior teacher more of like a supervisory but basically it's just the same thing [lah] just teaching and whatever not
ya so teacher senior teacher and then vice principal if your centre needs one then principal
and then (err) depends again on the
like the organisation that you are in so like last time I was in young school for kids above then
principal is (err) cluster cluster head
ya so cluster head is like in charge of like the few principles in a certain district or something like that
ya
ya so ya [lah] I mean basically you can climb [lah]
ya
it is a job actually meant for you to kind of
climb <malay>cuma cuma aku</malay> [jer] <malay>yang tak nak panjat</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> stay [jer]
no because if I were to become principal I wouldn't have a life man ya serious I've never seen a principal who like can leave work on time if that principal can leave work on time it's considered <malay>cincai punya</malay> ya <malay>macam kesah tak kesah</malay> [jer]
ya like my
but by right <malay>macam</malay> ya seriously like
for cannot
then you have to always be on your phone [ah]
ya after work hours there's no such thing as after work hours that kind of thing
<malay>tak nak</malay>
no no no no
this world is not for us so
ya
ya I mean I mean <malay>kita orang dah belajar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam macam tak perlu</malay> I I mean that's the thing I know they say like it's not good to have this concept <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
<malay>tak kejar tak mengejar impian tapi macam</malay>
how to say (um)
I don't know what I'm saying
yes yes yes ya
ya exactly ya
it's not like (um) the <malay>malas</malay> concept or something but it's just the
ya
contented yes that's the right word ya
ya
<malay>bagus sangat bagus</malay>
ya
(mm)
I mean e~ every career <malay>pun mesti ada macam dia punya</malay> progression [ah] ya but

no no no no it depends it depends depends on which part you're going
