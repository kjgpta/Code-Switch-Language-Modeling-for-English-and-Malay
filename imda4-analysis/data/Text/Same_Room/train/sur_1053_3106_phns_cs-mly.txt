[ah] volunteer next week [lah] <malay>dia</malay> start <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa dia buat</malay> but [ah] like I told you [lah] we we started with the orientation online because <malay>sekarang</malay> we are still in the phase
two so according to ministry of health (uh) we cannot have face to face interaction with (um)
the patients [lah] the cancer patients so
what I am going to do and I've told them I'm going to help with is the
copyright copyrighting <malay>untuk</malay> (uh) <malay>tak tahu</malay> <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> social media <malay>punya</malay> page [lah]
so ya [lah] that's what I'm going to be doing for volunteer
<malay>tak pergi mana-mana</malay> [lah] this is online because right now we are still in phase two (um) so we had the orientation online and we can only meet
as as as a as a cancer as cancer society <malay>punya</malay> volunteer we can only meet when it's phase three because M_O_H has strict guidelines <malay>sekarang</malay> (uh) because people you know cannot meet
<malay>tak tahu</malay> bla~ [ah] all these blah blah things so ya we had orientation online <malay>sedih engkau kau tengok</malay>
so if
so it was online on zoom and what happened what happened was (um) they but they recorded a lot of people there were thirty of us
(ugh) so thirteen new volunteers so that that's pretty good (um)
so I mean there are different things that we
can do [lah] <malay>macam</malay> so I want to do the copyrighting
and then you know the like translation you can do things for <malay>macam</malay> design (uh) photography
(uh) they have <malay>macam</malay> a knitting crochet with the patients but <malay>sekarang takde</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you know it's it's (uh) only phase two and then they have they do a lot of things [ah] cancer society they've been around for a long time <malay>jadi</malay> so they they're very established in the community
so I think the main their main goal which which is really why I joined (um)
is to make you know singapore cancer free really I mean that that's obviously <malay>susah</malay>
(um) but they tried (uh) I think one of the biggest things that they do on a on a yearly basis is (uh) the <malay>apa tu nama dia</malay> awareness (uh) campaigns so they go out in the community and then they have these <malay>macam cakap cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) how to do screening so they hold the screening the cancer screening
because a lot what we were told as as now new volunteers is
(uh) <malay>ramai orang macam takut nak buat</malay> cancer screening because of course <malay>takut</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> people <malay>takut nak buat</malay> cancer screening
in case they find out they have cancer so last year they gave us the statistics last year the cancer society did a hundred thousand cancer screenings
which in the population in singapore of like five point something million is not a lot [lah] ya so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya I'm looking
forward to it [lah] honestly something I've been wanting to do for a <malay>macam dah lama gitu</malay> so (uh) ya #inshaallah# I'll be able to do quite a lot from next year
you think so
no next week they will give me the (um) they have something in mind I think (uh) ya and then <malay>macam</malay> I'll just
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kalau boleh tolong</malay> then I'll do it because you know we're volunteers we're not like new workers
so they want to see that we can do it and that we want to do it
(uh) but of course they ask that [eh] no <malay>kalau</malay> once you commit you have to do it [ah] <malay>bukan macam suka-suka macam</malay> this week <malay>buat</malay> next week <malay>tak nak buat</malay> ya
ya beyond that I have to do more of course I'll start with what I can do which is what I'm doing you know for work and and all but
you know next year when they start doing (uh) the actual work that they do I think the first thing chinese new year <malay>bila</malay>
[oh] that's very soon
okay so what they do is on the form in (uh) <malay>apa apa tu</malay> during the four main religious group <malay>punya</malay> holidays so chinese new year is the first one so they do christmas chinese new year
<malay>hari raya dengan</malay> like deepa~ #deepavali#
I think now <malay>dia tak buat apa-apa</malay> [lah] this year they cannot do anything but what happens is for these main events they have (uh) all volunteers come together and <malay>kita macam</malay> pack pack goodie bags gifts and for chinese new year they have #ang pao#
[ah] so the the money is like donated from you know from community from companies and and stuff (um) and they give they give
families so cancer society helps lower income families (um) with their expenses
so a lot of families you know cannot as it is <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> afford treatment and then <malay>balik rumah rumah macam gitu</malay> and then cannot afford to buy food
food they can't afford cab fare to go back and forth so cancer society gives them (um) like grants and and you know money like contributions (uh) so the low income families can afford it so for chinese new year they do this but normally they said for chinese new year <malay>orang datang</malay> like people have to come to them to collect the #ang pao# (um) but this may be depending on (uh) whether or not phase three starts next year [lah] (um) I don't know whether that's going to happen <malay>ke tak</malay> ya so that's next year
<malay>kalau tidak</malay> boring <malay>aje</malay> [kan] <malay>buat</malay> remotely I'm not going to do just copyrighting
next year [lah] next year when we can
ya why not <malay>kenapa tak boleh</malay>
<malay>kau ingat aku apa</malay>
<malay>kau ingat aku apa</malay>
[oh] ya that's one of the things you do when you go to the homes the (uh) programs where volunteers <malay>kemaskan rumah cucikan rumah</malay> [tau]
so
ya I mean there's lots there's lots that you can do as a volunteer the I mean <malay>macam banyak macam</malay> program program [lah] you know there's a lot to do so one of the things ya (um) ya so they they do cleaning for the patient's homes because a lot of times especially the lower income families
they the caregivers go with the patients to do the treatment and then <malay>balik</malay> they are both
too <malay>penat</malay> (uh) the but (um) <malay>macam</malay> e~ especially the patient to do anything else so the cancer society sends in volunteers to go to the house
<malay>kemaskan rumah</malay> they showed like one house <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kesian</malay> [lah] I <malay>tengokkan</malay> like it's quite sad like you know because they really don't first of all they don't have the money to
you know just to fend for themsleves independently
and so they come and clean out and then they repaint
(um) they bring in
you know a lot of donations for food and stuff so you know just <malay>makanan bawa pergi rumah dia</malay>
and stuff like that [lah] so it's a lot of things that are happening for them and I think that that's why they regularly have <malay>macam apa tu</malay> volunteer drive so this was the latest volunteer drive and I signed up for it
[a'ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
ya
because you're not I mean you're not you're not like it's not like you're signing a contract <malay>untuk apa</malay> [kan] and it's really up to you
so
(mm)
but S_P_C_A <malay>buat apa ni</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but but wait the dogs <malay>dari mana</malay>
the dogs <malay>kat mana</malay>
okay okay okay now I understand
[ah]
(mm)
the one <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>dekat</malay> ya that's true
it's quite near ya ya ya
okay ya ya ya
(mm)
(mm) ya okay
(mm)
<malay>ini</malay> because of the (uh) <malay>apa ni benda ni</malay> [ah]
even with the <malay>ini</malay> the dogs and the cats
like dog walker <malay>pun tak boleh</malay>

okay
(mm)
newborn okay newborn cats [jer] [lah]
<malay>lepas tu dia orang kasih duit tak</malay>
so when you say volunteer with S_P_C_A doing this <malay>maknanya</malay> you take on the volunteer work with the money as well
like in the in the sense that you <malay>bayar untuk semua bende ni semua</malay>
like for everything
(mm)
S_P_C_A has a clinic
okay
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
so who pays for S_P_C_A <malay>punya</malay> clinic like they have this clinic and they are themselves they are themselves a charity so they have
so only only donations from from people from the public
!wow!
!wow! that must cost a lot of money I mean but but now that you said that they have their own clinic clinic must mean that they must be doing okay to set it up <malay>macam sekarang dah macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>duit sikit gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] okay ya
(mm)
G O V <malay>ni apa</malay>
what is the <malay>nama</malay> [oh] okay
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] charity [lah] I mean they don't expect the government <malay>nak kasih semua orang duit mana ada duit</malay> government gets the money <malay>dari kita</malay> taxpayers as well
sorry the priority number one priority is to the <malay>orang-orang</malay>
<malay>apa masalah</malay> if you if the government don't have enough money to <malay>macam apa tu cakap</malay>
like (uh)
to give <malay>macam</malay> to give enough so that the citizens are okay then you know the priority has to be us the citizens instead of <malay>kasih anjing-anjing</malay>
<malay>apa punya</malay> development
P_H property development (uh)
<malay>mana kita ada</malay> jungle what we don't have any jungle
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
so what does S_P_C_A have to do with that like what is the plan then
so you are saying when
but do you all know you know as volunteers of (uh) S_P_C_A and working in this working in this (uh) <malay>apa tu dia</malay> sector does the government actually have a plan (uh) when when <malay>macam</malay> like they go now <malay>kat belakang ni</malay> like there's this
<malay>tengah tengah</malay> this new development <malay>kat tengah kat belakang sini</malay>
do you know do these groups which are S_P_C_A know if the government has a <malay>macam apa tu cakap</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> contingency [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> plan [lah] like a plan when they develop these new lands
that they know
all these (uh) animals are going to be there and they going to drive out the animals do they know this is going to happen and then if they do know
do they have a plan
which one is no
both
but they've been developing singapore for how long <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam sampai sekarang tak tahu</malay>
(mm) #pasir ris# <malay>pun ada babi</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
but how can it be <malay>macam gini</malay> like because it has been going on for so long it's not as if <malay>macam kita baru</malay> start <malay>nak</malay> develop lands or takeover lands it's been <malay>macam</malay> we've been we've been building H_D_B
and and other housing since <malay>bila kita punya</malay> independence nineteen sixties [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but this is assuming that there are still jungles for them to go back into
(mm)
so that's only the dogs because I know <malay>dekat</malay> #pasir ris# when I went (uh) #pasir# park ya I saw the wild boar was right there in front of me behind the fence
where are the pythons
no I don't know
(mm)
ya because recently [kan] <malay>ada perempuan tu yang kena</malay> attack <malay>tu</malay>
ya ya
[eh] <malay>kau punya kerusi ni gatal</malay> [seh]
<malay>gatal</malay> [lor]
no it's your skin
ya but I'm okay I always sit there I'm okay <malay>jangan duduk situ</malay>
<malay>kesian</malay> spoke but so what what happens so who
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> it's been there for awhile <malay>dengan macam</malay>
<malay>terus kasih</malay> [lah] I always said that
<malay>tapi</malay> so when you
okay so I understand because I can see all the <malay>apa anjing-anjing</malay> [kan] I can see
and the (uh) <malay>siapa nama tu</malay>
(uh) the wild boars but what happens to the all the snakes
who takes care who is supposed to because <malay>kat sini</malay> I've seen <malay>satu</malay> just one snake and
<malay>apa</malay> ACRES
hello this is art [ah] by a very well known artist
ya I bought this when I was in dubai he is a ve~ (um) a a young and
really up and coming artist and
he's a syrian refugee <malay>dia tinggal dekat</malay> lebanon
so this was his part of his second exhibit and I really really loved it anyways [ah] <malay>cakap macam gitu</malay>
so no honestly (uh) <malay>apa cakap ular-ular</malay>
because that is deadly that is deadly okay with because
it's not as easy as [oh] <malay>nampak anjing</malay> [oh] (uh) <malay>nampak babi</malay> we can see it we can you know some kind of action the <malay>ular ni</malay> you know <malay>macam kat bawah-bawah</malay> and then in the <malay>longkang-longkang</malay> you never know and then the fear is until they come up through the drains which has happened of course before but [eh] <malay>takut</malay>
what is ACRES
microchip the snake
so are there a lot of
(uh) snakes because I mean we we don't often hear about (uh) <malay>ular macam ular</malay> coming out there are not as many sightings as dogs and and the wild boars especially so
are there I mean I've only seen <malay>satu kat sini</malay>
and and then <malay>dia macam masuk dalam longkang</malay> and then it just like slithered away but it was enough for me to <malay>macam takut</malay> (uh) because I can't I <malay>betul betul</malay> there's one thing I cannot do is reptiles and and snakes and like big lizards <malay>tak boleh tak boleh tak boleh</malay> so
so the thing is <malay>dekat</malay> here in in where where I am where I live sometimes I do see the (um) the stray dogs there is a family of three <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> during the day I can see them they like to sleep under the vans
the lorries ya so there's
one auntie <malay>dia</malay> (um) auntie <malay>tinggal kat tak tahu</malay> block <malay>mana</malay> she comes around to feed the cats so she was telling me the other day that (uh) <malay>dulu dia kena saman</malay> because she fed the dogs
so I don't I don't know anything about <malay>macam</malay> people feeding (uh) stray cats or stray dogs but auntie <malay>ni</malay> sometimes I give her some money because she buys a lot of food <malay>untuk</malay> she feeds a lot of stray cats <malay>macam</malay> she brings <malay>macam besar</malay> you know <malay>macam orang-orang macam ini</malay> (um)
ya so she was telling me so she doesn't she doesn't do the dogs anymore because she's afraid of getting (um) for <malay>dia dia cakap dia kena</malay>
<malay>kena saman</malay> so I don't know I don't know how true that is ya
!huh!
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] auntie I don't know I mean I'm not going to go check after her the problem is auntie <malay>sekarang pun nak kena</malay> she has to be careful because she also puts out (uh)
(uh)
<malay>air untuk kucing-kucing ni</malay> so the problem is our area <malay>kat sini</malay> is a high dengue area
[ah]
N_E_A <malay>tu apa</malay>
[oh] okay
(mm)
what do you mean two hours to clear <malay>siapa yang pergi</malay> check
<malay>siapa yang nak</malay> catch
what do you mean N_E_A walk past <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> fine <malay>tak boleh</malay> feed but you can feed right
I don't understand this this this two hours <malay>ni</malay>
how do they know <malay>macam</malay> who keeps tabs on these two hours thing
(um) <malay>tapi kau duduk situ</malay> so you have to like sit there and watch the cat eat until it's finished
(mm) okay
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>mesti</malay> clear [lah]
<malay>tapi me~ dia</malay> the feeder <malay>mesti</malay> clear <malay>makanan tu</malay>
[oh]
[ah] because then you attract all the all the like cockroaches and [a'ah] <malay>betul</malay> ya that's true
<malay>lepas tu kalau kena tangkap saman dia</malay> how much is the <malay>saman</malay>
but how much is the what is the
for littering
why they do that
[oh] I didn't know that
[oh]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>mana ada kat sini</malay> signs
who puts up these these signs
[oh] say
(mm)
ya but the the cats <malay>kat sini bagus juga</malay> [lah] and honestly the cats around here <malay>gemuk-gemuk</malay> because of <malay>macam</malay> auntie <malay>macam gini</malay> and this
[eh] <malay>apa kat belakang ni</malay> there are couple of cats who always come around and they they get fed more than one person
about the same <malay>kat sini</malay> so every morning when I this my my block when when when I when I wake up to to and I go to the you know the bathroom peep there are
six six-ish in the morning I hear sausage who is the neighbourhood cat who is so cute <malay>nama dia</malay> sausage <malay>aku kasih nama</malay> [jer] [lah] so I I sausage comes and I can hear sausage meowing because I'm on the third floor I can hear sausage meowing from the downstairs
<malay>sampai</malay> (uh) auntie <malay>kat bawah ni</malay> you know I can hear the auntie coming out and feeding him that's sausage
and then as the day goes on when I like look out the window (um) I can see someone else coming there's another man <malay>kat dal~ dia tinggal kat</malay> I think like behind this block
he comes and he feeds sausage again sausage <malay>ni</malay> honestly I've never seen stray cats
and they're not stray cats they they are neighbourhood cats there are two of them that are that that are here in this block like this block predominantly and and around just a few other blocks yes they're community cats ya they are so well fed honestly
I mean (uh) com~ <malay>macam</malay> the the
size <malay>tu macam</malay> comparable to a domestic cat like a cat <malay>punya kat kat rumah orang</malay> ya ya a pet cat
so you know they were they were they're they're well taken care of <malay>kat sini</malay> I always see the same cats around here so you know that people that they feel safe
here they always they live around here ya so it's nice ya it's nice to have all these kinds of things but the dogs
have run away <malay>dulu</malay> we used to see more of the dogs
(uh) during the day especially during the circuit breaker this is what I notice I first saw them during the circuit breaker ya because <malay>takde orang keluar</malay> [kan]
so I saw them <malay>dia selalu tidur</malay> under the this lorry because <malay>orang pun tak kerja</malay> so they were like always sleeping the three of them
under the lorry so when you know people started going back to work when it was what when did we go back july june june ya then they disappeared
so I don't know what happened to them ya ya so during circuit breaker when there were a lot of animals not just the <malay>kucing</malay> but the aunties still came around to feed the cats that one <malay>betul</malay> I always see that
the birds the birds now I don't hear them anymore (uh) <malay>anjing tak dah takde lagi</malay>
ya it was a good period when we had the circuit breaker because there were lots of birds that every morning I could hear them it was nice we had <malay>kat depan ni</malay> right in front here there's these two big palm trees [kan] so
the imperial pied pigeon came during the circuit breaker which is not a common sighting in this neighbourhood <malay>macam</malay> this H_D_B (um) once or twice we've seen them along the <malay>macam apa tu</malay> the park connector here at #bukit batok# going up to #clementi# but they came here the whole there were like there first of all <malay>dia hantar satu agaknya macam</malay> scout came scout <malay>nampak pokok ni</malay> scout stayed there so I took <malay>gambar</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan</malay> camera <malay>tu</malay> and then the next week few more came
yes because they eat the <malay>apa ni</malay> I don't know what the fruit is of this thing the family came imperial pied piegon it was really nice here ya I have pictures of them
and now they don't come anymore
I haven't seen them
ya but it's this tree yes but for them to fly all the way here is another method now that there are there's more traffic they like the quiet places so now they're back in when I was <malay>dekat apa jalan dekat</malay> park connector <malay>tu</malay> I can see them back at the park connector because there's no traffic is right next to big <malay>longkang</malay>
they are so you see <malay>kat sana ada</malay> the egrets so again during the circuit breaker when you know the only thing you can do is <malay>keluar pergi</malay>
<malay>jalan</malay> you know everybody suddenly everybody <malay>pergi</malay> (uh) exercise so in that <malay>apa tu nama dia longkang</malay> the otters all came out so the otters the egrets
the pied imperial pigeons we saw a lot so that was really nice but now
you I don't you go down to the park connector I don't see the otters anymore (uh) even
the animals crossing the path <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> during circuit breaker you could see different kinds of animals
from the snails to the millipedes centipedes
all crossing your path and everyone would have to avoid them
I don't see the animals anymore
egrets once in a while (um) ya
it's just the regular birds the #minahs# the pigeons ya I I don't know where the other the other animals are
(uh) but it was nice it was nice because at then even then the otters came out and everybody would stop (um) and they would do their swimming swimming but <malay>tu macam</malay> exhibitionist [tau] the otters are huge exhibitionists
yes
okay we don't get those kinds of otters in the in the <malay>longkang</malay> where did they go to the (uh) the botan~ botanic garden
so they came out <malay>macam</malay> every night
(mm) (mm)
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
of sudden
but now there are people at the botanic gardens [kan] not like before
(hmm)
(mm)
<malay>kesian</malay>
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
but they're not the ones <malay>yang kat dalam longkang ni</malay> they're not that big <malay>dekat sini kat</malay> park connector the one that goes up to #pandan#
like different kinds of otters
<malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>jangan bedek</malay> [lah] <malay>kau cakap</malay> different family different types [lah]
what do you mean <malay>mana ada</malay> clan
<malay>macam apa</malay> clan
okay
[eh] <malay>kau jangan tipu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana boleh gini</malay>
what is that what fan club
[eh] <malay>kau macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau jangan bedek</malay> [lah] I mean sorry this is not
this is this sounds too
like on the ground <malay>macam</malay> they go and <malay>macam nak nak pergi cari</malay>
[ah] okay like like the people who go #sungei buloh# <malay>cari burung cari burung</malay> [ah] okay okay okay
but they all look the same <malay>apa macam mana nak ada</malay> divide
so the one <malay>yang</malay> that I say <malay>kat sini</malay>
they're so cute they really are very cute
during the circuit breaker [kan] so I read about the one <malay>yang</malay>
the ones that went to #serangoon# road
(uh) ya
so do they <malay>macam pindah</malay> from one place to another or when you say <malay>dia orang macam</malay> this otter clan #kallang# clan do they just live there <malay>atau macam</malay>
they come <malay>kat sini</malay> to look for the
#bukit batok# clan what what I honestly don't understand <malay>macam mana ni</malay>
<malay>lepas tu kalau dah nak kahwin macam mana</malay> of course you have to look for <malay>orang lain</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm)
sausage sausage
<malay>lepas tu bila nak kahwin macam mana</malay>
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(mm)
I didn't know about that
<malay>lepas tu sekarang macam mana</malay> where do they go now like I've haven't seen them in a while
so <malay>macam</malay> do you think they like live there in in the botanic gardens that kind of and and <malay>dia orang macam</malay> what what I don't understand about okay in this case is the otters
is do they like
<malay>macam</malay> during the circuit breaker <malay>macam</malay> okay so that one whole family <malay>keluar pergi</malay> #serangoon# road <malay>nak pergi cari apa tak tahu apa</malay> [eh] when is it that they know they can they can go somewhere else like at do they go at night
like right now the clan from botanic gardens I because I find it hard to believe that that they just <malay>macam duduk kat situ aje</malay>
[ah] okay
so in snakes I snakes I understand snakes you slither I've seen the snakes <malay>kat sini</malay> in the drain
how did the otters from <malay>macam</malay> botanic gardens <malay>pergi</malay>
<malay>kat sini</malay> like #bukit batok# because there is a whole we we see a lot in #bukit batok# at the park connector in the <malay>longkang</malay>
how do they
#serangoon#
so this kind of thing when again like when you develop land to build new buildings
and you push out that the native animals
assuming that the otters are one of them
what what what happens to them
like do they get tagged by <malay>apanya nama dia</malay> ACRES
that is is this something that ACRES
looks after the otters or so because in singapore it's become it's become like a source of pride for singapore the otters ya I never I never realised it you know I was away from sixteen years and before I went away in in
two thousand so we did not hear about otters in singapore because and then when I came back here for a break like about two years ago then I people were talking about <malay>macam</malay> on social media <malay>pun tengok gambar-gambar orang tunjuk</malay> all the otters knew there was once <malay>kat</malay> #clementi# (uh) near sixth avenue that big <malay>longkang</malay>
and I was walking past then I actually saw the otters in the <malay>apa longkang besar</malay>
(um) but I don't understand like when I left singapore in two thousand and three did we have otters then or is it <malay>macam</malay> a new development that they came from somewhere
<malay>kau nak pergi mana lepas tu</malay>
[oh] okay
[eh] <malay>kau jangan bawa</malay> telephone <malay>kau masuk</malay> toilet <malay>boleh nanti orang dengar</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> can you please not <malay>macam gini</malay> this <malay>lucah</malay> can you please close the door
in singapore
like at least five years when you
like heard of them
(mm)
so ya that's what I'm saying because <malay>dulu</malay> I mean growing up here we did not hear about otters
ya [lah] wildlife ya [lah] of course aware but <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] what I'm saying is <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu</malay> honestly I mean I grew up in <malay>kampung</malay> we did not hear about all these otters during <malay>kampung dulu kampung banyak benda</malay> of course we had the <malay>monyet</malay> we actually had the <malay>monyet</malay> (uh) then
snakes of course
(um) we had our chickens and
but we I don't know about I don't even have that kind of memory growing up in <malay>kampung</malay> but we had the big <malay>longkang-longkang</malay>
I never we never heard about the otters
in the nineteen seventies in singapore
so <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] I mean couldn't have been that they
how did they come about to be in the <malay>macam</malay> the public's consciousness
otters are native to singapore I mean we have otters that are native to singapore
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
okay that's new to me
so these otters do they get tagged do they get tagged <malay>macam apa tu namanya</malay> microchipped
(mm) (mm)
do they no I mean when you say they care for them <malay>bukan macam</malay> it's it's not like what you guys not like what you guys do at S_P_C_A <malay>macam</malay> you can't walk the otter
or feed the otters they they take care of themselves [kan]
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>tengok burung-burung</malay>
in singapore do they have them <malay>macam untuk ular-ular</malay>
because honest~ I mean we have a lot of snakes in singapore [kan] I mean we just don't see them because they are really good at <malay>macam</malay> just hiding away and going into the <malay>longkang</malay>
(mm)
ya but now they don't do that anymore because people have back to work
(mm)
[ah]
but how do you <malay>macam</malay> if if you say like the last time I walking to westmall then I saw this snake it just goes into the <malay>longkang</malay> then it just disappears
[oh] I I remember <malay>dulu dekat</malay> the the M_R_T <malay>kat mana tu</malay> I don't know what [lah] it was in the news was it a python
I remember this a few months ago was it a cobra or a python or something
!huh!
what
the snake ate the cat
<malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay>
so what happens when ACRES comes when <malay>apa</malay> the the snake now it has the
<malay>kucing</malay> the <malay>kucing</malay> is in the <malay>perut</malay>
but they have to catch it and release it somewhere else [kan] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> redhill <malay>kat bawah</malay> block <malay>tak</malay> [kan] you you can't just leave it there
but but
but now we have less and less
so [a'ah]
