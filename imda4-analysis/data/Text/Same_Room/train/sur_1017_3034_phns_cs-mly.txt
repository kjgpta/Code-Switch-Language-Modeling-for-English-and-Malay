(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> one of the <malay>macam</malay>
rules about keeping your like bags in everything is to not hang it
so ya
<malay>tapi</malay> no [lah] I mean I'll get a shelf for it or something [lah] for my bags or something
ya cause I was just looking at actually yes speaking talking about that I was just looking at like how to store my back properly
looking at how to store my bags properly
because I remember reading before <malay>dia orang kata</malay> can just keep
(um) can just keep in the box you know keep in a dry place
keep in a box the original [ah] in the dust bag the box and then at a dry place
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips <malay>dekat dia orang punya</malay> zips covered [kan] in in like its original packaging <malay>kita tak buka</malay> so it's all just there <malay>abeh kita takut</malay> [ah] okay so I thought was safe
<malay>abeh</malay> I followed his wife <malay>macam</malay> a luxury person [lah] okay on instagram <malay>abeh dia ada macam</malay> Q&A session <malay>gitu</malay> sometimes <malay>abeh dia punya</malay> one of <malay>dia punya itu</malay> is (um) don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime <malay>abeh</malay> if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then (um) the humidity and also whatever whatever
okay but I don't know and I've kept like this one bag has
been in their zip in the cupboard
since like august
ya so so I'm worried about it <malay>tapi kalau</malay> if I ask him to <malay>keluarkan</malay>
then <malay>tak</malay> [oh] my god <malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>itu saya tengah</malay> because <malay>saya beli banyak benda</malay> [kan] then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because <malay>kakak dia belum keluarkan</malay> her clothes
so in that cup~ so <malay>ada</malay> a small section where I can put the stuff [lah] <malay>abeh</malay>
you know <malay>bila macam nak</malay> unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag [ah] <malay>macam</malay> all nice <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] so !woohoo! open it up
so okay you need to carefully place everything
(um) so that they can all fit nicely
and then like (um) without crumpling or whatever [lah]
then <malay>tak</malay> enough space [tau] so long as it can I can you <malay>gerakkan</malay> your <malay>tempat baju sikit</malay> so that I can more space <malay>lepas itu dia</malay> how why you just <malay>taruh dekat atas</malay> [lah] then no <malay>nanti</malay> crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is <malay>kalau kak suruh dia</malay> like can you <malay>keluarkan</malay> this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
<malay>nanti dia</malay> just <malay>macam campak</malay> or whatever <malay>nanti semua</malay> like I don't know <malay>nanti macam</malay> crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why <malay>macam</malay> [oh] if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now <malay>kak punya kerja</malay> like
I don't want to the days that I have off
I always say I don't want to do anything
just <malay>nak duduk rumah</malay> ya
ya I thought of that also
(um) because now <malay>dia</malay> apple boy he got a macbook
we can face time phone we are waiting for our contract to end
then when your contract ends <malay>kita sama tak</malay> mine is on february
<malay>tapi</malay> yours is the same <malay>kita sama</malay> plan [kan] <malay>ada abah</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
then when did we get ours
[oh]
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think <malay>dia punya pun</malay> end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone [ah]
where did you change
he hasn't been using a laptop for awhile
ya then <malay>macam</malay> all the other laptops <malay>macam</malay> will
die faster or something [lah] something to start then cause I told him that my macbook has
can survive like freaking seven or eight years or something
[ah] then <malay>macam</malay> not bad [ah] then like ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> all the food that <malay>abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai</malay> [seh]
then <malay>dia</malay> okay [lah] then <malay>dia</malay> ya
