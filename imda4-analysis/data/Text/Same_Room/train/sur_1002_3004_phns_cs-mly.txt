okay
(mm)
what type of superpower I want [ah]
(err) <malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower maybe I want to be someone like maybe bat man or iron man
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
because (err) even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
(um)
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
(um) ya it's not a
(err)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ada duit lepas tu boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>orang yang susah</malay>
(err) to fight crime
like
(err) and they don't just fight
(err) those on earth
<malay>orang pun lawan</malay>
people from
the aliens
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
both of them ya
how about you
you <malay>nak jadi apa</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
okay <malay>kalau kalau</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
bat batman or iron man
(uh)
(mm)
<malay>takpe</malay> K [ah] basi~ basically [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
superpower <malay>yang</malay> best is superpower <malay>untuk terbang</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> that that <malay>kalau</malay> if like one
specific
ability is to fly
<malay>itu</malay> [jer]
(mm)
(mm)
(err) okay <malay>juga</malay> but who has teleporting
powers
doctor strange (mm)
(uh)
[oh]
(mmhmm) harry potter <malay>betul pun</malay>
(mm)
[orh]
<malay>yang</malay> the one <malay>yang</malay> ron weasley injured <malay>tu</malay> ya that [one]
(mm)
(mm)
port key <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang satu</malay>
I <malay>lupa</malay> [ah] <malay>tu punya</malay> scene
<malay>mana satu</malay> [eh] <malay>tu lupa</malay> [eh]
[ah]
ya hogwart that [one] [ah]
okay <malay>kalau</malay> magic
[ah]
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to ei~
I'll change mine to either flying or running fast <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation [ah]
teleportation boring [ah]
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train [kan] you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
<malay>untuk</malay> while you <malay>naik atas</malay> mountain
okay if like <malay>lagi laju lagi cepat juga</malay>
<malay>sekejap saja</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
you can help people <malay>apa</malay> you can distribute your money away
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
~ness
<malay>tapi ni</malay> superpower <malay>bukan senyum</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(um)
(mmhmm)
(mm) but people need [what]
okay when you are rich you might not feel that [oh] money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
unlim~ when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to unli~ you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million [lah] not not like that [lah]
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
homeless <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know you build one condo just for homeless people in the world to live in <malay>macam gitu</malay>
no you should
(mm)
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
(err)
let them (err)
<malay>bayar sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>kira air dengan api semua bayar sendiri</malay>
<malay>tapi rumah tu</malay> maybe they difficult to <malay>beli</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay>
think <malay>dapat rumah tu</malay> free
it might be a si~ it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
those simple simple <malay>sudah</malay>
<malay>rumah</malay> just for them to live <malay>apa</malay> then after that
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
<malay>macam gitu</malay>
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
(mm)
no it's not unlimited <malay>duit</malay> for yourself
it's a
power
[ah]
[ah] where you can give to people
(uh huh)
becau~ okay because most of the villains in T_V and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
<malay>pun boleh juga</malay>
(mm)
but how
I think that [one] is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that (err) no need to work [lah]
because I can just live with the with the <malay>ubat</malay> and all
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that [eh] why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
<malay>orang</malay>
ya
(mm)
(mm)
magic <malay>lagi</malay>
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe (err)
(err)
(err) superman is boring [lah] or maybe the flash
or
(err) <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
<malay>siapa yang canggih sekarang lupa</malay> [ah]
(mm)
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
(uh)
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
(uh) superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
feminist <malay>ke dia</malay>
(mm) but the <malay>dia apa</malay> she's brought up in a feminist environment
(mm) (mm)
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
(mmhmm)
<malay>dia bukan tak boleh tua dia lambat tua</malay>
[ah]
<malay>mati</malay>
okay next
no no that [one] they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
ya I I <malay>tahu tapi</malay> from what I read is
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
<malay>orang</malay> clone so they <malay>tapi dia ingat macam</malay> [oh] this is actually the person <malay>tapi</malay> actually <malay>bukan</malay>
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one [lah] who will fight
wonder woman
(err) something like that [lah] the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
of the people in the past something like that <malay>macam gitu</malay> (err) <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [tau] [lah]
<malay>dah dah habis</malay>
<malay>dah habis</malay> film <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekarang tinggal</malay> production <malay>lambat saje keluar pasal</malay>
<malay>dia dia orang tengah kira-kira</malay> pros and cons of
(err) letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once [mah]
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
yes so they <malay>dia orang takut</malay> impact
stream
(mm) video on demand <malay>ke apa</malay>
apple T_V (uh)
<malay>lagi apa</malay> ya [lah] Netflix <malay>ke apa</malay> T_V all those [kan]
ya right
ya
apple apple [lah] the I
games movies <malay>ada</malay> you <malay>bayar untuk</malay>
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
(uh)
something like <malay>dia orang ada</malay>
<malay>dia orang dah ada dah</malay>
they don't have the mov~ new movies <malay>belum lagi berani</malay> [lah] go into this
they'll mov~ new movies will go into
that [one] produce by Netflix that's why they do that
but you those not produce by Netflix is those produced by Warner Brothers the they <malay>dia orang masih belum berani untuk</malay>
free
[ah]
so
<malay>macam tu kalau</malay> this [one] <malay>keluar</malay> movies
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
<malay>orang orang bayar untuk</malay> subscribe to Netflix to watch their movie
[ah] that's how they get their sub~ for themselves monthly subscription
(uh) this is how they fund their movies
<malay>dia punya tu</malay> advertisements <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>kalau dia orang buat letak kat tu</malay> people will unknowingly buy it [mah]
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
<malay>nak beli juga</malay> I
<malay>nak beli juga</malay> or maybe some merchandise or or <malay>apa</malay> I <malay>beli juga</malay>
that's how they make money [lah] it's not just
from the box it's not a traditional box office
sales you know
not just
<malay>bukan tu</malay> [jer] <malay>yang dia orang</malay> look for they look for streams they look for
(err) people new subscribers <malay>masuk</malay> people who
subscribe and (err) upgrade their
account
upgrade <malay>akaun dia orang</malay>
from one person only
<malay>boleh tengok</malay> to
three people or five people family <malay>punya</malay> account [ah] that's how they make the money
and also from the advertisement [lah] because for every movie <malay>mesti ada</malay> the sponsors <malay>siapa masuk</malay>
<malay>nak macam</malay> let's say Nike wants to be in in
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>macam gitu dia orang buat duit</malay>
let's say
<malay>dia</malay> promise
ya maybe <malay>dia dah</malay> promise
for like maybe <malay>dia nak tunjuk satu kopi</malay>
where your coffee maker say for every minute that you show me I will they will <malay>bayar</malay> a certain amount
of course they will show as much as possible but
or maybe they say that if you want me to be in you must I had must have a minimum of ten minutes
for every
movie <malay>macam gitu</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah]
they can they are they are free to pay any amount [mah] to produce that movie
producers need money and sponsors to come in also to to produce the movie
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] you you
you fast forward [eh] you
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>pasal tak tak dapat faham betul-betul cerita jalan cerita</malay>
but you will miss out on the details like
you will read about it
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>buang sampah</malay> I
<malay>siapa juga yang buat</malay>
okay <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> you you <malay>tengok</malay> movie <malay>tu sudah tidur</malay>

the sound that involves in each movie
might not
come out with
the same at every house
some people have surround sound but some people just have normal T_V
so they are the the problem is that sound that's coming out of the T_V
might not be the same setting
might be differ from house to house [lah] maybe that's the only problem [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> Netflix they set <malay>satu untuk semua</malay>
