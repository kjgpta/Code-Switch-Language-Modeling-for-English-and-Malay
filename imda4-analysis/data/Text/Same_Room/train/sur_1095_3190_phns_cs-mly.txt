<malay>balik</malay> time [ah] <malay>balik</malay> fetch her tuition
anyways (uh) ya you were saying <malay>apa tadi</malay> #afikah# <malay>pasal</malay>
(mm)
(mm) ya
[oh] okay
[ah] okay [lah]
okay
(oo) ya
[oh]
ya talking about her [ah]
(oo) that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story [ah] because (err)
something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got <malay>dia ada macam beberapa</malay> sample <malay>gitu</malay>
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing [lah] but the timing is also like (err) odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish [ah]
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early [lah] but sometimes
[ah] they go off or sometimes
when you work late [ah] you have to finish late [lah] you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back [ah]
not that bad [ah]
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back [lah] right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off [ah] something like that or
something like that [lah] alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is (err) I think
because in her team [kan] <malay>ada macam</malay> leader [tau]
so leader leader <malay>nak kena macam</malay> like
(err) <malay>macam</malay> leader <malay>macam</malay> (uh) if got <malay>macam</malay> the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier [lah]
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish [ah]
(err) I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know [lah] and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early [lah] to finish
so if this is a <malay>macam</malay> leader <malay>punya</malay> role [lah]
so <malay>tapi macam</malay> this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge [ah] you team leader
so they <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] got one one time <malay>tu</malay>
[eh] <malay>dia cakap dia</malay> she was in the toilet <malay>sekali ada</malay> this leader
[ah] and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking [ah] talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> like you know
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
so <malay>diorang cakap</malay> then the other lady was saying like (err) [eh] then you leave then how [ah]
then she [oh] then this [one] [ah] I will ask #sani# to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear [ah] [kan]
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out [ah] then after that she like go out [ah] then she like !alamak! !aiya! I like I also don't want [ah] to be leader you know
cause is like (err) say I also new say <malay>dia cakap</malay> like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is (uh) this indian lady [lah] older than her like master degree and all
but <malay>tapi dia macam</malay> I think the quiet type [lah] you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything [lah] [kan]
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
[oh] okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague <malay>pun macam</malay> like [eh]
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so <malay>tak</malay> maybe ya I don't know maybe <malay>tak</malay>
ex~
<malay>tak</malay> stand out properly I think ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this [one] because they are like contract [ah]
ya contract not perm~ staff
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay <malay>apa</malay> like you know at least you know the next job
you can s~ you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this [lah] you put in extra hours [lah] you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing [lah] it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like (err) worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
[ah] ya
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good [what] <malay>kita nak orang orang</malay> ya that's why
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit [ah] and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you [ah] #hani# [ah] #hani# can and
[ah] ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like (err)
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
so what was the painting <malay>yang</malay> painting <malay>tu dekat mana</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya so so what's what's what's going on <malay>dekat apa</malay> gillman baracks is that [ah] is there anything going on there and when the last time we went there for exhibition right

(uh)
<malay>sayang</malay>
okay where would they do they wear the the thing on
[oh] #bukit panjang#
moved #bukit panjang#
[oh]
ya [lah] <malay>dengar baik dengar</malay> they they say that now
(err) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] get the S_M_S <malay>sebab</malay> like
a lot of people looking for like (err) big property that's why I say
like your parents <malay>punya</malay> house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
there's the demand and whatever not you know
probably want to look into that [ah] I think but you know but then again (um)
and that's to you and your family [lah] you know
(mm)
ya but I remember that that day she said what and
(um) then the agent that time you say [oh] already see like that so
I'm not sure whether they want to revisit that again and over there
[oh] okay
ya
ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
so <malay>tanya</malay> [ah] your mum <malay>macam mana</malay>
give to
(uh huh)
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> you not there [what] you should be there I think you should be around [ah] like to hear like you know that time you were around right <malay>mencari</malay> sales whatever whatever right
ya
at least you
ya
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are <malay>dah tukar ke belum</malay>
<malay>kalau dia dah tukar</malay> what is changed you know
then from there
ya ya then from there then she <malay>cuma</malay>
like okay the next one okay so now !whoa! really really can sell then if sell then do what you know
(err) at least we know what is the option there [lah]
(mm) so I think what you are concerned that [one] <malay>dah macam</malay> like stage three stage four [lah] to sell like how to like
how fast you can sell that is the different right
now is number one <malay>kita nak tahu</malay> whether <malay>boleh</malay>
ya <malay>boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita</malay> belief that can <malay>jual</malay> also is is it really makes sense to <malay>jual</malay>
then if <malay>jual</malay> already then after that then
like you know what are you going to do next just gonna like you know (um) checkout or you're just (err) gonna like you know get a new one or what you know
ya I don't know
(mm)
so ya these are the I think the few things that (err) need to know upfront before we can (err)
and like decide on what to do <malay>kalau</malay> it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
then
if it's just like [eh] ya you can
