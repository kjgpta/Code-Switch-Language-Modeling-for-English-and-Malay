the sky was so clear it was so beautiful I remember crying
ya I was literally like tearing up because of how beautiful it was
it was super beautiful
ya but some people said (um)
they are away from the problems below
where they are high up you get what I mean
<malay>kau boleh jadi</malay> emirates <malay>punya</malay> [ah] emirates is it emirates
