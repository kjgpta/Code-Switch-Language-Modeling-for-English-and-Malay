<malay>empat</malay>
<malay>empat</malay>
<malay>dari dua ribu tahun pertama di universiti jadi agak-agak berapa lama tu</malay>
<malay>enam tahun</malay> !whoa!
[oh] okay
that's the part where we decide if we should get out or not right
<malay>ada</malay> contract

!hais!
<malay>jadi sudah sudah tujuh</malay> [eh] <malay>enam tahun</malay>
<malay>dah enam tahun</malay> !wow!
<malay>lagi satu tahun tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
<malay>soalan pertama apa dia</malay>
why don't you go first
(mmhmm)
yes the #bunny chow#
<malay>mengidam</malay> [eh]
(uh huh)
yes
ya and I feel like it was a new experience in terms of how they presented it
<malay>pasal pasal kita orang duduk tunggu makanan</malay> or the #bunny chow# <malay>tak tahu apa akan datang tiba-tiba</malay> it's a whole loaf of bread
a full loaf of bread and the top is cut
like like a like a hat it's like a hat like you take off the top
and then a pool of curry inside so it's like basically a loaf of bread with a hole inside and it's just curry
(mm)
ya ya and it was recommended <malay>ramai orang suruh</malay> order
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
yes yes
and it was a it was a weekday it was a normal weekday working day kind of thing
(mm) (mm) (mm)
yes we were very hungry
ya
ya and then I feel it's also the the service
[ah] <malay>cara dorang cakap dengan kita orang macam kawan gitu</malay> so <malay>kita orang saja</malay> [lah] <malay>tanya-tanya</malay> [eh] <malay>apa-apa yang sedap tak pernah</malay> try <malay>ini semua</malay>
<malay>terus</malay> (err)
<malay>apa nama dia pekerja dia suruh</malay> try #bunny chow# <malay>terus ada satu</malay> customer <malay>pun suruh kita orang</malay> try #bunny chow#
<malay>terus kita orang</malay> try [ah] ya <malay>ingat tak</malay> the customer
<malay>terus</malay> !wah! it it was the best decision we've ever made
yes we did but it was it was a day of of trying food it was a it was a food adventure day ya
yes
[oh] okay okay ya we tried the
steelers I think it was a local
burger joint but it was a
fast food
burger joint
ya
yes
ya <malay>kita nak makan banyak kira</malay> you know pros and cons <malay>kena</malay> give give in ya !oof!
and (uh) that was quite nice also
I felt
that was quite nice ya the burger cause before that <malay>sebelum tu kita orang</malay> try [ah] McDonald's
then K_F_C <malay>saja saja</malay>
<malay>saja nak</malay> try <malay>tengok</malay> country <malay>apa negara lain macam mana dorang punya</malay> [ah] McDonald's
<malay>tapi tak tak sedap sangat</malay> [lah] singapore <malay>punya</malay> standard <malay>terlalu tinggi saya rasa</malay>
[a'ah] I I <malay>boleh boleh rasa yang ini</malay>
<malay>ini bukan makanan yang patut di makan</malay>
like not like basically not healthy you know what I mean like you can tell it's not a proper meal you know like I shouldn't be eating this that kind of thing
ya
I forgot but but it it didn't it didn't stay in my mind cause after that we tried steelers and I was like !wow! a whole new experience ya
[ah] <malay>ye ye ye ye ye</malay>
ya
yes
not spicy
ya not not up to our standards our tongues
ya
just just another day
yes we did we did
ya our our spice game was
was really showing on during that trip like we really felt it
ya
ya so after that we tried steelers and that was good what else did we try that day or did we call it a day afterwards
I think we also went to this (err) the cake malay restaurant right cause they they have the in in
south africa they have their own malay community
<malay>jadi kita orang saja tengok apa apa ni</malay> plus <malay>kita pun orang melayu terus dengar kat sana ada ada</malay> community <malay>melayu juga</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kita ingatkan</malay>
<malay>walaupun</malay> (err) the history is different we thought we should at least try the food
<malay>makanan mesti ada mesti ada</malay> [ah] <malay>sedikit</malay> [ah] <malay>yang sama</malay> [kan]
[ah] so we went over there and tried
but I forgot what exactly did we try do you remember

(mm) was a thing it was a mixture of things
but it was interesting also
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
it's a different history and everything [lah]
different background
ya ya ya
(mmhmm) but it was interesting also to to experience that and sort of see the different variations I guess on the culture
(err) practise in different ways and then ya I think I think it was it was <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
is it #prata#
ya
(uh huh) (uh huh)
ya ya ya
!wow!
[oh] my god #bo-kaap# okay ya

ya I think I think the memories are coming back okay ya
[oh] [oh] I remembered inside it was a whole thing like inside there was fries and then there was there was <malay>daging</malay> and there was cheese it was
it was basically like
loaded in every ways
it was [oh] it was basically like #roti john# but they throw in (uh) fries also so ya and <malay>sayur</malay> also so it was like a whole meal with a
<malay>dengan</malay> ya I remember just taking one bite and felt like I just finished lunch

[ah]
[ah] <malay>ada tempat duduk</malay>

[ah] <malay>dah naik</malay> [a'ah]
it it was still a nice view nonetheless
<malay>dua jam mak</malay> [ah]
yes
yes
you know right
[oh] it is how it feels like if you live next to mountain and you just go up and down the mountain everyday like
like how I go #bukit timah# hill and I see all these random people run and run but actually they live next door right
[ah]
it was it was quite challenging sometimes
ya some parts we had to go down on all four do you remember there were like ladders and whatnot

[ah] <malay>permandangan cantik lepas tu</malay>
<malay>pun</malay> it was a it was quite cold I remember cause it was winter ya so it was
it wasn't that bad I felt like the whole experience felt very
good like surreal
ya
[a'ah] <malay>tu tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>angin dia kuat angin dia terlalu kuat sampai rasa macam</malay>
<malay>angin tu nak tolak kita orang</malay>
[ah] [a'ah]
[oh]
cause we were we were going around in circles like you know a hill and then naturally
eventually there's like one part where okay one part
the thing about cape town in terms of geographically is very interesting one side of the hill you are near the ocean the other side you are near the city
so when we were at the end that's near to the city it was quite hot
but the end near the ocean was quite windy so everytime we reach the hot side we were just <malay>jalan macam biasa saja-saja lepak sikit</malay>
<malay>terus sampai ke tempat yang terlalu sejuk tu tiba-tiba</malay> [ah] <malay>angin dia kuat tu tiba-tiba kita orang terus lari lari lari</malay> [eh]
[kan] that was an experience friend
(mm)
lion (uh huh)
[a'ah]
[a'ah] <malay>memang orang yang nak naik dorang pakai baju apa</malay> mountain gear <malay>tu semua ada yang</malay> stick <malay>panjang tu</malay> [ah] hiking stick <malay>dorang tengok kita macam apa pasal apa budak-budak ni kita orang saja</malay> [jer] <malay>jalan pakai pakai beg beg sekolah gitu</malay>
ya
ya ya but they they were had like the the bike gear on and
[ah] I remember when we got down the first thing we did was get a drink right do you remember
ya
and we just rest and reflect <malay>apa kita orang buat tadi</malay>
!wah!
ya we went quite ya damn early
(mm) (mm)
and then I remember technically we had time to explore but we were so tired
ya for one two hours then eventually we went out just to have a walkabout
ya
that was quite fun though
that was very fun
but I really want to go back just to see signal hill see like [ah] <malay>tak puas</malay> cause like
the the goal isn't there and then like sometimes I read up about cape town people talk about signal hill and I'm like
[oh] we haven't went
cause I I like
cause I was really curious I actually <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] video signal hill <malay>macam mana terus nampak tempat dia macam permandangan semua cantik ada apa orang duduk atas atas</malay> grass <malay>semua</malay> okay like I never said I didn't regret that experience it's just I really want to go signal hill next time
feel like we didn't accomplish that
okay sure I feel like we are
two zero

with a whole new list
I got I got #jio# one friend she she also malay okay we all <malay>melayu</malay> together
like the other day I was talking to her her name is #amisyah# and she's like I was like #amisyah# I really feel that we go somewhere it's for you ya I feel like you will enjoy it as much as I think and then she's like I did thought about it and I feel like I belong
and I'm like okay put it in the to-do list okay
before we die
yes
but my my friend has a stable job so it's just me [lah] which is fine

(um)
the cave
the cave
your favourite

ya
you guess that
ya ya ya
god damn it
!hais!
a time to be alive
what else did we do over there
I feel like okay I feel like
the trip was was a fun trip [lah] if I had to look back at the things that I've (uh) did in life I feel like that that will be one of my highlights
yes the highlight reel
before right before I die right
this is what you did
yes that's exactly
us getting stuck in the you and your getting stuck in the cave and all that right
gosh
that was an experience
okay
then what else
ya let's see another prompt
<malay>makanan makan</malay>
I want to learn how to draw
<malay>macam mana nak lukis</malay> just <malay>bukan lukis saja-saja</malay> [tau] <malay>macam lukis macam macam</malay> artist <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>macam boleh dapat kerja</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> graphic design [ah]
ya
ya I want to draw
cause I can't draw
okay <malay>pasal adik saya seorang</malay> artist <malay>jadi hari-hari saya di rumah saya boleh nampak yang</malay>
it's a certain skill [lah] that's already been presented to me a certain level of expectations of how an artist
should draw or the kind of level they should achieve which I can tell I am not at that level [ah]
so there's that so instead of a drawing I resort to colouring
I resort ya cause I I do like
(err) art in general so I'm like since I can't draw
then I'll just fill in the colours for them you know it's it's so
an artist right it it does gives me a pride and joy and happiness
ya yes
and I I feel like it also trains my (uh) colouring skills
cause that's also (uh) colour coordination is a very important skill
ya I mean for a wardrobe purposes
so ya
I think for me would be drawing
(mmhmm)
what about you
just one [ah]
can
[oh] !wow!
yes that's the way
okay
I [ah] I feel
I feel like the fact that it's on the you know ice it's a bit tricky
and different
okay
!wow!
[a'ah]
[oh] !wow!
kind of what
okay
(uh huh) [ah]
ya it will
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(uh) yes
did they die
[oh] gosh
okay ya
ya will be fun
so (uh) what else
two more skills
for me (um) other than drawing
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) swimming
I cannot swim and the other day I went to this this park with my friend and it was
it was at lakeside I was at lakeside
with my friend
and then I and then I remember [ah] my dear friend #wen xing# were walking at this
at this bridge bridge <malay>dia</malay> is a made of wood is a wooden bridge but naturally a wooden bridge can be a bit creaky
so I think she she she no no no she stepped on this a creaky wooden bridge and she panicked a bit and she was like I really thought I was gonna fall and I'm like
[oh] shit if you fall I'm gonna fall also cause we are stepping on the same wooden creak [eh] and I'm like and the first person is gonna die is me cause I can't swim
it's really during those moments I realised that I should really pick up swimming [lah] ya
but I know how to swim a bit like I know how to float like I'm aware like there's a certain way of of making sure that you stay afloat in water and I I at least learn up to that point [ah]
the (um) <malay>tahun lalu</malay> I went to #krabi# <malay>dengan kawan</malay> #krabi# okay
so naturally the activity is just go
beach hopping I don't why I thought it's okay to be honest
I I didn't regret why I even but when you think !wah! it's like !wow! this girl really spend a lot of money to go #krabi# when she doesn't swim or kayak so
I went to #krabi#
with my friend it's just the two of us and I remember before going I already told my friend A I don't swim and B I'm not a water person like I'm the kind where I can in the water but five minutes later I'm like
I'm bored leave me alone I'm just gonna sit at one corner and my friend is like ya that's fine I'm also the kind where you don't have to entertain me I can have fun by myself she she really is the typical (uh) suntanning beach kind of girl
so I'm like okay okay so the trip is really we just in our own personal space like
like people who people don't know we went together you know it's really we are all both in our own personal space
trip and then like I remember she really was having the time of her life you know like she really down there chilling like there was even one point I told her [eh] I'm bored
I'm gonna go back to the hotel which is like fifteen minutes away from the beach
and then she's like okay great and then I went to the hotel I took a nap
okay I took a nap for hours I wake up this girl is still not back
so cause it's just the two of us I the sister part of me is like [eh] shit she got kidnapped I die [sia]
like I will be responsible for that <malay>jadi jadi</malay> I remember after that I
like <malay>dah dah bangun dah dua tiga jam pergi balik</malay> to the beach check up on her she still sun tanning down there
<malay>tak</malay> no it was it was it was already like
seven P_M like she really just lie on the beach throughout that kind of thing then I just look at her and I'm like
okay can I didn't even know if I should go and say hi cause she was wearing a a sunglasses so I'm like I don't know if she's awake or she's not I don't know if she's gonna scold me ya I was like
you know I feel like I remember I played in the water again but five minutes later I'm bored
now what ya but ya I feel like (uh) if I could swim maybe I might I I I feel like definitely enjoy myself
I just feel like maybe I could have done more activities
ya
we didn't do we went the only water activity was the the beach hopping [lah] so
ya they just bring us to the beach and then they let us roam around for many hours
and I remember I was very fascinated by the fishes <malay>pasal dia punya air air dia</malay> clear [kan]
<malay>jadi boleh nampak ada banyak ikan warna-warni</malay>
banana boat <malay>ada tu ada</malay> [lah] but
ya and A and B I don't find banana boat interesting
ya
have [lah] but ya I also like (uh) and then my friend was also (uh)
I I think don't have I don't remember but I remember we went kayaking but the kayaking was very scary cause it's like
initially I thought that the kayaking would be
a a group activity I thought there will be a guide but instead they just give us the kayak and they were like do whatever you want
yes so it's
free do whatever and then they give us a map and they were like usually people circle here but ya do whatever you want just come back at this time and we we really just we tried to circle but even~ but eventually I remember we went okay the thing is <malay>kita orang dua bukan orang</malay> kayak
no okay it was in the middle of the ocean A okay B in the middle of the ocean okay
it's like it's like you you know how in #krabi# there's a lot of islands so one of the islands we did kayaking and then (err) this island is a bit small so the idea was to circle the island that's what they told us to do but I remember looking at my friend not gonna circle this stupid island
and then she's like
#nadi# stop being a spoilsport let's try then I'm like fine so we try
and then I remember okay <malay>mula-mula</malay> there were like a few there were a few family members okay so we started out with a group then eventually they went a certain way and then we just split and I I didn't care [lah] too much about that cause we we already had a plan cause me and my friend we thought we gonna circle like and halfway through
we realised that we were in the ocean alone like I looked around I don't see people I was like [eh] shit this is like I'm in the ocean alone and I can die and then
that's where all my anxiety thoughts come out while my friend being the typical girl who loves beach tanning was legit taking out her phone and taking selfies
then I'm just like
her name is #vishu#
I'm like #vishu# we gonna die then she's like can you stop being dramatic and I'm just like
I feel like okay the thing I love about hanging out with #vishu# is I always tell people she's my number one hater I mean everytime I tell her my like all this problems she's like
shut up okay she legit she pushes me down there and then I don't know like I like remember cause she's an accountant so I will always complain about how I don't know how to calculate this money and she will just tell you're stupid I know that kind
so
this is our relationship it's really her telling me over [oh] I'm stupid and then I'm just like okay you're right I agree I am stupid
so throughout the whole trip I will just be panicking and she's down there [eh] no we are fine okay I'm not gonna die and then she and then I'm like okay but if I
if I drown then are you gonna save me and then she's like no
then she's like I thought you can take care of yourself
that's the thing okay so
I remember like I did panic a bit but eventually I managed to calm down and then we went we went to
(uh) the big shore
so there was this random beach in a thing and then we went to the shore and we chill for like
again five minutes
cause we we we after five minutes like I'm bored so we went back but I remember throughout the whole trip that whole kayaking I kept telling myself I'm not gonna do this ever again and that was really my last kayak up till now cause like in singapore
there's certain places you can kayak right <malay>kalau kita orang nak kita orang boleh bayar</malay> [lah] but anyway <malay>gi</malay> kayak <malay>dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>tahu tapi kawan-kawan</malay> I <malay>semua suka benda gini jadi dorang kata kat</malay> marina barrage <malay>ada kat</malay> lakeside <malay>pun padahal ada</malay>
[ah] cause (err)
ya marina barrage ya ya and then
(err) I a few people have #jio# me I have one friend who has the actual kayak lessons so she has told me many times don't worry if you drown I I will save you
and then I looked at her face and I'm like thank you for you trying to act this is a superhero movie but it's okay
I will I will tap out of this korean drama moment
maybe I feel like the the swimming will help the the fear of the sea cause a lot of my problem is afraid of the sea but I feel like the fear of the sea stems from the fact that I can't swim
ya [lah]
ya ya ya
ya
ya I I actually (uh) <malay>baru belajar macam mana nak</malay> float <malay>masa kat</malay> #krabi# because (err)
I <malay>suruh</malay> ya I <malay>suruh kawan saya</malay> [ah] <malay>ajar macam untuk</malay> sorry [lah] [eh] #vishu# teach me how to swim then she tell me I teach you how to float
always doing the bare minimum
always doing the
ya yes
good enough okay <malay>jaga diri sendiri</malay>
more you already say live one another alone
<malay>ye</malay>
ya ya !wah! I I really want to go okay I
I I think after the trip I went with her to vietnam to vietnam
I went vietnam when I went there right
she ya we went mountain !wah! that [one] was another [one] cause she cause I've known her for quite some time so she knows all my problems all my problems
so before we go out on the mountain trip she already told me [ah] #nadirah# <malay>jangan lupa bawa apa bawa gula-gula ke apa pasal</malay>
<malay>kalau tak nanti</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti penat pengsan kau dah</malay> [lah] <malay>selalu pengsan kau jangan</malay>
ya <malay>bawa gula bawa apa</malay> protein bar <malay>ke apa</malay>
and I remember I tell her confidently don't worry I can take care of myself sis
don't worry thank you for reminding me though
I'm like !aww! <malay>tak aku tak bawa</malay>
<malay>aku terus lupa</malay> cause naturally
on the way up cause okay <malay>naik naik gunung tu dalam dua hari</malay>
<malay>dua hari kita orang kita orang naik atas lepas tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>kita orang ada bayar</malay> guide [lah] <malay>untuk bawa kita orang ke atas</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dorang ada</malay> [ah] <malay>ada tempat-tempat tidur</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> this small kind of chalet there was even campfire kind of thing
<malay>terus ada makanan dorang masakkan</malay>
<malay>jadi memang dorang betul-betul betul jaga</malay> [kan] <malay>kita orang</malay> [lah] <malay>dua hari naik turun naik</malay> [eh] <malay>naik ada</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang ada hujan juga pasal</malay> time <malay>tu macam</malay> june june <malay>daerah kita orang daerah</malay> southeast asia [kan] monsoon season [kan] [ah] [ah] <malay>terus ada kadang-kadang hujan pun kena</malay> stop <malay>apa semua</malay> and then I remember there were certain point where
(err) I was very tired cause I have low blood sugar low blood pressure
so after if I don't have enough food after a certain time [ah] my blood pressure will dip and then I will faint
and then during that period
my dear my dear #vishu# looked at me and do you bring your sweets
and I said no
then she rolled her eyes and then I'm like I'm sorry for letting you down again
and then and then I remember on this trip it wasn't just the two of us she brought along two other friends her two other friends looked at us what's this tension what's going on
I like
but really it was like
don't worry #nadi# I got this I know you very well she took out she got protein bar and okay okay #vishu# is a fitness freak okay so her protein bar isn't like from seven eleven kind protein bar is those expensive shit kind of protein bar that you need to order online kind of thing
so she give me her protein bar then I like A her protein bar tastes great but B I like shit I I swear I ate her her expensive shit a part of me is like okay I am a burden so yes
but I remember that one trip is like everytime I need a sweet I just look at her like this
then she will take out from her bag and she will like roll her eyes and take out from her bag
ya then she did that but then I remember <malay>macam</malay> the whole trip she was like I told you to bring
I like sorry
but ya I remember ya in the end we reach the top and that was that was really interesting cause there was actually
A cable car up but obviously we didn't take the cable car okay and B I remember
[ah] <malay>dari bawah naik tapi masa kita orang</malay>
<malay>lima belas minit</malay>
(mmhmm)
but I remember that
like <malay>lima belas</malay> twenty
it wasn't that long [lah] it was quite long also
ya but I remember at the top of the mountain there's a temple cause we're at vietnam and they believe (err) buddhist country most of them believe that
the higher you are to the sky the closer you are to heaven in thailand also I remember one of the mountains were like that but anyway
it's like if you there you see the statue is like <malay>besar gila</malay> so the only thing that came to my head is how did they bring all these stones up
it it look like they you go google is like a hole big ass buddha statue at the top like it's like way big like it was a giant-sized kind of thing ya
<malay>entah tak tahu</malay>
but ya that was the only thing [lah] I was just like !whoa!
how did this work there was no cable car then
how
ya I don't know I just find it interesting [lah] but ya [lah] then I remember after the trip we basically we <malay>kita orang</malay> tour from the north
to the south of vietnam so after a few days we spent one or two days in one country then we will take a bus ride to the next [eh] not not country
the city <malay>dalam satu dua hari naik bas terus pergi negeri lagi satu macam gitu</malay> and just get moving down down down all the way to #ho chi minh# kind of thing
and then I remember in the beginning it was [ah] there were four of us
halfway through the other two
her her friends had to go back to singapore cause [ah] they
they had other plans [lah] okay
ya
no [lah] no me and #vishu# are cool okay it's just that people people who are not friends with us will find it weird cause we really like talk to one another very <malay>kasar</malay> like but we are actually damn cool with one another like we understand one another and our boundaries and whatnot and then [ah] after that (err)
ya and then I remember halfway through it was just me and her [lah] ya and then when it was me I know it was more chill cause like initially when there was four people I have nothing against them [lah] but <malay>agaknya pasal tak tak kenal jadi</malay>
naturally when I go with a group I feel like everyone should have a good experience so I always like ask [oh] <malay>kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa kau nak buat apa</malay> then I figure out what is the best thing to do but then there was one girl who always had a lot of issues
then everybody like cause okay firstly it wasn't supposed the whole trip <malay>bukan</malay> holiday holiday [tau] the whole trip was supposed to be a backpacking trip so naturally there are limitations in terms of the place we stay and you know [ah] like you cannot be too luxurious [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay> too suspicious
of everyone too unsure like should we do this should we not
that kind of thing <malay>terus aku ajar naik</malay> motor cause <malay>aku boleh naik</malay> motor [kan] <malay>terus dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau orang</malay> catch <malay>kita orang tak ada</malay> license <malay>macam mana terus aku macam</malay>
<malay>siapa nak</malay> catch <malay>kau</malay> [sia]
ya <malay>aku</malay> realised just okay <malay>siapa nak</malay> catch <malay>kau kalau kau rasa kau takut sangat kau naik belakang aku</malay> [lah] <malay>apa-apa jadi aku ada</malay> license then I was like <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kau takut banyak</malay>
<malay>sana punya orang punya</malay> license <malay>pun</malay> [a'ah] <malay>dorangnya</malay> license <malay>pun</malay> questionable [kan]
[a'ah]
<malay>lepas tu macam nak try makanan makanan dia kalau macam suara dia lain sikit dia pun takut dia macam macam</malay> like some of the food were were like crocodile meat ya
just like okay I feel like okay if you don't want to try then don't try [lah] like I don't know she will like says [ah]
and she will complain complain a bit a bit unsure [eh] maybe we don't do this maybe we don't do that I tell you like
like [eh] [ah] [oh] <malay>terus pasal dia punya kakak pernah datang</malay> vietnam <malay>jadi dia</malay> based her own experience <malay>dari situ dia kata kakak</malay> I <malay>kata macam gini gini gini tapi masalah dia kakak dia satu orang kalau dia bilang aku yang dia</malay> survey <malay>seratus orang boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>aku aku dengar aku dengar apa dia kata tapi kakak dia</malay> [kan] <malay>satu orang</malay>
like you can't based your experience your you know all your options on one person's experience that kind of thing so I remember feeling very like
like okay since you're uncomfortable then we won't do it [lah] cause of that we already have no options and to begin with we already had limitations in the first place
<malay>dia bukan cabut dia macam</malay> okay
[a'ah] plan <malay>dia memang</malay> until that time <malay>jadi</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal ada dua budak ni satu lelaki lelaki tu</malay> chill <malay>aku dengan dia kita orang jadi</malay> good friends <malay>terus habis tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> halfway through <malay>kena pergi</malay> laos
<malay>untuk</malay> internship
so it's a thing in their they are all accounting students so basically throughout the trip I didn't calculate anything it was my dream it was like suck at math like everyday I just look at look at my team of accountants like what's up guys so
I didn't remember [ah] ya so the boy like it was quite interesting though when we go on the trip cause they really like !wah! their calculations damn fast they look like they never speak they already can tell you okay this is not worth it they walk off I like what is going on but I trust all of you
then like okay [oh] I remember
[ah] <malay>kita kena fikir</malay>
<malay>kita orang kena</malay> calculate you know <malay>kat depan tu</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>dorang tak payah dorang tengok dorang okay tak payah tak payah aku macam apa ni apa tengah terjadi</malay> <malay>tapi dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>ikut</malay> [jer] ya

[ah] <malay>tak payah lama-lama</malay> [lah] okay [lah] that was that was a good experience I made a friend and I in the trip which is the boy and then the other girl I completely cut ties afterwards ya <malay>tak payah</malay> there's no reason anyway then ya I I learnt that apparently a lot of people in that class find it difficult to get along with her [lah] ya
and then I ask #vishu# then why you #jio# and then #vishu# was like you know I okay with travelling with everyone I always travel with you [mah] then I'm like shut up [lah] don't compare me to her but it's
ya that was it but that was a fun trip I had a lot of fun I was talking to #vishu# the other day we need to go somewhere else like after this border closed like this border thing
ya and she's like okay on
ya but I remember I went where [ah] ya #krabi# and vietnam with her
it's [oh] ya we keep saying we want to go somewhere malaysia nearby cause (uh) our our clique is actually with this two other like one of this (uh) basically the two of them they have a a very (uh) (err)
tight-knit families
who are unsure if they travel too far

other friend the other day another friend I was saying that we should go indonesia
