bro <malay>aku</malay> #frus# [ah] bro
what happened did you watch the game last week the okay okay okay okay okay okay fine I watch the man U game and I also watch liverpool game <malay>aku punya bingit</malay> which man U game the one with crystal palace [ah]
ya (err)
K K K admittedly <malay>macam macam budak-budak</malay> [ah] <malay>macam main dengan</malay> boy look look at look at #wilfried# freaking #zaha# what he what he did to us and what he could have been for us but no thanks to
no thanks to david #moyes# we sold him back to crystal palace and look bit us back (um) bit our hand back
<malay>geram</malay> [seh] then then and then this whole freaking transfer window where we are talking about #gareth bale# and #sergio aguero# and and #thiago#
and you associated with all of them
but [oh] look <malay>dia pun</malay> sign the only work
the like one of the two world class players available
for like twenty five million and we bought harry maguire for eighteen million
ya [ah] the the cause
what what what did he say cause he doesn't know enough about #thiago# he doesn't know enough about a person who's playing in #barcelona# central midfield who's playing the champions league week in week out
and he says he doesn't know and this guy says he has a bunker iPad bunker with a full football knowledge database <malay>pakai</malay> football manager <malay>semak</malay>
I can't believe [sia]
david #moyes# <malay>kat mana dia baru lawan</malay> #arteta# last week
he fought against his captain and he lost
west ham [a'ah]
when did they ever not lost okay [ah] to be honest I don't care about the other fish in the ocean [ah] but but the west ham game was interesting for me cause I just wanted to see how
#arteta#
plus minus [ah] plus minus [ah]
[eh] but but honestly speaking I think liverpool gonna <malay>angkat</malay> again [ah] the <malay>korang punya</malay> the only thing you all needed was that was exactly that that guy in the middle who can keep things simple and can also do the spectacular #thiago#
<malay>dia punya</malay>
he knows his a level above everybody else [ah] no but but K you know there's this two theories of
(err) two types of players football theory [eh] two types of players one is the control player one is the chaos player and then there's in in amongst the current modern managers [kan]
[ah] the likes of
#guardiola#
and #pochettino# and #martinez# and and brendan rodgers they come from the louis #van gaal# [ah] #ajax# school of control at where
okay if I could if I could describe it this way louis #van gaal# is a scientist in in in that sense cause
ya no but (err) no you had you have to look beyond the partisanship let's just look at it from academic perspective [ah] okay (err)
he treats everything as available you control all the rest then you can tweak the variable and you can manipulate the variables no
so his main code word is control that's why when he breaks up the training he breaks up into the unit meetings or defence unit meetings midfield unit meetings attacking unit meetings and all of the eleventh place at any one point only three players are allowed to be creative the rest all control players
okay so the more variable you can control the more you can dominate the opponent [ah]
he does basically [ah]
there's no such thing as chance okay there's no such thing as chance chance happens cause you allow it to happen [ah] in other words so this kind that's that's why the possession thing cause me to play hard though if you have the ball the opponents have the ball it's the school louis #van gaal# school of control
wait then then I have the flip side [ah] the flip side is you eden clock eden clock
is the direct opposite of that he okay usually #merino# takes everything that is strong about louis #van gaal# and finds the witnesses so like louis #van gaal# takes
the ball without the ball you cannot do anything correct if you have the ball the opponent cannot score and we shift the opponent around cause they have to keep chasing after the ball
using #merino# flips that upon his head he controlled the ball he controls the match without the ball so he push them into different parts of the pitch which are harmless so that's the typical people have possession you always have to keep the horseshoe U-shape thing [ah]
from passing from right to left left to right cause you can break through the middle so that's how josie monaco dominates without the ball like the #barcelona# against #inter milan# <malay>punya</malay> game [ah] #barcelona# [ah] [eh] sorry (um)
bionic #inter milan# game where they only had seventy eighty percent possession and but #inter milan# won three main
reject the balls
correct he actively gets rid of the ball cause he his theory is (err)
the the one who wins the match is the one who makes the most the one who lose the match the one who makes the most mistake and the one who has the ball makes the most mistake that's #mourinho#
correct so basically people control the ball and he play a low block
the moment they make mistake there's miles and miles of space out there then he go on the counter break he has been quoted saying it's the person who does not make use of the counter attack is stupid cause it's a very powerful tool okay
that is still within the control manager kind of thing
same school but two sides of the coin [ah]
clock is totally different clock is from the chaos school of mentality the control player will be like someone like michael kerrick #zambia lonso#
(err) (err) schools that kind of control #zavi iniesta# chaos player
I the chaos manager is is what clock came from his school he doesn't #van gaal# doesn't like instincts that's why he always takes people he always tell people take one one step of the ball control the ball then shoot you will berate anyone <malay>yang terus</malay> shoot the ball [tau]
okay so cause he wants the control he's
players would act on instinct he cannot trust okay so (err) he wants them to think and get it repetitions so become muscle memory okay but clock he wants instinct that's exactly reason why #van gaal# and #cryuff# although there are come from the same school they're very different cause
#cryuff# emphasise more on individual creativity #van gaal# is strictly team organised by team
clock from the chaos part
he wants passion he wants instinct cause he believes that people at their best when they're in the zone when they're full blood rush rush to the head they have the extra ten per cent edge over the rest they have that ten percent inspiration overdress so
just whack and and
in football team the teams are in the weakest in the transition period so when the first phase second phase third phase forth phase
correct there's a transition period and that is that's when you lose your shape and you have not enough time to recover back into a different transition so that is
what #mourinho# exploits that is what clock clock exploits except that clock
pushes that to the limit he wants that to happen all the time that's why the high pressing
[ah] basically he wants the bag for of the opponent to <malay>kelam kabut</malay> he lose the ball there
then the distance travelled to the goal is very little okay so that's why he push up very high where but the distance is little but then you have less space to manoeuvre [ah] #mourinho# he lived the gap behind more space to manoeuvre more space to exploit
ya but #klopp# he he demands the intensity and that <malay>kelam kabut</malay>
opposites outside of the spectrum for one #klopp#
he
#klopp# denies his space
yes
correct for
swan
[oh] sun sun sun sun sun sun sun [ah] whatever [lah] <malay>melayu</malay> swan <malay>melayu</malay>

okay
so you are talking about <malay>macam</malay> child molesting kind of
movies
okay
okay okay talking about children [eh]
okay talking about children <malay>aku baru berbual dengan bini aku</malay> a few days ago okay I I don't subscribe to Netflix cause I have an app which can get all nets~ netflix movies or shows for free
[eh] you fall you know it could be a someone sign for me up an account so anyway (err)
okay <malay>bini aku</malay>
!ee! like when my it can be installed in my phone [ah] not just an Android box
it's an app~ [ah]
<malay>aku ada</malay> Android box T_V but also the smart T_V <malay>pun</malay> can install there
[ah] you can install on smart T_V Android box
as long as it's Android it can be installed [ah] in other words whatever the physical shape
it's an app~ [ah]
okay so <malay>bini aku</malay> past few days we're talking about this she mentioned this Netflix thing [tau] about how
(uh) in the last week or last few days <malay>alih-alih macam</malay>
their reporting
(err) people who are un-subscribing from Netflix are at an all time high
[ah] or
yes cause of the cuties it's cause (err) (err)
cause they're controversy people are boycotting cuties and <malay>apa</malay> okay [ah] to
quote yahoo news or something it's it's at a multi year high the level of substitution cause of this duties thing [ah] and <malay>kau kau tahu</malay> the controversy behind it
okay
alright so on on the surface level [eh] on the surface level is like [ah]
this de-sexualisation of minors [kan] <malay>selalunya</malay> I would say [kan] <malay>syaiton</malay> slowly <malay>syaiton</malay> is slowly inserting his influence on these things [ah]
desensitising us to sexualisation so
but (err) you know I I didn't even look trailer I just look at the freaking post and yell what the heck you don't even they are twins <malay>budak-budak ni</malay> they are just
ten eleven years old [kan]
eleven years old not wearing [ah] so
ya it's like in other words it's like my
it's my niece [ah] ones from that age right now so I feel it's freaking sick and you you it's creepy when you detach yourself from that film but into the real world [tau] <malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] the fact that
they are kids and the fact that are adults who actually suggesting these two kids [ah] and the fact that the kids have parents who agree for them to be dressed like this and act in something like this the fact their parents allow them to act and wear things like this being surrounded by adults
who are videographers cameraman directors and all the extra films on set all the extra on set
and these kids are growing up and thinking this is normal they might even enjoy the attention in real world consequences [eh]
and then you have the goal of the director <malay>nama dia macam</malay> sounds a muslim #maimunah# the cold or something <malay>dia dia dia macam</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] one of the subject people from france <malay>punya</malay> territories [ah]
but ya from breaking free from the traditions of senegal <malay>ini</malay> [kan] but that's that's the thing she she's justifying it by saying like [oh] it's a coming of
age story about breaking free from tradition and going against the patriarchy or against oppressive culture that kind of thing [lah] that's the justification [ah] so she said you're looking at the superficial thing but you're not looking at the message by the film
philosophical question does the end justify the means if that is your message but in the message you are actually causing some people some children real world [ah] mental or psychological damage by getting to dress like this in order to act a character like that in behaving in front of T_V people
<malay>aku nak tahu ni</malay> who who who was there even a was there a casting couch for this thing who's the person who who vetted through all this girls and look through <malay>budak-budak sebelas tahun macam</malay>
it's not a sleazy casting call [ah]
(mm) (mm)
kevin spacey serious
he's he plays like nerdy character <malay>macam</malay> he himself looks like
cut off like that [ah] controversial
better for him to keep his mouth shut rather than act moral
(mm)

saul goodman and the point in time when say screw this I just want to embrace who I am [kan] (uh) we still holding up a from certain point of views you ask
he's not wrong per se which is not legally wrong <malay>tapi</malay> is
morally ambiguous [ah] but but but ya that that transition to its when when it starts to get really engaging [tau] when you put yourself in and ask yourself
<malay>aku rasa</malay> three [ah] three three to four [ah] then (um)
then you see how brothers three each other and everything [ah] so <malay>kau dah tengok dia punya abang</malay> treat <malay>dia macam mana</malay>
