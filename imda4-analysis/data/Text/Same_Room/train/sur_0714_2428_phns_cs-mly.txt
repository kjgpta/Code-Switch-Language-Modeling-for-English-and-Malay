with the premium ya because [ah] last friday we eat
but we manage to only go for one round and the food like the person just stack the whole thing up you know the black premium seoul garden <malay>punya</malay> [kan]
then the person <malay>buat lepas tu kita punya jiran dekat sebelah</malay>
was looking at us
then <malay>macam</malay> judge us all the way [sia]
[sia] that [one] serious [sia]
but I don't care [lah] just like for for me it's like it's okay [lah] judge judge us all you want [lah]
I I as long as I get my food I'm happy

any medical site <malay>dekat sana tak</malay>
<malay>pass sini</malay> S_U_S_S

but what course that they have
I want to be <malay>cikgu</malay> [lah]
<malay>aku nak jadi cikgu melayu</malay> [lah]
B_A <malay>boleh jadi</malay> teacher <malay>belajar pun belajar</malay> part time part time science <malay>dah</malay> science <malay>lepas tu belajar</malay>
ya
why
no I have no patience in that
wet wipe <malay>tu kat depan tu</malay>
<malay>nak pinjam tadi</malay>
but I'm taking pharmaceutical science so what course I can get [ah] let me check [ah]
<malay>ada ke</malay> nursing
S_U_S_S
ya
yes I can psycho you
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
application fee [ah]
this [one] in any any diploma you can get right
okay
why
then <malay>buat</malay> [lah]
<malay>jap aku tengah cari</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [ah] how to apply
[ah] july admission and then I should take july intake
I think by the time by the time you graduate from your diploma [ah] when april or july itself
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
ya by the time july <malay>dah boleh</malay> just nice [lah] to apply <malay>sekolah</malay>
[eh] why so good can use P_S_E_A account
!yay!
how much you left
how many thousand
!huh!
but how much you left left balance when you when you apply T_P
[eh] then where the rest how come your P_S_E_A account
but R_P wasn't that much right
the one that you do full time
my god but it's like [oh] so you left I thought [oh] you left like two thousand
[ah] e-application fee is sixty four dollar twenty cents
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>mana</malay> part <malay>tu tempat tadi</malay>
(mm)
to begin this we view the application guide let's submit your application
ya inclusive of G_S_T
because <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh)
because mine I got around I think fifteen K I I thought I got eight K only [eh]
[ah]
but by the time you working you already working full time [what] they should
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
I go I_T_E then I go to but is under private [what]
consider
(hmm)
psychology [lah]
<malay>aku pada</malay> that time <malay>memang aku nak ambil</malay> psychology <malay>apa</malay>
so that that [one]
that pharmaceutical science is much more <malay>susah</malay> than psychology [sia] actually
ya because my friend said that they you have to <malay>halal</malay> [tau] like legitly <malay>halal</malay> and #rizal#
[ah] sister
(uh) said that the thing is going to be a bit more
I don't know she said it's much much I think it's difficult
(mm)
<malay>macam mana nak tengok macam mana nak tengok dia punya</malay> school [ah] how much is the course
(mmhmm)
how come forty and above is six thousand plus only
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
this [one] should get for him
<malay>dah tua</malay> [tau] <malay>nak mampus kena kerja</malay> [eh]
<malay>ini</malay> basic degree [jer] [kan]
it's just a basic degree so basic [jer]
the bas~
(mm) (mm)
[oh] okay [lah] just nice
so I don't need I don't need to pay extra
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya I think I'm prepared for this
okay [lah] at least at least I just need to ask him to
pocket up the money
so I can get married [seh]
okay [lah] as long he he support we support each other I think shouldn't be any problem [lah]
<malay>cuma nak kena tahan sabar dengan dia punya perangai</malay> which is
he will blue tick me when he is busy
and he will get back to me later
it's not [ah] because
for me I understand that he's working because for me he still even though he's busy he will get back to me
after that so okay
I don't like to control him also [lah] it's like it's your
you are big enough to know what's what is right what is wrong [ah]
so there's no need for me to keep on telling you
this and that okay you're not a five year old boy that I can just like <malay>macam nak kena bilang kau</malay> [oh] you <malay>tak boleh buat gini</malay> you <malay>tak boleh buat gitu</malay> okay you're not a five year old kid okay
[ah] so for me you should know your courtesy and you should know [what]
what is right for you what is wrong for you [lah]
<malay>macam tu</malay>
<malay>dah besar panjang</malay> [kan] <malay>dah tua dah tua bangka</malay> [kan]
<malay>dah beruban pun</malay>
[kan]
[eh] when you complete your diploma that time
my friend said that you guys can just you get a one thousand dollar plus back [eh]
(mm)
they score right
ya that's why
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)

<malay>tengah hari</malay>
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(mm) okay
I long time never walk already [leh]
(mm)
is this the only course that they have
I don't know I should take counselling or should just take psychology this question be the best
biomedical <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] engineering but (ugh)
no it's not
[ah] to challenge myself
because somebody said I have no life so ya
#rizal#
(mmhmm)
I just give her the look
just give him the look you see you wait you wait [ah] until I do diploma you shut up also
just to shut his mouth [ah]
sorry [ah] my critical thinking is way better than him okay
in a way
(mm) someone with depression [ah]
no
because I myself is already mental health problem
I got
I got anxiety
[ah] it happens
no but in a way the doctors
can see that I have a very bad I have a very bad anxiety when when I lost my mum
the counsellor the counsellor actually saw saw it happen
so it's like no no no I don't need a hug
ya so that what happen when I have psychology problems then eventually slowly I'll get get out of it
then sometimes it came [lah] but it just
sometimes when it came [ah] when it <malay>datang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam kau tak tahu</malay> [tau] <malay>macam kau tu tu tu cam rasa sawan gitu</malay>
you start to gag
you start to <malay>macam</malay> you feel that <malay>macam</malay> the bad energy coming
so [ah] there's this one point of time I think [ah] #rizal# saw it a few times
because when we (um)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>aku buat</malay> [eh]
I just talk to him <malay>macam biasa</malay> [tau] <malay>nanti</malay> at that all sudden I will start crying
I will just start crying
then it's either that
or I will start to have gag reflex
ya
[ah]
but it only comes like <malay>macam</malay> if really really I'm really under a lot of stress
(mm)
but right now <malay>dah</malay> random [lah] because I think because I'm busy with work
but I partly I will be a bit stress [lah]

after her is me (uh) before before her is me
no #rizal# only know
I was in the logistic duty [lah] <malay>aku angkat berat</malay>
so <malay>aku</malay> I didn't realise I didn't realise I was pregnant also at that point of time
until (uh) my period came a bit earlier
which it came with very
a lot a lot a lot of blood
and I was so tired
<malay>uzur dah tak datang</malay> the <malay>kelakar</malay> part was the <malay>uzur datang</malay> still <malay>datang</malay>
(uh huh)
(mm) so <malay>bila</malay> part <malay>aku uzur tu</malay> I was like <malay>macam</malay>
feel weird [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I don't I don't feel anything I feel a bit weird [lah]
but then <malay>sekali bila</malay> part <malay>yang</malay> the first blood clot <malay>jatuh tu takde pape</malay> [tau] the second time <malay>malam tu bila</malay> part <malay>aku tengah nak tukar</malay> pad [kan] then I saw one small little <malay>kat dalam</malay>
then then I realised I got miscarriage [ah] then my friend I was asking my nur~ nurses friend [ah] then my friend said I think yours will be around five to six weeks
already
already five to six old but how you feel right now <malay>aku cakap</malay> I was very tired [lah] I sleep the whole I mean the whole two days I sleep [sia] during my period
<malay>anak</malay> ya in a way [ah]

it's a very good condition
then got then then my friend was like telling me [lah] actually you are you did had miscarriage
if you saw that little photos means you <malay>dah</malay> miscarriage already
I don't dare I was I
I don't know whether I want to cry or I want to
I want to like I mean shocked
because I didn't know that I was pregnant
and I was in on logistic duty <malay>aku tengah angkat berat lagi</malay> I didn't know that I was having a baby inside inside my tummy
(mmhmm) <malay>aku</malay> went into that very like
[ah]
loving that person right
but in a way <malay>bila aku</malay> realise <malay>apa</malay> [tau] <malay>aku tak boleh salah</malay> [kan] <malay>diri aku sorang</malay> [tau]
it's like you didn't expect it to happen [what]
