urgent matter
urgent matter should be jamming soon
<malay>lama gila</malay> #dok#
<malay>aku rasa</malay> the last <malay>kita</malay> jam before circuit breaker <malay>atau</malay>
<malay>kita tak</malay> jam <malay>terus lepas balik yang</malay> vietnam <malay>punya</malay> show <malay>lama lama gila lama gila babi</malay>
like <malay>semua semua</malay> put on hold [lah] okay [lah] but at least other bands <malay>macam ada</malay> jam [ah] like space ya quite active [lah] like no cause we also we we also
finishing up our E_P [what]
but then not jamming it's more of mixing but that one also would be like on friday on like
(err) friday night [ah] he
like take some time off just to do the mixing [lah] but I think cause that time we prioritise on that first [lah] cause <malay>dah lama gila</malay> [seh] like hold back <malay>kita punya</malay> recording
so
<malay>entah tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dah habis</malay> [ah] <malay>dah habis</malay> mix <malay>dah habis</malay> finally <malay>habis</malay> [ah] like <malay>dah</malay> #swee# [ah] <malay>tinggal hantar</malay> mastering then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> we still finding for for people [lor] (um)
don't know finding the for the best deal expensive [sia] like mastering
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] (err) overseas [ah]
<malay>tapi tak tahu</malay>
<malay>tak tahu dorang boleh dapat</malay> sound <malay>dia ke tak</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> #haji hussin# <malay>boleh</malay>
(err) [oh] <malay>tu dia punya</malay> mixing mastering suite [eh]
<malay>tak nanti nanti aku berbual dengan dorang</malay> [ah] try to talk to them we also finding [ah] we will be sitting down
ya I heard [ah] I heard but I will sit down and talk to them see cause we still need to sit down and discuss about the design cause we planning to release like song by song [ah] instead not like all one shot [ah] on spotify [ah]
I don't know [ah] that's the plan [ah] I follow only cause I think the the whole idea of song by song is like at least you know scared like <malay>kita</malay> release <malay>macam</malay> all one shot [kan] <malay>nanti macam</malay> people get bored easily [ah] like [ah] so <malay>kita punya</malay> style <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] I mean is four songs only <malay>apa</malay> it's not it's not like a whole album [lah] if whole album then
planning [ah] there's also the plan to do a video clip [ah]
but but don't know [eh] (err)
what what's the whole concept [ah] you know what I mean the whole concept of the E_P is <malay>macam</malay> is all (err) is is interconnected [ah] is like (err) is like (err) <malay>macam</malay> a story [ah] from song number one to song number four
[ah] yes concept album so <malay>semua macam</malay> interconnected [ah] there's a story to it [ah]
so <malay>kita</malay> plan <malay>macam</malay> release song by song right then every song <malay>ada</malay> different artwork
so the artwork will end up with one whole piece of artwork that is all relatable [ah] (err) so
ya [lah] that's the plan [lah] but we need to sit down and talk again [lah] cause also budget [lah] budget we of course to do video like this must have you know (err)
budget [ah] see what kind of concept [lah] then also must pay for mastering (err) then we use up some money also for for our recording and all so but then we'll see [ah] we'll see how it goes [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah] <malay>pelan-pelan kayuh</malay> [ah]
well okay [lah] at least moving [lah] you know cause we were we were stuck [ah] cause of the circuit breaker [ah] cause we were already in the process already
mixing during before circuit breaker like really
(uh) most likely will be #wan# G [lah]
in-house [ah] better [ah] cause he cause he understands the song or if not we try to
I mean like me #hanis# #akid# sit we sat down and talk we we say maybe we can call #zaki# [lah] #zaki# ex-member [pe] so at least he kind of have the same feel of the band [lah] [ah] but see how [ah] if he is interested [ah] if not then we get #wan# G [lah] you know at least so I mean #zaki# left the band
<malay>tapi dia</malay> still <malay>macam</malay> part of it [pe] part of us <malay>dia tak keluar</malay> like know <malay>tak keluar</malay> in a bad terms <malay>dia keluar</malay> in a good term
and then you know he he was also part of the whole recording journey in the beginning [pe] ya so then <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] then we will we'll see how [ah] <malay>kita nanti duduk berbual</malay> we discuss with everyone see if they okay with it
#zaki# freelance [ah]

missy shoot <malay>pun nak</malay> record [lah] so <malay>tapi kita</malay> take it easy <malay>pasal sekarang</malay> I mean #hakim# is busy with work <malay>rabak gila aku macam dah beberapa minggu</malay> [sia] <malay>tak jumpa dia ajak lepak tak jumpa ajak lepak tak jumpa</malay>

ya <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] but missy shoot <malay>pasal kita selalu</malay> jam also on weekdays <malay>jadi dia pun tengah</malay> busy <malay>tapi kita tengok</malay> [lah] but definitely the plan is to record at least by
<malay>hujung tahun ni</malay> [ah]
ya true
[oh] beat a
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] but at least you guys went tour already [sia] U_S
europe
I think so
cause I think personally
I think [sial] is very influential <malay>macam banyak</malay> influence (err) <malay>orang-orang</malay> probably also cause of
<malay>dia</malay> female fronted
<malay>abeh</malay> and then <malay>nyanyi</malay> malay <malay>lagu melayu</malay>
then very very strong musical <malay>apa</malay>
musically very strong [ah]
ya
[ah]
[ah] that's good
<malay>bagus juga</malay> rare <malay>juga nampak</malay> band <malay>macam</malay> gitu like playing <malay>macam</malay>
those dark waves
<malay>betul aku</malay> realise that <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
I mean <malay>aku ikut korang yang</malay> time europe tour <malay>aku</malay> realise actually <malay>aku</malay> get to see many things
with little cost [ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah]
ya
but then again I think the twenty four hours <malay>pun macam</malay> can feel the vibe [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you are still <malay>macam dekat</malay> another country [orh] then you see like even though <malay>macam</malay> say for example [eh] for example <malay>kau main</malay> germany [ah] but different parts of germany have different style like that culture is like super different [ah]
so at least you get to see that culture know <malay>macam</malay> #berlin# really very
power and hipster hipster-ish very <malay>ni</malay> and then you go to another part of germany is like very more rundown ghetto sucky very <malay>kampung</malay> like in <malay>kampung</malay> [ah] but then
it's it's it's at least that one day one day or that twenty four hours [eh] is also to me an opener [ah] it's still fun [ah] it's still fun [ah] I mean as following tour [ah] so
yes
ya [lah]
but then again also I think it's not also about touring [ah] I mean you make the network but say next time you're not touring [ah] you just want to go for a holiday you go holiday to europe [ah] then you like want to meet friends you already have friends there and then they are very welcoming sometimes you even
<malay>macam</malay> save cost [ah] <malay>kau tak payah</malay> spend <malay>duit</malay> on <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay> lodging <malay>dorang</malay> will <malay>kasi kau</malay> crash <malay>tempat dorang</malay> I mean that's the give and take [ah] you know
ya so
(mm) (mm)
ya that's why
that's why that's why I mean
<malay>asal</malay>
I think he very selective of the places he wants to go
I mean I think <malay>dia</malay> maybe that his style [ah] if he don't like that culture or not say culture [ah] he don't like the vibe of the place I think he don't want to go [lah]
[ah] same same as long as I get out of here like singapore for at least that whole stretch two weeks [ah] two weeks <malay>pun dah cukup</malay>
cause <malay>kalau tak rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>kau</malay>
that's why
cause <malay>aku</malay> realise #siti# is is quite an adventurous person looking at her travel photos like when she posts on her social <malay>apa</malay> instagram
she can travel alone <malay>dia boleh</malay> travel alone <malay>pergi macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>gila</malay> cause <malay>aku</malay> realise cause <malay>bila</malay> that time <malay>kita dekat</malay> london <malay>tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> willing to go <malay>jalan-jalan sorang dia pandai</malay> explore [seh] like like she knows her way [ah] like to to just explore [ah] <malay>dia tak takut</malay> she got she's fearless [ah] but I think
that something <malay>yang</malay> holding her back [ah]
scared [sia]
cause cause I know her partner is not an adventurous adventurous person [ah]
ya but <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
<malay>aku pun nak</malay> tour [lah] <malay>dengan macam</malay> urgent matter I mean missy shoot <malay>lain sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kalau nak</malay> tour
probably <malay>lagi susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> #lal# <malay>pun macam</malay> #iman's# league right and then it's very
it'll be hard [lah] I mean cause missy shoot broke up for quite a while then I think the focus for him was #iman's# league [ah] then he came back so but I think he he still very on [lah] he wrote songs for missy shoot like even like you know when he do chords then he will ask [eh] does this <malay>ni kena tak</malay>
then <malay>macam tak</malay> [ah] <malay>ni tak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay> very very #iman's# league [ah] okay <malay>tak apa</malay> then <malay>dia akan tukar</malay> to change to <malay>kita punya</malay> vibe
<malay>selalunya</malay> is #dol# or most of the time is #dol# [lah]
but [ah] #lal# recently like did like quite a
did did a few songs [ah] one two songs
then everybody fill in ideas [lah] lyric lyric wise would be #dol# [lah] cause his lyrics are actually very good
#hakim# fill in
melodic parts
yes correct
he he he did give some ideas (err) when we take in some ideas some ideas <malay>macam tak kena</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> it's not our vibes but he tries to control not to go into <malay>macam</malay> very rubik's vibes
[ah] skate punk like a lot of
you know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
(err) but he will try to control he he don't want to <malay>macam dia tak nak tukar</malay> the sounds
[ah] bad religion I mean influence [ah] cause we influence with bad religion <malay>abeh macam</malay> influence with rise against #dol# <malay>punya</malay> influence is heavily rise against
heavy #lal# is very melodic guy #lal# <malay>suka</malay> melody so he
japanese punk like cause he grow up with <malay>macam</malay> he grow up with a lot of ska music and then japanese ska japanese punk rock he he he <malay>dia banyak macam</malay> on that vibe but <malay>aku</malay> is more very bad religion penny wise [ah]
#hakim# is very #propagandhi#
[ah] #propagandhi# (err) that fast and know a lot of yes so that that vibe so at least it's but <malay>bagusnya</malay> everything is jumble up you see so <malay>semua dah</malay> jumble up <malay>semua dah macam</malay>
apa at least everyone's ideas plays a part [ah]
<malay>biasa</malay> [ah]
confirm blast [kan]
[oh] [oh] #farhan# [eh]
but <malay>entah</malay> [eh]
but but
[ah] ya
<malay>dia macam</malay> very (err) straight [kan]
<malay>tapi dorang tak tahu</malay> [ah] #zul# <malay>dah tak cakap dengan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> bob [ah] [eh] practise [ah] single pedal <malay>aku</malay> feel playing single pedal
make it sound more raw
ya more organic
can feel the difference yes ya you can feel the difference if you play single pedal and you can even feel [lah] you can also hear that is double [ah] like like there's always for me like if you play single pedal you play that double pedal sound you have you have that a bit of latency
<malay>yang buat dia</malay> very unique [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> unique <malay>gila</malay> [ah] but then [ah] to each its own [ah] style [ah] ya but see [ah] see [ah] I don't know [ah] we still got a
right
I don't know [ah] is their style [ah]
but then also to say again missy shoot also playing that kind of song [ah] that kind of vibe [ah] but then
[ah] ya ya
ya relevant bands [ah]
<malay>betul dorang dah</malay> boring [ah]
they they they they suck life [ah] or they suck [ah] actually personally I don't listen to them already [ah] like rarely listen to them
bad religion still stick to that sound but then <malay>ada</malay> modern element I feel [ah] that's how I feel
penny wise will still be that sound [ah] cause it's still skate punk but then they always seek
(err) still have still around they still playing gigs
last year they release new album [what]
last year [ah] not bad [lah] but still the same sound [ah]
I like penny wise but I still prefer
he got a vibe [ah] a different vibe I still like bad religion [ah] cause <malay>dorang</malay>
cause they very <malay>abang abang</malay>
ya [ah] professor professor [sia] vocalist professor [siol] U_C_L_A [sia]
but they I think they really grow up with not the skate punk scene but they grow up with the the punk punk scene [ah] they grow up there
ya but like you know like like penny wise for example they all like (err) surfers and skateboarders [mah]
so but bad religion really I think raw from the streets [ah] but they are very intelligent people [ah]
tony hawk pro skater [eh]
no I don't like him [ah]
I don't know [ah] he some pop punkers like feeling feeling <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> very <malay>kental</malay> [ah] I cannot this pop punk pop punk thing [ah]
but cannot [ah]
but okay [lah] see how [lah] missy shoot
no but we going to jam soon cause #wan# G got a new bass
<malay>tapi tengah</malay> set [ah]
I don't know his brother-in-law give him
[ah] I forgot it's a weird shape weird shape [one] then he just need to redo the everything [ah] so he give to #hakim# #hakim#
#maggot# #maggot# [ah] #maggot# setting up for him [ah] then he gonna after that we jam [ah]
composer
all of us [ah] together but #wan# G is the one that do everything [lah] so
yes (err) so we input ideas [lah] [ah] like but but #wan# G will will #wan# G will do first [lah] at home then after that after he do
then will send us then <malay>cakap</malay> okay (err) <malay>ni ni ni nak kena tukar sikit ni kena adjust sikit</malay>
(err) then he will adjust okay okay let's meet then <malay>bila</malay> time <malay>jumpa baru</malay> like minor tweaking and tweak as much as possible
then <malay>dah</malay> [lah] see how <malay>pasal kita</malay> record with no clicks then very simple (err)
miking <malay>macam</malay> drums only four mikes (err) so that's why some sound <malay>macam</malay> really <malay>tak boleh dapat</malay> and stuff [lah] but we this is like a trial [ah] for me [lah] it's a trial [ah] but then <malay>nanti tengok</malay> [ah] like in future future recording <malay>kita</malay> do it like better [ah]
cause #hakim# <malay>macam dah</malay> offer [eh] next recording <malay>aku aku</malay> will make sure like all the all the miking will be better [lah]
I don't know he [ah] to me it's okay [lah]
ya but I think along the way right he he realised something [lah] and then along the way he he he he discovered new sounds ya so keep discovering new stuff right
ya [lah] that's why <malay>dia dia</malay> discovered <malay>tu pasal</malay> that time actually <malay>dia</malay> offered to <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam kau nak</malay> rerecord <malay>balik kau punya</malay> drum but then
[ah] but then <malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ada</malay> click [orh] we don't play with click so it's gonna be <malay>susah</malay> [sia] like okay [lah] we try [ah] I did record like what (um) we tried half a song [ah] but it's difficult cause there's no click
yes
yes cause the cause the feel is different already but I manage to record half the song but after that he said [eh]
<malay>tak</malay> feel [ah] like <malay>tak</malay> feel [ah] so then I think then I told him next time [ah] like the next time we we we try to record
(err) better [ah]
cause he discover but good thing that but good [ah] he's very hardworking <malay>dia</malay> discover sounds so he he knows more stuff so next time round he can give more input [lah] but then again it's not a bad recording [ah] this time
style ya correct
but he
ya cause you will cause when you buy new stuff you keep discovering new sounds then you you want to add you want to add but I think probably
music writing you need to be contented in some ways like okay
I got this one I discover this this new sound [eh] I will keep this new sound for the next one so we do with this first
then that personally for me
correct but then have to be patient [ah] but then but then again for example this spacedays <malay>punya</malay>
spacedays <malay>punya</malay> vibe is because we we needed to
do it fast [ah] cause we delay too long already [ah] [ah] so we we we say never mind [lah] we we we told #hakim# next next time when we you know writing new songs we want to record
we do it with you [ah] but because we already comfortable [eh] and he knows our sounds we know we he knows our sounds
he we know his style so and he will give the good know the good the good stuff [lah]
and then he also good he he always like investing on his stuff he got a lot of stuff as in equipment he invest on vintage stuff which we like [ah] [ah] recently we went to his studio right he bought this like
[ah] bass man [ah] it I think is
big one the big one tall one [ah] bass man fender bass man I think he bought for like what seven hundred plus then he he refurbish <malay>balik</malay> (err) for like four hundred plus so he actually spent like thousand plus on that cheap
but the thing is he always right he damn lucky [ah] I think I think he's damn lucky [ah] like he always find things vintage right but at a good price
ya
<malay>dia rajin gila</malay> [ah] ya but good [lah] know he he he he invests on that [lah] he invests on that then to have like
good sounds for the band [lah]
so far his recordings are actually good [ah] his personal his personal personal recordings is like everything that he plays himself or
he gets sessionist to play actually actually very good [ah] for me [lah] personally like like that seventies sound
ya but don't know how patient #yadi# is [lah]
cause must commit correct must commit
cause #hakim# is very hardworking that is his his income [pe] his livelihood [pe]
a lot a lot of bands
he he
but ya cause depends on the bands [lah] but from what
then <malay>apa tu</malay> force vomit <malay>pun tengah</malay> record
[ah] then recently <malay>dia cakap</malay> last week [eh] last week <malay>dia cakap</malay> dia record <malay>dikir barat</malay>
[sia]
don't know I think cause he knows some guys you know he he also got this #ranggi# #ranggi# guys [ah] #ranggi# is the motorcycle <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] so #ranggi# is actually <malay>macam</malay> (um)
#ranggi# is (err) some of them <malay>ada budak-budak dikir barat</malay> [ah]
so I think <malay>dorang</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> #hakim# is a <malay>buat</malay> sounds [pe]
so <malay>dia macam pergi dekat dia</malay> [lah] but then <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] then it's like side bazaar bush man <malay>dia punya</malay> side project
no no no he he got another reggae band
(err)
#adib# I think #adib# playing bass (err) then got (err) (um) #restam# bushman <malay>main</malay> guitar then (err) #rizal# #rizal# <malay>dulu main</malay> sound of province #rizal# <malay>main</malay> sound of province <malay>dulu</malay>
#rizal# <malay>kecil</malay>
comic strip play for comic strip also drummer [ah] ya ya ya #rizal#
he covered [ah] session I think for sound province but he's a good drummer [lah] then <malay>dia main</malay> for this band <malay>aku tak tahu siapa lagi</malay> a few more guys [ah] like play for his band
so I think recorded there also
(err) even stoned revivals [ah] remix sound that song [oh] no actually stone revival re-record one of the songs but to make it (err) make it into malay also (err) I think #goodil# [eh]
ya [lah] but how they do it right is like (err) (err)
some parts we record it in singapore then the tracks will be sent to australia #esam# #esam# australia #esam# will record
(err) we record over then will send back then they mix then will send back again then he will do the vocals there then send back they mix here [ah]
so <malay>dorang macam</malay> rerecord <malay>balik</malay> [ah] ya
(um) but then financially maybe <malay>tak sangat</malay> [lah]
ya but it also depends on him [what] he I don't know but
don't know [ah] but
I I don't know [ah] but but but that depends on him maybe he's comfortable using that but but okay [lah] I think #zad# also not bad not say not bad is actually he quite fast that he becomes really good [ah]
youtube #siao# he is
one thing about him right he if he into it right he really go all out [ah] into it [ah]
yes correct
but then see [lah] maybe maybe in future [lah] maybe he also looking at it
ya ya that's why
he really invest [ah] but one thing about #zad# I realised if he's really into it he will invest so if he have enough he will invest he invested on all the drums stuff
good [sia] cause he feels #paiseh# [lah] want to borrow people
he always borrow he like that one but people actually say nothing just use [lah] I mean we don't care if it breaks it breaks [lah] cause it's a wear and tear
[ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>tak aku cakap dengan</malay> #zad# <malay>juga</malay> #zad# <malay>dia tahu macam dia tak ada benda abeh</malay> then <malay>tiba-tiba macam korang main</malay> K_L <malay>semua cakap</malay> #zad# <malay>kau nak pakai pakai</malay> [ah] kau nak pakai pakai [ah] [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>kau mahal sangat macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> [jer] it's a wear and tear thing
<malay>aku tahu dia mahal</malay> but then I'm giving you that that green light <malay>apa</malay> that green light to just go and use instead of
but okay [ah] understand sometimes people don't want to <malay>terhutang budi kau tahu</malay>
that's why
<malay>tak</malay> maybe maybe also from experience
like we don't know like maybe <malay>dulu dia pernah macam</malay> have this friend who like okay just use [ah] then after that after using already then like [eh] !wah! now I want to you never give me back <malay>macam</malay> you know
#jialat# [ah] #jialat# got friend [ah] but then <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] but I'm okay [ah] kalau #zad# <malay>nak pinjam</malay>
of course
<malay>dah</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> end of the day also all the stuff <malay>macam</malay> like it's a wear and tear <malay>punya benda</malay> [pe] so
<malay>tak boleh cakap kalau kau pakai tak pecah esok aku pakai pecah</malay> [eh] you also broken [what] it'll also break [what] like know like so it's okay [lah] I mean the thing is
if it breaks it breaks then what can I do cause
it's not something which is non-breakable [what] it's something like confirm one day it will just spoil but okay [lah] I mean I understand
ya that's why <malay>kesian</malay> [sia] I know he's been <malay>macam dia berbual dengan aku</malay> [ah] like cannot wait [sia] I cannot wait to play drums [sia]
[ah] I cannot wait to <malay>lepak</malay> I cannot wait to record you know I told him [lah] if you need to record a band say for example band want to record you just record then call some of us [lah] we can help you set up the mic setting [ah]
but I know he some I mean knowing him
ya I know
like I know he don't want to <malay>terhutang budi</malay> that's confirm and maybe his style is different <malay>dia takut macam dia ter~</malay>
maybe he accidentally say for example we set the mic he scared he accidentally scold [eh] <malay>macam</malay> don't like that then he scared people like heart hurt [what] hurt the feeling hurt [what] so I don't think he's like that
but <malay>kita dah cakap</malay> [ah] I mean I already told him also [eh] <malay>kalau kau</malay> need to record you need help you just call us [lah] [ah] we will we will not ask for anything we will just help you [ah] cause you is is is you are the one doing the work

no the thing is the no the P_C_N walk that time the plan right #zad# was okay #zad# wanted to do it he injured [what]
[ah]
no but the thing is this type of thing right the P_C_N walk right you cannot <malay>pikiran</malay> you know just go regret <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] regret after that [ah] but there's no regret [ah] I mean for me personally when I went (err) the walk was was <malay>rabak</malay> [ah] the starting was fun cause everything but
towards the end
is
cause the leg was giving
it's mental [ah] mental [ah] it's it is more of mental
no but she also was struggling [ah] cause the last I think there was like four hundred metres we already saw the the entrance for coney island right that last four hundred metres suddenly like [eh] guys guys <malay>sekejap sekejap sekejap</malay> stop stop stop <malay>aku tak boleh aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] so we actually sat down and #azil# <malay>macam</malay> okay no problem no problem <malay>duduk</malay>
then it was like <malay>matahari dekat mata</malay> the sun was already like in the eyes ya
ya eight o'clock then <malay>kita macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> rest like it was only like still it was also four hundred metres five hundred metres more can see already it's like the bridge was just in front of us then we took out our shoes then we #lek# <malay>sekejap</malay> #lek# <malay>sekejap</malay>
we chill for about five ten minutes then like okay guys
no it was so crowded cause it's already weekend [what] then then we just walk [ah] so that the last one point five click right the moment we entered with we
entered like the one point five click way to #punggol# end coney island was like the longest four point five click we ever walk [ah]
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] for me [ah] personally but I told them sorry [ah] I say #paiseh# #paiseh# [ah] like we have to have a lot of stops
[ah] but #azil# also said never mind [ah] we take it slow [ah] don't don't
don't force yourself [lah] you know then to give up also now is like wasted [sia] ya no force is force but not say don't overexert yourself [ah]
so you you still go but we take it slow never mind don't care about the time but as long as we reach there we settle [ah] [ah] so we did manage to finish [ah] so the moment we touch that thing right <malay>kita cakap kita sampai</malay> right
<malay>macam macam</malay> #azil# we made it [ah] we just high five [sia]
[eh] take photo take photo take photo <malay>lepas tu kita pergi tepi pengsan</malay> I lie down already [sia] I lie down already I don't care already take out shoes take out socks #azil# take out socks take out shoes #aisyah# also sit down then all <malay>termenung</malay> already like good twenty minutes
twenty minutes half an hour after that #aisyah# like okay [ah] then we all like come [lah] let's go [ah] #hafiz# waiting
[eh] #hafiz# fetching [ah] <malay>jalan</malay> to the #punggol# settlement there is like another one click [ah]
[ah] [ah]
one point five click [ah] <malay>betul</malay>
so we had to walk for one plus click [ah]
we had to walk for another one point five click like that like
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah]
so that was the slowest walk to #punggol# (err) settlement but actually during the walk right going like when it starts to get really morning right
I I almost got into like hallucination already cause it's tiring already [ah] like [oh] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>dah penat</malay> [ah] <malay>mata dah rabak</malay> I cannot think properly then like want to smoke also <malay>malas</malay> you know like want to <malay>minum air</malay> just drink water [ah] drink water drink water drink water drink water
they even reach they want to eat also lazy you know so the moment we reach right actually #hamimah# #zafran# all they wake already they wanted to go <malay>makan</malay>
ya [lah] breakfast but cause #aisyah# [ah] #hafiz# fetching #aisyah# [mah] so they wanted to go <malay>makan</malay> then they ask you and #nazril# <malay>kau dengan</malay> #nazril# plan [ah] <malay>nak pergi makan mana</malay> then <malay>kita jumpa</malay> somewhere <malay>tu aku cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>kita nak balik tidur balik tidur</malay> [ah] <malay>nak balik tidur</malay>

<malay>dia cakap semua orang dia dah rabak aku pergi cari</malay> toilet <malay>aku jalan balik dorang dah ketawa ketawa pasal aku dah</malay> slow <malay>gila</malay> then <malay>aku duduk aku duduk macam</malay> [eh] [sia] [ah] to go into the car also <malay>macam</malay> [eh] [sia] [ah] <malay>rabak</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
[ah]
#siao#
[ah] [ah]
[oh] there the park connector [ah]
go to coastal
east coast
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> [oh] ya ya cause coastal
it's wrong coastal the coastal #tanah merah# coastal one whole stretch is about twenty plus clicks
twenty one [eh] twen~ like like almost twenty clicks [ah] actually almost twenty clicks ya include east coast one way (err) #hud# told me is about twenty five clicks <malay>ye</malay>
ya so ya [lah] but don't know [ah] but we want to dragon we want to do it again you make another good talk about I think this time with you go right we we go that route but we whatever we can cut regard [ah]
so ya [lah] but don't know but we want to try again we want to do it again
<malay>tak</malay> but I think this time if we go right we we go that route but we
whatever we can cut we cut [ah] no [lah] but
#yio chu kang# #sengkang# cannot [ah] must go that way no actually right
[oh] cannot cannot cause that park connector is the nearest if not you will go further
the #buangkok# is the nearest to reach [ah] but that one is also quite a stretch [ah]
[ah] [ah] but but is like you walk walk [eh] park connector park connector then you see [eh] #sengkang# already
that #sengkang# we thought you is after that bridge thought the #sengkang# is already #punggol# <malay>sekali</malay> [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> it's another #sengkang#
the other end then you go in front another bridge [oh] that's the McDonald's the stadium that is the end of #sengkang#
then you go to #punggol# so that from #punggol# the whole stretch you walk you thought like okay [ah] this one near already you walk walk walk suddenly it's just #sumang#
so that #sumang# is the end the beginning of that #sumang# is like the end middle of #punggol# [lah] that #sumang#
it still have a long stretch before you reach the end
but then the coney island right is if you go straight the park connector <malay>dia macam sampai dekat</malay> red bridge [tau] but this one is before red bridge <malay>kau dah belok kiri</malay>
so there's another route [ah] so there's another route to walk
but we see [lah] we try again [ah]
we see next time maybe end of the year [lah] okay [lah] K K K
