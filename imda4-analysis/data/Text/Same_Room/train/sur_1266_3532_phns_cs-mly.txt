then when when she finally gave birth then <malay>bila tengah</malay> breastfeed right then <malay>dia rasa macam</malay> I think the <malay>susu tak boleh keluar</malay> [ah] then <malay>tanya</malay> doctor [ah] doctor check <malay>dia cakap dia dah</malay> stage two and then like before that right (uh) I think while she was pregnant the <malay>si si jantan tu dia cakap</malay> (uh) <malay>dia nak anak ni</malay> like
be a guy [lah] like like like a boy then he like not very educated then he say (uh) <malay>makan</malay> steak <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> [ah] so that the gender will be a boy like what the hell
K then my aunt cause <malay>sayang dia</malay> [ah] then I'm like she go and eat a lot of steak then <malay>berminyak</malay> [what] so that's why <malay>dapat</malay> the cancer steak steak ya then after that <malay>bila dia dah</malay> give birth then <malay>dapat</malay> cancer then
I think she got ask him [lah] say like [ah] you will stay with me right you won't leave then he say ya ya then after that end up he cheat
ya he he cheat on smule do you know the smule app ya karaoke you know and then <malay>sebab dia suka nyanyi-nyanyi</malay> like those typical <malay>tu</malay> <malay>itu pasal</malay> then he went on smule then <malay>nampak</malay> this <malay>perempuan</malay> and this <malay>perempuan</malay> is <malay>janda</malay> means like
she divorced <malay>dua kali</malay> so before that she already had two ex husband's then each husband <malay>ada satu anak</malay>
like girl there's like a red flag
like he he cheated then he he <malay>sebab dia orang yang suka</malay> fishing like he go tell my [ah] late aunt say (err) <malay>aku pergi</malay> (err) fishing [ah] <malay>kat</malay> #krabi# [eh] #phuket# #phuket# but in actual fact he went with that <malay>betina</malay>
I don't know [lah] like he he <malay>maki</malay> my aunt until like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) say [ah] like as if she not in a bad condition [eh] she's not really in a bad condition and stuff <malay>habis kasi nafkah pun macam tak cukup</malay>
like it's supposed to be five hundred <malay>habis</malay> he say [oh] <malay>sebab</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> then my <malay>gaji tinggal sikit</malay> like [ah] <malay>dengar-dengar nanti kena</malay> retrench then you know how much he give or not he give hundred dollar per month
for the <malay>budak</malay>
hundred divided by thirty <malay>satu hari berapa</malay>
and and well ya it's not enough <malay>dua puluh</malay> dollar [jer] <malay>kasi apa</malay> ya

(uh) where [ah] every alternate weekends (err) <malay>budak tu</malay> will sleep at #tampines# at the <malay>betina punya rumah</malay>
ya then I think the <malay>betina</malay> is like
like su~ sugar mummy <malay>dia</malay>
cause he he really cannot like support [sia] the kid
ya then <malay>nak bayar</malay> school fees <malay>pun macam tertangguh</malay> like he paid late [leh] then for each day cause there's a specific date that you are supposed to pay the school fees by then every day that you are late you have to pay extra twenty five
then I don't know [lah] he <malay>bayar</malay> !alamak!
(uh) now K one <malay>tapi dia dia tak sekolah macam</malay> P_A_P <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>dia sekolah macam</malay> islamic school

then it's like I blame him cause like if never <malay>kahwin</malay> him then my aunt will still be around she wouldn't have cancer and stuff then <malay>bila</malay> like he already know he and the <malay>betina</malay> know that she has cancer then they still like harassed her
