people like trying to get in so even if I tell them (uh) I'm sorry [lah] you cannot

I (um) my sister she used to [lah] she used to be be a photographer
but now she's
she she she has been following like you know like the like production all
but she's not really into the like
camera thing but she's more on the like
helping the set up the scene or like more and becoming a producer but she don't really hold a camera anymore now
set up the scene or like more on the becoming a producer but she don't really hold the camera anymore now
(uh) no <malay>ada dah dah habis dah</malay> she ya I think if <malay>sekarang</malay> I think is every friday I think the
the <malay>cerita</malay> is (uh) I think is called
<malay>lesung</malay> if I'm not wrong you can try you can try (uh) tune in every friday <malay>dekat</malay> #suria#
you can watch if I'm not wrong is after the
news if I'm not wrong [lah]
ya
if you don't watch news I don't even watch T_V
like I feel like I watch T_V once a month <malay>sahaja</malay> no [lah] I'm not into
like the drama and all if I watch also I just watch it through like Netflix <malay>ke</malay> Viu or YouTube <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
now now I <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tengok apa-apa</malay> cause I like actually I am busy
like morning <malay>kerja</malay> then
after that you have to go to school already then go home have to do like assignment for tomorrow class
like sometime I feel like I'm even too busy to even like
look at my social media and all all I do is just like text people and just do my like go on with my day
and then just sleep wake up and just repeat
I don't think that's what we do I think that's what you do I guess that that's what you meant cause I don't get that privilege of like
<malay>bangun makan tidur</malay> kind of thing you know
if you not a if you just like (um) afternoon person then how you go school so you always miss school or late for school !haiyo!
!huh!
!wow! I was shock
you start at eight but the latest you come at eight on time
but next time try [lah] try to be on time [lah] it's school it's important
me graduate
(uh) still still <malay>lama lagi</malay> I think now like
I started school (err) this year april
so it's only been how many months
(uh) few months I think like I mean like
a quarter way there
still long time so still got
two years more left
(hmm) looking at myself right now
I don't think I'm able to continue until degree I think
diploma is enough I but I don't know maybe the future will change
how I feel about studying will change so we'll see how but
for right now I don't think so [lah]
then [eh] you you don't want to like get like full time diploma you want to work instead
[oh]
I don't think that's a good way of thinking because you need to know nowadays they all ask for like minimum diploma
like it's best is actually if you have diploma instead
like then if also you take full time it's at least subsidised by government you can take all
so you don't like taking part time diploma will be much more expensive actually
so think better think properly before you decide to actually just
straight away get into the career path you know once you get in it's hard to get out
ya sure glad to be your friend
(mm) I actually joined netball but for like one month only then after that
I quit I join guitar
but
like I join guitar until when like I'm like sec four but I don't know how to play guitar I don't know what I do inside
C_C_A also
then how about you you do you enjoy like your C_C_A during secondary school
!wow! then the this club are you like serious or just like
you know like just a leisure thing
(uh) that time I heard you got injured because of rugby right then like for a long time you did not
get to play rugby although it's your hobby
(uh) no I take care of myself very well
(um) like luckily you know I'm not that sporty person
ya I'm more of just like
chill relax don't get yourself in trouble kind of girl
[ah] like you know like I say myself is chill but yourself is called you know <malay>cari nahas</malay>
trying to find ways that can injure yourself
but it's okay [lah] since now also you
you didn't break a lot of bones right I believe hopefully
in another ten years
are you sure
but it's okay you can try but as you grow older there will be more commitments
[oh] really are you sure you don't have I thought you have a girlfriend already
[oh] good [lah]
(hmm) nevermind [lah]
like
right now [oh] you heard about like
(uh) I I thought I think I heard like they moving into phase three or or was it just fake news I'm not so sure
!huh! you <malay>tak sabar nak pergi</malay> malaysia I can't wait to remove the mask
like I know it's like for safety purposes but it it hurts to be wearing it for like
twelve hours straight the whole day
but you can just like
make sure that thing don't happen by wearing contact lens right
[oh]
it's okay [lah] we just we just pray like things will get better like
this COVID will go away soon cause like I think it's almost a year already now
(uh) I really
really cannot <malay>tahan</malay> already people really need to follow like
the safety measure like the government has put out
are you sure you do that
it's good [lah] you playing a part to help like singapore a safer place like
like let's make it like by next year it's free from COVID
!wah! I really I like [oh] yes just now I remember you asking me like if COVID ends what I want to do right
actually the first thing I want to do is I want go karaoke like I don't know (uh)
like before COVID I used to go karaoke like at least like at least every month
[ah] every month but now
like I heard like ru~ like I heard rumours that they want a close down Teo Heng
[oh] !wah! everything you want to do with your friend [ah] then how about like your girlfriend or your family you don't want to do anything with them is it
[oh] (uh) you heard talking about like M_B_S and all you heard about like
(uh) government giving out the hundred dollar the singapore I think the singapore discovery voucher if I'm not wrong
like like but I'm not so sure [lah] but like what it can be use for
[ah] cannot be anything I'm sure like <malay>mesti dia macam</malay>
only like c~ certain
I'm sure there's like partnership like certain places only they accept if I'm not wrong I think if you go to places like like singapore attraction I think
like I think like the singapore zoo or U_S_S you can use
but
if I'm not wrong I heard from my friend they say cannot
you cannot combine your vouchers like and and you you told me like just now you can staycay right
ya but you can only use your own voucher I think you must add up with <malay>pakai</malay> cash
relax what you so stress about
!wah! talking about staycay before COVID also I used to staycay a lot with my family
but now but now actually the hotel is actually cheaper
but cause they only like
you it's already a like limited number of people can go and then you can't even use the swimming pool like
at one time only a max of I think like
four person can go inside the pool
if not you have to like (uh) allocate time for every guest
ya I guess we all now like hope like life could go back to normal
but in order for life to go back to normal it's also it's it's our part to play to make things better like
to avoid
COVID to spread more ya so let's try our best to do that
so we can have what we want
go #sentosa# <malay>untuk apa</malay>

it's fun like it's fun you can like take this car right you can go down like different
(uh) trails
there's a lot of tourists that keep coming back
because (uh) apart of singapore I think there's one at new zealand there's also one at korea
but their like bigger country got longer trails but singapore is more of like the I think the shortest trail they have
but you still can get to experience the same [lah]
but isn't roller coaster better like you like you can just end it within like a minute
you see the longest roller coaster also like I think how many minutes only
is like you you just have to close your eyes for a while then you you already finish especially the one at U_S_S I think the is it the human one
ya it's like really fast
<malay>dia naik habis</malay> suddenly <malay>dia turun</malay>
then you want what the roller coaster just go straight line is it
(uh) I think might as well you just take a train

enjoy life already

like you know there's you people say <malay>macam</malay> (uh) there's like there's a
is it
rain before sunshine

(mm) (mm)
ya can't wait can't wait to get like
(uh) like a good career and then can start saving and then we can do like we say like travel
and do the things we want
ya but it's okay [lah] let's just think positively for now
no need to think so much
we just do our part we focus on our
career or our education
then I'm sure things will be better for us
okay
