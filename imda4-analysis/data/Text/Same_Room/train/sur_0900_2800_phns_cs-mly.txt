test and
okay hi I'm #amir# I a~ and my partner #salamah#
okay so first conversation was how
I got here [lah] so I mean initially we plan to meet <malay>pukul dua belas gitu</malay> but then I was a bit lazy so I was lazing at home so I went then I stayed then
I then I will just okay [lah] I want to <malay>naik basikal</malay> then now I'm regr~ regretting it [lah]
a bit
hot <malay>pun</malay> it's not <malay>tak panas sangat macam hari yang dah</malay> like the past few days it's not really that got [lah] but then I mean its a good time also now like three o'clock I cycle then forty five minutes to your place <malay>tak tak jauh sangat</malay> it's eleven kilometers
and the weather <malay>cuaca pun</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> [lah] so I mean it's okay you got [lah] so I mean it's
but I think it's the perfect time [ah]
I mean when it comes to like l~ l~ face mask from what
I remembered I I need to refresh the the the mandatory law <malay>tapi dia cakap</malay> difficult if you doing exercise like any exercises running jogging cycling <malay>tak payah pakai</malay> mask [pe]
so I think when it comes to mask I wasn't very I mean I didn't wear a like a proper face mask <malay>yang kena</malay> and the one the government <malay>kasih atau</malay> the one that they government <malay>suruh</malay> [lah]
I just use the <malay>kain</malay> like the one the the they call it the <malay>kain untuk muka</malay>
then
ya ya ya the step cool kind I mean is also to prevent like you like at higher speeds like around you are cycling down
with like good high speed then confirm things are gonna go to your face so it's like prevent [ah] <malay>ba~ barang-barang kena muka</malay> like some debris you just go to (uh) face what's that at least <malay>apa dia ada</malay> protection because if not like
like you will either injure or just things going your
face your nose or your mouth [lah]
okay ya so I was cycling because I was doing part time
deliveroo so like most of the time it's like cycling and it's like but the pathway is <malay>tempat kosong</malay> so I will I can just keep cycling at maybe higher speeds like
like I can compared to a car I mean not until forty kilometre [lah] maybe twenty ten kilometer per hour to <malay>cepat juga</malay> [lah] ta~ but then
then some more <malay>ada</malay> construction <malay>tempat</malay> construction so
so the <malay>tempat</malay> construction is just debris [ah] then the <malay>habuk-habuk masuk hidung</malay> then I was like my nose a bit itchy [lah] then I mean
ya but that is okay not compared to there was a time [ah] I was like
cycling down to woodlands just to meet my my my girlfriend my ex girlfriend [lah]
okay [ah] then ya so that wa~ that was the time <malay>yang</malay> cause that one <malay>tempat dekat dengan</malay> forest forest <malay>sana</malay> because it's the #ulu# #ulu# <malay>tempat</malay> #ulu# <malay>sana</malay> so
by chance I wasn't wearing that face that that mask then ya [lah] (err) <malay>lalat masuk</malay> [lah] <malay>hidung</malay>
[eh] <malay>lalat masuk mulut</malay>
I mean literally it's not at house anymore [lah] <malay>dia dah dekat luar</malay> [lah]
[eh] ya <malay>dia masuk</malay> [lah] I mean
you you imagine you
you are cycling <malay>penat-penat jauh</malay> it's like you are <malay>jauh</malay> then
you are breathing in you need a lot of oxygen so you I don't think you are gonna <malay>pakai mulut</malay> [eh] <malay>pakai</malay> your <malay>hidung</malay> ya it's <malay>kena</malay> use your <malay>pakai mulut</malay> [lah] you
then by chance the thing <malay>masuk</malay> and <malay>nasib tak masuk</malay> my the the air pipes it <malay>masuk</malay> my esophagus straightaway so I just <malay>telan</malay>
I mean it's it's better that you chewing it [what] like you chew I I don't even know what I taste but
I mean it's just
after that I was okay [ah] so I think the house fly was
<malay>dia makan betul</malay> [ah] I also <malay>tak berak-berak</malay> so okay [ah]
ya I guess so I was fine
<malay>sakit</malay> no [ah] it just
I think it's just extra protein [ah] I don't know <malay>apa dia makan kat</malay> that #ulu# area and I mean forest I mean housefly they ar~ flies are basically came from maggots [what] then then they evolve
ya you don't know [meh]
so I don't know maybe there's something they rot~ rotten there then I'm just extra protein [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> some people confirm <malay>makan</malay> maggot [what] good
ya [lah] it's just that I got the most freshest one [lah]
you want <malay>nak makan</malay> bat
ya I
ya
yes I'm I'm taking my bike license [lah] my motorbike license like
k~ I
currently I'm tak~ taking <malay>kat</malay> the C_D_C the #ubi# <malay>sana</malay> [lah] I mean
I am like I mean cycling is a good thing [ah] like <malay>naik basikal</malay> if you exercise you go distance and if you work <malay>pakai kerja</malay> deliveroo or grabfood you earn money also then I mean but then I still schooling then I need transportation also [lah] like but I mean by motor also can work use for my grabfood and deliveroo also so I mean might as well I get a bike license [lah] bike license <malay>boleh tolong apa</malay> like like two in one so just settle everything
I don't
<malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> but I I think depends [lah] I think now the the rate <malay>dia dah</malay> really drop <malay>dah jatuh</malay> so
cause I think now there's a influx [dah] <malay>banyak</malay> I mean cause of corona a lot of people lost their jobs so they also now <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] apply for foodpanda grabfood deliveroo
I mean I I mean I have a <malay>ada</malay> grabfood <malay>dengan</malay> foodpanda [eh] <malay>apa</malay> deliveroo account [ah] I don't really need <malay>dapat masuk</malay> joined foodpanda [lah] so I think
I those two is enough [ah] and then now also s~ <malay>masih</malay> because I'm now <malay>masih</malay> like recently <malay>kena</malay> diagnosed <malay>dengan</malay> hyperthyroidism so my <malay>saya</malay> I just <malay>sakit sangat</malay> [lah] I just <malay>susah nak nak</malay> exercise so ya so I mean now I cut down [ah] just do less
I don't remember calling it docket (uh) I think the maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> it's a foodpanda <malay>punya</malay> ba~ <malay>benda</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> grabfood <malay>dengan</malay> deliveroo they call it [ah] incentive so <malay>dapat</malay> incentive like you deliver ten [ah]
deliver ten then you will get incentives like maybe for grabfood was ten dollar
you divide it a extra extra five dollar ten dollar then after you deliver hundred than maybe extra
thirty forty dollars that was <malay>itu pun</malay> only for
peak period like friday to sunday but then friday to sunday also you are not the one <malay>kerja</malay> [lah] the <malay>orang lain semua kerja kerja</malay> so you are challenging others people I mean not challenging you are like
com~ competing competing <malay>orang-orang lain semua</malay> [ah] so
that is grabfood [lah] for for deliveroo incentive <malay>punya ada</malay> every deliveroo every delivery for for peak is extra maybe one dollar to two dollar so the good thing for grab for deliveroo is I mean
I mean I I work for both
I mean not this is not advertisement [lah] but then
they grab the deliveroo their support is mu~ like way better [lah]
like you in a in a pickle you just call [jer] <malay>nanti</malay> they just will assist you [ah] <malay>tolong</malay> to~ deli~ just <malay>tolong</malay> you like just like that grabfood you call <malay>sampai besok pun dia orang tak angkat</malay>
[oh] ya ya depends [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> tip <malay>dia orang nak kasih</malay> tip [ah] I mean in singapore I mean singapore culture itself <malay>tak ada</malay> tip culture [what] it's like sometime also there are people
you'll give tip <malay>nanti dia orang fikir</malay> [eh] <malay>ini aku dah buat dah dapat kerja duit ni apa pasal dia kasih duit lebih ni apa aku buat ni</malay> like they are thinking that's like something wrong but then is in the end they just wanna tip so i's a singapore it's not not a tipping
it's not a tipping thing [ah] like the culture
ya
second second
bro that one that one is I mean that one depends like I mean H_D_B you cannot
that one is the~ they give big tip is maybe
ten dollar
ya they give ten dollar I tip just <malay>kasih</malay> [ah]
ya they give I mean because the tip you can just give it through app <malay>atau</malay> the cash so they will just give you cash [ah] like from singapore's tipping
the app like you give you ten dollar that will get the ten dollar because some countries like for example in like happening in other places I think U_S like the their
food their tipping like their the the person the company they <malay>ambil duit</malay> the the that it was supposed to tip but t~ to you so it's like
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] but singapore I mean they tip you you get the tip [ah] so that's what the company the company
like it's just
well I mean because <malay>tak ada duit selalu</malay> no pocket n~ no cash in the pocket so they tip using a card using the payment make payment <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> that account [lah] so ya so my biggest is <malay>paling banyak</malay> is ten dollar [ah] [lah] but now is they give me cash see me
looking cool then give me ten dollar [lah] <malay>itu dapat terus sepuluh</malay> dollar just just the just deliver and it was a <malay>tempat pun</malay> like also like legit
cause it was a big so basically <malay>tempat dia</malay> is like <malay>depan depan rumah dia tempat makanan</malay> then he just like maybe
fifty meter and <malay>lima puluh</malay> meter [jer] I go down take food go up
and that really the delivery fee like what I got is already seven dollar then this add add of a ten dollar <malay>dia orang kasih</malay> then I got seventeen dollars I guess just for fifty meter <malay>pergi angkat itu</malay> [jer]
ya I got it for six [eh] four hundred plus [lah] like because
I mean long term [ah] and I think I really gain back that four hundred I've
been a long time ago [lah] like [dah] <malay>lama juga</malay> [ah] I've gained back the <malay>empat ratus tu</malay> so
like four <malay>empat</malay> about four hundred is still a good price for a good bike that is like
with the accessories [ah] <malay>barang</malay> like
it's (err) I mean you want to do something you on the road ri~ ride bicycle also or pavement you want something that you can rely on you you <malay>pakai benda yang murah-murah terus benda rosak yang mati pun kalau apa-apa jadi pun</malay> it's you what
ya ya
I mean
the thing is sometime <malay>pun orang</malay> like you rider you will sometimes take <malay>naik basikal</malay> you I mean then you anything happen like then [eh] #guai lan# <malay>padahal</malay> sometimes you forget [eh] your your means your safety first [lah] you don't even remember you like you just wanna get that money but then you <malay>lupa</malay> about yourself [lah] so it's quite stupid [ah] sometimes like you
sometimes you see
they those like
food delivery they like I mean
we are paid by <malay>duit apa</malay> by by by time so the time you <malay>cepat</malay> you get more money so <malay>kadang-kadang tak pakai otak nampak tu</malay> green lig~ green light <malay>belum</malay> green light <malay>tu</malay> showing but you want <malay>nak</malay> to go you want to go
ya [lah] so safety also have to come first [ah] because you are doing this thing like even like for me I take bicycle more high risk [lah] but then better I can go in to the like where the pedestrian <malay>jalan jalan</malay> [lah] so like <malay>senang</malay>
then then compared to bicycle ya but then you I b~ since I can go two in one go to the road and <malay>pergi</malay> the pedestrian pathway <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang pun</malay> singapore drivers
<malay>memang semacam</malay> [ah]
blind blind spot
(err) talking about check back blind spot <malay>tadi</malay> on the way here already I was I was really know I was
I I think I might feel fail someone from the C_D_C the the I was like on the road going junction then there's a light then on my left is the zebra crossing [ah]
like busy but I'm not crossing on the zebra crossing I'm like walking on (um) from the main road going straight so <malay>dia dari</malay> the the j~ the other side <malay>nak masuk</malay> the main road from the zebra crossing [ah] the junction so the
the driver <malay>dia tak nampak</malay> [ah] I like I was really prepared to break from <malay>jauh</malay> but I was already <malay>dah macam dah nak</malay>
I was really goi~ like to be beside her in that main road <malay>dia</malay> just jam break [ah] then ya I will I will initially I already jam break first
cause a he she right I don't see her like <malay>dia</malay> not stopping so ya she so I think I might fail her [ah]
[ah]
I mean not my problem also I like legit I was already on the road I'm wearing blue colour <malay>boleh nampak apa dari jauh</malay> then like there was a car like
there was no nothing no one else on the road on the road was me
I mean but
I was with I'm already maintaining my speed and never slowed down she just didn't <malay>tak ternampak tak nampak</malay> so I mean I was I already my two hands really prepared on to you break [ah]
so she just she jam break herself [ah] then just I hear <malay>dia cakap</malay> sorry sorry sorry but I don't think it's got that sorry you cannot help her [lah]
[oh] ya (err) so <malay>sekarang</malay> I'm taking my bike license [lah] like I mean as a someone who I think honestly as a
you license [ah] you
I mean it's a good thing for a license [lah] you easy save best like for demonstration but then I think when it comes to you are <malay>dari</malay> the cyclists [ah] you are like basically the food chain [ah] <malay>kat bawah sekali</malay>
so you know how the da~ the most dangerous thing so now you technically you will go out [ah] as a motorcyclist style more car then you will like maybe can put yourself in other shoe [ah]
[ah] <malay>tahu mana bodoh bodoh yang macam basikal orang bodoh</malay>
ya like I think then I think the instructor <malay>pun cakap</malay> you because some people <malay>dah dia dah ada</malay> three A license of the three class three three license
then they <malay>dia orang nak ambil</malay> class two B then they then I think they instructor <malay>pun cakap</malay> [ah] you now okay now you guys are from start from car now you but <malay>sekarang nak nak naik</malay> motor then now you know <malay>orang</malay> motor <malay>apa yang jadi</malay> so just now I was doing practical [lah] I did revision but then I think what reason <malay>siang sangat</malay> because
like <malay>cepat sangat</malay> [ah] because I haven't booked my prac six yet overnight to go out on the road
so I think
(uh) prac five is the revision [dah] I mean it's the internal cost [lah] but I already cleared that just that I did revision because <malay>dah lama tak naik</malay> motor
six <malay>kat luar</malay>
but before that defensive riding [lah]
[oh] you mean <malay>keluar</malay> from the to the main road [ah] yes I that one I can see beside because whenever I go there I also <malay>naik basikal</malay> so I can see <malay>apa yang</malay> wha~ or like what's happening [ah] <malay>kata orang</malay> too happening [sia] I also <malay>macam takut</malay> [ah] <malay>nak nak nak nak keluar</malay> that main road just to <malay>naik basikal</malay>
so
S_S_D_C
ya
but I think I
I because I choose #ubi# <malay>pasal pun</malay> l~ l~ like <malay>dekat dengan basikal</malay> so I think I I mean <malay>naik basikal sana</malay> okay [lah] I don't want to <malay>naik basikal</malay> every time go pevery time go S_S_D_C
ya
no
ya
I mean <malay>aku pun</malay> don't mind [lah] <malay>kena</malay> ride on some something ride on me but
depends [lah] so I mean every time I mean cycling far okay [lah] once in a while occasion so like how <malay>aku naik naik basikal sini</malay> to to here then also I need to go back <malay>naik basikal</malay> so depends [lah] but then <malay>nak</malay> every time <malay>nak</malay> take lessons no thanks [ah]
I will just take public but then now <malay>pasal nak dekat</malay> so I <malay>naik basikal</malay> to C_D_C [jer] [lah]
<malay>dua puluh enam dua puluh enam</malay> the practical like depends [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> in the evening that is twenty eight ya but then ya when it comes to outside the road then it's it's like ten dollar extra so
thirty six when it comes to revision outside or the the the test outside is sixty or so around fifty plus
six or five
ya
I mean <malay>basikal pun</malay> okay for exercise like I mean comes to <malay>dapat</malay> motor <malay>pun</malay> okay [lah] you
like for transportation because now also <malay>tengah</malay> l~ like <malay>belajar pun</malay> like easy [lah] like <malay>boleh bangun lambat sikit nak pergi sekolah dari bangun cepat-cepat abeh terus naik</malay> public <malay>abeh</malay> public <malay>tempat penuh sangat</malay> then you cannot sit down <malay>terus macam</malay>
<malay>dah malas nak pergi sekolah</malay>
I don't know [lah] I think when it comes to transport singapore it's always <malay>macam</malay>
I I I don't know [lah] <malay>macam ada ada hantu dekat dalam orang-orang dah mati dulu-dulu punya perang cari balik</malay>
singapore I <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] I don't know every time it's like damn haunted start the singapore transport for the M_R_T I mean the buses everything is (err) I mean reliable just that I don't know why [ah] M_R_T
I was I <malay>rasa kubur-kubur dan do~ kena</malay> you dug up the <malay>kubur</malay> then th~ underground then <malay>hantu dah semua datang</malay>
I I think the bike I'm looking for is (err) the one like my friend is riding I think C_B_R one five zero or M_T one five
is it I don't remember I don't I don't no the bike <malay>kat sana</malay> is F_Z one sixty
I don't know [ah] I want to <malay>jimat duit pun</malay> okay [lah] but then I want to <malay>nak</malay> like I mean <malay>nak nampak</malay> handsome <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] so
F_Z <malay>tak</malay> handsome <malay>sangat</malay> [lah]
ya like [ah] <malay>muka aku pun buruk sangat</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> F_Z <malay>pun tak b~ tak boleh tolong tapi</malay> at least <malay>kalau</malay> C_B_R at least I from a seven maybe <malay>masuk naik atas ke</malay> nine <malay>ke</malay> eight <malay>ke</malay> all over there [ah]
ya ya okay that one I
you <malay>pandai juga</malay> [eh] motor <malay>kau</malay>
I I don't even know what
those brands are like [ah] because I think the one that everybody using that have been recommending me fuel efficient is the C_B_R I mean s~ s~ somewhat fuel efficient is C_B_R one five zero [ah]
I think when I think <malay>kalau nak beli</malay> motor <malay>pun</malay> I'm gonna buy I think buy maybe (uh) as a second second owner [ah] not gonna buy until <malay>dah nak habis</malay> maybe maybe
seven more years or seven seven or seven more years [ah]
<malay>kalau ada duit</malay> of course obviously I will buy [ah] like a first hand but I think I still need to figure out [ah] like
e~ t~
like I I need to decide first whether because like i~ if I were to do my work
like usually when it comes to like my future career I don't think motorbike is a good thing [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like that's because I would be <malay>macam jauh</malay> away from singapore ya like for <malay>enam bulan</malay> so I think see how first [lah]
ya
ya like I mean that's the that's the one thing [lah] <malay>ada ada datang balik terus</malay> the tyre <malay>hilang tinggal</malay> handlebar [jer] <malay>kat sana</malay> but park <malay>kat</malay> carpark <malay>tinggal</malay> handlebar I mean obviously there's one thing [lah] but
[ah] I so that's why I need to see first most probably <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] most probably I just comeback
I just keep renting [ah] depends on like what bike I want then
then (uh) I think most probably I will still <malay>nak ambil</malay> class three three li~ license [lah] I mean
s~ I mean we (err) like (uh) <malay>nak buat</malay> family cannot be bringing your child <malay>kalau ada</malay> child <malay>naik naik ke~ naik</malay> motor [pe] I means still can [lah] but then like cannot [lah] like but singapore I mean were asking if want to <malay>naik naik</malay> bus [pe] public but then
like when it comes to reliability <malay>macam barang-barang selalu</malay> breakdown you think you can trust can you trust singapore government
!aiya! I think that one too vague [lah] like everything can be improve [lah] <malay>semua benda boleh boleh</malay> improve [pe] <malay>ada benda merepek pun boleh</malay> improve
so <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] like I don't know I mean sometimes you cannot rely on wanting too much [ah] <malay>nanti benda</malay> problem <malay>nanti</malay> then you are relying that thing <malay>benda rosak</malay> then you are
like at the at the like a dead end
so <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [ah] so that one also cannot rely too much [lah]
[oh] ya so I've been talking so I think maybe like your turn [ah] <malay>berbual</malay> for I mean this conversation we are having so
what was the question I have to remember [oh] was it something like okay what is the
which (um) the surprise <malay>yang paling besar yang orang</malay> like give like give you like you have a shock of your life
ya ya yes yes
freighter then I noticed the mere driver was my one of my teammates
[oh] so like [ah] okay okay so <malay>duduk lama-lama</malay> then suddenly you just don't know either <malay>dia orang datang</malay> so they put your car then what happen next
(um)
so we basic~ basically <malay>dah kereta</malay> you just waiting waiting then <malay>dia orang dah sampai tempat</malay> pick me pick spot then they just like
so they already park [lah] so then after that <malay>dia orang nak bawa</malay> to the place to eat [lah] so and so <malay>tempat makan dia</malay> at where exactly
okay now let's understand so <malay>siapa</malay> like you who <malay>siapa</malay> who was there like <malay>siapa kat sana semua</malay> like is it your all your soccer mates [ah] is it just them or <malay>ada orang lain</malay> celebrating
okay [lah] I mean ya I mean the also quite <malay>gerek</malay> [lah] but then like I mean
I think it's a good way to celebrate birthday [ah] <malay>orang</malay> like you are with [lah] people you love <malay>orang kalau kawan</malay> help your family depends like everyone like <malay>ada orang macam nak</malay> celebrate birthday they just want to celebrate themselves <malay>tak nak orang</malay> involved
like
everybody <malay>orang</malay> celebrate differently [ah] so I think it's good [lah] like you know what you want like you how you want to celebrate and that's and your friends you know that's how you want [ah] <malay>ada</malay> some people you want to celebrate they will they think that invite invite <malay>dia padahal dia tak nak</malay> celebrate they are just <malay>nak lepak kat rumah</malay>
<malay>nak tidur tu</malay> [jer] so I think I mean it's good that your friends you know what exactly like you want [ah]
so
my birthday present I think honestly now
just <malay>kasih duit</malay> [jer] I I happy don't really need to buy me stuff [ah] I think like [ah] you give me <malay>duit</malay> I I can spend myself you give me a voucher <malay>kat</malay> N_T_U_C also I happy <malay>dapat beli beli makanan makanan biskut ke apa kat rumah</malay>
so I think that will be is enough <malay>untuk</malay> like for me [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
I mean it's good [lah] you like your friends chip in everything for <malay>barang-barang</malay> for you
so I think
right your th~ th~ your this celebration is quite I mean quite interesting [lah] like like it's like it's very it's a very like emotional roller coaster ride you like you are shocked don't know what the heck you are [eh] <malay>apa</malay> like what is happening and like
<malay>tengah buat apa ni</malay> th~ what they doing [sia] you are <malay>dalam dalam hati</malay> is just <malay>takut tapi</malay> it's like excited like to find out
ya like I say [ah] <malay>duit</malay> vouchers are a good thing [ah] like I think like you know I mean they're doing it
for your friend or you like just <malay>orang</malay> just acquaintances you just <malay>tanya</malay> the mutual friend like [eh] <malay>apa dia suka</malay> [ah] like like like the person's hobby like for example like you know this person like likes to <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>pergi</malay> shopping rather you maybe buy a like get (err) voucher from zalora or something as long as I don't know I I also <malay>tak</malay> shopping <malay>banyak sangat</malay>
and ya I think the typical <malay>barang</malay> for guy is <malay>orang kasih apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kasih</malay> those perfume I guess the the they demo <malay>apa lagi</malay> (uh) they don't call it perfume <malay>dia orang panggil apa</malay> [eh] [oh] cologne [ah] cologne but I mean
I don't know [lah] <malay>jangan nak nak</malay> step <malay>atas cakap</malay> perfume <malay>sudah</malay> [lah] for me [lah] okay but
(err) <malay>tapi</malay> ya I mean for guys I think
ya the the best the most easiest I guess is a watch [lah] like <malay>senang</malay> [ah] unless <malay>orang dia macam</malay> those (uh) <malay>yang benda benda</malay> the all the watches <malay>dia dah dah dah ada</malay> rolex all the thingy thing then you then you just
alter course [lah] <malay>tak payah fikir pasal tu</malay>
[ah] ya
I mean I am okay wi~ grand if it's just the person that I want
even grand but then <malay>orang orang orang siapa</malay> [seh] <malay>ni aku tak berbual</malay> then <malay>terus</malay> it's like
it's like (err) it's like [eh] [ah] like awkward [lah] you cannot be yourself like you are they because they is grand [lah] so so <malay>orang kalau fikir</malay> okay invite <malay>orang lebih lebih padahal</malay> you want grand but then the people that you want that can be yourself <malay>tak payah tak payah</malay> no need to hide your personality <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
ya [lah] I mean but like honestly
okay that is I mean birthdays [lah] but then it's like I mean to me you <malay>fikir fikir</malay> birthday
what are you celebrating like the person's life like celebration like <malay>apa</malay> that has been going on on his life or like petty celebration of the I mean let's celebrate the longevity of the the person [lah] <malay>dah dah dah tua dah lama</malay> or you want to like celebrate whatever the person
like like what you say [lah] or whatever if the person has done but then ya [lah] but
like you have to know what the person like intention of birth~ what a birthday is [lah] for me
okay whatever you said that one <malay>orang terlalu fikir jauh sangat</malay> like you I mean like birthday birthday [ah]
<malay>tak payah nak</malay> (mm) <malay>susah sangat</malay> like what you said <malay>kalau orang nak</malay> book <malay>tempat pun</malay> as a as an example <malay>kalau</malay> the person birthday is on the december you want to book which hotel thirty first december <malay>orang orang</malay> confirm like it's gonna be fully book [lah] so it's gonna be problematic
so like I mean ya [lah] there are some people want to have the most grandest birthday <malay>nak barang-barang semua yang bagus</malay> [ah] like I mean for a celebration [lah] it's like it's a once in a lifetime
I mean birthdays [ah] once in a lifetime [ah] you can you are gonna be that age for once only (uh) unless (err) I don't know <malay>percaya</malay> reincarnation that one different topic [lah]
okay (uh) (uh) ya I guess that's <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dah nak</malay> they by their by their age
they have to know [lah] like like it's not gonna be feasible [lah] for the rest of their life if they wanna do something like often but then with his once in lifetime you let people celebrate their twenty first birthday something grand then like okay [lah] whoever their close friends planning gonna plan like really
<malay>jauh</malay> [lah] like plan ahead very far like for example birthday twenty fifth december [ah] then you have to book very early but then
<malay>banyak banyak</malay> hotel <malay>pun nak</malay> book is quite hard must be nearer to the date then it's be very very hard [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> you're not the one like celebrating an occasion some people are like christmas where or whatever else they are celebrating [ah]
so I think when it comes to birthday it's like all ultimately is do you want to grand or not
okay [lah] ya I mean ya [lah] overs~ I mean going overseas also for a holiday or a birthday trip but then ya [lah] COVID <malay>sekarang buat</malay> everything <malay>susah</malay> even
not even just <malay>nak keluar</malay> holiday like <malay>nak keluar untuk kerja</malay> overseas is like the deployment <malay>kat</malay> overseas is <malay>orang semua susah susah</malay> is like now everybody <malay>kena</malay> in singapore like thinking
th~ like they're like whether this k~ <malay>apa apa</malay> this career <malay>dia orang tengah buat</malay> is on hold <malay>pasal</malay> of a pandemic so it's like it's a big talking point [lah] not just birthdays [ah] so like all other like holidays or even like work [ah] <malay>kerja kerja</malay> critical this is a it's like a
a good (err) thing that is happe~ I I I think like it's a good thing that is happened [lah] so like <malay>orang</malay> can just reflect is this a good like like it's like reflect [ah] like in the future is this [ah] like like you have to have a contingency plan ahead <malay>jauh jauh lain</malay> [ah]
I mean the furthest I went <malay>paling jauh</malay> is U like U_S the L_A I went to that was <malay>bila kecil-kecil</malay> [ah] los angeles that was during winter I was I was only like four years old so I don't really remember <malay>apa yang</malay> I did
but I think when it comes to like if I were to choose a place to go out maybe not just birthday [lah] a holiday or something [eh]
I think I will most probably do something
like maybe like if
like I would think or maybe going to east west of like of the U_S like a road trip or just maybe just like go japan north to south that's that's what I would do [lah] a road trip
I mean it helps [lah] you you got you like you already plan [lah] <malay>nak pergi</malay> okay okay I want <malay>aku nak pergi jepun</malay> so I want to like at least <malay>belajar</malay> a bit a bit of keep like a keywords like
#taberu# <malay>makan</malay> like like all those [ah] keyword like #taberu# <malay>makan</malay> and [ah] #coco desuka# like <malay>ni nak pergi</malay> (err) like go where <malay>nak pergi mana</malay> go where some something like that [lah] so I think and when it comes to
food like what you say halal okay ya it's very hard [lah] <malay>nak cari makan makanan</malay> halal but then
I mean <malay>yang</malay> the big staple food there is you can just I mean <malay>minta</malay> so I guess <malay>ikan</malay> sushi <malay>nasi</malay> and one
I mean #hokkaido# no the highest I've been of in like the altitude is I think is only #yokohama# th~ that [eh] no th~ [oh] no #tokyo# is <malay>lagi tinggi dari</malay> #yokohama# so no that's the highest I've been is to to~ #tokyo# so but
I think #hokkaido# <malay>tempat tempatnya</malay> ya is I mean from what we know as been advertise that their whole their what they're known for is
their I guess their ice cream and stuff [ah] <malay>benda-benda</malay> cream is usually <malay>benda-benda yang sejuk-sejuk</malay> I mean that that that latitude <malay>tinggi-tinggi pun memang</malay> understandable [lah] so ya I mean #hokkaido# is when it comes to <malay>makanan tempat benda sejuk</malay> [lah] dessert
I think it's not also just that [lah] I mean you also <malay>tempat</malay>
where there their place is like like even like you can say the japanese also <malay>dia orang pun cantik juga</malay> I mean their complexion is there <malay>tempat pasal</malay> there <malay>tempat sejuk</malay> if it's cold then you don't really sweat much <malay>tempat</malay> so it depends [ah]
I mean that's understandable [lah] you see <malay>orang-orang yang mat salleh orang</malay> those <malay>memang</malay> the further north
further like whiter they are I mean and when it comes to nearer to the equator you gonna be much more darker [lah] it's I think that one is like it has been for so long already and just that now people are more migrating more so it's a different more complexion
but the percentage point <malay>tak tinggi sangat</malay> [lah] so it's ya [lah] I mean that is all geography geographical location which is depends [ah]
honestly I think it's a waste of money <malay>orang</malay> like I think singaporeans is always
they have a or like they call it fomo fear of missing out it's like it's just <malay>takut</malay> [eh] <malay>orang</malay> also <malay>pergi</malay> then I never <malay>pergi</malay> it's like I cannot talk about it [sial] <malay>berbual abeh</malay> then they just they don't they just want to go just for just to make sure people know that <malay>dia orang dah pergi</malay> so that can talk
[oh]
okay ya so ya [lah] I mean wait this six hundred is a lot [lah] so
this is a this six hundred like what you say is a lot <malay>untuk nak anuh dah</malay> just for a very premium dining experience which is I think it's quite I don't know for me quite ri~ <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] <malay>orang nak belanja</malay> then up to them
