COVID situation
I don't know [ah] okay <malay>sekarang sekarang</malay> (err) I'm in army [kan] so
but the same for you [lah] you're also in army right so (err) it's just S_D_M [ah] social distancing
okay
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] what are we doing now
okay understand
(mm)
ya
ya I think <malay>sekarang sudah tak boleh tak boleh pergi</malay>
like you cannot go places a lot of places [ah] <malay>banyak banyak banyak tempat tak boleh pergi</malay>
<malay>atau dia punya ada</malay> limit
<malay>ada</malay> limit to entry [ah]
(err) <malay>kalau</malay> [ah] <malay>se~ tak tak tak sekarang masih masih</malay> five <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>sampai seratus</malay>
(mm) <malay>bukan</malay> [ah]
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
I don't know but I think <malay>tengok tengok apa</malay> like <malay>o~ orang lain yang</malay> instagram stories <malay>nampak</malay>
<malay>ada ramai orang cakap tak ada</malay> in the same venue <malay>tapi</malay>
they take turns [ah] like in six
so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam pagi</malay> family then (err) <malay>petang</malay> just <malay>kawan-kawan dengan</malay> friends
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see [lah]
ya
(mm)
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>iya ke</malay>
(uh huh)
(uh huh) (uh) (mm) [ah]
(mm)
[ah] yours is [ah] that <malay>yang yang jemputan</malay>
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
[oh] actually [ah]
[ah] okay okay good
okay [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah] evening <malay>semalam</malay> only <malay>semalam</malay> I posted about it
(err)
I don't [ah] nothing much about it it's to me it's (err) quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause (err)
I post that like the last thing I said was (err) it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> it's a bit contradictory
[ah] paradoxical [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay>
(err)
like it it
automa~ because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself [ah]
really your P_S_L_E score
really [ah] I see
[ah] I haven't seen that
[ah] same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school (err) to secondary school [lah]
as of time
ya ultimately (uh) what happens (err)
what secondary school the person goes to will affect thei~ their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about (err) that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
(uh huh)
(err) these days like
<malay>macam</malay> (err)
<malay>memang</malay> I don't keep myself up to date that much
like I don't read the news
ya
[ah]
[ah] (uh huh) <malay>memang memang betul betul</malay>
ya
basically that's the thing
(mm)
(err) okay
I <malay>sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang</malay> [kan]
es~ okay <malay>kalau tengok</malay> in army in army
<malay>berbeza kalau</malay> compared to police <malay>dengan</malay> S_P_F <malay>itu memang</malay>
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army [kan]
ultimately what S_A_F is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
<malay>macam</malay> for example pack
<malay>lapan</malay> pack
or
fireworks
I guess
so
<malay>sekali dengan</malay> diagnose [ah]
[ah] <malay>pasal</malay> for us like
(err) we come from J_C then
<malay>kita memang tak banyak apa berbual dengan apa orang lain</malay> [lah]
we just talk to our own people [lah]
[ah] own circle [lah] ya [oh] ya
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
ya these two years not wasted
<malay>satu tahun belum lepas kau nak</malay> two years okay okay <malay>tak apa</malay>
ya so far
ya [ah]
ya (err)
for some people <malay>kalau</malay> they didn't go to N_S
<malay>dia orang memang</malay> won't have the opportunity to
(err) <malay>jumpa orang lain</malay> [ah]
so unless they went out of their way today
(uh huh)
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>betul betul</malay> actually it's actually true [ah]
(mm)
do anything else
ya true
[ah] ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in N_S [lah]
but even in N_S you can do stuff outside N_S you can learn other skills in your free time [ah] if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
then (err) as I was saying [ah] in army is <malay>penat</malay> so
(err) so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
(err) which wouldn't be applicable [lah] cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn (err) can be applicable [lah]
(err) recently I went through this (uh) ammunition course
then (err)
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff [ah] (err) stuff related to storage
and (uh) inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
(err)
going out with my family that rarely happens
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang suka buat dengan</malay> family [ah]
<malay>kalau tak tak kalau dengan</malay> family for me [kan] it's just <malay>pergi makan</malay> [lah]

ya that's good
[ah]
[a'ah] ya really
[ah]
ya

(mm)
good point ya the thing with me is that I have

every time I go home he always
ask me questions about (err) when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one [ah] like that (err)
ya but during B_M_T (err) during B_M_T
he always ya that was the time when he compared the most because (err) <malay>pasal ada apa</malay>

[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the most recent batch they did (err) twenty four K_M
in #tekong# ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
[ah] for for us [kan] <malay>bila kita</malay> pass by
(err) #changi# #changi# <malay>apa tu</malay>
usually #changi# <malay>ke</malay> east coast <malay>ada</malay> hawker center
hawker center [ah]
east coast [kan] east coast <malay>yang ada satay itu semua</malay>
ya
they were like [oh] thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits [lah] we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but (um) is to is to
yes
ya B_M_T
[ah] that's a good point ya they just did
ya
[ah] nine weeks and then next one nine months [lah]
[ah] [eh] I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you [oh] you're going to talk about the pay [kan]
so (err) to me okay
<malay>jangan cakap</malay> pay [ah] you know it's more like a
allowance <malay>macam macam</malay> your parents give you during school
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
like for me for us it should be I think <malay>pasal</malay>
(err) back in J_C [kan] my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but dude I don't understand why <malay>kenapa sekarang</malay>
<malay>sampai sembilan ratus pun</malay>
<malay>tak sampai dua minggu boleh habis</malay> I don't get it
but it's okay
[ah] okay
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>senang apa</malay>
[ah] same
[ah]
[ah] <malay>itu pun sekali</malay> [ah]
(mm) that's the thing <malay>pasal</malay>
(err) for a lot of people [kan] <malay>pasal masih muda</malay>
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending [lah]
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
for the most part they can like <malay>beli baju ke beli</malay>
<malay>makan makan</malay> more extravagant more extravagantly than you normally would [lah]
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
[oh] no me too
(mm)
(mm)
ya
same
yes yes [oh] my god
[oh]
election [ah]
ya
ya that's how it is but (uh) personally I also don't
(err) I don't follow that much
(err) I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates [ah] [oh] my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about N_B_A but then N_B_A finished already
so now they're talking about elections [kan] every day they will talk about stocks
!wah! buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive [eh] [ah] this one going up the percentages all
ya and (err)
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good [lah] I think it's good that
(err) more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in N_S you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's a good thing [ah] that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we (err) get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good [lah]
but the thing is that after this
after these two years of <malay>apa</malay> earning money
we're going to go through how many years
at least <malay>empat</malay> at least four years of uni for some of us [ah] especially J_C kids [ah]
and then <malay>apa</malay> during these four years <malay>kita</malay>
confirm <malay>tak akan tak akan</malay> make that much money [ah]
as in unless you do a side job [ah] side hustle <malay>ke apa</malay>
(err)
you have to
I have to find a way to either make money or just I don't know I'm personally
going to try and rely on a scholarship <malay>atau kalau tak</malay>
no I don't want to burden my parents like honestly I don't want to burden my parents
<malay>dia orang sudah banyak banyak</malay> give me money [lah]
like they're going to sponsor my I mean okay driving license is not that much [ah]
but they've been sponsoring my whole life honestly
so
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> I would get a scholarship
for uni so they don't have to fork out more money for now
and uni <malay>bukan murah</malay>
depends [ah] especially <malay>kalau nak nak nak</malay> stay in hall (uh huh) stay in hall
ya so
ya
<malay>mana kau</malay> deal <malay>dengan</malay> [ah] some [oh]
okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] <malay>habis</malay>
ya
(mm)
[ah] <malay>betul</malay> [ah] saying this do you have a plan
personally I I
I aim to at least save a excess of five K (err) by the end of N_S
(err) s~ because I I've I've made a lot of plans [ah] like I have the investments
and then I also signed up
I got I got tricked into no okay not tricked I got lured into
signing a deal with A_I_A investment savings plan
insurance [oh] my gosh yes
<malay>jadi</malay> so it's like
a few bucks okay [lah] about a hundred every every month
that they will take
then save it saves more than a bank of course anything saves better than a bank honestly
interest rates well
so ya just apply and then
other than that I don't know what to do
like maybe I should also start taking down
(err) how much I spend
that will be better right
yes
(mm) okay
(mm)
yes
(mmhmm) thinking about it's
it's a rookie work yes it's realistic

ya reading and writing doing exercise for five hours and then after that
because I need to eat I will go out and eat
