of course these are all <malay>syirik</malay> but
no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places [what]
all the haunted places
then that time I I tell I thought I told you before
then I when (um) they say always go in even numbers right went in odd
then I was the only girl and I was having my menses
then <malay>semua kena kacau</malay>
except for me
ya like <malay>kena tarik kaki</malay> then like
<malay>mak kau terkejut aku</malay> I also don't know [sia]
then they ask me [eh] <malay>kau pakai barang</malay> [eh] then I was like
<malay>pakai barang apa</malay> [sia]
then after that
<malay>antara kita semua</malay>
high likely <malay>kau yang patut kena kacau asal kita orang pula yang kena</malay>
<malay>kau tak kena langsung</malay> and the thing is while while we were there there's like (um)
a veranda
out on level two or level three then we were just there sitting to smoke first [ah] before going down back because the place was like super horrible with a lot of broken glasses and such
then while sitting there a black figure was
like
you know I can feel all these right
and and the black figure
all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung (uh)
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
then the rest was just standing around then <malay>dia dekat atas</malay> like
over over me and my friend so I was like they said <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tu benda kau punya</malay> then I was like

people beside me and
out of out of like
we went <malay>satu dua tiga empat</malay> (uh) five of us right
three of them can see things
then then they saw [ah] they saw <malay>kakak</malay> they saw <malay>itu</malay> they saw <malay>ini</malay>
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
that his mum [lah] [kan] <malay>nenek bising cakap apa</malay>
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
(mm) what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
keep on <malay>suruh-suruh</malay>
[ah]
then like [eh]
<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay> like [eh] if I got a husband
like keep on asking me to <malay>buat tu buat ni buat tu buat ni</malay> and he's just sitting there and smoking like I will fucking slap his face with a broom [sia] and I ask for a divorce
I don't know
should we go to <malay>ustaz</malay> and ask
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
<malay>kita memang kena patut pun</malay>
<malay>ustaz kena bayar ke</malay>
not really <malay>salah bawa</malay> [lah]
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not
