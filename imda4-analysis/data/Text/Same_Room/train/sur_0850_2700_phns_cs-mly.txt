<malay>kenapa</malay>
but <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>terkeluar</malay> Zoom
I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
okay <malay>tak apa</malay> I I <malay>ajar</malay> you <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> Zoom <malay>dulu</malay> cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
okay <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under N_U_S the N_U_S under school so I <malay>punya</malay> sign in is just under sign in with S_S_O <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> personal I would think you have to (um) sign in <malay>pakai</malay>
your own email [lah] <malay>tak</malay> okay but let's just pretend <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> your own email okay
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to (um) another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
(mm)
okay so like <malay>selalunya</malay> when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will <malay>macam</malay> send you a link [kan] then like from from the link you you just
op~ click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you [ah] they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
select you can see like my background <malay>kat sini</malay> [kan] you it's <malay>apa</malay> (um) it's virtual screen so <malay>maknanya</malay> my background <malay>takleh nampak</malay> [lah]
[ah] so
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> messy <malay>kalau</malay>
yes ya
so you can change like your virtual background [ah] at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I <malay>selalu pakai</malay> virtual background cause <malay>belakang</malay> messy [kan] so I don't want to like show my background so <malay>kalau</malay> it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
then you can you can use their (err)
<malay>tak ni dah</malay> log in <malay>dah</malay>
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you [lah] I'm not sure about your personal [one] but my school [one] has like
(um) my school's background
so (uh) you can also add in your own photo so for me I <malay>macam</malay> I create I even created my own background just to
<malay>bagi lawa</malay> [lah] so I I use this
<malay>tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni</malay> [kan] it's
(err) you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show [lah]
(mm)
K
so background is done and then (um) <malay>apa lagi nak tahu</malay>
(mm)
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet <malay>dengan</malay> iPad I think [ah] ya
so when you click share screen right
I'm not sure about (um) <malay>apa</malay> and~ not android <malay>apa nama dia</malay> Windows <malay>punya</malay> laptop but
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
so <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>pakai</malay> desktop [kan]
it will show everything that I go
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp <malay>punya</malay> web
everybody can see that
but
ya but if I <malay>pakai</malay> if I choose the Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> [kan]
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
so even <malay>kalau macam</malay> I <malay>tengah pakai</malay> Google chrome <malay>lepas tu</malay> I open WhatsApp web
<malay>dia tak akan nampak</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> (err) window
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share [lah] share
so like this would be hard <malay>macam</malay> (uh) once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just (um)
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
[ah] you stop share [lah]
ya so you just stop share
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know <malay>selalu macam</malay>
you <malay>selalu cakap</malay> then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper <malay>orang boleh dengar</malay>
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
and then it goes the same for the video [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your video <malay>takde</malay> they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me <malay>dalam</malay> class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak yang tunjuk</malay> you <malay>tadi</malay>
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say (um) they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that [one] is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad <malay>dia akan tanya kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay>
allow
<malay>macam</malay> for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers <malay>tadi</malay> (um)
she chose don't allow
so even <malay>kalau</malay> even <malay>kalau dia</malay>
pick the stop video I mean I mean [ah] like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> video [kan]
(uh) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
actually you can see yourself [lah] <malay>kat tepi</malay>
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are <malay>apa</malay> the video is done I mean the video is off
<malay>apa</malay> done
(mm)
and then other basic things is like <malay>macam</malay>
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
raise up your hands or (err) <malay>apa</malay>
thumbs up thumbs down
okay I don't really have it [oh] <malay>dengan</malay> yes no
okay so they will just ask [oh] [ah] who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just <malay>angkat tangan</malay>
<malay>tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini</malay> [lah]
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands (uh) put down your hands yes no
(err) thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs [ah] hands up
ya usually at the participants area [lah]
ya then like just now you can like
<malay>apa</malay> rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want #siti# instead
so #siti# ya and then other basic things is (err) okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
so record is just you <malay>boleh tengok balik</malay> [lah] the recording
okay so you can choose between like (err) record on your laptop or record on cloud
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you rec~ if you record <malay>macam macam</malay> that time I conduct my master classes right
and then I had to record the classes
[ah] I chose
the first mistake was I chose (uh) to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
<malay>macam</malay> movie <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so so I had to I had to
<malay>apa</malay>
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then <malay>susah</malay> [lah]
ya then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I just (um) I tried out (uh) record on cloud
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
then <malay>orang akan</malay> just
ya <malay>orang akan</malay> be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
(mm) ya
and then some basic things like chat
chat [ah] okay cause <malay>ni tak ada</malay> participants <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] so
(mm) then you know you can change (err) to everyone <malay>ataupun</malay> to a specific person
(mm) <malay>tak boleh</malay>
<malay>takleh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap yang</malay> like what like the host who
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host (uh) even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer <malay>kat dalam kelas</malay> [lah] ya
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which (err) will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
(uh) instead of everyone there's like person [ah] other people's name all the participants' name [lah] then they will have like bracket privately
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message [kan] you have to make sure <malay>yang apa</malay> you you click back to everyone
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages (uh) your and messages <malay>apa</malay> to everyone
it will be altogether
ya so you just have to <malay>macam baca betul-betul</malay> [lah] like which one is everyone which one is to you only
(mm) ya but that's just like
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to <malay>apa</malay> to to my friend [ah]
(mm) other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
breakout rooms is just (uh) <malay>macam tadi</malay> you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of <malay>macam</malay>
forty people
<malay>lepas tu orang tu nak</malay> breakout into smaller groups to do group work
so I will just
<malay>macam</malay> create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>tengah tengah tengok</malay>
I'll just be like (err) there will just be a notification that pops out (uh) proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait [lah]
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
(mm)
(mm) I guess so [lah] but like
cause
cause for adults I don't think you guys <malay>pakai</malay> much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks <malay>apa</malay>
I get
ya so if you like (uh) if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say <malay>macam</malay> I conduct my fundraising master classes [kan] the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just (err)
it will just be somewhere here [lah]
like ya
(mm) I think it's better than <malay>apa</malay> what's the other option the outlook is it live live
google meet or live outlook something like that [lah]
(mm)
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal I_D then you just copy and send to people [lah]
(mm)
but just now you had you had something on
<malay>ada apa</malay>
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
but it's so <malay>susah</malay> just now
(mm) but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no but like but like what was your <malay>apa</malay> what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room <malay>ada</malay> virtual
I <malay>tak</malay>
I <malay>tak pernah pergi</malay> [lah] but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries [lah]
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi susah tak</malay>
[ah]
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay> it's the starting of the
[oh]
I mean technically it's in the poem also [what] so like even if you <malay>baca</malay> like
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
but this is done by the escape room <malay>punya punya</malay> company [lah]
[oh] so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator <malay>macam</malay> team bonding facilitator right
!huh!
the gavin (err)
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation [what]
[oh] then the escape room is they create or what
cause cause got my for my global studies <malay>punya apa</malay>
welfare pack [kan] everything is online now [what] so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
no it's like <malay>macam</malay> okay basically if it's physical [kan] in school then they will give you like nearing to exams [lah] <malay>macam</malay> your <malay>apa</malay> midterms or your final year then they will give you like (err) a literal goody bag
then inside <malay>macam ada</malay> foolscap <malay>ada</malay> snacks <malay>ada</malay> like ya then like all these are like
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
(err) <malay>apa</malay> get
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff [ah]
promote [ah] sponsorship [ah] sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship [lah] but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty <malay>punya</malay> goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small <malay>apa</malay> faculty group [kan]
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with [lah] so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like (err) cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical [one] or something like that but like
<malay>tapi lima orang apa</malay>
maybe maybe ya then they
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but (um) is to try out our <malay>apa</malay>
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather (um) if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
(um) room <malay>punya</malay> fee
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay [what] to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that [lah]
<malay>tak tak tak kita</malay> play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you <malay>nak orang</malay> (uh) you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want [what] [kan] ya
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
you have to source out for the for the people [lah] but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android <malay>punya</malay> phone
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried [lah] we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
and then cause at first they tried to <malay>apa</malay>
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that [lah] like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
(mm)
and then like initially I wanted to
(uh) produce like three different
E-vouchers for <malay>apa</malay> three different sect~ three different categories <malay>macam</malay> welfare [eh] welfare <malay>pula</malay> beauty (uh) food and <malay>macam</malay> activities [lah] like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end <malay>macam</malay> I think they just decided
to produce one instead
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to <malay>macam</malay> we tried to
engage in home-based businesses
<malay>tapi tu pun susah</malay>
like it was supposed to be
release
[oh] it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships <malay>tak</malay> reply cause COVID <malay>sekarang</malay> then even their organisations not doing well <malay>apa</malay> the companies not doing well
like even like activity <malay>punya</malay> entertainment places <malay>pun tak</malay> not
they open [lah] but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
(err) we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
ya then now I just finished my fundraising <malay>punya</malay> series [oh]
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
!woohoo!
ya our target was four hundred dollars
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first <malay>macam kita</malay>
we just like no confidence [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>susah</malay>
four courses [a'ah]
(err) each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my (um)
(uh) members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism [lah] he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also <malay>macam</malay> donate in bulks [what] like you and mama
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
seventy per cent seventy per cent <malay>pula</malay> seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot [what]
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half [lah] like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible [what] it's not to rely on like
just you <malay>sorang</malay> [jer]
[kan] so like that's what he said [lah] he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
(mm) but ya not not there yet not as
(mmhmm) (mm)
ya then we're like that's quite true [lah]
(um) no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is [oh] third is excel and forth is (um)
<malay>apa</malay> embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think <malay>macam</malay> is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that [one] a bit but in the end (err) a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class <malay>macam</malay> it's not that bad [lah] ya
cause it was still <malay>macam ramai</malay> then she was like [oh] my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like [oh] [ha] [ha] [ha] <malay>nasib baik</malay> cause there's only like
three people <malay>yang</malay> sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people <malay>yang</malay> sign up
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like (err) in our faculty there was there's another group
[oh] by the way I won a giveaway from them
from the faculty <malay>punya</malay> group
ya it's a just a makeup set [lah] ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
[oh] ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
[oh] at first he I don't really know him but I just <malay>tahu pasal</malay> he lives in my R_C for
ya
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance <malay>macam</malay> I saw his (uh)
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time <malay>pasal</malay>
[ah] this excel course [lah] <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> and I wanted to join that time <malay>tapi</malay> I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course [lah] ya
and then fast forward (err)
I was <malay>dengan tengah</malay> planning for this fundraising I was thinking like (hmm) like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> I think
like
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
not hands-on <malay>macam</malay> very practical skills that people would need <malay>macam</malay> in their workplaces in their school right
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him [lah] I was like [oh] will you be interested [oh] I ask his number from my friend and then after that [ah] I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
he was just like ya sure sure <malay>lepas tu</malay> I I went to find out (err) he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like [oh] my god so <malay>kesian</malay> then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
[ah] but ya it's just it's
<malay>dah</malay> I told him already but
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
two and half cause the maximum <malay>kita anuh</malay> is
(uh) two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like (uh) extra class notes and he even like answered (err) post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
[oh] but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like D_B_S
and like
ya and he
[oh] he was (err) he was chosen for D_B_S and Facebook or something like that like I know like (uh) ya
prestigious one [lah] but then
but he in the end he chose like D_B_S I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
(mm) really [meh]
(mm) okay [lah] ya I guess
but he's really smart I'm just like !wow!
how is someone that smart
ya
<malay>esok ada apa</malay>

there's like a bar right
ya like it's a
a hawker semi bar kind of place ya
(mm) no but I just do my assignments like I'm swamp with assignments now
(err) <malay>pasal</malay> it's this semester is all online [kan] I didn't even step in school like for one moment
[ah] it's focus more if your if your room is conducive [lah] but
no but like
I don't know like I felt I felt like you get burnout quite easily if you
stay at home a lot and cause for me I don't even go out at all [what] I never go out to study I didn't even go out like back to school to like cause all my friends
(err) go back to school to study <malay>apa</malay>
no at first cannot <malay>sekarang dah boleh</malay>
but <malay>jauh</malay>
no but like over there I guess it's conducive quite a little bit conducive I don't know I don't know but
but like
so many places
where you tell me where
you <malay>boleh</malay> #tampines# hub is the most not conducive environment ever
like I don't even know how people study in #tampines# hub
it's so <malay>bising</malay> you ever went there before
the basement [kan] you're talking about the basement right
it's so <malay>bising</malay> like the there's a playground I mean if you go there like two A_M that you know that kind of like hours like no more shops then okay [lah] understand but like
ya the N_T_U_C is twenty four hours [what]
ya I mean how can people go inside N_T_U_C without going inside the area
ya
but it's not conducive and then people study like outside <malay>yang kat atas semua</malay> it's so hard
[oh] no cause COVID then now they
[oh] but library now they open
I think
#bugis# the national library and like some bigger national libraries like #tampines# library they open like
for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online [lah]
but like two hours <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>sikit</malay> if I want to study there
ya and then <malay>nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun</malay>
like I don't mind studying outside but
some establishments <malay>macam</malay> Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is [oh] my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that [one] my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams (err) assignments to do
six
all different [lah] so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
<malay>tapi</malay> it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
twenty four hours [ah]
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam (err) my job <malay>punya</malay> module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to <malay>cam</malay> use all these
your laptop <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can [lah] but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you [lah] but
even if you have friends <malay>macam</malay>
#paiseh# [kan] <malay>nak tanya</malay>
like it's not not
#neh#
no but it was
it was so much time [lah] I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
!huh!
<malay>cakap apa</malay>
no [lah]
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
[oh] you look at
exactly ya
so it's usually like like <malay>apa</malay> a combination of (err) topics
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
[oh] no but
but one thing bad about online school was that (err)
[orh] okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module [lah] but
[ah] generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought <malay>macam lebih lebih bagus</malay> [ah]
no the answer is no
[oh] that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
(uh) non exam modules and two exams <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> happy [lah] !yay! three three modules no exam
[ah] <malay>ambil kau semua</malay> submission at the same time cause usually
like (err)
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually [lah] (err) the <malay>macam apa</malay> submission the deadline is
about the same so let's say
in this (uh) my first mod then my second mod right I have like (um) my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
<malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [lah] but it's just like that [ah]
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
(um) let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
but the assignment like most of my assignments here (um) especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating <malay>nya</malay> assignment
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like [eh] it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like !yay! no exam fun [what] then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like !huh! why I never knew until I experience it
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy <malay>punya</malay> mod
and my major (err)
my major <malay>apa</malay>
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words [lah]
so you you <malay>bayangkan</malay> I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
<malay>semua</malay> yes you see
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major [one]
and then two thirteen november okay then this [one] is okay [lah] relax [lah]
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same <malay>sama-sama</malay>
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two [lah] but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam [what] like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time [lah] then now I think
some period
<malay>macam</malay> now
now and
two [eh] no week six that's the crazy period [lah] cause that's the like now now is my #chiong# period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster [lah]
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you <malay>tak percaya</malay> you <malay>tanya kak</malay> #shima# the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
that's that
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just <malay>belajar</malay> for that one
(uh) like you <malay>belajar</malay> for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
I just got my I just go my <malay>apa</malay>
(err) result for my which one
my G_L four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay>
twenty third november <malay>baru</malay> end
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you [lah]
ya
!huh!
[oh] no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments [kan]
then cause different assignments is different weightages <malay>apa</malay>
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case [lah] cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
like like I think it's cause <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
<malay>mesti</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !huh!
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that [what] then I think they don't want [lah]
ya but
I guess it's it's okay [lah]
like
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we <malay>dapat</malay> results you <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did [lah]
ya
ya
it's like
<malay>lagi cepat</malay> stress
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni [lah] I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my C_A_P
cause when you freeze your C_A_P then cause of my C_A_P now is is okay [lah] I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
you <malay>naik</malay> year three year four it gets harder and harder [what] you have to take harder modules [kan]
ya and then after that
I just want to <malay>macam</malay> freeze my C_A_P [lah] so that it won't <malay>macam tak turun tak naik</malay> I mean I mean <malay>naik</malay> is possible it's very hard for you to <malay>naik</malay> [lah] honestly
ya <malay>tak turun</malay> [lah] basically
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
(mm)
(mm)
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like [oh]
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
(uh) our sem two [kan] sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email [lah] they said like [oh] like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no vac~ cause they were I think
<malay>dorang nak tunggu</malay> vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already [lah] but unfortunately <malay>tak ada</malay> vaccine
so they said cannot [lah] like
I think only countries to europe
asia and U_S
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there [lah]
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round <malay>punya dah</malay> actually <malay>dah tutup</malay>
but then they just <malay>buka balik</malay> then they said [oh] it's until [oh] it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
ya
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so <malay>macam tak kira kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything [lah]
but the thing is my
my major <malay>punya</malay> requirement is that
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like <malay>macam</malay> group work
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again [lah] cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out [lah] I <malay>tak boleh pergi</malay> [lah]
(mm) so sem one but my course my my major <malay>ada</malay> this requirement that you <malay>kena ambil</malay> this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so <malay>kalau</malay> you miss out in sem one <malay>tak boleh ambil</malay> in sem two [jer] [tau]
you have to wait
you have to wait another year [lah] so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do (um) online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause (uh) you're it's actually taking
two (uh) <malay>apa</malay> different modules from two different universities
right
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a <malay>macam</malay> group work <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no it's not
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with (um) just like (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
(uh) doing online <malay>kalau boleh</malay>
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if (uh)
they don't let
if you are <malay>apa namanya</malay> I lost my train of thoughts already <malay>ayah</malay> keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling <malay>pula</malay> it's actually trying to like
take two different (err) from two different schools <malay>macam macam mana</malay> you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck (lah) we just we just trying to ask but
I don't really have hope <malay>yang kita akan pergi</malay> [lah] cause it's ya it's quite hard
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then (um) the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is <malay>macam tak baik</malay> [lah] like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
and obviously the school will not allow it [lah]
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
no <malay>kalau kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> one <malay>kalau</malay> one year then I won't [lah] like no and and it's not just them it's like
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore [what] if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can [lah] which is damn unfair cause it's just like
the faculty I mean my major <malay>macam</malay> just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
[eh]
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous [lah]
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
but the the new application <malay>yang dorang kasi</malay> it's more
<malay>apa</malay> there's more options [ah]
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
<malay>kena</malay> submit <malay>lagi</malay> [ah]
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first [ah] so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject <malay>apa</malay> and you and you won't
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options [ah] to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay [lah] no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now [what] it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
you've been looking forward to this but <malay>nasib baik</malay> I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what <malay>takde</malay>
know like <malay>kak</malay> #shima# stay in the hall everything
[oh] ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision [what] remember
like for me to enter my my R_C
but ya [oh] did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know [lah]
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report [lah]
ya but no the thing is
what it what people are mad about is like <malay>macam</malay> the the college <malay>tak</malay>
they don't they don't <malay>dia tak</malay> relay <malay>apa-apa</malay>
(mm) like cause some people notice like
only after two weeks they reported <malay>baru ada</malay> like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
the <malay>laki</malay> [lah]
then like people like
it took two weeks just to <malay>macam</malay> do something then that speaks a lot [what]
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything [lah]
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know [ah] just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni</malay>
<malay>jap jap</malay> and then after that like they and then we were like
(uh) what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release (err) a statement [lah] saying like [oh] increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for N_U_S again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know [lah] look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
(um) my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know <malay>macam</malay> sensation [lah] like the media just wants to like keep on (uh) saying [oh] N_U_S N_U_S again
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like [oh] like it only happens in N_U_S everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous [lah]
no but but in but <malay>kita punya</malay> people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report [lah] like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic [ah]
like everytime another one comes and then like (uh) yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that [what]
