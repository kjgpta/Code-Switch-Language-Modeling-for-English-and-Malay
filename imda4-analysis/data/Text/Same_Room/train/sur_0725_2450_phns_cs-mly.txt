toilet recording all the most of the toilet recording incidents right
all happened [ah]
like you know
is most of them right that make the news [ah] is all
it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in N_T_U you know then (err)
and this is not the fir~ and I mean there's been one or two cases right very very recently that they just brought up
that was just that was just brought up
then (err) but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago [ah]

it's always guy on guy it's guy <malay>macam</malay> there's a recent rise right on guy on guy crime
and some more it's in N_T_U you know how embarrassing
no [lah] but
no [lah] but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in N_T_U you know shit
so <malay>macam</malay> it it it kind of pisses me off [ah]
no
but then again but but then again but then again
(err) most of the
(err) most of the incidents takes pl~ (err) take place in [ah]
hostel <malay>punya</malay> the hostel environment [ah]
whereas the places where I
patron right (err)
the toilets where I go to [ah] they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they (uh) most of them
ya most of the incidents happen at hostel <malay>punya</malay> area do you know that do you know that
(err) some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge [ah]
I'm not too sure about this [lah] I can't confirm but
there are some right where
(err)
I think this [one] also depends on the price of your accommodation [ah]
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a <malay>ken~</malay>
I really really needed to take to take a piss <malay>nak cepat-cepat kencing</malay> and it really cannot <malay>tahan punya</malay>
so
(err)
we wanted to use the complex <malay>punya</malay> toilet right but there was so many people
and then a lot of people were still there so <malay>macam</malay> we like
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
bro bro bro bro bro <malay>aku nak pakai</malay> toilet bro bro bro then he was a malay guy he was like okay okay okay <malay>kau tunggu kejap kau tunggu kejap</malay> so he actually
so the guy actually (err) took I still remember you (err) he had the
<malay>kunci</malay> he had the key inside (err) he had the key on the rubber band [ah] then he like
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I ente~ I entered [ah] so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
(err)
you know that like single floor toilet [ah]
it's just a
it com~ commune toilet [ah] communal toilet [ah] that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why [lah] people
(err) those #pervs# right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense [ah]
in a sense yes last time (err) in a sense yes last time <malay>abang abang</malay> #han# [ah] he's the one who told me
he was the one who told me [kan] <malay>yang</malay>
(um) there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a C_C_A
second if you don't have a C_C_A you need to (uh) (err)
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame [ah] (err) that's lame [lah] (uh) I
I for one right can tell them to <malay>kirim salam</malay> [lah]
then (uh) I'll probably tell them to <malay>kirim salam</malay> (uh) but
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but cu~ currently it's no longer the case already like
(uh) for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you [ah]
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know C_C_A and then sweat your punk ass
and then (err) like or hall activities [ah] like
!yay! sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey [ah] it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time (err)
(err) they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts [ah]
so they had I swear to you [ah] it was really cringey
(err) they had those like (err) orientation games [ah] then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they (uh) like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey [lah]
who the hell is running man
who is running man

I don't know [lah] you kids these days right <malay>korang anak-anak zaman sekarang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa nak cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>kau orang</malay>
