cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too [lah] so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money [lah] I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty R_M
thirty R_M bath bombs so
(uh) that okay that was the second night when we decided to (um) buy the bath bombs and

[ah]
but
we didn't think much [lah] cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right

I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me (um) what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something [lah]
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes

(uh) another bed
so that the <malay>kakak</malay> so that the sister can sleep no nobody is separated from each other
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes

cause she actually had a history of like
(um) this this kind of thing [ah] ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
(um) she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually (uh) on the left
it's a big mirror with (um) a shelf and actually that shelf is <malay>berabuk</malay> already but I didn't but for me <malay>berabuk</malay> is
(um)
for me <malay>berabuk</malay>
was the bed
was the mattress

okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
(um) dusty
nothing else (um) was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty

I
think (uh) occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor

we already at that point
we were like
(um) in our heart [lah] we're like

(uh) this is the

ya but then we didn't think cause (uh) it was like five thirty A_M in the morning who cares whether the room is who who cares the the room is high or low we just want our bed [ah]

<malay>ahli yang lain</malay> so what she was trying to say is that that hotel was known to be haunted where people actually killed themselves and know do [ah] they they hang themselves okay technically they kill themselves inside the hotel there were a lot of like scenarios in hotel so what the hotel C_E_O did was

this year january was with my cousins
[oh] only sixteen twenty
that (uh) definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like

but it's a very famous hotel [seh]
speaking of <malay>orang kaya</malay>
<malay>kita tak ada jiran</malay>
[ah] okay <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>setahu kita kita takde jiran</malay>
<malay>tapi kita selalu dengar macam</malay> (uh) <malay>macam kita dengar benda</malay> [lah]
<malay>kita boleh dengar benda</malay>
<malay>tapi kita tahu kita takde jiran</malay>
okay <malay>bilik kita bilik hujung</malay>
corner corner
okay the the floor
okay the okay <malay>bilik</malay> the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
so the the the hotel very big right
(uh) the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
(uh)
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like (um) kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how <malay>orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu</malay>
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
(uh) we couldn't be bothered [lah] cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
<malay>leceh</malay> [seh]
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
<malay>kita tak kesah sebab kita malas nak</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>nak angkut barang-barang kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> okay <malay>kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kat depan</malay>
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work [ah] we we we like (err) don't want [ah] we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in K_L and we could have been to #krabi# if not cause of this COVID
[ah] it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
we still when when we we <malay>kita</malay> share when <malay>kita kongsi</malay> story (uh) <malay>cerita ni dengan</malay> (um)
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us (uh)
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were (uh)
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think [lah]
[eh] ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal [one]
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
the shopping mall is just down <malay>bawah</malay>
(err) given a choice I won't want to go back there
[ah]
but I've
but I'm okay honestly I will I glad that I experience it with my cousins
cause if I'm if I'm cannot experience it with my family my my mum who knows my mum will end up reading one one whole book of like
[ah] recite recital and
ya you told me about your <malay>kakak</malay>
