<malay>untuk kanak-kanak muda</malay>
(um) <malay>teknologi boleh menjadi</malay> (err) <malay>boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah</malay> (err) <malay>yang faedah dia</malay>
(um)
<malay>macam dalam pelajaran</malay> (uh) (um) <malay>cikgu boleh memberi</malay> assignment <malay>kepada murid-murid</malay> (um) (err) <malay>contohnya kalau ada</malay> E learning
(um) <malay>anak-anak muda</malay> (um)
<malay>murid</malay> (um) <malay>dari dari</malay> (um) <malay>muda mereka senang untuk</malay> catch up (um) their skills especially in technology
<malay>mereka senang untuk</malay> (uh) <malay>belajar macam cara nak menggunakan teknologi dengan mudah</malay>
(uh)
<malay>dan mereka juga boleh</malay> (err) learn new skills from the internet because (um) but
<malay>banyak perkara yang baik dalam menggunakan teknologi jika digunakan dengan cara betul</malay>
(um)
<malay>yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini</malay> (err) <malay>ialah</malay> social media (um) <malay>mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan</malay>
(err) <malay>perkara yang di luar yang</malay> trend <malay>yang</malay> ju~ <malay>yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri</malay>
(err) <malay>contohnya seperti</malay> (uh) <malay>ada seorang</malay> celebrity
<malay>mereka melakukan</malay> trend mem~ (uh) <malay>yang mungkin boleh membahayakan dan apabila anak-anak muda melihat itu mereka rasa mereka juga ingin melakukan</malay>
<malay>dan ingin dia yang ingin</malay>
<malay>ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya</malay> (um) <malay>tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya</malay>
(err) <malay>dengan itu saya rasa</malay> social media (err) technology <malay>haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin</malay>
[ah] <malay>untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna</malay> technology <malay>dengan baik mereka</malay> (uh) (uh) techonology <malay>ialah perkara</malay> (um) it's a safe platform for them

[ah] ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
[oh] yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get (um)
second hand phone from you and <malay>ayah</malay> and
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad (err) cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it (um) ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
(uh) any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but (um)
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back (uh) just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it (um) even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but (um) maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me (err) excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not (um) just buy (err) knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya (err) just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that (um) whi~ which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work (um) then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes [ah] okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then (uh) you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say (err) when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss #johor# so much our old house ya but now it's (um) make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it [ah] #abu#
[oh] it's a terrace [oh] okay
yup because [ah] it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and (err) I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun [lah] ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase #abu#
sticky #sambal# I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's (uh) it's whatever happens (um)
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
well (um) where we go malaysia I really like us going trip at where is it <malay>adik</malay> (uh) wherever we travel malaysia is a a fun place but most of the time we went to #johor# (um) just for shopping you know going to giant
(um) because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper [what] I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger #ramly# burger #ramly# that I miss the most yup and the abalone
ya I know right it's so <malay>sedap</malay> I really miss malaysia food but too bad now is COVID nineteen we had to wait until eve~ (um) alright everything goes smoothly (um) but I really miss malaysia a lot it's amazing experience
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of (err) cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to J_B cause
yup (err) sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go #johor# and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that #abu#
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
(mm) I think so
(um) [ah] we went to cycling (um)
[ah] we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge (err) you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
[ah] and we tried (um) tried their obs~ [ah] that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it (uh) you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say #abu# like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
(um) yes because I was (um) for my C_C_A I was from N_P_C_C
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
(um) I think it's S_T_C
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
[oh] wait I can't rem~ (um)
[oh] actually I think I didn't went (um)
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or (uh) high elements it~ in (um) school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay (um) my camp was at the #pulau ubin# H_Q there ya
(um) I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the (uh) I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore (um) ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to (um) rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
(um) you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
(um) I remember (um)
I can't (um) in secondary school we did a lot of things
(um) like (uh) like camps mostly camps
(err) give I remember (um) chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days (uh) and then what else [oh] (err) it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time (uh) in our secondary school (um) we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
(um) cause we had we change our principal I (um) our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they (uh) do (uh) about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
(um) ya
and all of them all of these charities (err) will be donated to the (uh) respective
respect~ respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs [lah] for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that (uh) you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy (err) to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games [ah] and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you (err) I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
(uh) plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
(mm) ya and we have a lot of programmes [lah] actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme (um) like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed (um) how the way how they speak
we and their english [ah] the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that (um) I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup (err) from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them [lah] ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type [lah] actually (um) but [ah] for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you (err) like example for me (uh) I was given a choice to go to I_T_E I I did wish to go to poly but ya I_T_E is also like poly but
(err)
like I in I_T_E is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like (um) ya (um)
it's like school also but no [ah] I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in I_T_E or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in I_T_E
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
(um)
sports there's a lot [ah] actually ya and yup act~ [oh] to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves [lah] like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
(um) doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my (err) using my I_T skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school (uh) we didn't have like I_T workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs [lah] like you have to make (err) you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your I_T skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically (err) and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking (um)
because I I cause why I choose that course is (um) I I I want to learn how to (uh) bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
(um) pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun [lah] to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
[oh] (um) okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot (um) okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made (um) I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or fin~ financier focaccia and it's a great (um)
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made (err) the pizza it (um) and we also make cakes (um) black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could (err) redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if [ah] even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like (uh) you have to cut it into threes (uh) three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and (err) after (err) the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling (err) at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
[oh] okay I remember (um) we didn't make okay (err) I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is #pate choux# in french and then you know (uh) we had to do eclaire #choux# so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like (uh) cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my (err) my class advisor though
(um) my sir showed us (uh) a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough con~ this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who (uh) they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed [lah] like they have really nice talents to (um) which I can also learn from them
ya
[oh] my lecturer name my (err) we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really (err) sir jeremy is a very nice (uh) teacher he
the (uh) he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our (uh) parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him (uh) he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who (err)
which teacher doesn't want to see their children (uh) their chil~ I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud pa~ like a very proud like (err) like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
(um)
do you mean during COVID nineteen

like example does (uh) when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause (uh) because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children

example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross [lah]
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know (err) restau~ in restaurants last time was like (uh) you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the (um) the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya

like (um) (um)
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
(um) I know wearing a mask it will it will helps (um) to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face [lah] example like I have mask acne like ya it can
