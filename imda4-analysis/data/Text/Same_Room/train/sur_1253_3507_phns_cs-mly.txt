ya [lah] <malay>memang si</malay> june
<malay>tak payah</malay> mark <malay>sebab dia tak ada</malay>
ya [lah] we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya [lah]
ya so I think what we can do we don't go (uh) we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual [lah] we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in [ah]
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay [lah] (uh) we can take the the voucher [ah] you want to buy the voucher [ah] meaning we have to go (uh) the
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
(err)
you have to go the four att~ attraction
ya
of course [ah]
no [lah] the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before [what] just like the night safari
the four items [ah] the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
(err)
think eleven plus [ah]
[oh] (uh) wait I know is until
nine P_M or ten P_M for the night luge [ah] seven plus to nine P_M
two you (uh) ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this [one] right
(uh) we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going [what] you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go [lah]
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also [lah] can
the three of them
but if #affaf# don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two [lah]
then it's two two each
Subway
[oh] over there got <malay>itu apa</malay> Marybrown
(mm) ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough [lah] don't know ya
have to
is the camera (uh) waterproof
don't have [ah]
can
#affaf# <malay>punya bukan dua lagi tu</malay>
<malay>si</malay> #affaf# <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] because her
her studies finish already [what] her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
(uh) the other two they don't need to go <malay>pun</malay>
knowing <malay>si apa</malay> knowing <malay>si</malay>
(err)
#affif# I think he doesn't want to go down
[eh] what
twentieth right
the following week [lah] after christmas
can [eh] no cannot
yes (uh) (uh)
cannot
<malay>dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
<malay>kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh</malay> if we go out I keep saying to the kids
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have [ah] not open yet [ah] okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups [lah] so the kids
all the children
add up (uh)
it's just nice
it's just nice eight eight person the children <malay>saja</malay>
force [lah]
monday
that's why first person to check is #aisyah#
I mean if you don't want to <malay>leceh</malay> then just do it at home [lah] <malay>kat rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
but if you I I don't know whether
(err)
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
one you contact <malay>kak</malay> #ogi#
then you ask her
then if she what he say [lah] you ask her for her opinion and all
then what what she say [lah] then after that <malay>baru</malay>
get the ball rolling
cause I think for us ki~ <malay>kita yang tak jumpa</malay> #aisyah# <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>si kecil tu</malay> at least <malay>kak</malay> #ogi# <malay>jumpa juga</malay> [lah] once and then <malay>ayah tu jumpa</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita langsung tak jumpa</malay>
since
<malay>bila raya</malay> [lah]
<malay>raya dia tunggu kita kita datang lambat kita ingatkan dia balik rupanya dia menunggu kita</malay>
think <malay>raya haji tak salah</malay>
[eh] <malay>buat juga</malay> [lah]
so my family side I can suggest
<malay>macam</malay> okay so it depends
(uh) ya [lah] there is a few suggestion [lah] one is
(uh) because <malay>sekarang ni yang paling ramai</malay> is either #mahir# or #amin#
[kan] <malay>kat rumah yang paling ramai</malay> so we either go to #mahir's# house or #amin's# house
<malay>kalau si</malay> #lina# <malay>dia</malay> happy <malay>kat rumah</malay> #amin# [ah] because it's more <malay>apa orang tu tak ada kucing</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> so <malay>ertinya</malay> we cannot come one time <malay>pun</malay> it's just <malay>macam contoh</malay> [lah] [eh]
(um) we split into two groups
so one group is maybe (uh)
<malay>kita dengan mak</malay>
so <malay>kita bawa mak dengan si</malay> #matin#
<malay>pergi rumah</malay> #amin# so <malay>kita lapan orang</malay> [lah] <malay>kita jumpa</malay> #amin# <malay>dengan budak-budak tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] then second group could be #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir#
<malay>bawa</malay> the children [ah]
[ah] [eh] [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir# <malay>dah tak boleh</malay> [eh]
ya
<malay>tak boleh</malay> eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why <malay>kalau nak jumpa kena macam</malay>
go to the one that is more [lah] [kan]
so <malay>contoh contoh</malay> [eh]
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there [lah]
so #affif# #affaf# #shafie# three
then (uh) maybe #mahir# send his kids but <malay>dah berapa</malay>
seven plus (uh) <malay>si kecil tu</malay> #akil# #akif#
<malay>dah lapan</malay>
<malay>anak</malay> #amin# <malay>kat rumah dia</malay> so already join in [lah]
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
[ah] #adoi# ya [lah] but if <malay>nak</malay> have a cousin gathering then can
and I think they don't mind [lah] because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya [lah]
but I think if it's like just cousins
get together before <malay>ini</malay> I think maybe okay [lah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let say it is (um)
so (uh) <malay>apa</malay> all the cousins meet one time
then okay <malay>balik</malay>
then
<malay>tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu</malay> okay <malay>kalau macam gitu</malay>
<malay>anak-anak saudara</malay> [jer]
you have how many (uh) eight plus four twelve
twelve children
so they can't sit together <malay>pun</malay> I mean they won't sit together <malay>pun</malay>
correct <malay>kalau dekat rumah</malay> #amin# <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang bermain</malay>
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
so to me <malay>biar anak-anak saudara ni semua</malay> all the children can come down at one time
then they
(mm) <malay>asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit</malay>
<malay>kita biar budak-budak semua pergi</malay> #amin# you handle the kids
<malay>kita</malay> (uh) adults alright bye bye <malay>kita</malay> go for our
K if it's a red line [ah] and it's too (um)
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
[ah]
#amin# I mean we all have been coming over
we [ah] #mahir# because the other time his family come over #amin# come over #amin# the whole family his whole family come over
so and then #andir# <malay>selalu</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay>
so it's not like <malay>ini</malay> [lah] it's the together <malay>ramai-ramai yang tak ada</malay>
okay do how [ah]
(uh)
ya [lah] (uh) we can give suggestions and then let them think
so one of my suggestion is that [lah] (uh) let the kids all <malay>kumpul kat rumah si</malay> #amin# so at least the kids
<malay>cari penyakit tu namanya</malay>
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest #amin# would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
(uh) at one time at one go
and then (err)
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay [lah] then after that
of course [lah]
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
[ah] apply
once you step out the house <malay>tak boleh</malay>
okay other than that then they all meet at <malay>tu</malay> their <malay>ayah teh</malay> house
<malay>ayah teh</malay> will be very happy all come come come
just that maybe #amin# (uh) only
the two older [eh] #umar# also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if #umar# is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
<malay>abang</malay> is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
K so
(mm)
right okay so what else [ah] do you want to talk about (um)
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya [lah]
very difficult
ya cannot [one]
the night safari
how and what else can we do with <malay>mama</malay>
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
then we <malay>ajak mak</malay>
twenty
that weekend [ah] the christmas weekend twenty six <malay>ke</malay> twenty seven
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
so if let's say you want to <malay>pergi pun boleh pakai</malay> wheelchair <malay>kat situ</malay>
or jewel
jewel [kan] <malay>dia ada</malay> all those (uh) tours right
<malay>pergi jalan</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> waterfall [lah]
the the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>atas tu ada</malay> the the <malay>apa</malay>
the
ya
we we also haven't gone [what] we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options [lah] so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ada cakap apa semalam</malay> wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
<malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> own timing
not today is tomorrow <malay>kakak dia ajak</malay> tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want <malay>memang</malay> he already say he (uh) a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
no
so okay [lah] at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that [one]
no the problem is
all others in singapore [lah] unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to [what]
P_S_C academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at M_D_I_S
ya that's why that's why I say so <malay>lepas ni</malay> she have to go to <malay>apa ni</malay>
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
because I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay>
(um) the problem with all other (uh) uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's (uh) and her lecturer one whom she took the last course [kan]
that lecturer <malay>yang</malay> quite good [lah] she talk to him quite a bit
then she the lecturer actually say (um)
that
if you he teach at these two uni <malay>dua-dua</malay> uni <malay>dia ajar</malay>
murdoch [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> northumbria so <malay>dia ajar</malay>
a topic module not on in these two uni [lah]
so <malay>dia kata memang kat</malay> northumbria
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
whereas <malay>dekat</malay> murdoch
you <malay>dah buat</malay> all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
(err) coursework [lah] another <malay>apa</malay> testing test
you have to write [ah] [ah] correct
so she's (uh) worried about the that part [lah] that's why
no she already <malay>memang</malay> in this line
<malay>dia dah memang buat</malay> communication so she can
(uh huh) ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya [lah]
they actually have it [leh] the last time she say they the
officers came into the class and <malay>dah</malay> explain <malay>pun</malay> everything <malay>tapi</malay> (uh)
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
even that <malay>wira</malay> guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go [lah]
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants [ah]
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
(err)
(mm) more working people are opting for that course more working people [tau] meaning people who are
let's say they (uh) they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us [lah] she (uh) or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student [ah] so she will be like considered as an adult already [lah]
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say (uh)
(err) income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
[ah] but actually that [one] not much [lah]
of course [lah] because she is [ah]
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
(uh) adult already <malay>cuma</malay> I don't know in terms of
(uh)
ya [lah]
like that [lah]
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have (uh) all these other
unis [ah] which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
[oh] my god that's why I was
ya [lah] because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
and then now they tell us <malay>dah tak ada</malay> (uh) two time
it's very frustrating [lah]
ya so that [one] actually I thought (uh) I want to sit down with her and go through all the
all [ah] all of the <malay>ni</malay> ya
ya [lah]
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
ya [lah] so for example the other time <malay>dia pergi</malay> M M_D_I_S
M_D_I_S <malay>tu</malay> actually not bad and I saw the programme <malay>pun macam bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>dia ada</malay> sound recording space
all those things [lah] so and she went in they were all telling her [oh] you know (uh) this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like #affaf# are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop (uh)
K so
we need another
ya we need another (uh)
round of her checking [lah] ya for her to check
<malay>mana kawan dia</malay> N_U_S N_T_U <malay>atau</malay> overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up [lah] and say okay go maybe australia <malay>ke mana</malay>
practise <malay>apa maksudnya</malay>
that's why okay another option is <malay>tengok dekat</malay> malaysia
because malaysia <malay>pun banyak</malay> twinning programme
and twinning programme <malay>dia pun</malay> not bad quite good
<malay>anak ustaz</malay> [ah]
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
[ah] so actually we just limit it to singapore <malay>cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil</malay> kaplan
so with that diploma <malay>kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain</malay>
one more year <malay>tapi</malay> it's just one more year ya [lah]
ya [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dia</malay> at the end of the day <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak ni nak buat</malay> #shafie# <malay>mati-mati nak buat</malay> photography right he wants to be a photographer
that's what he wants to do
so
ya [lah] she
N_A_F_A [lah]
N_A_F_A
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based [lah] so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics [lah] right that's physics right
so more about physics
[ah] so you learn how to make
the photo~ (uh) you learn what is the because
#shafie# <malay>dia</malay> once he is focused on
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
so that part is good [lah] he <malay>kalau betul-betul</malay> interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya [lah] you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
(um)
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application (uh) by this person
who wants to (uh) (uh) okay because I put up (uh) a post
[ah] resale
ya okay so two [ah] one is about the
(um) recruitment
(uh) I put
teacher coach (uh) at SAM [lah]
so so far
(uh)
two person submit one is a malay girl who
<malay>bukan yang dia</malay> she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like !huh! <malay>apa kejadah ni</malay> so she apply K
the other one is an indian lady
(uh) <malay>anak tiga ke apa tak tahu</malay> she is she used to teach in preschool
used to teach english
so she (uh) she apply but we are maths [kan] so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
[ah] that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because (uh) we already signed up [what] it's for free at that point in time [lah]
(uh) when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say (uh) this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
(uh) about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer eng~
[ah]
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can <malay>macam</malay>
switch her [lah]
ya
ya [lah] paying the teacher only
correct [lah]
ya [lah] I mean that is not the whole idea <malay>pun</malay> the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so <malay>kalau</malay> let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources <malay>pun</malay>
so okay [lah] so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
(um) a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
you you go and pause <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] my god
<malay>putus</malay>
no [lah] <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tekan</malay> the other side [oh] my god [oh] my god okay
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
[oh] he he message he say <malay>kak</malay> I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run [ah] let it run [ah]
but if if if cannot get the numbers <malay>itu yang ini</malay> [kan]
so the partnership confirm don't want [ah] so I will message to say don't want [ah]
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya [lah] the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
session <malay>tu yang</malay> I told #ira# #ira# <malay>kalau</malay> let's say parents <malay>datang</malay> they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session [ah] I <malay>cakap</malay>
because you can still do the assessment on the first day <malay>dia datang tu</malay> you can do
[ah]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say <malay>dia</malay>
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
so <malay>dia</malay> accept <malay>dia</malay> P three still have to give the
the worksheets for P three right [ah]
if ya so on the first day <malay>dia datang</malay>
<malay>dia buat</malay> the assessment <malay>dulu</malay> that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue [lah] from there [kan]
so #ira# <malay>angguk-angguk</malay> don't whether she <malay>faham ke</malay> she agree <malay>ke</malay> will do <malay>ke tak tahu</malay>
okay so
progress report I told #ira# to do that already
I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> print the progress report do the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
so that tomorrow we print out <malay>semua</malay> all one time [lah] so that's why I want to know what is it
that's what you said to #ira# right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of #ira# you said to #ira# directly
I was there so I think it's okay [lah] let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out [lah]
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
I don't know [eh] to me <malay>macam</malay> it's okay [lah] you just print out <malay>pun</malay> okay black and white <malay>apa</malay>
can't be bothered to
don't have to <malay>turun</malay> you have to pass to the children
and then we message the parents we have passed the
(uh) final <malay>apa</malay> the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
<malay>kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi</malay> on in june
july right we're supposed to give (uh) first week july then we didn't give
so this [one] at least we give [lah] everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya [lor]
but then
buy over then he buy over [lah]
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
(uh) for (uh) the person who takes over is a full time
owner
[tau] so he was saying
(uh) Kumon <malay>pun cakap</malay> the same thing
so he the new centre <malay>yang dia nak</malay> run (uh) a franchise <malay>tu</malay>
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved [lah]
(uh) in
ya sort of like that [lah] ya correct
but I was thinking actually no [lah] (uh) #yang# was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his C_V photo looks clean cut [lah] so I think he can
ya [lah] he cannot speak chi~ the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said [lah] a bit
you know I said (uh) (uh) in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot [ah] then I say during N_S and all ya ya ya
(uh) I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only [ah] I can understand a bit but
(uh) chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say [oh] because
(uh) nearby our place (uh) it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so (uh) a lot of (uh)
P_R_C (uh)
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
[ah]
then then (uh) because of that
(um) we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
[oh] okay okay but now got Google translate [what]
can just v~ (uh) tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear [lah]
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say [oh] but the children can speak english [what] so the children can explain I say yes
(um) we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had (uh) chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy [lah]
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just [oh] okay
[ah] [ah]
[ah] that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct [lah] ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
okay so he has been teaching when he was in (um) school <malay>dulu dia mengajar</malay>

so
maybe [lah]
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can <malay>macam</malay>
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like [oh] okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
