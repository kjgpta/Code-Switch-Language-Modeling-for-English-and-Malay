okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap [eh]
<malay>tepuk tangan</malay>
okay then <malay>nak bual pasal apa</malay>
the first one
<malay>apa</malay> what's the last one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
for the rest [oh] my god it's so lame you <malay>nak makan apa</malay>
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
and <malay>dia kata apa</malay> he wanted to eat ya I told him if we get like one thing
to eat
then he was like ya <malay>nasi ayam</malay>
then I'm like !huh!
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
it depends [ah] maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
#mee goreng# but you know me and #mee goreng#
<malay>terberak-berak</malay>
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that #mee goreng# taste
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
speaking of <malay>makanan</malay>
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not [lah]
which I don't think it is
this is actually #konjac# jelly kon~ #konjac# you know C O N J A C
so it's like a shape of a <malay>sotong</malay>
you <malay>tengok</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> you just look at it first you want turn turn on the lights or no
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
[ah] have you tried #mala# before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of #mala# cause actually I I went to #hai di lao# we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to #hai di lao# and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all [lah]
(uh) because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try #mala# they so bad you know like you have to try #mala# I was like what this this this big deal about #mala# [sia] everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too #kaw#
you know #kaw#
yes
like too strong like that
(uh)
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil [lah]
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you [ah]
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K #nah#
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
[eh] it's delicious <malay>sedap</malay>
ya (err) okay K ya ya (uh) it so it's #konjac# jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
but is the shape of <malay>sotong</malay>
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] so that is #mala# this is the most spiciest one
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this #mala# taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
so the <malay>tak pedas sangat</malay> like
<malay>ada rasa macam dia</malay> then then <malay>dia tak macam meresap</malay> or like or like <malay>lama-lama macam tu</malay>
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap</malay> [kan]
so (um) I google and then youtube this thing <malay>cuba tengok dia orang makan macam mana</malay> (um) basically they open like four five packets
<malay>dekat dalam mangkuk</malay> and then <malay>apa</malay>
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious [eh]
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan]
you think the conversation is good
like
they will accept this conversation at us <malay>kunyah-kunyah makan-makan</malay>
(mm)
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets [ah] the other two is for my other friend
so I brought it home first
but you see the shape of the <malay>sotong</malay> is actually it looks legit <malay>macam sotong</malay>
[oh] my bad <malay>jangan kena baju</malay>
it will really stain <malay>tadi tadi</malay> you drop on my <malay>kasut</malay>
(uh) (uh)
then don't bother <malay>makan dia punya</malay> oil
you can just throw it away
because
stingy [ah]
<malay>macam apa</malay> what's that word [eh] <malay>macam</malay>

I_T in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe [lah] but like now lately with all the mental stress
I was actually thinking <malay>nak ambil atau tidak</malay>
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know [lah] I was just thinking a lot about it [ah] I don't (uh) it's been about two months already
ever since the lockdown [ah] <malay>itu macam fikir banyak sangat pasal</malay> psychology cause I want to know like
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
(um)
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way [ah]
because I see people change and I see
like
<malay>perangai semua macam lain</malay> [lah] not not not <malay>perangai semua macam lain</malay> like people
I know like when you look <malay>macam</malay> if you look <malay>dekat</malay> someone [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] he's not like this but
you know a for a fact that <malay>yang dia tak macam ini tetapi</malay>
like after a while you be like [eh] a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
<malay>dia punya perangai macam</malay> [eh] he he's like putting a front or a defense kind of thing

<malay>apa kerja</malay> in exhibition maybe I take something else so that's why I'm like thinking a lot about
this whole cause the whole of (uh) the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it [lah]
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
(mm)

really right like it feels like yesterday but it's actually a long time ago it's actually
know it feels so long ago but it's actually just this year only to give I mean yes
you get what I mean
then I'm like
and then I wouldn't call it like the curse of twenty twenty but a lot of things really happen there like the airbnb didn't go well
the whole ya I told you about the airbnb didn't go well
<malay>apa</malay>
(uh) <malay>cakap dekat sini</malay> but in the end <malay>dekat tempat lain</malay>
it was supposed to be like five minutes off times square but instead it's like
twen~ no not twenty twenty is really slow walk [ah] but it's about fifteen minutes
no less than fifteen ten mintues ten fifteen minutes
walk down to times square it it's still a good location [ah] in the end we loved it [ah]
in the end we loved it we grew to love it but initially we thought it was just beside so like can see the
fireworks whatever but in the it's actually far away and then in the end
we wanted we the whole idea was to was to do new year's
new york twenty twenty new york new year twenty twenty
to see the fireworks whatever the ball drop [ah]
ya hello we went
because of the airbnb the stupid airbnb is like so far away not far away about fifteen minutes away
we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like (um) #sya# was
that's why a lot of things happened
<malay>gigi dia sakit</malay>
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
<malay>tutup dahulu</malay>
okay <malay>kejap ini bising</malay>
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three A_M people start queuing already
and you cannot leave if you leave you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay>
ya which is
too far they were cor~ cordoned off already
like if you leave your spot means you leave your spot so <malay>macam mana nak berak nak kencing nak makan</malay>
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
you really have to pack <malay>mesti bau masam</malay> [kan] ya ya
so I went down at about
ten A_M no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten A_M I was like [eh] the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like [oh] shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like !huh!
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> the ball drop [ah]
and it costs five hundred U_S_D I thought I told you before
(mm)
it costs five hundred U_S_D so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
a lot a lot of slacking a lot of <malay>baring</malay> here <malay>baring</malay> there I clean the rooms
<malay>tukar langsir</malay>
<malay>tukar lampu</malay>
carpet [eh] seriously I need to change this carpet
(mmhmm)

#alhamdulillah#
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity

mister <malay>abang samled</malay> that's like
codeswitching
mister <malay>abang samled</malay>
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
like towards the end I never expected [eh]
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
ya
the <malay>lorek</malay> version of [ah] [mah]
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
because I wasn't around for the longest time [kan] <malay>tak terasa</malay> but actually I love him so much [eh]
he's been forever [kan]
since you were like four or five
ya four or five [ah]
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya ya <malay>dah tua pun dah dah apa</malay>
but ya no [lah] <malay>gigi yang nenek kucing</malay> is like twenty plus <malay>apa</malay>
(mm) no <malay>itu betul-betul menjaga</malay> [seh]
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain [orh]
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
mister <malay>soput itu nak kena sebat</malay>
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
<malay>macam menyeksa</malay>
<malay>kesian dia seorang seorang</malay>
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during C_B
remember
so it's like !wah! <malay>ini kalau</malay> a~ <malay>ada</malay> (uh) ya can always <malay>teman</malay> [what] like someone to talk to
instead of <malay>seorang seorang</malay>
ya exactly then it's going to be <malay>perap</malay> in this whole room
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
considerable amount of space to <malay>joget-joget</malay>
or like walk around and do my work here or like
move around [lah] at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like <malay>bersepahkan</malay>
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything <malay>semua sekarang tengah mahal</malay> I don't know [ah] like
I have no idea okay [lah] probably yes I have an idea what is gon~ is <malay>mahal</malay> now because
everyone needs the money
but
se~ se~ seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
(mmhmm)
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
<malay>panasnya</malay> #ya allah#
then that that that's the thing price should be <malay>kurang apa</malay> should be lesser [what]
shouldn't be that expensive [what] to entice people to buy [what] or like rent
downgrade
decrease
(mmhmm)
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small [lah]
and <malay>nak itu pasang apa</malay>
a false wall
and then have to <malay>pasang</malay> another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
then like I'm like !huh!
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this [ah]
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like [oh] I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like [ah] okay no way
but it's costly [lah]
it's nice [sia] it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all [kan] with the window
[oh] ya speaking of which just now I pass by (uh) river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like [oh] my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
!huh! I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
[ah] that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
#potong pasir#
no
#potong pasir# yes
#potong pasir# I love the room because it was an upgrade
the outside of the house was like <malay>rimas</malay>
they clean once in a while it was nice
then after that <malay>bersepah lagi</malay> then <malay>rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas</malay>
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
(hmm)
!huh! when
she cook curry
(mm)
!huh! then where was I
[oh] interesting
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows [ah] <malay>tingkap macam</malay> best
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this (uh) this time round [lah] but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
[kan] <malay>mahal</malay>
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like (uh)
you <malay>fikir masak-masak dulu</malay> like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like <malay>fikir masak-masak dulu</malay> like if you move in
[eh] no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month o~ okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
(mm)
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right
