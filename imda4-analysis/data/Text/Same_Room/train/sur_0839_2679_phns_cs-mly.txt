okay
that was a bit loud
but
ya
good
so the video not that bad right
ya
a bit
the the jojo thing was a bit long though
like a bit like
but I like the jojo thing that's why
like
and if you get it you get it
ya
ya I mean I'm a small channel so it doesn't really matter
so like I I'm not even monetised
like <malay>takde takde</malay> [ah] [sia]
so like just do all this things
ya
ya that's the thing
but the I changed the intro music and the outro music
I don't know
ya it is but the
I don't know if it's better [lah]
like I know the outro was a bit okay [lah]
a bit better
because the outro previously was like [meh]
ya
now I think intro okay [lah] still what my second second video
so
third third video still using the software and yesterday it kept crashing [sia] cause like I ha~ I don't know the thing the RAM was like <malay>macam bodoh gila</malay>
so like I have like the
video wallpaper right so that [one] eats up RAM so when I ya so the thing so this thing video processing especially when you put like four videos running together (uh) then it starts to like ya especially when on four cores four cores is like the worse I'm planning to upgrade [ah]
saw online like two hundred fifty [sia] for a thirty three hundred X
and the A three twenty motherboard
but ya it's ya it's two fifty I'm planning to buy because <malay>macam</malay> at least it's
four cores eight threads and then it's like a newer processor so like fuck it [ah] [sia]
just buy [ah]
because but the only thing is that that motherboard you cannot upgrade [lah] as in I have if I upgrade I have to buy a new motherboard
two fifty man
the because last time the thirty three hundred X was
it was always our stock but now I think a lot of people are waiting for the new Ryzen the new Ryzen five [eh] the new Ryzen four gen four [eh] gen five gen five ya they skipped one gen because they fucking misnamed you know their laptops were called Ryzen four
the laptop processors were Ryzen four and the desktop processors were Ryzen three
so now if they go up one and then the laptop goes up one and then it's like <malay>macam bodoh</malay> like that you know then now so now it's like <malay>macam</malay>
now is like they shift they skip one gen so they move from three to five so the laptops will also move from four to five so both are five
what happened
!wow!
then what they release it as
the fuck [sia]
but if he copyright first then he wins it what right
it's like if you buy a website first
buy it off him [lah]
but confirm he will ask for a ridiculous price but I think it happened
happened before what a lot of people who knew like this will happen will buy like a name or website last time I think happened to one of google's website or something they tried to
ya all the way
ya
ya but
but I bet it depends it depends on the company [lah] I guess
but okay [lah] it all worked out for them
<malay>macam</malay> some of them is like really like very big but hopefully the guy gets a lot of money [ah]

Sony is terrible [sia] you know they don't allow discord on P_S five I'm like what the fuck [sia]
ya so the only way you can talk to other playstation users

and then you don't want to like let discord and then like then these computer users have to use push to talk in your game then push to talk is usually shit
ya discord was the first [one] that was like quite good [sia]
after teams speak
but team speak you had to buy you had to buy the server
discord is free at least
ya
of course (uh) I mean I took awhile before I went to discord

ya
australian or singapore
australian is
you know at singapore currency is stronger than australia now
after very long no
now is like their three thousand is two thousand plus
or what
ya I think
ninety cents around there ya that means means ours is stronger I'm actually surprised I remember last time people were like go australia one point four
then the currency drop like shit
no now the best place to go new zealand they don't need wear mask anymore
but then it's like
ya I mean it's it's normal [ah] I mean at the end of the day as long as the ka~ the whole world is not clear of this thing confirm got one but if you stop them at the boarder then it's fine in the end <malay>macam</malay> singapore's <malay>punya ape itu</malay> their way is like rapid testing and shit what so like for them is okay [lah]
ya
no because you know why because we were prepared because we had masks we had a lot of things that we prepared we knew what a pandemic would happen you know
and I think
not really rod it's like a more like a a a a gi~ giant dildo shove up your butt
ya
really
really
I last last week [oh] ya [oh] that means it really surged [sia] !wah!
two hundred twenty I believe was like a week or two weeks ago only [sia]
[oh] my god
because it's expensive [eh] you know COVID treatment there is like thirty thousand [sia] not like us like you go to doctor with like respiratory <malay>punya</malay> illness or whatever cock and then like you go you [ah] <malay>apa</malay> you go there again you get we pay ten dollars they have to pay for a nonsense amount of money [one] doctor's visit is like hundred plus [sia]
it's not flawed it's garbage it's hot garbage because you
ya [lah]
they have their own pricing on it ya like whatever different hospitals [ah] that's the worst part is because they each hospital has their own pricing on it they charged giving whatever religion they charge whatever for whatever treatment that they want to give and then and then like the bill comes out like #siao# [lah]
different hospitals got different thing
because they believing privatisation what
ya
ya
even if you have insurance right your insurance coverage [eh] only covers certain hospitals so reviewing the wrong place and the next nearest like insurance approved hospital is at two hundred miles away you gonna drive two hundred miles bro
then you got fucked if you sick or what good luck [ah]
ya even ambulance what they they try to avoid riding ambulances because ambulance is like what three hundred dollars
quite quite a high amount [ah] like <malay>merepek</malay> kind of prices [ah] like here okay [ah] somebody sick just call ambulance [ah] next time can pay I mean at the end of the day it's government run so like
ya
the gov~ because you know why because it's the government they are not scared of like running out of money
unless government is running out of money [ah] then then but wou~ but that is unlikely [ah]
at the end of the day if they are able to like do so much for the COVID <malay>punya</malay> crisis they have a lot of bank [lah] so
at the end of the day it's not a worrying thing so they like [ah] you owe money pay a bit pay a bit
that's thing
unless you got you pay late [ah] can got late payment [ah]
but there's no interest [lah]
ya
you know the new #borat# movie coming out soon #borat#
and then there's this video of (uh) donald trump's lawyer rudy #giuliani#
so the thing is right he was [ah] asked to come to the bed [ah] the hotel room of the #borat# #borat# two got #borat# and his daughter I think
so the daughter of #borat# supposedly [lah] ask him to come to the room and shit [lah]
and then I I think drink something or like have some cocktails or whatever [lah] so then he put se~ #borat# put secret cameras in the hotel room like her room to set up it was actually part of the movie but the guy didn't know
[ah] so like she was in the thing right she was she ask him up to the hotel room and he come up to the hotel room [ah] then he was in the room [ah] then can see him like a touching himself and shit
ya and then after that the the #borat# came out of nowhere then was like she's too young for you she's fifteen
but actually the girl wasn't fifteen [ah] she was twenty four [lah] but at the end of the day he still got caught like touching himself like at some hotel room with this actress when she asked to come up you know like it's like his defense is [oh] he was taking out his microphone and then his shirt came out in a weird way and then he was just putting back the shirt in
so right now the video is not released yet [ah] but a few people in the media industry watched it [ah] like I because #borat# does this kind of stupid thing then he release it ya
so he does this thing then I think next week [lah] next week monday most likely the video goes public [ah]
[ah] no they wou~ he cannot what that is part of the thing part of the movie they agreed to it so too bad [ah]
#borat# does this stupid shit I I I actually quite excited and then he's defence is like that and then now the lawyer letter came out also so the lawyer have lawyer
that's how reliable trump's lawyer is that he has a lawyer I don't understand
ya so his lawyer [ah] the lawyer's lawyer is sending letters out for the media cause of like slander or some shit or like ya there's a video [sia] come on guys
no [ah] they all they all terrible
ya
ya
ya but
I mean you can believe whatever you want
ya
right they switch off right
but that's the problem right there is what the cans of top like to eat very the officer to spot because right now it's all written and then if like if you and your partner come up with a story and then you make a report
and th~
okay
tallies
is your words against the civilian and then obviously you won't trust a civilian what because supposedly he is the wrongdoer
ya
and come on if you want to talk about video there's a video of a man landing on the moon and they still don't believe you know come on people
that's why
like
<malay>apa lagi kau nak</malay> [kan]
why
why [sia]
[oh] they <malay>tutup</malay>
!haiya! they wo~ I think they'll always plan for very long
ya
#taiwan# [ah]
the missile [lah]
#taiwan# [ah]
ya it's always always like that [one] it doesn't do anything is more of a <malay>macam</malay> threat kind of thing
this is how countries do diplomacy [lah]
same like north korea what
no this is this is called no it's diplomacy it's called like <malay>macam</malay> firm diplomacy [lah] or some shit like that
because it's like the same what north korea remember they had a rocket that could shoot all the way to U_S then everyone was like scared it's the same thing and then you know who came talking talk to them trump it's like that
it's pressure
because they know what
but really you know they won't pull the trigger unless because the thing is if they pull the trigger
there's a lot of repercussions [lah] it's like a butterfly effect kind of thing
I
no that's the no that's the thing right if they want to take over #taiwan# then it says #taiwan# wasn't theirs in the first place
because they keep saying that #taiwan# is part of china like <malay>jangan</malay> world [lah] bro
the only sad part is actually #taiwan# defeated not defeated [lah] kind of curbed COVID better than a lot of other nations did
and then like they are not under the world health organisation <malay>punya</malay> data list because they are not listed as a country
because china is
ya ya #taiwan# isn't listed as a country of the W_H_O because china is part of the bigger heads of states what like it's china U_S and a few other countries
republic of #taiwan# no
no
no
no
you can check
no they don't they don't list it as a country so all their data is invalid they take china's data
ya
so basically like their measures there or whatever or these things right they couldn't directly like
spread the news [ah]
like how they get the thing
no no the difference between #taiwan# and singapore is that we are not under another country
[ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha]
that's the biggest difference boy
I mean !hey! are their own parliament and shit
ya but I mean the thing is they don't have international pressure
like not from malaysia like [eh] [eh] boy you mine
you know no one no one
malaysia busy fighting on their own don't kn~ have you seen the video
that [one] that [one] that [one] really <malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
no now it's worse because of COVID now you know malaysia K_L lockdown you know af~ [ah] <malay>ape tu</malay>
#wari# #wari# #wari# <malay>kena</malay> locked out of K_L he was at his <malay>kampung</malay>
and then now cannot go back home
[ah] so he like that's why he not online
for very long already because K_L lockdown back
so he's like then I message he message me boring [ah] <malay>kat kampung aku nak balik main</malay> computer
then I was like (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> then I like I didn't know that time that K_L was lockdown I found out from him it's like [ah] lockdown <malay>balik</malay> then it's like [ah] lockdown [sia]
[oh] okay
why [ah] then he show me the thing then like the cases rose up because I think #sabah# had (err) election
and then after the election everyone went back then the cases all rise then the clusters came up again
but ya
when I mean
that's the thing you cannot say like [oh] that time they allow interstate travel like like their own states
that's when the thing spread [lah] I guess
I don't know [lah] difficult [lah] the policies they have also not very strong so
they all busy fighting each other also so <malay>takpe</malay> [ah]
you know
like whatever man good luck to you
it's okay we we doing fine for now but I miss going to J_B [lor]
to like buy stuff buy fuel
[a'ah] [sia]
[eh] come on [ah] it's one third the price bro that means [eh] I top up once every two days
so for me right if I instead of topping up like three times a week
I top up for the same amount of one time [ah] [jer] per week [sia] that's a lot of savings I guess like it drops my fuel cost to like what
eighty dollars per month only [sia] instead of times three [ah] two hundred plus
there's a lot of savings bro
but it takes a lot of time [mah] you travel there [ah]
every month [eh]
but okay [lah] takes a lot of time [ah] I personally don't do it because
jam [ah]
always jam
and then the closest [one] near #tuas# and then #tuas# you cannot buy anything cause it's only like the fuel thing
like the Shell there and that's it then like <malay>macam</malay> boring [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
ya but can is can [ah] but <malay>malas</malay>
like <malay>ni semua nak tak nak</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> to me <malay>tak nak dia lebih</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak nak</malay> [ah]
but okay what [ah] now got the discount what twenty percent [sia] for fuel
ya I I saw the one that's sinking right
ya because the thing is [ah] if fuel not leaking nobody cares
very simply put
okay if a ship sink right and it's laden with fuel right they rather leave it there
then try to save it and then it cracks open
because you are talking about millions of tons of not millions [lah] okay that's millions of barrels
but
like forty thousand tonnes may be eighty thousand tonnes depending on dead weight [ah] I think it was about sixty thousand
fifty thousand tonnes and if it was max load right and it's crude oil is not like those like process shit
so it's really thick
no
crude oil doesn't sink it floats and then it clumps which is worse than petrol like petrol spreads around like you know
like ya
would you rather that area or the whole fucking coastline
you rather the coast line y~
fuck you [lah] no
no you can just clear the thing don't let anyone bang and just leave it that's why you're do~ not a politician okay or saving the earth the earth would be dead if you are saving it
[ha] [ha] [ha]
no expediting the process is donald trump man
sad [sia] all the green [ah] all the green <malay>punya</malay> policies that obama put in place all gone
very sad like he worked eight years [sia] for that would fight against the congress
you know and then all went to shit
just like that
not not not one person it took a whole nation to vote him
it took no it took a whole nation not to vote for hillary that was it
I'm like [sial] [ah] you all talk about emails #ivanka# also got emails what then no one cares only
don't know [lah]
then he then got mention what I remembered trump recently mentioned like if he lose the election he's going to run away from the country
cause he say he be embarrassed for losing all you know why or not he's going to run you know why
he got a lot illegal shit that he has done he scared <malay>kena</malay> indicted
as it
he know if he come back he's going to sit in jail for very very very long
because I I bet you joe biden will try his best [sia] to do it
who
who
on fucking twitter of all the places them really [ah] guess how he want the millennium will vote eight years back in that they are few politicians who was actively like in social media ya that's
I mean because obama is acting on twitter [eh] bro
ya
that's how he won the millennial <malay>punya</malay> vote [ah] eight years back he was one of the first few politicians who was actively like in
now he still now he still
come on look look at michelle obama all very ya quite influential in terms of <malay>macam</malay> U_S presidents
and first ladies [ah]
like melania trump nobody cares [ah]
ya I mean I I don't really care about the opinion of the country that voted trump up you know
I'm I (uh) I really don't care
who
#valkrae#
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya A O C A O C ya #alexandria ocasio-cortez# ya she she was the highest ra~ the most viewed stream on twitch [sia] the most viewed stream I was like [oh] !wow! but she a lot of people don't like her because they say like she radical leftist but really [sia] she's really good [sia] and she's not like
and people like to make fun of her because she like used to work as a bartender but then it shows that she knew what the hell she's doing and she knows how to work hard you know like like how the normal people did not like trump you know small loan of a million dollars small loan [eh] like okay bro
like next time ask for my younger brother one million also [ah] bro like fuck you that doesn't happen
like you know this woman a lot of people hate her but she very very how to say [ah] aggressive a lot of people don't like her
because she's one thing because she's a woman [lah] and women of colour is another thing and then she is like not not not like black like she's like latino [ah] and then another thing <malay>macam</malay> she very fierce
and she doesn't take shit from no one
she's very good she's very good politician right but then she's like same like bernie sanders you know they say like [oh] she's too progressive
for the benefit of the people you all don't want then you all <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] (err) reduce taxes will be rich let's go
I'm like okay bro and then the rich like enjoy in their yatch all during COVID you know and then you all suffering [lah] begging for the one point two K every month every week or something and then trump
U_S is one point two K every week [eh]
ya I think they got it once only for one month some shit like that
after that trump doing that's why that's why trump says COVID is over because he doesn't want to pay up to the citizen because he doesn't believe in that economy what he believes you give money to the top people the top people make money for the bottom people
it's trickle down economics you should read up about that
it really doesn't make sense no it it makes sense it's like a like a religion right to is like a like a you know like those evangelist like keep collect all the money it's the same [ah] it's like when rich people they just spout all this nonsense
to make other rich people rich and then keep the poor poor
because what happens when people get more money they're not going to create more jobs they are not going to like make my company bigger or what no they are gonna spend more money on themselves
what they gonna buy the a bigger yatch they gonna buy a bigger house
ya
that's why like you have to give someone who has four hundred thousand five hundred thousand then he's going to buy a bigger house bigger car bigger everything [ah] he's not gonna like [oh] let's give donate more to the poor all you think
they will donate what they can just to evade taxes
most of the time
ya
or like trump pay seven fifty
per year
[oh] my god
ya
no that's that's the thing no they were saying like [ah] the minimum wage workers pay more tax than he does correct [oh] my god I was like (ugh) and he was like I pay millions of taxes in a year
<malay>tu [ah]</malay>
world [sia]
no the thing is <malay>dia</malay> world and then people still believe him I like [sial] [ah] and recently his rallies all the people wear mask wear at all but when did he ever come out with a negative test
never right
[kan] [ah]
any proof [ah] I mean you can say it it doesn't matter but the thing is like we want the medical thing what
but whatever
I mean that's how his style what you have to believe him and nothing else everything fake news recently he walked out of sixty minutes
you know the the the those
like you know I think singapore used to have it also like like sixty minutes is like sixty minutes of an interview with some politician or what
ever but we used to have it but it got boring because we ran out of people to interview
for them they have like it's called sixty minutes so basically is like an intense interview [ah] like they asked all the hard hitting questions are for all these like politician and all these things [ah]
like sometimes they ask celebrities like especially <malay>macam</malay> controversial issues [lah]
but this time it was trump forty five minute he walked out
he couldn't take the interrogation not interrogation [lah] the questions [ah] then after that he got
pissed right he got angry he tweet out and then he say because of the fake news media I will release the video first before the sixty minute come out then I like that's his hit back <malay>macam</malay> you gonna release it first because he wants to say that <malay>macam</malay> they gonna portray it like differently but then <malay>macam</malay>
if you walk out in forty five minutes right then if you don't see forty five minutes of footage then you kind of know like there's something cut out what right or like sixty minutes [ah] like if there is less than sixty minutes you know it's fake what right
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] they repeat the loop and you didn't realise in one hour right
[kan]
ya I'm like
ya no no no cannot
no we cannot normalise his style his style is shit
ya
ya
terrible
terrible [ah]
that's it
ya man
because science is science is stupid what right science doesn't make sense what
because it's so difficult to read words
the worse part is that like he says I love the bible I love the bible and then it's like what is your favourite verse from the bible [ah] that's very personal don't ask you can't even tell me the verse like or paragraph or like where it's from or what then he's like no it's very personal so I can't share it I like that means he never read hundred percent never read you just use it
ya I mean if you say you love the bible right it's like saying you love the quran [oh] which <malay>surah</malay> you like you know then you like [oh] I don't know man like it's private then I'm like
okay bro like cool story bro
I'm like what
ya no the thing is like no I that people [oh] ya there was one one guy you know there's this guy that time <malay>macam</malay> [oh] who you voting for like that time what he does these interviews with trevor noah like he does these interview at trump rallies and ask all these questions about conspiracy theories and whatever shit [lah]
so that time he was asking like [oh] [ah] <malay>ape</malay>

the store quite big [sia] mine
it's not like like the one here the here is kind of linear what mine is like a weird shape so there's a bit of blind spot that the cashier cannot see
so they're going to have to have have two people cause one station at one area
