so <malay>macam</malay> #bud# okay
I heard there's a lot of barber shop [ah] nowadays
but then how they make money in the first place <malay>kau tahu tak</malay>
ya I think there are people who like <malay>macam</malay> every three weeks they will go for a haircut
!wah! if I !wah! cannot afford [ah] <malay>rabak</malay> seriously
ya but I saw it's like forty dollars what's so special about the forty dollars [sia]
but it's more I I don't know if actually I I I really cannot afford [lah]
the haircuts [lah] I just go to normal neighbourhood barber shops like <malay>bawah</malay> block <malay>punya</malay>
and the <malay>pakcik</malay> will cut your hair and it's really I think that's more comforting [ah] cause cause I see all these young people do [ah] and then the places
that they make the shop that they make [ah] is very intimidating you know you know like sometimes you <malay>takut</malay> you know you'll be like
[eh] what's this [ah] why they all this <malay>abang-abang</malay> like
got tattoo [lah] you know for normal people [ah] I will scared [lah]
ya
ya but normally
when I go there I sit down
then the <malay>pakcik</malay> will be like [eh] [ah] <malay>sekolah</malay> [eh]
then like [oh] <malay>sekolah ke kerja</malay> then like [oh] <malay>kerja</malay> [ah] [oh] <malay>ni</malay>
ya but I normally go there only when I go reservist ya to make my hair short [ah]
ya
same [ah]
ya same same
ya but during circuit circuit breaker what you do actually
ya
ya but I remember that time we always zoom
we zoom every I don't know once
one week I don't know three or four times [sia] we zoom
!wah! <malay>gila</malay> [eh] thirty days
ya but to me it's a very weird weird experience [ah] cause for us singaporeans cause we we always <malay>lepak</malay> [what] like every weekend we always see each other we are lucky to be in singapore where where things are like small then we can travel everywhere within one hour then we also have our own friends that we always hang out with
but then <malay>sekali kena</malay> the circuit breaker
cannot <malay>lepak</malay> [lah] cannot do this cannot do that [lah] but then we still <malay>lepak</malay> at zoom [ah] so is (uh) I don't know [ah] it's very it's very weird feeling I hope
it's fun but I but I don't think we
ya is different [ah] I don't know [ah] to me is very weird [ah]
ya ya
ya I think we are lucky [lah] we got friends who are like
<malay>semangat</malay> [lah] want to still want to <malay>lepak</malay> cause I know is is [ah] very very difficult for other people also [ah] those who no got no support from friends during this circuit breaker !wah! that one <malay>rabak</malay> that one sure <malay>rabak</malay>
ya
ya
then some more if you stay in a family then you don't like the family I mean your family everytime <malay>gaduh</malay> everytime quarrel !wah! that one more more worse [sia] that one

ya
ya
ya
but at least you need to work full-time for like three five years know if you want to commit to that to buy get your own place [ah] as with a actually couple more easier [ah] not
not alone cause couple you can get a lot of (err) loans and (err) whatever other stuff
ya
ya
but actually B_T_O sucks [eh]
if you notice [ah] B_T_O houses sucks [eh] very small I cannot [sia] I cannot imagine myself in B_T_O I mean I'm just saying [ah] even though I'm not planning to buy a house but if I can buy house [ah] I just take resale
ya ya
no but the feel different know if you notice the feel if you go to B_T_O house you <malay>masuk</malay> like all our friends all like #wal# house [lah] [eh] I think #wal# house small [ah]
#mamat# house like same as #wal# house [ah]
ya #zafran# house very big I think that's the earlier earlier B_T_O
#hud# house same like #yadi# house [ah]
#yadi# house ya ya the kitchen
(mm)
ya ya ya I don't know [ah]
I heard I heard estee also want to get married october

ya next year [ah]
good for good for her [lah]
I think she good at managing money [ah]
ya ya ya
ya
but now she working part-time
ya
part-time or casual [ah]
ya it's true [ah] part-time
ya
at the sento~ [eh]
no no no the outram one
(mm)
ya ya ya
exactly
[eh] [sial] [lah] if <malay>bagi aku rabak</malay> #dok#
<malay>aku</malay> [eh] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] [sial]
<malay>aku</malay> stress
stress [sia] <malay>aku macam nak pergi luar negeri</malay> [sia] <malay>cabut tak</malay> [lah] <malay>main-main</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> okay
ya
<malay>hari tu dekat</malay> rubik's jam
!huh!
<malay>asal</malay>
<malay>abeh dorang</malay> book
!huh!
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
ya
exactly
ya actually we also plan to record but now no mood [ah]
don't know [lah] if [sial] if [sial] is
have to <malay>bungkus</malay> [ah]
<malay>bungkus</malay> [ah]
ya but wasted [ah] I think [sial] very special cause of the style
cause of its music
ya no [lah] but the reason why this band is easy to tour in the first place remember <malay>macam</malay> #zad# (err) freelance #zafran# also
freelance I also freelance #siti# but then now !aiyo! ya that's why I make postpacs
cause I'm bored
and then
I like
trying to <malay>kumpul duit</malay> [ah] to buy gear to for live setup
ya
so that the reason why <malay>aku selalu</malay> form band <malay>pasal aku suka pergi</malay> tour
<malay>pasal kalau kau pergi</malay> tour you get to see the world
and then when I see the world cheap [ah]
ya
ya little cost but sometimes hec~ hectic [ah]
for me you don't really get to see a lot of stuff of course you just go to one place
for I don't know twenty four hours or less than twenty four hours sometimes
then you #chao# [what] you #chao# to next city
ya
ya of course
power [ah]
ya
very sucky
ya
ya
ya but the best I think
after you play then you make friends
but then these people become your friends then maybe next time you can visit them I mean next time you can go on tour with other bands it's like that [ah] it's it's it's creating a network [ah]
ya
ya
ya
cause me and #zafran# have the same thinking like that every time
#zafran# more cool [sia] got kid all got other thing but still want to do all these
like#zad# he a bit different I think sadly <malay>macam</malay>
don't know [ah] like picky [ah] or ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya
ya but to me if I'm out of here [ah] I okay already
[ah] ya ya ya
