[ah] <malay>keranda</malay>
then you just my heart more even
<malay>tengah tunggu tengah tunggu</malay> for praying [lah] <malay>bawah</malay> block [kan] seriously like the whole block is filled with his friend
teachers friends
people <malay>budak dikir</malay>
you know like this guy is so good <malay>macam</malay> #bilal# is like very nice [sia] even though I don't know him then
I don't know him much [lah] at all but I know he is my (err) C_C_A mate
and he was one of the leaders last time
then
even though I don't know him right so for some reason right out of nowhere right I cry
I cry I cry my balls
my balls out my eyeballs out
ya <malay>aku nangis gila babi</malay> #dok#
<malay>bila</malay> like <malay>babi boleh</malay> [kan]
[oh] I think [ah] legit
I cry
ya I'm like [oh] my god is it
ya you you you have to go through ya I mean I mean go through ya you have to
I mean not relative or <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] this not my relative also my friend <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>aku tak rapat</malay>
but then when I see
and it's suddenly <malay>macam</malay> that it it strucks [tau] it strucks [tau] it strucks <malay>macam</malay> like I don't know why I cry but then it's just waterfall
then I'm like <malay>asal</malay> [eh] <malay>nangis</malay>
no I mean that's one that's one factor but before but before that was my heart like <malay>macam asal ni</malay> why am I why am I feeling this way
I ask myself [lah]
why why am I feeling this way
then
like then when I see his body he kiss kissed his forehead
then after that you go then slowly I didn't even see anyone it was crowded also [what] because everybody was like after praying
then we have our last respect cause we all we all follow a line [lah] (err) follow queue <malay>taburkan apa entah</malay> forgot what's that thing called
[ah] <malay>taburkan</malay> and <malay>cium dahi dia</malay>
then we go and we go <malay>semua</malay> crowded like very crowded so I cannot see anyone but
I started to <malay>macam rasa nangis</malay> [tau] like my eyes my eyes starts tearing up I didn't even feel like crying but it tears up
you know then then you start to tear up heavily know like waterfall like
then ya I go then I go then I see my friend the friend cry then I even I even cry
heavier [ah] I cry heavier more then like after <malay>dah habis</malay> then my friend one of my friend who is quite close to him [lah]
he asked me #zul# (err) (err) why
why (err) your why that time <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>nangis</malay> [eh] <malay>bila arwah si</malay> #faiz# <malay>meninggal kau kau sorang yang nangis sekali dengan</malay> batch to cry heavy why [ah] [oh] I just I just say like <malay>macam terasa</malay> then
that one day ya I want to die like that also <malay>orang ramai</malay>
second also (um) I scared <malay>macam</malay>
scared of death [lah] basically
scared of death [ah] since <malay>lagi buat takut</malay> that's why my heart was beating beating I scared
like one day all these happen <malay>angkat jenazah</malay> that will be you one day [lah]
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> so
and you don't know what what happened to you after that [what] you know
only I known no one can
ya [lah] can <malay>macam</malay>
no one really to tell the tale [lah] in the afterlife [lah] basically so you have to go through yourself so that's what that's what
<malay>takut</malay> and <malay>risau</malay>
is the one is one of the major factors I was super scared [lah] you get and
some depends on the person also the person also can change
any person [lah] like like that <malay>jenguk</malay> ya emotions [ah] like also like visit <malay>jenazah</malay> also also change <malay>macam</malay> they have a new perspective of things how it's supposed to be <malay>gitu-gitu</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] so
sometimes
<malay>benda ni</malay> eventually we all have to go through
you have to <malay>macam</malay> face it that's that's how reality [lah] sucks [ah] we cannot live in a fairy tale forever also as long as we are happy happy happy one day
we but you have to expect one day
<malay>benda-benda benda tahi akan jadi</malay>
so
ya [lah] but in the mean time since we are still alive we just we just <malay>kita</malay> just pray for each other [lah] for safety you know <malay>gitu-gitu</malay>
but ya [lah]
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] [lah] I I have to share [lah] [ah] no [lah] not sad [lah] I I'm I'm way past that already [lah] ya [lah] I think about it [lah] but
(err) he's a good person <malay>arwah</malay> #faiz#
ya it's a very the people people praise him a lot [lah]
and I I (err) people praise him a lot I see no for all I know I see no bad things about him I never see <malay>macam</malay>
scold vulgar <malay>ke apa</malay> like very low-key quiet guy you know
then unfortunate [lah] <malay>bila</malay> that day happen it was right after <malay>jalan raya</malay>
ya but right after <malay>jalan raya dorang</malay> [ah] it's like imagine your friend your
ya ya [lah] ya [lah] two A_M <malay>dia</malay> #ciao# two A_M was their was was was their last together
