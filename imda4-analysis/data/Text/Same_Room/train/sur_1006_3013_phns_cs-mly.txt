what we can (err) do for our (err) client's company so that they can become more sustainable
yup

but after school
I went out with my boyfriend to celebrate our fifth monthsary
<malay>tapi</malay> simple simple [jer] [lah] we went to <malay>makan</malay> (err) <malay>nasi goreng</malay>

then
<malay>habis</malay>
did you <malay>jumpa abah tadi</malay>
[oh]
<malay>sama-sama</malay>
suddenly
thank <malay>sama-sama</malay>

<malay>jadi</malay> (um) the price total was (err) forty dollars forty five
yup
(mmhmm) no got a lot

a_ [lah] cannot <malay>tak boleh</malay> think ahead <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>berapa lama ini</malay>
!huh!
<malay>dalam dunia</malay>
[oh] I know
[ah] ma~ zic~
[oh] <malay>saya tahu</malay>
<malay>makanan</malay>
<malay>sebab saya mak~</malay>
<malay>sebab saya makan terlalu banyak</malay>
then
it's all on food if food is free and can be replaced with something rather than <malay>duit</malay> then (err)
ya I will <malay>boleh jimat banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
(mmhmm)
clothes <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>kadangkala</malay> [jer] <malay>boleh</malay> splurge
but
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so you're not open minded [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
for me it's (err) <malay>mengada-ngada</malay>
like some
no
ya like some girls
or people that that do not respect (err) like
(err) ya other people like example <malay>macam</malay> service crews <malay>cikgu</malay>
that [one] <malay>itu tak boleh tahan</malay> [ah]
especially during class
<malay>kalau dia orang betul-betul</malay> like
<malay>tak tahu</malay> like boundaries like as <malay>sebagai</malay>

boyfriend <malay>kita semua kat</malay> army
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
no
I feel like with the absence of (err)
like <malay>semua benda</malay> like the system capitalism <malay>semua sudah tak ada</malay>
then you will bring about chaos [lah] <malay>sebab semua orang akan</malay> like <malay>fikir</malay>
like of their own selves like in ways where they can survive so for example <malay>macam</malay> food <malay>semua</malay> food resources
water resources everyone will fight to get as much as they can cause there is no
boundaries you know what I mean
<malay>tak ada</malay> system ya
so some would <malay>tamak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> will definitely
<malay>dia orang</malay> will definitely be selfish [lah] of like whatever resources they can get
and it will eventually <malay>macam</malay> create havoc
so as much as capitalism <malay>semua orang cakap macam tak bagus</malay> it's like much needed in the
much needed in the society unless there's another way in which (uh) we could
(err) prevent like chaos from happening [lah]
