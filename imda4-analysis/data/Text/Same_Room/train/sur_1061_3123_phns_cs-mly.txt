okay can start already

<malay>tu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>bila</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> last <malay>jumpa</malay> each other
[oh] that time <malay>kita</malay>
we
video call each other [kan]
[oh] <malay>apa ni yang</malay>
was it my assignment
[oh] ya ya ya ya okay okay okay but that's not counted as <malay>jumpa</malay> [lah] because it was on google meet
was it google meet facetime
zoom zoom [eh]
because the last time we met physically was like
before COVID [kan]
that was like
many many months [seh]
and I think just because of this recording <malay>baru</malay> [lah] <malay>kita nak jumpa</malay>
<malay>kalau tak aku rasa</malay> next year <malay>baru aku jumpa kau</malay>
ya
so
(err) how have you been like I mean how's your work been
[ah]
so like (err) were you affected
I see
so like are you working from home now or what
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> for me <malay>leceh</malay> [seh] you know like
for me [lah] for me like <malay>kau nak</malay>
like
like <malay>kau nak kena</malay> work from home then <malay>kau kena</malay> go back office might as well just work from home [kan] because your job <malay>pun</malay> doesn't really require you to like
really be in office right
don't mention it man it's been damn crazy
you know right I I've been doing online right I've been on doing online learning so it's been
very tiring [lah]
because for me it's like online learning is
like the workload is increasing
so it's not like people say it's like !alah! online [jer] [pe]
you know it's like very easy [what] you just (err) turn on your laptop and then <malay>duduk depan</malay> screen [jer]
but to be honest it's really very taxing because it's like you have to be there from like morning eight thirty usually [lah] my daily my daily <malay>apa</malay> (err) daily timetable will be like <malay>lapan setengah</malay> eight thirty then
<malay>kalau</malay> at most <malay>pun</malay> I will end about what five six <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau duduk</malay> in front of the screen for that one whole day
ya
ya because for me [kan] <malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>aku pun</malay> I I love to be honest I love to be at home but like to be at home
sitting in front of the laptop I don't think I don't think that's my ideal staying at home situation
[eh] <malay>kau tahu tak</malay> actually [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> the thing that we are doing now right <malay>aku</malay> feel <malay>macam</malay> deja vu [tau] <malay>aku</malay> feel like
like
<malay>aku pernah mimpi pasal</malay> this whole scenario serious I mean I mean now like what we are doing now
<malay>aku</malay> feel like deja vu [sia] <malay>ni</malay>
I I feel like I've dreamt about this before but okay nevermind ya
so ya [lah] but now (um) it's it's going to be exam period soon and assignment period and stuff like that so
I'm just
trying to survive day by day but
I will make it through [lah] as always <malay>dah nak dekat</malay> final year [kan]
[ah] ya [lah] ya [lah] I mean
I'm trying
ya true
but you know like I feel like I've been (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> stress eating [tau]
I've been stress eating and I haven't been exercising that much
like
I mean when you are stressed you I I keep I keep like <malay>macam apa</malay> (um)
buying comfort food
and my comfort food is like not those healthy one please is like those what chocolate
(mm) #liho#
[kan]
[eh] but I've been doing this (err) one cardio [tau]
(err) this one channel
brody (um) brody <malay>pula</malay> (err) body project
it's like this one guy instructor and one female instructor
they are couples like
I think husband and wife
then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> he the guy is very
<malay>macam</malay> very inspirational [ah] very motivational <malay>nanti dia macam dia kelakar</malay> like every time like <malay>dia dah habis dia punya</malay> whole exercise [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> last last [kan] <malay>bila apa ni</malay> cool down [kan] <malay>nanti dia kasih macam</malay> those motivational speech <malay>nanti isteri dia</malay> will be like <malay>apa</malay> [jer] <malay>apa</malay> [jer] <malay>budak ni buat</malay> cause like <malay>dia punya</malay> speech is good [lah] because <malay>dia akan cakap</malay> things like
(err) okay the fact that you have (err) chosen this (err) this this workout the fact that you have chosen this video means that (err) you know that <malay>macam</malay> you know he's trying to say that (err) <malay>macam</malay> well done [lah] because like <malay>kau</malay> (err) <malay>kau</malay> decides to do this workout
so
in a way <malay>macam</malay> well done so like he's trying to make us feel very motivated because after like cause <malay>dia orang ada macam</malay> the the workout varies [tau] <malay>dia macam ada</malay> forty minutes I think the the least is like ten minutes
then (um)
after forty minutes <malay>kau</malay> feel like you want to die right
so actually his speech is really very inspiring <malay>macam kau</malay> feel like okay ya that's why <malay>aku</malay> take this this this whole
video
[oh] no I think
it was like six years ago but only recently <malay>macam dia orang</malay> famous I think
<malay>kau</malay> try [ah] one day ya
because recently okay <malay>aku</malay> tried <malay>macam</malay> the videos from six years ago and the videos [lah] recently
<malay>yang</malay> six years six years ago is like purely <malay>macam</malay> because I think <malay>dia orang</malay> just started out right so <malay>macam dia orang</malay> very (err)
very <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> very rigid very cardio cardio you know <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay> videos <malay>macam</malay> really okay thirty second <malay>nanti ada</malay> count~ countdown <malay>gitu sekarang dah macam</malay> more chillax <malay>macam dia orang ada letak lagu</malay>
songs you know music so
to me
it's good [lah] <malay>macam kau joget</malay> and then <malay>lagu dia macam</malay>
quite quite quite quite fun also
so <malay>kau</malay> don't feel like you are actually exercising
[ah] [ah]
ya especially now that you are working from home <malay>kau nak kena</malay> really [seh] have to make time
because for me like
because <malay>aku</malay> just recently started doing the cardio [kan] then there's this whole whole week <malay>yang aku tak</malay> (err) felt well so I didn't do workout <malay>aku dia punya apa</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> exhaustion <malay>tu dia punya</malay> level of exhaustion <malay>boleh rasa</malay> [seh] because it's like
you know <malay>kau</malay> feel so tired then <malay>kau</malay> feel like <malay>macam lemah</malay>
you know so that's why <malay>aku rasa</malay> like you you have to like (um)
be consistent [ah]
actually <malay>aku</malay> have this intention [tau] like every morning <malay>bangun</malay>
<malay>pergi</malay> jogging
ya but actually you <malay>macam</malay> we must [tau] because I mean you're not getting any younger and then like (um)
our health <malay>ni</malay> is really very important because recently I just bought a <malay>kau tahu yang</malay> the blood pressure <malay>punya</malay> monitor cause my mum few days ago <malay>dia sakit</malay> [kan] <malay>yang dia pergi</malay> doctor <malay>tu</malay> so she had like <malay>macam</malay> high blood pressure [lah]
it was really very high so <malay>macam</malay> (mm) the doctor <malay>suruh pergi suruh beli</malay> that machine to monitor so I bought bought from watsons
<malay>beli</malay> [ah] then the past few days we've been checking our B_P
then (err) my <malay>adik punya</malay> B_P was like
hundred and fifty like below hundred and thirty <malay>gitu macam</malay> normal [lah] then my <malay>adik cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>tak kak tak tak</malay> (err) it is normal for me hundred and fifty <malay>lepas tu aku macam</malay> are you sure your are you sure it's normal <malay>abeh dia cakap kak</malay> I'm fat then <malay>aku</malay>
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] is it cause
for me [kan] <malay>aku aku</malay> don't really bother about this kind of thing [tau] to be honest
<malay>macam</malay>
I know I have to take care of my health but I don't really bother about this kind of thing until like you until like someone really fall sick or it's like a wake up call
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> recently <malay>aku macam fikir</malay> [eh] actually really [seh] I've been eating a lot of unhealthy food
and then <malay>kau tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>muka aku ni macam</malay> this pimple it's really a sign that says that I'm not I I feel like I haven't been glowing
you know and I feel so <malay>macam</malay>
very sucky like you know like <malay>macam kau</malay>
because you can you can really see from your your face [tau] <malay>kalau kau</malay> really glow you know that kind of thing so that's why <malay>aku</malay> these few days <malay>aku</malay> feel like (err) really [seh] I could really feel like I need to wake up in the morning and go for a jog
[ah] ya
ya true that's why [lah] <malay>aku cakap aku aku aku</malay> feel like I haven't been taking care of myself lately ever since (err) start online learning <malay>ni</malay>
cause <malay>aku</malay> feel like
to be honest <malay>macam dulu aku malam-malam aku letak letak apa</malay> those facial <malay>punya benda</malay> [ah] serious <malay>aku</malay> moisturizer <malay>aku</malay> really very very very consistent <malay>sekarang aku dah macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>lantak kau</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>malas</malay> [tau] then <malay>aku sekarang</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> could feel so
<malay>menyesal</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> really <malay>menyesal</malay>
the pimple and stuff like that and then like you know
(um)
okay [lah] maybe I'm just lazy
ya
so it's not online learning it's just me
ya
!hey! you sure <malay>kau</malay> step [jer] you are saying this because you are my friend
[eh] no but I actually [kan] <malay>aku</malay> feel you should like makeover [ah] your room
or is it because you like this kind of
vibe
you know what
you should put like fairy lights man
no <malay>kau kena macam letak dari sana</malay>
but what colour was your light <malay>macam</malay> is it like the <malay>macam</malay>
the orangey type or the white one
but you also bought <malay>yang</malay> the the stars thingy right the constellation <malay>punya lampu</malay>

your kindergarten is under the P_A_P <malay>punya</malay> [kan]
<malay>sama</malay> [lah]
but mine was like (err) near the pioneer area <malay>sana</malay>
or maybe <malay>tak</malay> [lah] maybe we met in (err) primary school
so if we met serious primary three
[oh] my
so that means we'd be friends for like about twenty plus years
[oh] my
[eh] but actually [kan]
but actually
our friendship is like random
[kan] because I remember in secondary school we we weren't really contacting each other [kan]
<malay>bila</malay> [eh] <malay>kita</malay> start
close
it's always like that <malay>macam kau bila kau</malay> in the same environment with the person [kan] <malay>kau tak kau tak macam</malay> close [tau] <malay>nanti kalau kau dah habis sekolah ke apa habis macam habis kerja ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti kau</malay> just randomly
<malay>pergi</malay> trip <malay>dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi</malay> holiday <malay>dengan dia</malay> [lah]
ya I have that friend also like my this one ex colleague <malay>dulu macam</malay> like when I was working with her
<malay>kita tak berbual langsung</malay> [tau] because
<malay>aku</malay> like <malay>macam kirakan</malay> assistant <malay>dia</malay> executive [lah] different roles [kan] because that time I was still taking my diploma she was already like degree holder <malay>gitu</malay> so different roles so I was like in one office and she was in another room
<malay>kita tak kita tak rapat</malay> then after I left then like <malay>tiba</malay> randomly <malay>kita</malay> because like for me like after after I left right usually I will like add them on facebook or instagram
then <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> random <malay>tiba-tiba dia ajak aku</malay> like <malay>pergi</malay> the one the one that I went perth with
yes then
and then the funny thing is like <malay>aku pergi</malay> trip <malay>dengan</malay> not only her but also with her sister and then like so funny like <malay>kita tiga</malay> like con~ considered like strangers but then like when we were at perth <malay>kita</malay> just clicked instantly [tau]
and then <malay>aku macam</malay> amazed because
!wow! you know I'm an introvert [kan] then
to to click with someone because she's an extrovert
and then like
it's just so <malay>macam orang cakap macam senang</malay> [ah] <malay>masuk</malay>
ya
[oh] my god
I don't know what you are thinking but no that's not what I meant okay you and your you and your weird mind
alright whatever
okay [lah] okay [lah] let's not go that direction
[oh] about my boyfriend [eh]
okay [lah] okay [ah] I think
<malay>aku</malay> just be real <malay>dengan kau</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] recently <malay>dia sakit</malay>
I I don't remember I don't I don't recall if I told you about his condition cause
okay the okay (err) what was the last time that I told you about him [eh] do you remember
[oh] okay so it's really very way back [ah] okay okay so <malay>macam macam gini</malay>
<malay>dia sakit</malay> [kan]
it was (err) before he <malay>balik</malay>
okay so he <malay>sakit tekak</malay> and stuff like that initially we thought it was like because of him smoking
so I was like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) because he's okay not only his throat [tau] then he always has like <malay>macam</malay> ulcer
popping in his mouth so it was very painful for him
so we tried like natural remedies [lah] <malay>macam kasih dia minum</malay> like those (um) honey lemon <malay>kasih dia pakai yang kau tahu</malay> bonjela gel stuff like that
(err) eventually it didn't get better for him and he was very worried and then the fact that because [kan] he (um) because he's staying far away from family so his anxiety level is really really very high and
I was trying his best to be very supportive but at the same time I was also very tired because he wasn't trying to be positive as well
I mean I understand where where he's coming from but
to me if you're not trying to be positive about your condition
it's very difficult
[kan] so like (um)
his condition kind of worsen [tau]
from the throat to
technically like the whole part of him [lah] got worse
so he went back he went back home then (err) <malay>macam biasa kena</malay> quarantine and stuff like that then <malay>macam aku cakap dengan dia</malay> (err) you go <malay>jumpa</malay> doctor <malay>kat sana jumpa</malay> clinic <malay>kat sana</malay> cause first of all it's cheaper and and and <malay>kau</malay> at least like <malay>macam</malay>
(err) at least get to the bottom of it [lah] because if not you don't know what's happening [kan] because we've been trying natural remedies and then it's not working <malay>lepas tu dia pergi</malay> clinic <malay>kat sini pun</malay>
it's not working as well and then one thing <malay>aku geram pasal dia</malay> [kan] is that <malay>dia nak benda</malay> [kan] <malay>nak nak dia sakit dia nak cepat</malay> like instantaneously [tau]
<malay>abeh aku macam</malay> [eh] come on [lah] like <malay>kau nak baik</malay> needs time to recover [kan] but <malay>dia tak dia macam nak kau tahu macam makan ubat hari ni esok nak baik</malay>
where got such thing right so okay <malay>tu tak apa</malay> then he like (err)
he
but he <malay>balik</malay>
okay he <malay>balik</malay> then (um) he
he <malay>balik</malay>
and <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
he <malay>balik</malay> he went for doctor and stuff like that
the doctor <malay>cakap</malay>
something wrong (err) there's something wrong with his kidney
<malay>buah pinggang</malay>
<malay>buah buah buah pinggang bengkak</malay>
so
(err) he has to go for like further check up <malay>dekat</malay> (err) specialists but it will take time
for the for the for the appointment
so right now he's actually on (err) renal diet [ah] renal diet <malay>ni macam</malay> (um) less salt less sodium less potassium <malay>kalau kau ingat aku aku kadang-kadang aku</malay> post <malay>dekat</malay> instagram <malay>yang gambar-gambar masak</malay> it was actually for him
ya but then
I don't know [eh] <malay>macam</malay> sometimes recently <malay>aku</malay> feel like (um)
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] okay you know I'm a very
(err) okay even though <malay>aku</malay> introvert [kan] you know I'm a very outgoing person adventurous person and stuff like that
and then when <malay>aku</malay> with him <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>aku</malay>
like he
he really drains me
not only mentally
but emotionally because <malay>aku</malay> feel like
throughout this whole (um)
few months [kan] it's al~ it's always been about him okay maybe I'm selfish but it's always been about him and then like <malay>aku</malay> trying
<malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kau tahu aku sakit tangan</malay>
so like
<malay>aku</malay> don't feel the support from him also
cause it's always been about his sickness
so like
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> recently <malay>aku</malay> feel like
(mm) ya
ya because
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nak cakap</malay> [eh]
like
(mm) okay
okay actually [kan] that time he asked me [tau]
<malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> [ah] he said (um) okay you know of my condition and stuff like that [kan] like do you still want to be with me
but at that point of time <malay>aku</malay> was in (err) in a dilemma because
okay
okay this is very cliche but
you know how (um) because okay I don't want to be that kind of girl <malay>yang macam</malay>
<malay>bila kau susah kau takde tapi bila kau senang kau ada</malay> you get what I mean
like
like like like you said relationship
<malay>mesti ada</malay> ups and downs [kan] I want to be that kind of person who who has always been supportive
okay and when he asked me <malay>macam</malay> do you still want to be with me despite my condition <malay>aku</malay> felt
guilty <malay>aku</malay> felt <malay>bersalah</malay> because <malay>macam</malay> [oh] because of his condition now <malay>abeh aku nak tinggalkan dia</malay>
but
okay <malay>aku aku aku aku rasa kadang-kadang aku rasa macam aku pun</malay> depressed [ah] maybe because of the previous relationship I think my ex really really broke me
okay maybe it's also my fault for not healing properly
when I got to know this new guy
but
I don't know [eh] because you know my soft spot for my ex [kan]
and I hate the fact that he made me feel this way
you know sometimes I feel like
because just now I was talking to (err) my friend
<malay>yang tadi aku jumpa tu</malay> I was telling her I said that you know sometimes
if if I <malay>macam</malay> if I could turn back time sometimes I wish <malay>macam</malay> there are some exes <malay>yang aku</malay> shouldn't have let go
<malay>macam</malay> I should you know my <malay>yang</malay> the ex from (err) poly <malay>tu yang dia nyanyi tu</malay>
that guy
[ah] like okay cause he was my best friend
so
you know like <malay>macam</malay> I I want those kind of relationship <malay>yang macam</malay>
you can be with
you can be yourself
you want to be with your best friend you know like you can talk about anything and he was that kind of person but because of my
my my temper my my my P_M_S my mood
kind of destroyed everything and then like you know recently <malay>aku</malay> added him on (err) instagram and then like a few days ago [ah] no actually was yesterday I saw his instagram story and I was tempted to message <malay>dia</malay> [tau]
but <malay>aku macam jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan jangan</malay> message <malay>jangan cari pasal</malay>
like <malay>aku nak</malay> text but <malay>aku macam</malay> telling myself not to
but to be honest there are some there are times where <malay>aku</malay> felt like
I shouldn't screwed up I shouldn't have screwed up my relationship with him
[kan]
actually [kan] to think of it I think he was like my only best friend [tau]
I mean you know during poly I had a lot I had a lot of guy friends
but I think he was like my only best friend
and
ya to lose him was like a double double hit [seh] double blow [ah] in a way because you lose your
best friend and you lose your boyfriend
ya
but
(um) like you said I think at that point of time we were young
okay and you know at at that point of time I had a very terrible okay maybe this is an excuse
but I had a terrible time with my family remember my parents were divorcing at that point of time right I had it tough then
I was very temperamental emotional okay [lah] I was a shitty person
then
he wanted different things and then there was a third party which <malay>aku ni gatal sangat pergi melayan</malay> the third party was my recent ex
[ah]
so that's why <malay>aku</malay> like when I think about this whole thing [kan] <malay>aku</malay> feel like <malay>macam</malay>
I shouldn't have <malay>layan</malay> the ex man I mean I shouldn't have <malay>layan</malay> that third party
because you know you know that that time (err) during one of my (um) poly friend <malay>punya</malay> wedding [kan] we met
we bump into each other and then
<malay>aku lupa</malay> [tau] <malay>aku</malay> honestly forgot that he was the cause of the break up
then <malay>aku</malay> introduce <malay>macam tak bersalah gitu lepas tu</malay> because I only I didn't notice at that point of time I only remembered when I was looking back at my memory box because I have this memory box where I <malay>apa tu</malay>
keep like letters
pictures
cause <malay>dulu aku dengan dia</malay> okay [lah] a bit cheesy [lah] we we write letters to each other
ya he's that kind of guy and <malay>aku</malay> I'm a sucker for letters like to me it's very sentimental and we have those you know <malay>macam</malay> coupons that was my birthday like gift [lah] to him <malay>macam</malay> coupons <malay>macam</malay>
okay (um) redeem this to get a free dinner [ah] <malay>macam</malay> redeem this to get a free massage [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know
for him it was very thoughtful because
I mean it's not expensive you just like what print out a template and you write but to him he was very it was a very thoughtful gift
so I'm a sucker for that kind of thing I'm a sucker for like letters and stuff like that so
like recently I was looking through my memory box and then I saw
there's this book that I wrote [tau] <malay>aku dengan dia tulis</malay> (err) <malay>tak kita macam</malay> okay <malay>kau tahu macam</malay> paper [kan] <malay>lepas tu kita macam gunting</malay> then <malay>kita macam</malay> staple [lah] <malay>tepi tu macam</malay> make it into a book so we wrote down like
things that I dislike about you serious things I like about you (err) what do you want to change in this relationship then <malay>macam</malay> appraisal
ya so so we did that so we did that then (um) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err)
I [oh] he wrote down that person name so like recently [kan] <malay>aku</malay> look through [kan] then <malay>aku</malay> realise [oh] my god he hated this person so I was like
and then I introduce them then <malay>aku</malay> was like [oh] my god what ya then I was like what did I do you know no no wonder okay [lah] because you know you know you know when a person is looking at you [kan]
at the wedding
he was looking at me
I mean my ex <malay>yang</malay> best friend <malay>tu</malay>
(err) he was looking at me and then from <malay>dia macam dia tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh kalau kau tengok dia tiba-tiba mata dia macam</malay>
I don't know because okay [lah] recently okay <malay>aku</malay> be honest with <malay>dengan kau</malay> [eh]
I basically I tried to flirt with him [tau]
ya online through (err) because <malay>kita</malay> friends again [what] on instagram
no
I tried to like <malay>macam</malay> talk to him and stuff like that but
I think he kind of
learn his lesson so he tried not to engage
(err) a conversation into me [lah] <malay>macam</malay> with me so <malay>macam dia</malay>
<malay>macam kita berbual</malay> then after that <malay>nanti kadang-kadang dia</malay> just seen <malay>tak</malay> reply <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay [lah] but

and he has his group of friends I have a group of friends
and I don't know whether I can fit into his life anymore
I mean people change right
(err) it was a funn~ not okay now it's funny but that point of time it wasn't
like I remember <malay>merepek gila ya allah</malay> I don't know it was like <malay>macam</malay> I think it was after his performance or something

okay I can't remember but I remember this one part where <malay>kita naik</malay> M_R_T [tau] he was sitting at the two seater seat and I was sitting at the long seat <malay>tu</malay>
after that
we'll we'll both very angry with each other then we didn't talk to each other
