but then like if you are buying the three room but then like it's small like I mean like last time four and last time
like four room is now's five room
like B_T_O five room
and then after that if you want to talk like realistically
like I wouldn't even spend
more than four hundred thousand
on a house
ya like I would <malay>macam</malay> spend the
my whole life paying for the house
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam tak</malay>

three K
that's why [ah] like I went my agent right then my agent say
(uh)
(err) you can also cause <malay>kita</malay> like we planning to get at woodlands so it's like woodlands area is just so near to J_B then she say so <malay>aku kata</malay> like you <malay>beli rumah dekat</malay> woodlands
and then after that then like
after five years M_O_P then
(err) you all (err) <malay>rasa macam</malay> you all save enough money to <malay>beli rumah dekat</malay> (err) J_B
then you all just <malay>beli rumah dekat</malay> J_B <malay>abeh</malay> rent out the <malay>rumah dekat</malay> (err) singapore [ah] <malay>dekat</malay> woodlands
like so many like so many people want to rent nowadays
ya and like there's so many people who want to
buy a house but cannot buy a house cause like
ya there's so many of like these things
<malay>abeh nanti orang cakap</malay> like imagine <malay>satu rumah</malay> like seven hundred dollars
ab~ <malay>satu rumah</malay> [eh] seven hundred dollars
<malay>satu bilik</malay> seven hundred dollars up to eight hundred fifty dollars
<malay>sebab tempat dia kat</malay> woodlands
and then after that then you times like let's say the <malay>rumah</malay> that I want to go for is <malay>empat bilik</malay>
then like
no <malay>dekat</malay> singapore [ah] so seven hundred (uh) times four
one thousand four two thousand eight
so one month you earn two thousand eight you never even <malay>kerja</malay>
so two thousand eight
ya it's like a property investment [ah] something like that ya
so like two thousand eight <malay>abeh dah tu</malay> you convert the money to malaysia
times three
[ah] <malay>tak payah kerja</malay> [seh]
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
(uh huh)

(uh huh)
[kan] ya
ya
(uh huh)
[orh]
ya [lor] some more he buy condo some condo is like
(uh) freehold [eh] you know what's freehold
okay so like <malay>rumah</malay> H_D_B [kan] <malay>dia ada</malay> ninety nine years lease
so <malay>kalau</malay> freehold that means like you can stay there forever and ever you can go generation
like ya some [ah]
<malay>jadi dia macam</malay> forever and ever <malay>jadi</malay>
let's say <malay>ada anak cucu cicit</malay>
[ah]
then <malay>dah tu sebab dia orang dah ada</malay> the <malay>rumah</malay>
then they can just like rent the <malay>rumah</malay> then they can just buy another house because it's like
technically it's like their landed property
ya so
crazy [lah] like the amount like
that I still like
see singaporeans like they still have like money
to purchase property and here I am just willing to spend four hundred thousand dollars only

you you need to work
to be to diplo~ [eh] to
<malay>apa namanya apa</malay> after diploma [ah] degree
ya after degree <malay>abeh setakat macam dapat</malay> like a three hundred dollar raise like a starting pay of two eight

like
I mean to buy a house
everybody standard like that is the price of the house to the house <malay>tapi ni macam</malay>

<malay>tunda</malay> [lah] <malay>beli rumah tak akan beli</malay>
!aduh! <malay>peningnya kepala</malay>
[ah] [seh]
thir~ <malay>tiga puluh</malay> [ah] <malay>tiga puluh</malay>
<malay>tapi tiga puluh lelaki tak ada masalah</malay> [seh]
<malay>lelaki dengan perempuan masalah</malay>
the harder it is
[ah]
why
(uh huh)
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay
<malay>zuriat zuriat</malay>
[oh] my gosh
ya
pros
(uh) thing to think about
ya
but then okay [ah] I think like the guys prime time is actually thirty years old
thirty years is like a good enough like
(err) time
ya
ya it's it's okay now you~ now younger girls like older guys
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>betul betul betul betul</malay>
!wah!
(uh huh)
[eh] but I think like the trend [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> is like
actually it doesn't matter
cause ya
<malay>tak sebab</malay>
like we all like I think we grew up in a way that
<malay>semua orang boleh jadi</malay> independent like girl <malay>dengan</malay> girl like guy girl is girl guy is guy and like
if I wanna like work towards something like I work hard for it [ah] and then after that then (err) <malay>kalau macam</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> slack off
then just
ya
so I think the <malay>zaman dah berubah</malay> change already
ya
because right I see I see right actually
now <malay>zaman sekarang orang</malay>
like <malay>perempuan</malay> like like girls
<malay>lagi</malay>
like they earn more
than the guys
ya
and which is like I think like I don't know but like I think it hurts the like
the guy's pride the <malay>maruah</malay> of the guy which is like
I mean like sometimes it's un~ <malay>tak boleh</malay> avoid
<malay>macam</malay>
is it
[ah]
(uh) ya
(mm)
it's not possible [eh]
for <malay>satu</malay> for one person to <malay>kerja</malay>
like to
<malay>macam mana nak cakap macam</malay> sole breadwinner ya like it's impossible like
you need like to have the both of them to work
<malay>kalau satu orang kerja</malay>
!whoa!
<malay>tapi</malay> commission <malay>pun tak</malay> stable [seh]
<malay>satu hari</malay> like you can like <malay>satu bulan</malay> you can only earn like <malay>macam tiga ribu abeh</malay> the next <malay>bulan</malay> you earn <malay>lima ribu</malay>
<malay>abeh macam</malay>
<malay>abeh kalau ada bulan satu satu ribu</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
so let's say you need to have like a backup [lah]
saving plan
[kan]
[eh]
[ah] [seh]
<malay>lagi</malay> like COVID I think COVID nineteen was a good example like
of like my
[ah]
ya
[kan]
like
