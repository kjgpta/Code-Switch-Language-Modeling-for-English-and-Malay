[oh] okay it's okay [lah]
<malay>aku mimpi aku</malay> pregnant babe then the <malay>mimpi</malay> was so real is like <malay>macam kau tahu bila kau tengah</malay> give birth
ya so I was like giving birth to a baby I don't know
ya I can feel the pain it's <malay>sakit gila</malay> babe

ya got saga
(err) nobody [ah] it's just me and the baby and some other people that <malay>aku tak kenal</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> baby <malay>biasa</malay> I guess like <malay>anak perempuan habis</malay> cute <malay>tapi nakal</malay> [ah] <malay>habis dia minta susu dengan aku selalu</malay>
no [leh] it's more of like I have to <malay>jaga</malay> this baby
ya because it's already there with me [mah]
(err) that's why [lah]
I feel weirded out because I don't know when the baby was but it's also like a continuation of my dream when I was pregnant it's so weird

<malay>orang tu macam tak</malay> text <malay>aku balik</malay> or what I think <malay>aku fikir yang bukan-bukan</malay> but then I <malay>aku macam</malay> don't act on it [lah] but sometimes I'll I'll be
I think more to guys [ah] ya I think ya
even though you think maybe it's something personal but <malay>kau</malay> try to
ya
ya or like
[oh] okay now I remember or like people who like block my way when I'm walking or what babe that's the most petty shit ever
[a'ah] <malay>satu hari tu kat</malay> bus <malay>aku tak tahu kalau kau ingat ke tak aku</malay> tweet <malay>pasal perempuan ni kat</malay> bus <malay>habis dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak nak jalan</malay> babe <malay>dia macam tak nak</malay> give <malay>aku</malay> way <malay>habis</malay>
in the end like <malay>dia tak nak duduk dia tak nak duduk tak apa tapi banyak</malay> seats <malay>kat belakang</malay> then <malay>bila banyak</malay> seats <malay>kat belakang aku geram</malay> [lah] <malay>macam apasal kau tak nak kasi aku jalan</malay> [eh]
and then me being passive aggressive <malay>aku macam</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] <malay>aku</malay> just <malay>diri habis aku jeling-jeling kat dia</malay>
then <malay>terus bila orang turun dia duduk dekat depan</malay> babe
at last <malay>dia duduk</malay> so <malay>pun tak apa</malay>
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> maybe around like younger than me
she saw me she saw me and then <malay>dia macam nak buat macam</malay> you know <malay>muka yang macam</malay>
(mm) step <malay>tak nampak aku gitu</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> stare <malay>dia</malay> [seh] <malay>aku dah macam minah</malay> red <malay>aku dah keluar habis</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> what about you
<malay>aku rasa macam</malay> you're the least petty person ever
(mm) ya ya
it has to be very big [ah] ya
ya
she's annoying [lah]
but I also don't like him [leh]
I think he's the petty [one]
ya ya ya
(hmm)
of course [lah] just dislike
but I can I know other people who don't like me for petty reasons like they just don't like me or
or like me <malay>zaman dulu</malay> [lah] because
ya ya <malay>bila aku dengan</malay> #zee# I mean like this girl <malay>nama apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nama dia apa</malay> [eh] <malay>aku lupa tapi dia kawan</malay> #zee#
then this girl <malay>dia macam tak nak tegur aku tak nak</malay> say hi even though I said hi to her so I don't know her personally [what] right
I mean you can just say hi [what] but then the #wan see# girl just came to me [oh] [oh] allie
so allie #wan# (err) #wan see# was like telling me like [eh] [ah] ya she don't like you [eh] then I was like !huh! why [sia]
ya [eh] you know why it's because
exactly it's because <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>apa ni aku</malay> date #zee# that's the reason why she don't like me even though I'm julie's friend
so I thought that was very petty of her
she didn't know me
and to for her to go out of her way not to say hi to me it's super petty [lah]
yes she blatantly like ignored me
but it's not faking [lor] it's just immature [mah]
[ah] ya ya ya ya
(mm)
(err)
damn
(mm) (mm)
ya
ya appearance all
<malay>nasib baik buat apa</malay> call <malay>aku</malay> [eh]

!wow!
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
master three new skills [eh]
I think I wouldn't want a new skill more of the skill that I already have

a lot of languages instantly
ya
and also <malay>kau boleh baca quran</malay> babe
!yay!
ya you can converse with anybody
and then the second [one] would be to be able to play any instruments that I want

hopefully they will accept your conversation [hor]

ya it's a skill ya singing is a skill [seh]
it's not you don't really need like talent
ya there's this
[ah] there's this video [kan]
(err) about james charles <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>suka nyanyi tapi nyanyi dia macam tak sedap</malay> [kan] so he went to a vocal coach
ya and then it his singing improved
I think so [ah]
!huh!

you do not have to have talent you just have to have ya the determination
yes
ya ya definitely
why not
la~ la~ la~
okay so

!wow! actor [ah]
actor
<malay>siapa</malay> [seh] <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> I'm already an actor myself in real life I think normal
(hmm) thinking of my favourite
(err)
I don't know why like on top of my head is johnny depp for some reason because he's very versatile
ya
ya but then I don't want to go through the abuse
ya that's true that's true that's true
but I just said why [what] thus
because he's such a versatile actor but if it was a young actor maybe I want to be number five
so handsome
[oh] I'm a sixteen year old boy
ya
<malay>apasal</malay> [seh]
#elek elek#
<malay>apasal dok dia kena bahang</malay>
<malay>kat luar</malay>

[oh]
all so just jealous of him [lor] he's very good [sia]
<malay>aku tahu tapi</malay> I didn't like
yes
but to me it's just like okay [lah]
yes
no that that video makes me think like yes he is still a kid
so it's like okay [lah] [kan] nothing wrong with that but I think because we older already so we don't really <malay>macam</malay> judge too harshly
[oh] I didn't know that people were like bullying him
ya encouragement [ah] yes if I were him I wouldn't care [lah] of what people say like [ah] whatever I want to sing
normal yes
!wow! why am I not surprised
(mm) ya
[oh] ya I heard about that
ya yes
!wow! awesome [sia] better than mine [sia]
ya
!wow!
ya so petty
ya
ya
that's great
!wow! I'll be young again but then I'll have like my life set out already
like dance rap but then if I were to wake up as me in their body I think cannot
like you wake up as them but you're still yourself <malay>rabak</malay> though then suddenly I can speak malay
that's so
[a'ah]
that will make the news you know !wah! stray kids can speak malay [one] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
!wow!
!huh! work
at all
not go work but (um) [ah]
I don't know [leh] I feel like we will like
go back to how we were
ya we would have to like make our own food you know farm or whatever right it's still kind of like work
but maybe it means
like <malay>tak payah pergi kerja</malay> [ah]
[oh] like a depression [ah]
!wah! man I don't know man
ya I think <malay>aku</malay> so
ya I think will be like if you don't need money to survive right do you have other means
it's like a dystopian game
if it were me I will just sleep
but if you don't have to go to work
so be anything [lah] whatever people need [lah]
<malay>aku rasa aku kasi</malay> therapy [ah]
[ah] you give me food and I'll give you a hug how about that
okay what is it must listen first if kiss can kiss on the cheek
but please I hungry if not I just kill you [lah]
but that's an interesting question though I can't imagine [ah] cause it's too far far fetched already
but you realise or not like apocalypse themed movies like singapore don't do that imagine in singapore context we do that I don't know how it's going to be
<malay>tapi</malay> are we allowed to talk about singapore like that
[ah] that's true [lah]
ya
out of the boss <malay>gitu</malay> [lah]
but apocalypse in singapore I don't know [sial]
how is it going to be
of course not [lah] it's like gradual
ya
ya ya ya
but I feel like if ever [lah] got apocalypse in singapore I think all the races will finally get together and will not think about actually being coloured
ya like
come on sis
extinct
ya ya ya ya
what's the question again
I think
I mean based on what I see in the news and all that I think (err) global warming
would ya ei~ either we drown or we will run out of food like there's no more resources left that's how ya we become barren [lah]
which is like most likely but imagination wise I don't know [leh]
[oh] because of the pandemic now
ya ya ya ya
that's my legs
spread [ah]
<malay>sekarang ni</malay>
[oh]
ya
ya we already cut [oh] !wow!

bridge
(um) break down
<malay>itu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi kita tak tahu</malay> what type of zombie

our import export don't have already how

lose weight
ya
!yay!
I feel like we'll extinct it will be because of a flu like we will sneeze too much until we get dehydrated and die
hopefully not [lah] [eh] now already COVID it's so scary
(err) work [ah]
[eh]
but something you already hate right like something
(oo) everyday activity
that is torture yes
<malay>gigi</malay> [siol] <malay>putih</malay>
that's torture that's too much
<malay>tak kot</malay>
<malay>tapi kau boleh tak dah hafal</malay> channel <malay>dah hafal cerita dah hafal</malay> script
is it
(oo) that's like work [seh] babe
[oh] this is a game

I think eating for eight hours is a torture also that's like why would you do that but
exercise normally already torture
exhaustion
<malay>putih sangat kau</malay>
dry and <malay>terkopek</malay> and already <malay>putih</malay>
ya you will lose melanin and then like <malay>kau jadi putih</malay> [ah]
[sial] [lah] chores for eight hours

therapeutic
okay then maybe not
I want to say sleeping but then
I cannot torture myself [lor]
so many things
why I rather die
!ee! that's sick
hello
hello what's up who can help me <malay>kau berbual kuat</malay>
I know I want to be able to make someone have diarrhoea
if I don't like the person it's okay no need to say anything just like diarrhoea
ya they won't they won't think it's me also
imagine the engineer <malay>yang kita tak suka dia</malay> knock knock <malay>kat aku bila tengah tidur</malay>
sir (uh) I need to take M_C [ah] <malay>bagus bagus kau balik kau berak</malay> full of shit
ya and then you can ha~ it can happen anytime you want
yes I have thought about it if like if it's others others [eh] if it's other powers I think it's like <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] if it's like creative if it's like <malay>gini gini</malay> like I I don't need all that [ah]
see the ghosts because I'm like
claus like can make them do much for me
ya [lah] but I'm also depressed so I feel like I can [lah]
that's true [lah] hi
I'll just make I'll just make them a K-pop group [ah] then okay go around and stray kids
ya I think that's the wo~ side effect of his power [ah]
ya I think ghosts more than people
so imagine you in a crowd you already <malay>rimas</malay>
then ghosts <malay>lagi-lagi te~ hari-hari tengok kau macam</malay> [eh] and <malay>kau boleh nampak</malay> [sia] <malay>ke apa</malay> !ee!
but then why you say that you want to see ghosts is it
ya but your super power
<malay>apa pernah apa</malay>
ya
most of them are quite bullshit [lah] but the one the real ones like
I only know one guy <malay>dia boleh macam dia memang boleh nampak</malay> but <malay>dia</malay> and you can kind of see <malay>dia macam</malay> claus <malay>dia macam</malay> depressed <malay>dia macam</malay> (mm) ya
<malay>so macam kesian</malay> [ah]
but he's very like I think he has that since young [lah] so <malay>dia macam dah biasa</malay> in a way but
[oh]

ya I know [lah] some of them <malay>macam</malay> they everytime will find an opportunity to just say [eh] <malay>kat belakang kau ada benda</malay> or whatever but I can tell [lah] that is fake [lah]
they quite consistent but
is like why why must you do this all the time like
I think I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] maybe <malay>dia orang gila</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> attention but then why would you want attention that way
it's a guy [ah]
like I remember that time I met my boyfriend there and then he was like [eh] <malay>kau tahu tak</malay> boyfriend <malay>kau ada macam lembaga hitam dekat belakang dia</malay> then I was like
<malay>apasal</malay> [eh] <malay>lembaga hitam dia cakap dia ada</malay> something [lah] <malay>kat</malay> like his aura or something
