[eh] <malay>dah lama tak jumpa</malay>
that time we eat the dinner at Chatime
yeah and then you wanted to buy your le~ first then you wait for so long
the brown sugar pearls right because its closing already [ah] I think that's why
two more weeks before intern
yeah I'm just my friend is just to find a jobs [lah] flexible part time jobs you know to suit my schedule especially like my intern is not paid right <malay> abih kena cari kerja sendiri [lah]
then what about you
<malay> asal boring what you doing at home
(hmm)
yes it almost three years already and we are gonna graduate next year <malay> tak sabar rasanya
I don't know [seh] I'm scared that I just hope that it will have that graduation ceremony [lah] if not we will be like the this year batch right they graduate through Zoom or M_S Teams [ah]
yeah I know right will you miss school !duh!
stress [kan] <malay> kena buat ni semua but I'm glad <malay> macam its all over already [lah] now [dah] holiday <malay> boleh enjoy
but I'm glad it's all over already [lah] no the holiday where they enjoy
so what have you been doing ever since the holiday
<malay> apa was the assignment about !duh!
<malay> apa itu I tak faham
yeah I see
[ah] for this semester
(err) so far only <malay> satu je [lah] like one module (err) we learn about airport management it's quite interesting [lah] cause you get to learn about the operations behind a airports right like how the run or what what other things involved yeah
[oh] my dream job is to be stewardess [lah] like cause <malay> macam you know that time the first time I took a flight to #penang# then the stewardess served me right then from there I was like inspired I want to be like them
so from there <malay> macam I work hard [lah] to you know I do research about aviation about stewardess all these
then get I get to poly this aviation course
but now a bit sad [lah] because COVID then aviation sector like
#rabak# [lah]
yeah that was one of my dreams <malay> tapi macam susah [lah] <malay> nak jadi pilot you need a lot of qualification yeah so now I just want to be a stewardess first [lah] I see [lah] if
I want to work at singapore airlines [lah] but <malay> banyak orang cakap susah nak masuk [ah] because high standard <malay> semua so now I looking for maybe other travel budget airlines like the Scoot or Jetstar asia
why
but okay [lah] we see how maybe I can go in maybe not I don't hope so much but I just hope the only hope I want is to be a stewardess [lah] I don't mind actually which airline as long as I get to as long as I get the dream job I'm working
what's your plan to do what's your plan tomorrow
[oh] <malay>sekarang ni</malay> I I <malay>tengah tengok drama</malay> korea [ah] korea [ah] <malay>cerita lama</malay> [lah] <malay>cerita</malay> legend of the blue sea
yeah I watched that before I think that was in twenty sixteen or something around that year then I want to watch it again [lah] because its so nice yeah you should watch that
[ha] [ha] yes
yeah then [ah] do you want to watch a movie next week or something
train to #busan#
okay
just now I eat [ah] <malay> nasi with <malay> kari daging
what about you
!wah! <malay> sedap nya
<malay> boleh jugak your mom <malay> masak semua
<malay> macam hari raya pulak
[eh] you told me that [ah] she is going to stop working right
okay then how is your intern you got any updates
so you won't be alone [lah]
okay [lah] that's good [lah]
!chey! I thought you say like got maybe at least one more person with you at the same location so at least you won't be bored or you know
some more your house is at #tung lok kiew# right
and you are not familiar with place
its
it's still considered as internship [lah] because I'll be working with #changi# airport it just that I won't be getting salary [lah]
I think there will there's like another four people they'll be doing it with me yeah but then still sad [lah] because I got no salary then I have to find a the part time job to support myself
yeah I have one friend my classmate [lah] she also choose the same internship so I just hope that we'll be working together cause I don't want to work alone work alone
yeah but then like my other friends they <malay> banyak kena campak dekat (err) company <malay> yang tak related to aviation <malay> macam logistics then like some of them will be like under admini~ administration or marketing that kind of job
but they still get they still get paid like high salary [ah] like yesterday I asked my friend she said her salary will be eight hundred dollars and I'm like !wah! so lucky
yeah but for me it's too late for me to reject my internship [lah] because all the position close already so I'll have nowhere to go so I'll just have to accept that internship
yeah hopefully I can cope [lah] between the project and the job
<malay> belum susah cause <malay> aku tengah cari flexible or adhoc ker~ kind of job [kan] <malay> tapi mostly like they want you know minimum commitment three to four days a week that kind and like you know office hours yeah so hard [lah] I need to find a flexible one because I scared if they ask me to come to the #changi# airport then if I working the part time job then I cannot go there how you know so I need to prioritize my intern first
no who enjoy [seh]
why
for long [ah]
what !aiyo!
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
like the participation level for us very low and then we get you know sometimes get downgraded because of that so its like unfair
physical class
yeah but !wah! this semester my grades okay [lah] decent only [lah] its not the grade that I expected
yeah because because like I said [lah] like the participation never all actually I do participate but I just don't unmute my mic because I don't dare and like ya [lah] ever~ a bit <malay> takut [ah] when if you talk then you will talk alone
so how (err) how was
good [lah] was it a <malay> macam manageable or stressful
okay [lah] but it's quite hard [lah] to you know ask your friends or your faci then like through online cause no issue in the physical cause you ask your faci then he straight away come to you know like can get instant answer right but this one you need to write message or you call them sometimes so they busy doing things then they will reply like very late
so it's like
yeah correct [lah] better you by say then all your classmates listen right
okay so what's your plan after you graduate from poly
[oh]
same [lah] I also thinking like I want to go in uni but not sure what course should I take cause now COVID so I thinking of like taking something to back up me [lah] you know aviation may not be stable like even after COVID (err) finish
so maybe I'm thinking like taking up (err) finance or H_R course cause like this I want to take a course that is like universal [lah] that accepted everywhere every industry so I feel like it will be safe for me
<malay> abih kau macam mana macam ada plans <malay> nak buat business [eh]
!wah!
I see like !wah! nowadays a lot of people do auction on Facebook
yeah
<malay>tak</malay> they see [eh] I see like they sell those gadgets you know like speakers [lah]
not sure I think some of them are brand new
yeah maybe then
now also people sell clothes [oh] now especially COVID they sell the mask you know they make themselves yeah
everywhere you can see that
so
what what do you want to sell like food or you know like retail stuff
[oh] muslim friendly cloths
yeah I also have plans to open up the cafe
yeah we should be partners
meal some
okay I actually have (err) thoughts [lah] like okay maybe this cafe is the small cafe I want to make it
you know of course like (err) nowadays students like to study outside like at Starbucks or you know those small cafe so I'm like inspired by that so I want to make a cafe that is cosy for them to study
but that cafe will have (err) it will start like serving you know just drinks or desserts drinks and desserts very small small [one] [lah] then you have like a space for them to study to relax you know have free wifi
for students to enjoy or even like adults [lah] those working adults they want to do their work there also can and then slowly you can introducing mains you know like appetisers mains and then maybe slowly expand to become a full cafe full a full
how to say that
like
open up like
just like the other cafes <malay> semua those that sell the mains all yeah
yeah true [lah]
<malay> sikit sikit lama lama jadi bukit
yeah so maybe by that time you know when it's successful then you can open a new outlets at other places
yeah this one also actually I I don't want it to be at somewhere <malay>ulu</malay> somewhere (err) a place people cannot find
you know like some cafes like in the <malay>ulu</malay> places right then people want to
like (err) it will be inconvenience for them [lah] you know especially those who have who don't have their
who don't have their own transport [lah] like car or motor then they wanted to take public transport you know some places very hard [lah] even if you take a bus or M_R_T you still need to walk like fifteen minutes away you know
yeah yeah yeah
and cannot be <malay>ulu</malay> [lah] like I said
but I feel I feel like (err) cafes in the west is like
quite boring [ah]
like I said
