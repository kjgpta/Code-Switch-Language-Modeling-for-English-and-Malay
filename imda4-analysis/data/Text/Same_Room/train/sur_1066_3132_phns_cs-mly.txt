in singapore
no [lah] but at the rate like we are walking like <malay>ulu</malay> hotel entrance but literally in the middle of town is like
I think the only thing you cannot <malay>tahan</malay> is the toilet because of the frosted glass toilet
nobody is going to stare at your body [lah]
well to be fair s~ since you so #paiseh# I was like drying my hair so nobody got time to stare fo~ at you
so weird and you covered the frosted glass with clothes
so weird
okay we're going to go have like a~ (err) chicken rice lunch are we still on for chicken rice lunch
ya but we cannot #chope# seat and it is if if it's like lunch hour it will be
and then the angsty (err)
no the angst~

but he work
he even even when you order with your nice friendly face he already serve you that #dulan# face
annoying [sia] he's going to give you even more #dulan# face with the just the eyes he's gonna give you the
no but he is really like
I don't know before we wore mask right it's like constantly you you will like want to scold people with that face with the (err) I don't know he's tha~ but lucky the food nice so that's why people go there like you know [ah] the person is like the s~ the nephew or [eh] no no the grandson is not friendly but die die must try the chicken rice so we queue [lah]
ya ya
ya ya
their customer their customer base quite like a lot [what] people go there and <malay>makan</malay> like I think because lucky plaza is cheap
ya
ya th~ the grandparents are both super cute but I th~ think the grandma like (err) sit on the chair only but the thing is when you eat there right you cannot like chill chill you know like #lim# <malay>kopi</malay> like lunch hour people take their own time
really
ya because you have to eat and everybody is staring at you be~ from behind you lik~
ya
cannot talk cock during lunch cause everybody is watching but okay [lah]
ya wel~ ya like it's not like you're eating like super slowly but like sometimes you have the <malay>macam</malay> the luxury of eating at your own time own target but here maybe if you're not used to how their system is like the first time right the first few times we went we like [oh] ya cannot own time own target cannot choose your own seat cannot
we
was it we #dabao#
no before we came before we ca~ [ah] (err)
I
ya ya
ya so is like
(err) what's that called it's nice [oh] but the indo food there is not bad also after
no not <malay>ayam merah</malay> the there there is this <malay>minang</malay> store in lucky plaz~
[ah] indoor and I like because they have this <malay>sapi goreng</malay> or <malay>empal</malay> ya ya that [one] is nice it's not bad I brought #risa# there she ate like she order all the vegetables I'm like what the hell
because she want to step healthy
on anyway recently she started walking ten K_M (err) ten K_M every night or every day she's trying because that day she went doctor and the doctor say she needs to adjust her cholesterol or there's a possible heart attack in don't know how many years [lah] so she she scared already (err) ya
so had try [lor] try and walk (err) ten ten ten K_M everyday if not like ya
because the husband <malay>kena</malay> heart attack [what] but that [one] heart attack in sleep so like she don't want like confirm plus chop she also <malay>kena</malay> [lah]
but I think the funny thing is right I think when you reach that age [ah] then you look back at your l~ at your food intake
<malay>macam</malay> over the past twenty years
I don't think she's someone who eats fast food [leh] she s~
no she has (um) (err) high high bad cholesterol
but there's only now [what] right like
last time he got juggle his intake [meh]
exercise [ah]
ya because he works in that kind of environment
no but before that like for the first thirty years of his life not really right
like before this like you now they are forty [mah] like th~ the first thirty years of his life is like
they got they got like
(uh) really like watch what they eat or just like
ya that's true
okay that [one] cannot I ver~ I very scared to go for like I'm very scared to go for those kind of checks it's like
ya
e~ but but cholesterol is one thing when if you hit already right you exercise rigorously like crazy right it will still not go down that much
is th~ it's different from phlegm and the amount of fats like cholesterol is really the build up like in your heart vessels so yup
diabetic <malay>sana</malay>
(mm)
[oh] he cannot take I_P_P_T because of this but he's fit [what]
[ah] okay okay
ya
!wow! okay that is quite #sian# cause like I see him exercise so much and (err) workout so much and then
ya sugar ac~ sugar level quite easy to maintain [one] as long as you watch what you eat everyday and like take all the sugar free stuff [lah] because like even in in coffee tea milo all got sugar [what] so y~ ya
but I think cholesterol I don't know [ah] don't know what ya
even if they give you meal plans right is to maintain it like for you to magically l~ lose the chloes~
ya
[oh] shit
you mean all this while he go visit the doctor they never give him meal plan
because my cousin went to the polyclinic right and because they they review her every three months or six months right they actually gave her suggestions you know the~ without her actually requesting for a dietitian they are like okay you eat this ea~ th~ eat this at this timing because I think they feel like maybe after the first (uh) like time gap review right maybe the change not much
so I think that's like why !wow! there's so much toys okay that's like me digressing but [oh] ya [oh] wait I I just side note that day I was eating lunch alone right and there was this lady she was (err) what's that called [ah]
she was eating a whole plate of <malay>tauge</malay>
with like I think is a vegetarian meal [lah] so like
no like (err) there's (err) you know like those kind that looks like #mala# but I don't think it's #mala# it looks like (err) it's soya sauce so it has like
<malay>tahu</malay> and all but but the bulk of it is <malay>tauge</malay> and I'm like she is eating one big plate of <malay>tauge</malay> I'm like okay healthy people
ya everybody now want to be in (err) healthy lifestyle (err) why is it called drink coffee Instagram-mable life
okay and why you making some mentioning s~ names nope
but yes everybody wants to fit in all the healthy healthy lifestyle
no if you don't take photo it didn't happen so you must take a picture to prove that you went to the gym
that's one (err) ya I think for us when we look at it it's show off right but I think for me I don't do it cause I feel like if you start showing once you have to show more and then
ya they're forced [lah] like die die a~ die die must do [what] because like [oh] shit people know I've been gym-ing so so it's like if I don't show any result or something like quite lian</mandarin> like quite embarrassing [lah] or like <malay>macam</malay> you know remember you made this comment about a schoolmate you said (ugh) she workout so much but don't really see much difference remember
ya and I and then y~ we also realise that we have some friends who like who like workout but then they still eat very sinfully so like the difference also not much so like people will know that's the thing about displaying your life online it's like
if you go out and then i~ like like for example go staycay then you take video then people will be like [eh] #bo# #jio#
no when people when people #jio# you you not like you will reply [what]
ya
not you [lah] I mean like other people people !alamak!
didn't get it
ya so like that's the thing about promoting like life online [lah] it's like everybody
but then som~ some people will C_S_I your life like
crazy it's scary [lah] if you [ah] used to crazy people I think you'll be quite scared
ya I think it's just me but yup
wait so after we eat we're going to go to the l~ Rolex centre cause we <malay>atas</malay>
ya we are not we're not gonna buy any Rolex to show off but yes after that we (err)
at where [oh] so much for like not <malay>atas</malay> and then want to shop some more
(err)
I am eyeing that item online if I buy outside some more right <malay>habis</malay>
no the dress that I show you the whi~ the black and white dress that I show you yesterday
the swiss dot (err)
!aiya!
ya ya but but I don't know whether I should buy I've been staring at it it might sold out and then I will regret and then I will be very #sian# because I miss it (ugh)
it is it's available but it's like (ugh)
but I don't know which colour cause no colour nice and like can is those generic colour so it's like !aiya!
no if it's white I think I'll wear it only for really like s~ <malay>macam</malay> events like like events [ah]
[ah] yes it must not be cause otherwise G_G
(err) so it's like must must confirm plus chop must be like e~ for the black [one] can wear when we go out but then for the white [one] maybe wear to like wedding
(err) thirty eight ninety thirty eight ninety the top is thirty four ninety but minus ten percent so it'll be about hundred for three
no I want to buy the top and the b~ white and black dress but it's like a lot (ugh)
(err) in the last one month I don't know I mean maybe in october dude now is what month december it's december already
but I buy and can keep [mah]
same
not not about options or design [eh] like size like
ya ya
so just suck thumb [ah]
ya just
ye~
no [lah] it's not that th~ it's not that #jialat# [what]
you should wear b~ b~ plain clothes then just wear bright coloured like (err) <malay>hijab</malay> so it's not so #jialat# it's like
it's still colourful
I feel like now is the time to buy clothes because I feel like if in three to five years (err) if I settle down I think no such thing as buying clothes so maybe now I should buy
no I y~ I think you really have to rethink it because shag like so many things to pay for like the increase in terms of bills that you have to pay will be quite significant so quite
I u~
nope shag spend so much money
only choose one [ah]
for me
I think
<malay>jangan berangan</malay> [lah] please
no
I think
ya I think the reason why I buy buy clothes is because I feel like I'm the kind if I like it and I ke~ can keep it for long I I really can keep it like I have some clothes there like don't know how many years old ya so it's like it's really
I feel [lah] if you buy clothes and if you can stay stay in your shape
[ha] not so #jialat# like expand too much right (err) then you can wear your clothes for quite a while just need to look after them
ya but then if you buy and then never wear buy never wear then some people buy really a lot
but okay at least I'm the kind who don't buy very expensive clothes but I~ I rather buy more not so expensive ones like I won't buy a two hundred dollar dress I'll buy like three three items for hundred so it's not not so bad
cause people who buy like
very expensive [one] is like [oh] my god it's just like too expensive
and it's like
actually
thirty dollar dress and two hundred dollar dress
it doesn't really look
di~ much of a difference
ya
okay
ya and
[oh] let's go see (err) universal traveller the winter shop
w~ I don't know where we can just go [lah] walk down the road are we still going to the rich and good cake shop

no that's the thing I don't know when is the follow up (err) follow up appointment the (uh) I don't know
anyway now he probably quite #kanchiong# no haven't #kanchiong# yet because he will only #kanchiong# like literally twelve hours before the exam he has two papers one on wednesday one on thursday

<malay>mana ada momok</malay> it's m~ it's <malay>padang</malay> [what]
what
but I wanna see cause the room looks nice you k~
okay I just like then I already see all the hotels in singapore
is like
ya it's nice [leh] but like !aiya! I'm not gonna spend that much fri~ that much money on one staycay six hundred can get us a very fancy hotel for three nights in thailand so
did we successfully launch the indonesian travel bubble
cause I know the hong kong [one] they stopped because of the
ya the surge in cases but I think the indonesia [one] and because I think the once they allow travel business my boss might want us to travel so I don't know
like I think she ya cause we opening the office in K_L and obviously thailand is a standard [one] [lah] a
a~ what we opening office in K_L but they're gonna use (err) they are going to use a section of the generally insurance office to like s~ cordon off and use it [lah]
but is
no~ no it's gonna be operational in jan but <malay>leceh</malay> because it's malaysia so they're (err) authorities approval system is all bloody slow it's
it's very slow it's really really slow and like we don't know how whether it's all done or not [lah]
[eh] I don't know how they manoeuvre it like I mean like when you open a~ (err) an office in a country where you don't know anything and the system then someone language
like I think you really I don't know [lah] whether you need to like but then malaysia <malay>boleh</malay> so everything <malay>boleh</malay> you just need to have money
above table under table whatever [lah] wherever
ya but once we sh~ once okay [lah] not once we can travel but when we can travel we should go to a cheap place in thailand ons
[ah] okay [lah] not immediately maybe you have to wait until like (err) I guess three
three six months after it's clear although I don't think so [leh] they say leisure tra~
that's the thing that means they under report
no it's like how trump says if we don't do more tests we will not have more cases
so there's
ya
and also for countries like thailand and indo right it's ve~ it's worlds apart like the people living in the city and the people living in the villages you wouldn't (um) like if you don't get tested then okay [lah] basically you don't have
so it's like okay so it it l~ it's like closing your eyes like okay come I I [ah] you say you never test okay so you just declare thirty cases okay we clap for you you got thirty cases but really you all are not wearing mask you all are not tracking people you're not you all are not like controlling the movement so
do you really think he has little cases
but in countries like okay technically in U_S [lah] like it's bad right but I think it's bad in the in the is in the ci~ major cities but like
like in places where are you
ya the the the the conservative people like
ya
you know that more than five million people travelled right
I think more than that because also U_S has about what five hundred and twenty million people
u~ that that day #pedi# said at that point when she talked to me there's at least five million americans on the planes flying throughout the country to visit their family
and then there are some people even on Tiktok you know like Tiktok videos they're like they're like all kinds of people making videos what's so there are I follow a bunch of all these like doctors who make like Tiktok videos about medical stuff like free [what] t~ to watch so like they (um) what's that called they were saying like (err) please do not travel and to minimise the spread [ah] the healthcare system is really quite drained but they will do it in a dance you know like make it fun that kind of thing but people don't care
they don't care it's natural selection at (err) it's best no nature selection natural selection
ya correct ya natural selection right because it's like
you n~ you're not scared
but then again singaporeans who are #kiasu# usually (err) #kiasu# #kiasi# don't want to lose out and also scared die but but also go out and crowding the malls so I don't know
the younger ones [ah] <malay>macam</malay> the the the kids that are in tertiary education I think there's some of them they still <malay>lepak lepak</malay> and like
but you will immediately be fined [what] not [meh]
no <malay>ada</malay> [what] remember during the circuit breaker the the the ex~
the expat <malay>yang</malay> is it the group of expat <malay>pergi</malay> robertson quay
the whole of singapore was watching [what] like <malay>kalau</malay> like <malay>kalau dorang</malay> didn't get send back home [eh] actually <malay>dorang tak kena hantar balik</malay> [kan]
!chey! they were not they were not like removed from our country
I thought it's like quite a high amount and no jail [meh] like no no jail like
!aiya! whatever
I mean if you want to make sure people follow then you need to have a s~ more serious
it's like how
the india [one] [ah]
no but look at
i~
isn't it like (err) what for littering or smoking can't they write it's either five hundred or six months jail usually you know on the on the
exactly that's why this people expats all rich [what] <malay>boleh bayar</malay>
ya
but then again right it's quite <malay>bodoh</malay> because you think about it [ah] <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> gathered in more than five people right but we have offices and
p~
we have offices and we work in offices and offices not very small [what] even with the with the alternate grouping it's still more than five [what]
so you wear mask at all times at your table
[ah] that's good because
ya we have to wear mask at all times then we even ask like !huh! but we one person [what] what if today I'm in the office alone in the as in in the room alone [lah] I still must wear mask at all times
well
I guess I don't know is just like
we will see actually I'm used to the mask already in fact I'm glad because if you have breakouts right the mask cover so nobody <malay>boleh nampak</malay>
that's true have you seen
yup my cheeks are like [oh] my god it's like <malay>rabak</malay>
but then cannot do anything but it's okay [lah] the mask will cover so i~ (uh) <malay>tutup</malay> [jer] <malay>muka</malay> and li~ ad~ the trick is <malay>pakai</malay> nice eye makeup so the <malay>mata</malay> nice like <malay>lawa</malay> the
the rest ne~ never mind [lah]
ya so it's only it's only the it's only the that [one]
[eh] the the the #khatib# new play~ (err) playground four level you wanna go but then it's like
#khatib# SAFRA [ah] ya the one (uh) jason went the vet~ the
HomeTeam #khatib# HomeTeam N_S at #khatib# i~ I told you before
(uh) ya but (uh) maybe not not when (uh) got menses
okay that [one] ons although I think I reach there I will be too scared I'll be screaming
what show your what
climbing away from responsibility but people can always arrow you more res~
nope b~ once people arrow if people shoot so many arrow you you you
what the hell you o~ you people arrow you at work you skip skip skip
(err) okay
okay
if you say so
that is not that is different [lah] I think you next time shouldn't
I think you shouldn't spoil market when you talk to people right you shouldn't be too empathetic because (um) <malay>nanti orang perasan</malay>
no <malay>orang akan perasan</malay> and <malay>orang akan rasa macam</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay> caring [eh] this person <malay>boleh dengar aku</malay>
no
no you cannot do this because all these <malay>mamat belok ni semua macam</malay> (um)
<malay>dorang</malay> is it <malay>bebal dorang bebal</malay> so
and also <malay>kalau</malay> even <malay>kalau macam</malay> (um) [oh] is that a challenge ya they're going to purposely try like ons you were trying to challenge me right I'm going to see no you cannot do that all this <malay>mamat-mamat</malay> especially malaysia you must think like the typical <malay>melayu</malay>
you ya you really cannot spoil market I I think the slightest sign of you caring for them they'll be like [oh] you're so caring I'm like what the hell
(err)
actually I don't get it <malay>macam</malay> it's only in games [mah] like you can talk [ah] but <malay>macam</malay> why would they make it like you're obligated like why why you must why obligated to reply you at like you supposedly free time
but some of it is some of the questions they ask like quite #kaypoh# [what] no [meh]
seriously
okay cause like if if
what is favourite <malay>buaya</malay>

[eh] I talking about this (um)
I don't know whether I told you but (err) so like th~ (uh) I watched Tiktok videos right so tik~ in america teenage pregnancy is very common right
<malay>tapi</malay> the youngest <malay>yang aku nampak</malay>
they'll conceive at thirteen
they will give birth at fourteen
she's turning twenty one next year <malay>habis anak dia</malay> turn seven and I'm guessing <malay>tak habis</malay> school [lah] right
unless (err) defer <malay>sekolah atau pergi sekolah</malay> until like you're th~ thirty eight thirty
no you can differ [what] <malay>macam</malay> skip school for ya [lah] <malay>macam lepas beranak</malay> she can <malay>pergi sekolah</malay> then <malay>mak dia jaga</malay> [lah]
but the thing is
fourteen o~ what the hell <malay>kau beranak</malay> f~ fourteen <malay>empat belas tahun empat belas tahun</malay> you know it's like teenage pregnancy I usually think right <malay>kau beranak</malay> like [oh] my god <malay>kau beranak</malay> at like <malay>enam belas tahun</malay> or like maybe (uh) <malay>enam belas tahun</malay> onwards <malay>kau beranak</malay> is still considered teenage mum
<malay>kau beranak</malay> at <malay>empat belas</malay> it's like dude I haven't even get my menses I was wa~ I was waiting for my menses
ya I do~ like why would you why would you be preg~ why would you give birth at fourteen okay [lah] but I think the U_S is a big country everything is possible
why what you mean what education
maybe people don't have money to buy condom
(err) maybe their pull out game <malay>rabak lembap atau</malay> (uh) <malay>atau</malay> (err) because oral contraceptive <malay>kena bayar</malay> co~ condom condom actually is the cheapest option already
!huh!
what if the saran wrap drop out into the person's body
!ee! but then it has no rubber at the side i~
you <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] just <malay>bodoh</malay>
[eh] but then again there are people on I_U_D or like even the tubal ligation then <malay>tiba-tiba mengandung</malay>

[oh] no you did the surgical thing but now you are pregnant
no sometimes it's quite (uh) quite (err) [oh] ya after the menstrual cycle <malay>entah</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tahu</malay>
but it's just like I don't know it
and then ya is people all this whatever [lah] I will I will clap for you if you give birth at like fourteen that's like <malay>tak gagak</malay> [sia]
why would you why would you do that <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] she signed on to army so is like
