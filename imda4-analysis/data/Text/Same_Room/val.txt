<malay>sampai</malay> about how many years [eh] <malay>ayah kerja dekat</malay> #alfa laval#
<malay>sekarang nak cari kerja dua puluh tujuh tahun</malay> !hais! <malay>macam tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh] [ah]
so <malay>bila ayah kerja dulu dekat</malay> (uh) #alfa laval# then you don't think <malay>macam</malay> maybe there's a better job out there or something like that
<malay>memang dah</malay> planning [kan] <malay>dah</malay> [kan]
so <malay>ada apa yang macam</malay> very interesting <malay>tak yang dulu bila ayah kerja kat situ apa dia punya mesin ke</malay> like the machine <malay>dia</malay> style <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>tak ayah cakap tadi dia pakai apa</malay> sledgehammer
<malay>yang</malay> the the like the big <malay>punya</malay> sledgehammer <malay>itu</malay> [ah]
!wah! <malay>kira</malay> [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [seh] <malay>pakai</malay> allen key [jer] <malay>senang</malay> [seh]
[oh] because it's much easier [ah]
nowadays <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>banyak</malay> like really a lot of things <malay>dia orang nak tukar</malay>
<malay>jadi macam</malay> manufacturing [kan] even <malay>macam sekarang</malay>
like now my workplace <malay>macam</malay> construction [ah] <malay>pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam</malay> manufacturing
(mm)
ya ya ya ya actually true [ah] so <malay>macam dia orang</malay> [ah] actually <malay>dia orang nak buat</malay> [kan] <malay>benda tu</malay> [ah] <malay>datang</malay> [jer] [kan]
<malay>terus terus</malay> in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish [ah]
<malay>ayah rasa</malay> the houses [eh] because now they actually want to do a house
[ah] <malay>yang pagar kayu tahu</malay> the whole you imagine [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the whole building
<malay>dia semua pakai kayu ayah rasa ayah ra~ ayah tinggal tak kat tempat tu</malay>
so so you it really depends (uh) [ah]
(mm) actually <malay>kalau macam</malay> they use wood [kan] <malay>dia orang ra~ cakap</malay> [ah] it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like (uh) the wood <malay>banyak tapi macam macam</malay> (uh) the <malay>besi</malay> is steel [kan] <malay>dia orang kena</malay> mine
[ah] so that's why like (uh) <malay>kalau kayu</malay> [kan] <malay>senang dia</malay> chop [jer] <malay>lepas tu dia dia</malay> process
[kan] <malay>cepat habis dia punya</malay> plank <malay>tu banyak</malay>
[ah]
<malay>sekarang macam dekat dalam</malay> news [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak cerita macam</malay> climate change <malay>ayah dengar tak cerita ni</malay>
<malay>macam dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia ada per~</malay> [ah] <malay>perubahan alam</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia ada tukar macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula</malay> [ah] you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly [eh] <malay>tempat tu tak banyak</malay> snow
[oh] <malay>yang itu ada</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kalau macam ayah</malay>
<malay>ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak</malay> over the years [eh] <malay>yang</malay> in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the <malay>udara ke</malay> or anything like that
so <malay>ayah rasa macam tak apa</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau dia lagi banyak</malay> shopping centre then
this climate change <malay>tu kira</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh boleh</malay> adapt [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [ah] so far [ah] <malay>ayah tak tahu</malay> anybody <malay>yang</malay> got this COVID right
(mm)
so [ah] <malay>pada ayah macam yang</malay> this [ah] COVID <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>ayah</malay> think will last how long
<malay>tapi dia orang cakap</malay> fav~ (mm) <malay>dia orang cakap mula mula</malay> it comes from china [kan] because like <malay>dia punya</malay> china <malay>tu dekat situ</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia orang ada dia orang</malay> they like to eat a lot of like <malay>macam</malay> weird weird <malay>punya</malay> animal <malay>tahu</malay>
[oh]
[oh] so <malay>macam ayah fikir</malay> actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
(mm)
<malay>ayah baca tak yang</malay> there's this (uh) group of people [kan] <malay>yang dia orang</malay> army plane <malay>habis lepas tu dia orang</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang fikir</malay> [oh] never mind [lah] because it's a private plane <malay>habis dia orang tu~ turun</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas tu yang eropah punya</malay>
the europe <malay>punya</malay> people say [eh] [ah] don't come because you're from U_S [ah] please go home
[ah] <malay>ayah baca tak</malay>
[oh] ya <malay>dekat dekat</malay> [eh] the inside of the dormitory [kan] it's really (uh) it
according to my workers [ah] <malay>dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada</malay> [ah] but unfortunately [lah] <malay>kirakan kalau</malay> you're from china [eh] <malay>yang</malay> the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix <malay>dengan yang</malay> chinese because <malay>dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya</malay> hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> is like <malay>tapi</malay> of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the (uh) sickness because if not then people will be very <malay>macam macam</malay> racist [kan] <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak</malay> [ah] actually
[a'ah]
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad [kan] <malay>macam aku</malay> I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
[oh] is it <malay>abang abang punya</malay> party
which one is this [eh]
[oh] the the <malay>khatam quran</malay> party is it
[oh] I don't remember <malay>kena</malay> check temperature actually
[oh] <malay>dah boleh</malay> clear [ah]
mineral water [jer] [eh]
<malay>tapi ayah rasa</malay> like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada <malay>benda lain</malay> in <malay>yang ayah ingat</malay> [ah] that is the worst thing than this COVID
so (uh) <malay>apa tu kak~ jadi</malay> if now [eh] <malay>bila ayah tengok macam</malay> movie movie <malay>macam</malay> zombie zombie [kan]
[ah] <malay>ayah</malay> continue <malay>tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang</malay> [kan] now you feel like you're already in the movie
<malay>ce~ ada cerita yang paling takut tak</malay> wha~ what story is like super <malay>takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang</malay> [ah]
[oh] like like cannibalism
<malay>tapi</malay> that cannibalism is not even fake [seh] it's not it's not like zombie
<malay>tap~</malay> but in the story [kan] <malay>dia orang macam cepat gila</malay> [kan] like the they the they run you know
<malay>orang hantu apa</malay> [seh] <malay>itu</malay>
human that
[oh] so you're actually like actually the actual human <malay>yang</malay> human <malay>yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada</malay>
so <malay>macam hantu biasa macam</malay> [ah] you can just
walk away [ah] <malay>katakan</malay>
<malay>tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah</malay> retire [kan] so <malay>ayah rasa</malay> freedom <malay>tak macam</malay>
I I don't need to care about like all this you know <malay>hantu</malay> or all these you people
so like you don't even need to think about like the basically no stress at all [lah]
so [ah] <malay>apa tu jadi bila ayah dah</malay> retire so after <malay>dah</malay> you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so [ah] <malay>apa itu bila dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>ayah</malay>
(um) <malay>mula mula</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then you said that the [kan] <malay>ayah ada kerja kat tempat</malay> glass [kan]
[ah] so <malay>dulu dekat</malay> singapore <malay>dia ada banyak</malay> factory [eh] <malay>pasal</malay> I don't think <malay>sekarang ada</malay> company glass <malay>dekat</malay> singapore
<malay>dia punya cerita semua sama</malay> [eh] <malay>kena</malay> retrenched [ah]
<malay>macam kirakan</malay> fated [ah]
so <malay>sekarang kirakan macam</malay> free and easy
[ah] then everyday <malay>bangun</malay> and then just <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>buat itu</malay> [ah] (uh) if there's planning today then just <malay>buat</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>gitu</malay>
so <malay>ayah rasa macam hidup gini</malay> all the way till the end okay <malay>ke tidak</malay>
so <malay>kalau</malay> actually [eh] <malay>macam sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia banyak gila</malay> technology [kan]
[ah] <malay>ayah rasa</malay> technology <malay>ni kirakan macam bagus ke tak bagus kadang kadang macam</malay> technology <malay>ni macam</malay>
<malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>nak cakap</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dulu ayah</malay> favourite subject <malay>apa</malay> [eh] like when in school [lah]
(mm)
[oh] okay
so <malay>bila ayah</malay> when you read [kan] those kind of stories [kan] do you feel <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>bila dia jajah satu</malay> country <malay>tu dia bagus ke</malay> (um) good or bad
so <malay>bila dulu</malay> (uh) [kan] <malay>yayi</malay> is actually malaysian right
[oh] <malay>yayi</malay>
[oh] actually so <malay>pasal tu</malay> <malay>nyai</malay> will come to singapore
[oh]
so <malay>tapi yang</malay> that time <malay>yang yang yang apa tu</malay> the the separation [kan]
<malay>dia dia</malay> announcement <malay>ke apa</malay>
is it an announcement on T_V
so it was actually <malay>senang gila</malay> [seh]
immigration centre [ah]
[oh] so actually you got lucky [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
so actually <malay>macam ayah pun tak</malay> march <malay>sangat</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
[oh]
actually <malay>dulu pun</malay> like when I first (err) <malay>fikir</malay> [kan] like what to do [kan] actually I also wanted to join (uh) the army
because like the army <malay>macam</malay> to me <malay>macam dia semua macam</malay> easy [ah] [kan]
[ah] then <malay>lepas tu</malay> you you you can rise up the rank and then <malay>kerja dia macam</malay> not so bad [lah]
<malay>tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam</malay> army <malay>pun macam apa tu</malay> ston~ stoning [kan] <malay>dia orang ikut</malay> the rules and then
marching wha~ what's the point [sia] ya
!huh!
[ah] <malay>macam pelik</malay> [kan] it's like what what what's it for [ah] but I mean I can maybe understand [lah] <malay>dia orang semua nak untuk buat</malay>
like you're disciplined <malay>tapi</malay> there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
[ah]
<malay>macam</malay> somehow <malay>dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu</malay> suddenly everything <malay>macam</malay> not so bad
quite positive [kan] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] you can remember the good times [ah]
[ah] it it like life is like that [kan] <malay>macam dulu</malay> like <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) that time when the <malay>adik dalam</malay> police [eh] [oh] my god [sia]
like so hot and then <malay>lepas tu dia punya</malay> push up don't say [ah]
[ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> push up <malay>dah apa tu</malay> !wah! <malay>sekarang sekarang nak buat</malay> push up <malay>macam gitu pun tak boleh</malay> [seh] <malay>tapi dulu</malay> !wah! you know so good you know
ya
[ah] and then <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> and then <malay>dia punya</malay> army officer <malay>semua cara dia sama</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>muka kirakan semua macam yang itu</malay> [ah] M_P yang <malay>kak</malay> #inah# tak minat
[oh] ya ya ya that guy is also before army right ya ya ya ya
so <malay>macam dia orang semua nak kena</malay> they have this <malay>macam angkuh punya muka</malay> [ah] [eh]
[ah] <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [ah] maybe it's just not fated [ah] that I you know that I didn't join the army [ah] forget it [sia] <malay>tengok</malay>
[a'ah]
[a'ah] <malay>tapi bagus juga</malay> [seh] <malay>kalau hari hari pakai</malay> uniform <malay>senang</malay> [seh] like you don't need to think you wake up
ya ya ya ya ya
[ah] so <malay>macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam</malay> MINDEF [kan] so like although he's in construction [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> nothing to do with him you know [eh] whatever that happen outside [eh] <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] okay
<malay>macam</malay> MINDEF [kan] is very big so <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> if there's anything [eh] <malay>dia orang nak kena buat</malay>
[ah] in within the MINDEF itself ya <malay>dia orang mesti nak ada</malay> manager <malay>yang kat dalam yang boleh buat</malay> construction
so he's the construction manager for MINDEF [lah]
like [oh] I got no feeling #liao# no work no work also everyday I will come to work [lor]
<malay>macam</malay> ya like no feeling to scared <malay>ke takut ke kena buang kerja</malay> nothing ya
[ah]
<malay>tapi ayah dah nor~</malay> (err) I mean like I you speak to them <malay>sekali sekala</malay> [ah] at least
[oh]
<malay>apa sal ada banyak</malay> secret <malay>ke</malay>
so <malay>mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya</malay> then (uh) too bad [lah] because like you're in warehouse [pe]
M_O_M
actually <malay>ayah dulu ada</malay> license <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>ayah ada</malay> license forklift [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> wasted money [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> call crane
[ah] [lah] <malay>pasal macam sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> construction <malay>kalau ada</malay> crane <malay>masuk</malay> [kan] it's like [oh] my god [seh]
like <malay>dia orang semua</malay> like you cannot even walk there and then ya
[ah] actually servicing <malay>kebanyakannya</malay> is really <malay>buang habuk</malay>
<malay>dia dia buang habuk</malay> [jer] <malay>lepas tu nanti</malay> is if if really something wrong [kan]
[ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] change part [jer] [ah] <malay>semua</malay>
ya ya ya ya it's true [ah]
maybe <malay>pun tak gerak</malay> [seh] <malay>pasal</malay> there's not much things [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay>
!huh!
ya so <malay>sekarang macam</malay> the situ~ situation <malay>dengan si</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> is a bit weird [kan] <malay>pasal banyak benda macam</malay> just stop
<malay>pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>ke apa tu yang</malay> the funny thing is that <malay>yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik</malay> [ah] <malay>habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru</malay> [seh]
[ah] is <malay>aku</malay> I don't even use the <malay>baju</malay> half of the time in pyjamas <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>pergi kerja pun</malay> pyjamas [ha]
<malay>dulu kirakan macam</malay> so <malay>bila ayah dah masuk</malay> warehousing <malay>tu</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
(mm)
<malay>ayah tak pakai itu ke</malay> umbrella
[oh] ya [ah]
!huh!
so it's like <malay>macam</malay> after you get out [kan] <malay>macam lain gila</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja</malay> actually <malay>macam</malay> technical officer is actually pretty [ah] <malay>se~ dia dia</malay> actually quite <malay>senang</malay>
[a'ah] so <malay>itu</malay> [ah] so <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] maybe <malay>adik pun</malay> will just become a technical officer [ah]
<malay>pasal kau</malay> if like you <malay>kerja</malay> all the way construction
is like <malay>lagi senang nak</malay> check <malay>orang punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada nak buat</malay> you <malay>punya kerja sendiri</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tapi</malay> actually <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang banyak yang</malay> [ah] <malay>banyak</malay>
<malay>dia orang suka</malay> just <malay>berdiri</malay> and then <malay>suruh orang lain buat</malay> they don't want to go down themselves
<malay>itu yang masalah dia</malay> [ah] <malay>itu yang banyak yang macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> manager [ah] <malay>yang susah</malay>
I (mm) so you're saying like <malay>dia tak tahu</malay> [ah] actually

I happen to like mango <malay>juga</malay> so (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango [jer] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !woo! <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] like
<malay>nak</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam nak makan</malay> [jer] mango [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal</malay> mango [jer] <malay>macam nak makan sahaja</malay> so (uh) first [jer] <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango
actually <malay>bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam rasa</malay>
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
I don't know if you've (uh) I don't I don't know if any of you <malay>dah pernah dengar ke tak</malay> but
the brand mango <malay>ni memang makcik</malay> I <malay>memang suka pakai ba~</malay> <malay>baju</malay> mango this T shirt from this brand <malay>nama dia</malay> mango (err) by the way <malay>ini</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> sponsored [lah] [eh] so <malay>kita ya faham-faham</malay> [jer]
okay so what comes to mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango kita <malay>dah berbual</malay> okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay
okay <malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>buah</malay> mango <malay>ini kalau kita berbual</malay> if we talk about the shape we are
it's it's not a definite shape I can say [ah] it's not a definite shape it's not a pat~ it's not a a shape that is
is precise or [ah] specific is
it could either be a it it could be ei~ it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
(um) it's slightly bended it's <malay>bengkok sikit ke dalam</malay> <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok betul-betul</malay>
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
something <malay>macam apa benda ya</malay> shape <malay>dia</malay> so
mango <malay>ini memang</malay> interesting <malay>memang</malay> it's
unique
<malay>selain daripada bentuk dia ini</malay>
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can somehow cut it well in a way that <malay>kita boleh makan betul tak</malay>
(mm) so <malay>kita boleh potong belah dua</malay> we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so <malay>dia macam kotak-kotak gitu</malay> so we can we can eat it like that <malay>atau kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kupas kulit dia</malay> and then <malay>kita boleh makan</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) we slice it we sl~ we can just slice the
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
and okay shape it's <malay>memang</malay> irregular <malay>tapi dia macam bentuk yang</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak pelik sangat bila kita makan</malay>
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
(uh) <malay>selain daripada ben~</malay> besides the shape
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
about one or two colours so <malay>dia ada</malay> colour yellow <malay>dia ada</malay> colour <malay>oren</malay>
and <malay>dia ada juga</malay> colour <malay>hijau</malay> so <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>hijau itu</malay>
okay <malay>selain hijau</malay> there's also there's also red <malay>betul tak</malay>
okay so (err) these four types <malay>yang paling banyak kita</malay> like the ones that we see a lot
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
usually the the ones that we usually see <malay>betul tak</malay> so
(err) <malay>yang paling sedap</malay>
I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> <malay>yang mana yang paling sedap</malay> because I've only tried
a few types of mango
and yeah
but honestly mango is my favourite s~ my favourite fruit as well <malay>macam memang se~</malay> I don't know it's it's nice so (uh) the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about ho~ why it's our favourite fruit

(uh) <malay>itu macam</malay>
it's like a brand
<malay>yang</malay> quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a mang~ (uh) (err) a fruit name for a brand because
(uh) they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all [lah] because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
<malay>cuma</malay> word mango [jer] <malay>kot</malay> I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like <malay>macam betul-betul macam</malay> !wah! <malay>nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam</malay>
I guess
that's interesting
okay
(uh) besides that (uh) <malay>kita berbual pasal resepi-resepi</malay> mango <malay>ada apa-apa resepi tak yang kita tahu</malay>
<malay>betul betul</malay> I feel like [ah] okay but honestly I think (err)

ya you can do anything you want <malay>dengan</malay> mango cause I feel that
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
we don't really think about
talki~ the it's interesting that mango is the topic <malay>untuk hari ini pasal kita</malay> actually <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>kita suka makan</malay> mango <malay>tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal</malay> mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
[oh] my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs [ah] we there's also
mango pudding we always have mango pudding <malay>dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari</malay> mango pudding especially <malay>dekat</malay> wedding

process
that's true
because <malay>kita tak pernah</malay> I mean <malay>jarang</malay> [lah] <malay>ya berbual pasal</malay> mango that's what I find it interesting <malay>kalau kita berbual faha~ untuk</malay> our first recording <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
about having mango soda
<malay>tak pernah ada</malay> [kan]
do you have have you had any mango sodas
I really wish <malay>ada</malay> mango soda
(um) that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time <malay>kot</malay>
okay
(uh) do you know that (uh) in some parts of the world <malay>dekat luar negeri</malay> some parts of the world <malay>dekat tempat lain</malay>
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking [kan] (um)
the fact that <malay>dekat</malay> southeast asia <malay>dekat asia tenggara kita</malay> actually the king of fruits <malay>ini</malay>
actually durian I don't know if you guys know du~ durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region
so ya okay now okay time check we still have about (um)
about forty minutes
left in having our conversation so now I'm going to go all out with facts with nutritional facts about
<malay>buah mangga</malay>

so besides that (uh) okay the the scientific name [eh] <malay>untuk ini ini buah</malay> is actually mangifera indica
have you heard of it
and none of us have heard of it we don't even care

[kan] (uh) <malay>ada</malay> berry <malay>ada apa apa semua</malay> then this one is just stone fruit which is cool because <malay>memang</malay> if you look at it
it actually looks like a stone I don't I have no idea but
once again mango is awesome
okay so it means [ah] okay what stone fruit means is actually the the seed is large so <malay>dia punya biji</malay> (err) <malay>biji buah dia itu memang besar</malay>
<malay>buah mangga betul tak</malay>

ya no high expectations I'm so sorry
but yes we're trying
okay
now that we (uh) we hit thirty two minutes let's (err) just
take a break from mango topic because (uh) whoever that is going to listen this for one hour <malay>mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>betul tak</malay> so let's hear about your day what have you done today
thank you for asking I know
question <malay>dia tadi satu</malay> question [eh] <malay>tapi dah melalut</malay> [eh] <malay>tak apa</malay> it's okay
so for my day I def~ today I
okay this week actually is my first week (err) since (err) holiday that school resumes so (err) as per usual I had my class today <malay>tapi</malay> because you know [kan] <malay>sekarang tengah</malay> pandemic <malay>tengah</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> corona~ you know like the the virus is you know <malay>masih dekat</malay> singapore <malay>masih ada</malay> cases [lah] [kan] so today we had
for a month actually we have to be (uh) doing classes online
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I <malay>pun dah melalut tak apa</malay> it's okay
I mean
we're just talking we're just having a conversation just chilling
okay back to the topic (err) seriously I think quite sad because <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> [seh] <malay>dekat rumah</malay> like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive <malay>dekat dekat sekolah</malay> like my brain my work like [ah] I can just think and do work
like
much more than I can do work at home <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kerja dekat rumah</malay> cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily <malay>dekat rumah</malay> so your productivity level is not as
much as when you're outside
in school especially
I'm sure some of you would feel the same
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that <malay>dekat rumah lagi</malay> (err) productive [lah] but today is (uh)
quite decent for me
nothing too extreme nothing to some <malay>macam</malay> okay okay [jer] [lah] I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work wh~ or who is more productive <malay>dekat rumah ke</malay> or is more productive <malay>dekat luar</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> exactly
okay so
now that we've (uh) talked about our day
let's talk about okay before we going (err) we're going back to talking about the fruit [lah] [eh] cause
I don't know let's just talk about this it's more casual [lah] [kan] so okay (err) what [eh] what food did you have today
(mm) (mm)
I had <malay>sambal</malay> fish and <malay>sambal</malay> egg
then (err) <malay>ada</malay> this <malay>apa nama dia macam</malay> soup <malay>petola gitu</malay>
dengan <malay>bihun bihun</malay> [eh] <malay>ke suun</malay>
so
I think it's <malay>suun</malay> this <malay>dia macam bihun</malay> but it's like (um)
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles <malay>yang dari</malay> japan so I think that's what it is then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (um) ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today (um) because you know (uh) work's getting really really stressful <malay>jadi macam</malay> you know we just had have a sip of cam~ cammomile tea then (err) <malay>lepak lepak [dah] itu</malay> [jer]
then okay let's (uh) start talking about next thing shall we talk about fruits still or shall we move on to another topic
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>apa yang</malay> best [eh] <malay>nak berbual</malay> okay let's talk about our favorite music
okay what (uh) which artist do you listen to the most
(um) <malay>kalau kita berbual pasal</malay>
artist okay <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> genre first okay we'll talk about fo~ genre my favourite genre is very (err) much the same as hers (um) it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
okay but
(um) I wouldn't say okay my favourite song
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay>
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay that song is my favourite song
it
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have <malay>jadi macam bila dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god my emotions <malay>semua keluar</malay> but like
that's just what you feel about it
(err) I rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that I'm talking about it now
okay so (uh) besides that (err) canon in D [eh] that's one genre that I don't listen all the time but that that's a song that I really really like above all the other songs that I hear
and okay
let's talk about the next genre my next genre <malay>yang</malay> favourite <malay>itu</malay> let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between (err) western songs <malay>dengan</malay>
k-pop
they both have very distinct (uh) features they both have
however <malay>macam</malay> similar <malay>dia itu macam sama tapi lain</malay> [lah] you ge~ you ge~ you get what I mean
<malay>dia punya</malay> upbeat <malay>dia punya</malay> instrumental <malay>semua sama tapi</malay> it's just that the language probably different <malay>kot macam</malay> that's the distinct difference

it's called #mevoy# M E V O Y <malay>daripada</malay> [eh] the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice <malay>dia</malay>

no okay I I have a reasoning
you know why it's because [kan]
if you
okay for example you give me this assignment
you tell me it's due
okay no no no back then here was my rationale
it was because
the class is the next day [what]
why are you looking there look at me
okay so the class is always the next day right
and then whatever is going to be taught in that class is about the previous (uh) homework [lah]
the later you do the more you'll remember
that was my rationale
no [meh]
it's like
okay for example [eh] you
I don't know the
if you if you study the later later part the more you can remember [what]
until now I still do that
[ah] [lah] primary school not that hard
I didn't say it wasn't that hard
to not remember a lot of things
because the teacher make us struggle

that's how I got into <malay>dikir</malay> [what]
it was because
ya at first #hannah# say (err) we got this this and then we need people then I was like okay [lor] sure [lor] then just join
then every there everyone there was so nice and I feel I liked it

ya ya
and one of this this one girl was picking on this other guy
he's a very small guy [ah]
and then last time I was very I wasn't big [lah]
but I was bigger than the rest for some reason
which is hard to ya it's hard to imagine right cause right now I'm the smallest person
you know last time I was big (err) kind of big
bigger than everyone else
[kan]
ya and I was very how to say gangster
[ah] gangster ya and then after that
he was picking on this other guy then that guy <malay>apa tu</malay> was starting to cry not cry [lah] he was like tearing up

I hope you don't consider him
[a'ah]
sweet <malay>nya</malay>
annoying
then <malay>nanti</malay> you <malay>nak tengok cerita apa</malay>
[oh] that's some random thriller show right
what you mean bridge the cursed bridge
so is the cursed bridge
so it's about a bridge
I don't know now got what movie
can we watch the hunt
intruder we already watch
Greenland
want to see this one of the worst show in the world
Greenland <malay>apa lagi</malay>
to be honest <malay>kan</malay> I don't know how they record
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
like <malay>macam mana macam mana dia orang</malay> record
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
so then <malay>tiba tiba kerja</malay> continue continue continue then (err)
april [kan] lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
but what if they start recording okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] then that means the movie wouldn't be out [what]
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
I mean <malay>pernah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel [kan]
then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] disney channel then got #mulan# then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] then like [oh] whatever
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad <malay>macam rasa</malay>
disappointed <malay>pasal anak dia perempuan</malay> so <malay>tak ada orang yang boleh</malay> carry on
[oh] so which #mulan# have I been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would #mulan# do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched [lah] but I don't remember [lah] [kan]
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about #mulan#
so #mulan# [kan]
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
okay what do you mean by <malay>terpaksa</malay> because if she's <malay>terpaksa</malay> [kan] okay at first she's a guy [eh] she's a woman
woman is not required to go for this [one] [what] this [one] N_S
ya woman cannot go
but then why is sh~ she forced to go
[oh] okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
<malay>tak tak pernah tengok</malay> that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
I watched before
<malay>dia</malay>
no no no I watched already you see
#mulan# go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then (err)
she she <malay>sakit</malay> then she <malay>baring</malay> I think sick or whatever I don't know
then the doc~
[ah] sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check (err) then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander (err) leader [ah]
[meh] she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie [what] right
she got caught in the se~
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
#hans#
so is #mulan# like
based on the real life
<malay>orang tengah berbual pasal</malay> #mulan#
let's finish the #mulan# first [lah]
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
#wushu# finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay #wushu#
#wushu#
okay #wushu# then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why I just help me understand
no you make me make me understand #mulan# first then I'll make you understand #aladdin#
what do you mean I know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
[oh] so even okay the dad <malay>tak boleh pasal dia sakit</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> in the go~ in that government even though <malay>kau sakit ke apa</malay> [eh] sorry
even though if you <malay>sakit</malay>
okay even if you <malay>sakit</malay> or not <malay>tak kisah</malay> you have to go is that the rule
so the the #mulan# <malay>dia macam kasihan</malay> [kan] that's why she left that note
(oo) makes sense
nineteen sixty five [eh]
!wow! that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about #aladdin#
okay [ah] honestly I think it's stupid [ah] because
okay because
she don't let me drink water [ah]
cause he
cannot [meh]
then you want me talk for one hour no drink [ah]
!huh!
okay
<malay>dia pasal</malay>
this one guy

a real relationship I'm sorry [lah] but (um)

so how it ended with me and #amin# is that he was the one who ended it ya so
(um) he didn't say why but he told #amin# [eh] he told #syafiq# it's because like he feels that (uh) he's doing all the work and then I I
I am not reciprocating his efforts but I don't think it's it is that
but then I
I don't think I acted that way [eh]
#amin# now

okay [lah] I will try [lah] this monday when I meet him
(mm)
portrait the fuck
(mm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
ya
ya
that was ya okay okay so after the the ex right
!aiya! I I give people the benefit of doubt [lah]
so anyway (um) so after the the the the the the cheating case
then he dated this other girl
which was his no which was his ex primary school they bump into each other not they bump [lah] I think
they had a primary school reunion
then they met so that's
that was when
that was this [one] [ah] this [one] I think last year
last year or last two years
I think so
ya
[eh] no no no his relationship was just what eight months
ya
ya so (um) the
ya then he dated this his ex primary school friend ya so
this girl she was the one who ended
with him because this girl is much more religious than him so
this girl you know <malay>macam pergi</malay> date <malay>semua</malay> [kan] he she doesn't even want to be <malay>macam macam sekarang kita tengah lepak dekat macam</malay> playground <malay>gini kita dua</malay> [jer] [kan] let's say you are a guy
she doesn't want that
<malay>macam berdua-duaan abeh lepas tu kalau macam nak pergi</malay>
<malay>tengok wayang</malay> cinema <malay>macam dua orang</malay> even though there's there are other people but
is <malay>tetap macam korang dua orang</malay> [jer] [kan] in a dark place also she she's not comfortable with it so
her mindset and like the ex mindset is that if she likes you and (um)
she wants to tie the knot she's ready to settle down
but this is the thing that I am not sure because
I think she has already said [lah] what her intentions are and what she wants in life
ya which is very good I'm very proud of her to you know to know what you want in life and but
(um)
that's the thing I don't I don't
know why he didn't pursue that
how should I don't know I never ask
how he ya
ya so <malay>dengan dia</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> I think he is ready
ready to settle down I think [lah] almost there [lah] but
but then if he is wait wait if he is ready
like you know as in his mindset
whether he whether he is ready or not
for me I'm not ready I'm sure as hell not ready man I need a few more years
to marry ya
wait wait wait ya so
if sh~ if I think he really likes this girl [lah] but then this girl wants to get married
but I don't understand why he cannot pursue that
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> she didn't
when she wanted to break things off
that was her reason [ah]
ya
(uh) I never ask for details
(mm)
you know when they first went out right
sh~ he asked for permission from the girl's parents
really [ah] I no one has no one has asked me
at all
[orh] ya
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya but when he did that it wasn't with it wasn't with the Muzmatch girl it was with the primary school girl
ya
[ah]
!oops!
!huh!
(mm)
(mm)
ya
acts of what passive aggressive [ah]
[orh]

why
okay <malay>jap</malay> later
<malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
hello baby
who's that <malay>siapanya</malay> baby [ah]
<malay>ni kau gi mana</malay> [seh]
[oh]
<malay>korang tolong</malay> [eh]
(mm)
okay [lah] <malay>dah</malay> [lah]
<malay>dah dah habis</malay>
<malay>dah dah</malay> okay
okay <malay>sini sini</malay>
<malay>mana kau punya</malay> web WhatsApp
[ah] <malay>aku belum</malay> synchronise
so #fathul# I have a question for you (mm) if you have three wishes what are (err) what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would (err) void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say (um) by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things (hmm) maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and af~ after all to live happily is what everyone wants [lah]
and lastly (err) the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world <malay>sebab bila</malay> you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good [ah] when you can do things <malay>yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat</malay>
(mm) and some skills that I want to have (err) maybe include (err) having all the capabilities to al~ all the knowledge that that exist in this world [ah]
(mm) <malay>pasal ilmu ni</malay> but <malay>dia ada banyak</malay> (err) <malay>rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi</malay> (hmm) <malay>kalau dapat ni</malay> best [ah] <malay>pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat</malay> (mm) and <malay>bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni</malay> (mm)
so <malay>ini adalah yang tiga</malay> wishes <malay>yang saya nak</malay> (mm) so <malay>kita</malay> (err) what about you #fathul#
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily (err) to us to some people to live happily is to have (err) the money and the wealth
<malay>pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh</malay> spend on whatever and what not and <malay>bila awak dapat</malay> spend whatever and what not then means (err) with every spending <malay>awak akan rasa</malay> this happiness
(err) so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy [ah] and intelligence also [ah] this is to me I think it relates to me also [ah] because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
(uh) so maybe for now we move (uh) to the next question which is (err) superpowers #fathul# what (err) if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
[ah] [eh]
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of [ah] the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you (err) by accident
<malay>kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang</malay> teleport <malay>ke tempat lain</malay> so <malay>dia jadi</malay> the source of this (err) <malay>kuman</malay> [lah] so <malay>dia yang</malay> spread to others
<malay>dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus</malay> (mm) so I stay over this view whereby teleportation ac~ could actually increase
the the
the amount of (err) infection or the possibilities of (uh) infection rate [ah] you have anything to argue
yes correct
okay <malay>mungkin awak dah cakap ini</malay> okay maybe <malay>saya</malay> agree <malay>sikit</malay>
maybe <malay>awak ada</malay> point over there
<malay>tapi yang</malay> contact tracing <malay>tu mungkin tak tak senangkan</malay> [lah]
<malay>pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia</malay> teleport <malay>kalau dia sendiri dah suka</malay> teleport
(mm) <malay>tapi ini</malay> interesting point of view (mm) so <malay>kalau awak tanya saya apa</malay> superpower <malay>yang saya nak saya nak</malay> power of regeneration
so <malay>contohnya</malay> (err) <malay>jari saya terpotong</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti dia akan</malay> heal <malay>sendiri</malay>
<malay>saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki</malay> dislocate [ah] dia genera~ re~ regenerate <malay>sendiri</malay>
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk (uh) ambitions that I have
or maybe (uh) I wo~ I can take risks without having worrying that I might (uh) injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe (err) get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win [ah]
provided I am strong [ah] and maybe with this regeneration
(hmm)
I can donate let's say some parts of my (uh) limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
(hmm) where I have this ability so I can do is (err) I request my leg to be cut off and then give away (err) in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard (uh) tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
(mm) what do you think about this regeneration ability
(mm) it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
<malay>dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang</malay> high risk
<malay>itu me~ meminta kematian</malay> [lah]
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having (uh) to be looked at or without (err) being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
(hmm) I have this
think of living in isolation (uh) maybe one maybe <malay>satu hari bila dah dah</malay> experienced everything <malay>yang kita nak</malay> [ah]
I want to be (uh) isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self [ah] to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems (uh) affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
(mm)
how long maybe until I feel peace [ah] so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I ca~ I cannot give a number of years or months [ah] but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months [ah] then slowly maybe I will
(err) increase the number of the period [ah] slowly
okay <malay>mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya</malay> and <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena</malay>
<malay>bergaul dengan orang untuk mem~ untuk memahami keadaan orang</malay>
<malay>sebab tanpa kita me~ ber~ bergaul dengan orang</malay> we will never know what they face
(hmm)
we can never do something to improve the people around us
so for example <malay>bila kita tahu orang ini mengha~ menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong</malay> so <malay>kita akan mencari</malay> solution <malay>untuk menolong seseorang itu</malay>
so <malay>mungkin apa awak cakap</malay> (err) <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] and <malay>tapi bila awak</malay> (err) <malay>saya</malay>
(hmm) <malay>hairan</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa awak</malay> (err) question <malay>bila seseorang itu nak</malay> isolate maybe for months
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable [lah]
but it has to be looked in a certain way [ah] whereby the person
(err)
he is not affecting badly (uh) around the people (uh) (uh) he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state [ah]
(uh)
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
his child behind then <malay>anak-anak dia akan merana</malay> [ah] and
<malay>kalau</malay> months okay months maybe <malay>saya rasa maksimum</malay> (err) maybe not more than nine months [ah]
lesser than that <malay>mungkin</malay> okay
<malay>kenapa</malay> nine months <malay>sebab</malay> within this nine months (um) <malay>budak tu dia akan</malay> grow and after this nine months
they will change a lot [lah] so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small (err) goals small (err)
small achievement so this child will live without (uh) having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife [ah] he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife (err) agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free [ah] to do anything that he wants
do you think so
[eh]
okay <malay>soalan tu</malay> interesting <malay>sepuluh tahun</malay> <malay>mung~</malay> means <malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay>
<malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay> okay <malay>saya</malay> definitely <malay>akan suruh diri saya</malay> (err) <malay>ini</malay> [ah] invest [ah] invest in bitcoin
(uh) cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
(err)
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary [ah] but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams [ah]
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart [ah]
(mm) so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self (err) I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self [ah]
<malay>sebab</malay> at <malay>umur</malay> ten years old <malay>memang awak cakap betul</malay> (uh) <malay>nak nak faham tentang</malay> certain <malay>barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat</malay> convince [ah]
<malay>se~ se~ sa~ satu orang ni</malay> at ten years old <malay>dia akan ingat</malay>
and maybe along the way <malay>mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas</malay> and then <malay>dia akan</malay> start
(err) thinking back (err) <malay>apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya</malay> ten years <malay>bila saya ten-year-old</malay> <malay>akan</malay> <malay>betul</malay>
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
(mm) and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
(um) what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos (uh) I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and (uh) an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud [lah] or maybe just email yourself [ah] so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
(err) a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself (uh) since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is (err) I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see (err) how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe st~ (err) start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
so <malay>mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan</malay> (err) (um) <malay>akan</malay> interest <malay>awak</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> maybe one day <malay>juga awak akan jadi</malay> famous because of this [ah]
(mm)
K
you maybe you next we should talk about (um) near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
(err) some luck you managed to stay alive [ah] so for you (err) <malay>apa yang</malay> experience <malay>awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian</malay>
I need to add on <malay>apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati</malay>
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was (err) I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
it happens whereby we have to train where (err) train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> capsize <malay>habis tu bila</malay> capsize <malay>ini kita kena</malay> grab <malay>kawan kita punya kayak</malay>
and get back up [ah] so <malay>bila saya tengah</malay> practice capsize <malay>ini</malay>
instructor <malay>jauh</malay> so <malay>kita jauh daripada semua orang</malay>
<malay>habis tu kita bila saya tengah</malay> capsize <malay>kawan saya dia</malay> lose control of <malay>dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah</malay> capsize <malay>terus saya</malay> tap <malay>saya punya kayak</malay>
<malay>bila saya tengok terbalik ini</malay> so <malay>kawan saya punya bot tak ada</malay>
<malay>saya dekat situ saya</malay> stuck [ah] <malay>saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada</malay> skirt skirt <malay>ini akan</malay> prevent water from entering our kayak
<malay>nak keluarkan</malay> skirt <malay>tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay>
tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> (uh) in hope that <malay>kawan saya dengar saya</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal saya tengah dekat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap tap tap <malay>dia tak dengar</malay> alright <malay>bila dia dengar ini dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas</malay> incident <malay>dia cuba</malay> paddle <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tolak dia</malay> so <malay>dia nak</malay> paddle <malay>susah sikit</malay>
so <malay>saya dekat bawah air</malay> maybe for one minute [ah]
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was (uh) stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall (uh) is when I was
(err) riding bike (uh) it happens maybe due to
(err) rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to (uh) overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next (uh) topic that I have in mind which is (err) a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
(uh) ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
(hmm) whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that (err) there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
but I was skateboarding and <malay>dalam mimpi tu saya rasa</malay> best <malay>nak bila</malay> skateboard <malay>ni rasa seronok</malay> [jer] and
<malay>bila</malay> skateboard <malay>tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun</malay> [oh] [eh] <malay>rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak</malay> skateboard [ah] [ah] <malay>dari situlah saya start</malay>
start skateboard <malay>tapi nak belajar</malay> skateboard <malay>ni dia susah sangat</malay> (err) it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
(um) synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example (uh) few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
(err) I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future (um) a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go (uh) deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took (uh) I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
and <malay>bila dapat tahan</malay> breath <malay>saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar</malay> (uh) free dive and that time <malay>bila kat</malay> swimming pool (uh) <malay>saya ada</malay> swimming <malay>dekat</malay> nine metre pool [ah] [ah] <malay>itu saya cuba</malay>
and <malay>dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat sampai ke</malay> bottom <malay>tapi ter~</malay> I was having difficulty breathing [ah] and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that I have
so you have anything to add on
okay

<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>lapan bangsa</malay> from where
but it won't be like that what cause you only you only like
you only come out of your mum and dad
like you are only from your mum and dad [pe] <malay>tak</malay> [kan] like you want to <malay>kira</malay> your <malay>nenek moyang semua</malay>
there there's where the like one quarter one quarter comes from
[oh] okay okay
no
you shouldn't
why
wait but
no but as okay race first of all race is socially constructed
<malay>tak ada kau kata</malay> like it's not (um)
(err)
like it's not fair for like kids to have as if not fair for people to get based on their dad's <malay>punya</malay> race [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time <malay>kau kata</malay> like they shouldn't choose so
<malay>apa yang</malay>
like what's your point
(uh huh)
(mm)
like you say they shouldn't choose
[oh]
do you know that got some #macam#
[ah]
like <malay>kalau</malay>
okay <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian [kan] like chinese indian then you want to buy a house then you know cause of the H_D_B race racial <malay>apa tu</malay> the quota that one right
then ya you can choose whether you want to identify yourself as chinese or indian and not obviously people will choose
(um) probably indian cause
cause like
I mean okay I don't know
no they will choose indian
cause
cause like <malay>kalau</malay> this one H_D_B
<malay>dorang</malay> [dah] <malay>ramai gila cina</malay>
then they need indian [pe] and then that their open slot is only indian like #macam# that open open #macam# the empty house is only open to indians
so <malay>kalau kau</malay> chindian then <malay>kau</malay> identify your like you can choose right then you identify yourself as indian then you can take but if you identify yourself as chinese then you cannot take cause
that only that one empty slot
is like reserved considered a reserved for chi~ [ah] indian
ya
[ah]
[a'ah] I I don't know if like we can <malay>jual</malay> like <malay>jual</malay> to <malay>melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>jual</malay> to india or not
then I know like you have to <malay>jual</malay> to like
probably the same race
[a'ah] [a'ah]
ya
ya cause like you also sell at a lower price cause you want to #macam# some people want to get rid of it fast so like they just put it low so that people buy the higher chance of people buying [ah] so it's like
(um)
(uh) it's like a social social inequality cause <malay>kita</malay> minorities <malay>selalu</malay>
okay [ah] I don't want to say <malay>selalu</malay> cause it's too like absolute but
(uh)
(uh) <malay>banyak kali</malay>
(um)
!chey! <malay>dipinggir</malay> yes ya yes ya
ya <malay>dipinggir</malay> is like [ah] #macam# <malay>jadi</malay> outlier <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
ya
(um) honestly <malay>aku rasa</malay>
okay honestly maybe for me like I still support it but is just that I feel like (um) there needs to be more help
to mitigate the problem of [ah] like #macam#
whatever inequality that we mentioned just now [ah]
so <malay>aku rasa</malay> #macam#
cause <malay>kalau tak ada</malay> quota <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] confirm there's like racial different like racial segregation [ah] cause like #macam#
[ah] yes [ah] #macam#
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [ah] woodlands confirm <malay>kampung melayu</malay> [sia] woodlands #yishun#

(hmm) three wishes right
(uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> wishes <malay>ni mesti lebih realistik</malay> [lah] <malay>tak boleh yang merepek-merepek</malay> [lah] okay <malay>kalau realistik</malay> wishes <malay>aku rasa aku nak</malay> get rich [lah] one of it [lah] one of it maybe <malay>untuk</malay> get rich
the reason <malay>aku nak kaya pasal</malay> actually (err) <malay>aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan</malay>
I want to help the poor maybe (uh) I feel that (err) it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then <malay>kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi</malay> fit [ah] <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> fit <malay>aku</malay> fit <malay>aku rasa macam aku pergi lari</malay> [ah] (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok# reservoir <malay>ke</malay> macritchie <malay>ke</malay> I feel that (uh) my body feels good [lah] so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
then next (uh) the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes #furqan#
(uh)
my views on what your wishes are it's actually (uh) is very good from what I see you are a people person like (err) like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
superpower okay so (err) we are moving from realistic to not so realistic [ah] okay so superpower <malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kalau tengok cerita</malay> X men [eh] <malay>dia sikit-sikit macam</malay> night crawler
(err) so <malay>kalau</malay> teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at #tampines# I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like M_R_T (err) taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the M_R_T I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
(um) to a certain extent <malay>pasal [lah] tu</malay> (err) <malay>bila teleportation</malay> okay <malay>kononnya tak ada teleportation</malay> [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>kita dah kena</malay> expose more (err) how should I say it (uh) more unknowingly for example <malay>kita naik</malay> M_R_T <malay>kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>dekat</malay> M_R_T
<malay>tak ke lebih bahaya kalau kita tak teleport</malay>
<malay>kalau kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>naik</malay> M_R_T <malay>atau naik</malay> taxi grab driver <malay>ke</malay> taxi driver <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> expose in that (uh) area <malay>kita duduk kat dalam</malay> M_R_T <malay>ke</malay> <malay>kat dalam kereta ke</malay>
<malay>kita dengan orang yang suspek tak kita tak tahu ni kita tak tahu dia ada ke tidak ni</malay>
<malay>untuk beberapa minit ini</malay> [ah] <malay>ada yang</malay> research <malay>cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau ada</malay> measure measure <malay>contohnya macam</malay> (uh) sanitisation
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say (uh) for example I I share an example [ah]
let's say <malay>nak pergi</malay> giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food (uh) food court I teleport to the place
then after that (uh) I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay (err) you said it can increase because the person (uh) didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so (err) let's say you are not talking about teleportation you take~ you are talking about (err) going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an M_R_T I took M_R_T I took a bus and (uh) maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from M_R_T to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's M_R_T
there's (uh) maybe (uh) the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
and I rest at work and exposed again <malay>ini tak boleh kalau kita dah</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kita</malay> skip all the buses <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] all the transportation <malay>ini</malay> exposure
we only expose to the office
[ah] which is easier to contact tourists
[ah] <malay>tak kan begitu</malay>
it is (uh) something
(err)
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
<malay>itu haram tu</malay>
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know (err) be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
(err) I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one (err) mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of (uh) being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe (uh) act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but (err)
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it (uh)
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that (err) you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to (uh) ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that (err) you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means (err) if a person is a father
okay so (err) what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of (uh) two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man (uh) should isolate himself
for months
I feel (uh) I I agree to a certain extent (err) where
let's say this person have (uh) no responsibility maybe (uh) no parents no siblings no children no wives then (uh) I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say (err) okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example (uh) a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
but then when this (err) <malay>banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan</malay> (mm) <malay>di~ apa ni orang kata</malay>
<malay>kena pergi kursus</malay> [ah] <malay>kursus-kursus</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer</malay>
<malay>menggunakan aplikasi</malay> word excel <malay>kenapa teknologi telah berubah</malay>
<malay>jadi mereka dah</malay> behind time so <malay>ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin</malay> okay <malay>kut</malay>
okay [lah] [eh] <malay>jap</malay> (err) <malay>kita</malay> (err)
<malay>saya teringat</malay> something [ah] <malay>yang pasal</malay> teleportation [ah] kita (uh) <malay>ni</malay> [eh] reverse <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] [eh] teleportation [eh] <malay>kononnya</malay> teleportation <malay>ni kan boleh kita boleh</malay> teleport
(um) <malay>bila kita umur sepuluh tahun</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira-kira ni macam</malay> so called <malay>macam</malay> time machine <malay>begitu</malay> [ah] (uh) <malay>macam</malay> advance <malay>yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya</malay> invention <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah ada ke tidak ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh</malay> teleport reverse time [eh] maybe <malay>kita</malay> teleport ten years old
<malay>nak cakap apa dengan awak punya</malay> (uh) <malay>diri tu</malay> okay <malay>kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia</malay>
actually (err) pretty similar [ah] on on the investment part because (err) actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves (err) a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
(err)
if you were to tell me that investment is (uh) is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe (err) last time I was maybe too good [ah] I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society (err) when they see [oh] a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much (err) about monetary (err) maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old (err) ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more (uh) gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this (uh) money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go (uh) anywhere that I want because (err) there's a certain level of (err) financial freedom I would say
second topic
[oh] my my memory memory is (err) de~ degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
[oh] I admit (uh) do you have you heard of (uh) about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the ne~ the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep (uh) items
or (uh) photos [ah] to then (err) to keep in a secret place or maybe (err) some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video (err) it's like a conversation with (uh) my old my my oldest self so let's say (err) my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually (err) when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so (uh) I just hope I don't lose the video [lah] actually I don't even remember where is it now
(hmm) I like to be famous yes
but
but (uh) I think is (uh) if I were to take myself a picture of myself (err) every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
(err) <malay>salah satu</malay> (err) experience <malay>yang aku pernah mengalami</malay> [ah] <malay>adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> real [ah]
<malay>dia</malay> (err) it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving (uh) at #tioman#
one of the nicer waters in (uh) asia that (uh) that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic (err) trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so (err) I think there is (err) what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and sud~ suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have bre~ you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of (uh) funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that (err) short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then (uh) another (err) much more serious (err)
(uh) experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me (err) makes me (err)
<malay>bulu roma ternaik</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku</malay>
<malay>jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga</malay> so (err) <malay>saya tengah bawa macam biasa</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba</malay> (err) <malay>saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan</malay> (err) <malay>di</malay> road <malay>tersebut</malay> [lah] <malay>di jalan raya tersebut</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila saya bawa</malay>
then (err) maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was (uh) I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that (err) jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to (uh) go into (uh) into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then (err)
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an am~ amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that (err) it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually (err) and even (err) just now I was riding a bike
(err) due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so (uh) I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
the person a a driver the driver that (uh) was (err) almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily (err) nothing happen <malay>tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja</malay>
<malay>tapi itu pun</malay> okay <malay>itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu adalah</malay> (uh) experience <malay>saya</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> near death experience or rather I would say a near miss [ah] how about you #furqan#
!oho! <malay>dah macam pantun berkerat</malay>
(uh)
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
(err) someone is (err) or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of (err) delivery riders who is (uh) riding very recklessly around (uh) (uh) on the road [ah] because they are
(err) chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe (uh) road (uh) sorry (uh) lorry drivers lorry drivers
<malay>yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen</malay> (uh) <malay>yang tu semua</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>dia orang kerja</malay> trip
<malay>lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut</malay> number of trip <malay>kalau dia orang</malay>
(err) less trip
<malay>kan kurang</malay> [lah] <malay>gaji dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya</malay> (err) <malay>sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak</malay>
(err) <malay>lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dia punya dia punya alasannya</malay> (err)
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because (err) (err) when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example (err) if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can (err) plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering (uh) maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that (err) we are not so (err) I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe (uh) three hobbies one is (err) maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start (err) ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
(err) I would know I'm I'm not really a good (uh) soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because (err) I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that (uh) soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me (err) easily when whenever (err) people especially (uh) in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said [oh] let's play soccer outside
(uh) this way you gain (uh) relationship or some
re~ relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and (err) in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems (err) I think is is is quite interesting
(err)
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some (err) activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure (uh) how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because (err) in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals (err) so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less (err) how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think (uh) as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
(err)
so far I think [eh] all the (err) hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from (err) we are kind of (uh) similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers
okay
so these days
<malay>aku kat rumah</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> crochet [jer] [kan] <malay>tapi aku macam nak</malay> try
to design more
<malay>benda</malay> other than just <malay>macam</malay> bag <malay>pasal aku nak jual</malay> a few bags
<malay>tapi macam</malay> I want to try cardigan [lah] skirt
<malay>tapi aku takut</malay> because I need like <malay>macam</malay> time to try it out
<malay>macam</malay> model it out you know <malay>takut dia macam</malay> for sizes and all so
ya I think I want to I need your help
to <malay>macam</malay>
advise me on the sizing and then <malay>macam</malay> so what kind of design people is interested in
so ya
because my Instagram shop is not
progressing at all
I don't know
cause I don't have like <malay>banyak</malay> content <malay>cuma aku aku</malay> post <malay>apa yang aku ada dulu</malay>
<malay>tapi tu pun aku buat untuk aku punya</malay> self <malay>bukannya orang beli</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>sekarang ni orang yang beli pun kawan-kawan aku</malay> [jer] I don't know how to <malay>macam</malay> reach out to
because you know Instagram <malay>ada yang</malay> promote <malay>punya</malay> function <malay>tapi kena bayar</malay> <malay>aku tak ada duit dah</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak</malay>
<malay>tak dapat tak payah cakap pasal kerja tapi aku tak ada kerja macam untuk tanggung aku punya</malay>
(uh) hobby <malay>punya</malay> expenses [kan] so ya
hobby is hard I want to try new things you also want to try new things right
but <malay>tak ada duit</malay> so what's the things <malay>yang kau nak</malay> try
[oh] I think
<malay>aku</malay> start <malay>pasal aku ada duit</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku</malay> the first step I did was <malay>aku beli mesin</malay>
that's that's the first step [lah] then even after that
that step I felt very <malay>macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>abeh sekarang kena beli kain kena beli</malay> ruler
<malay>apa ni</malay>
all the materials [lah] because you know starting a new hobby is always so expensive but it's always been my interest and actually now is my passion [ah]
but I I still have not <malay>macam masuk seko~</malay> class <malay>atau macam</malay> any course <malay>yang</malay> will teach me
professional way ya so I think <malay>itu pun aku nak kena belajar</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> if you want to join me
I think we can always join <malay>yang macam</malay> you know the SkillsFuture kind of thing
<malay>yang</malay> I saw at Instagram the one that you I send you that time then you were like (uh) but you don't even know how to draft why would you join you know that there's a lot of level right
<malay>aku nak</malay> join the highest level the <malay>terus buat baju kurung</malay> that [one] you know
ya but I think if we want to do we can find a time then we join this course together you know there's this thing that this (um) school
<malay>yang</malay> that time I was interested in that time when we want to go the open house
yes
I think that [one] also have like course it's not like serious schooling but is like <malay>macam</malay> after school (uh) part time I think we can join that
I mean for now if you if you really want to learn you can borrow like you can you have your parents <malay>punya</malay>
you can just start [lah] you just go for it just invest a bit of money on like necessary items
ya
(mmhmm) yup
ya <malay>aku pun rasa sama</malay> I think that's why I started my shop because I've been following so many <malay>macam kedai dorang semua sama</malay> like I don't know what I think I there's like a certain time
and if you all no no offence there's like a lot of people jumping on the bandwagon [ah] they hyping all these <malay>kedai</malay> too much no offence
I saw one <malay>kedai dorang jual</malay> tote bag like
like basic <malay>gila</malay> tote bag <malay>dia abeh ada macam</malay> embroidery <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> pathetic [ah] to me no offence it's not like high skill level embroidery but it's like sixty dollars and people all buy and it's like sold out I'm like [oh] my god like I can do so much better
and some more <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada</malay> artistic <malay>punya</malay> course
that's why we always feel like [oh] no we can we can apply what we know and we can do so much ya ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya that's why that's why (um) <malay>apa ni</malay>
that's why because because <malay>dekat</malay> Instagram they always like
up it up within like people of our community we always <malay>kita selalu macam bilang</malay> you are artist you you gonna charge
<malay>punya harga mahal</malay> it's a piece of art it's a service people not <malay>tak semua orang boleh buat benda gitu</malay> [pe]
so just charge <malay>lebih jangan jangan</malay> cause some more <malay>kalau kau</malay> charge low <malay>nanti</malay> other artist <malay>kena macam</malay> compare <malay>macam</malay> then the customer <malay>macam kenapa orang ni murah kenapa kau mahal gila</malay>
ya that [one] <malay>satu</malay> [lah] <malay>itu betul</malay>
<malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>apa ni benda-benda</malay> simple <malay>gitu</malay>
okay [lah] like I I guess <malay>rezeki dorang</malay> [lah] you know but then the the machine is it embroidery machine <malay>atau</malay> machine just help you stitch <malay>atau</malay>
is it <malay>tulis</malay> letter <malay>punya atau</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm) <malay>pasal</malay> my brother <malay>dia selalu buat</malay> commission work
so <malay>orang yang</malay> order <malay>dia punya</malay> commission work is like <malay>kawan dia banyak kawan dia atau cikgu dia</malay>
<malay>tapi dia pergi</malay> charge <malay>murah</malay> [seh] like A four
oil paint [eh] not oil acrylic <malay>punya</malay> paint they charge twenty <malay>dua puluh dua puluh dolar</malay> [jer] hello I'm
<malay>untuk dia senang</malay> [lah] <malay>memang untuk dia senang dia dia</malay> draw <malay>satu kali satu malam pun dah habis</malay>
so <malay>dia cakap tak akan aku nak</malay> charge <malay>mahal-mahal tapi dia cakap</malay>
<malay>benda ni bukan banyak orang boleh buat lagipun orang</malay> there's people out there <malay>yang</malay> charge <malay>benda mahal-mahal kenapa kau</malay> just <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku agaknya tak</malay> confident [lah] [eh] <malay>macam</malay> insecure <malay>macam aku nak jual</malay> tote bag <malay>aku</malay> <malay>berapa</malay>
<malay>macam mahal sangat kawan</malay> that kind of thinking you know
but ya so I think <malay>kita</malay> people like us <malay>kalau nak</malay>
<malay>buat benda-benda gini</malay> we should just do because we I don't think we have like necessary knowledge in <malay>macam</malay> style no offence
no offence some people just no style
and we if we if we create a trend right people will follow that kind of thing <malay>macam</malay> no offence like
like Instagram shops now locals <malay>semua macam</malay> they all have the same style
and people dig for it so
[ah]
<malay>atau macam</malay>
<malay>apa ni</malay>

[ah] <malay>tu pasal</malay>
(mmhmm)
loose
<malay>lagipun sekarang macam kita</malay> our world or our like I don't know maybe people around us or my generation [kan]
<malay>kita</malay> more to <malay>macam</malay> a sustainable lifestyle
so <malay>banyak orang</malay> choose to <malay>beli</malay>
local <malay>atau</malay> secondhand <malay>atau</malay> thrift <malay>tapi</malay>
if you think about it thrifting and secondhand <malay>atau</malay> hand me down <malay>dia macam kau kau selalu kasi aku baju</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tak nak pakai kau kasi aku baju pasal</malay>
<malay>pasal apa ni</malay>
<malay>itu boleh boleh senang untuk orang yang badan macam</malay> smaller than people so <malay>kalau banyak orang yang macam</malay>
<malay>besar sikit</malay> then <malay>macam mana dorang nak</malay> like
sustainable <malay>dorang nak macam</malay> [oh] <malay>macam</malay> long don't buy from fast fashion <malay>tapi</malay> actually fast fashion <malay>pun baju semua kecil</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
ya that's why <malay>aku suka sangat dengan</malay> this new <malay>macam</malay> trend of <malay>kedai</malay> Instagram <malay>yang buat</malay>
custom fit is I think is very important I think <malay>kalau aku boleh jahit</malay> I think that's one of my goal <malay>macam</malay>
I like it's always at the back of my head to <malay>buka kedai baju</malay> [lah] actually <malay>tapi</malay> just I don't have the necessary
skill <malay>tapi kalau aku boleh aku nak</malay> [seh] <malay>aku suka gila kalau aku buat baju kurung dekat kedai</malay> like yes
like yes the <malay>baju</malay> really is your <malay>baju</malay> it hugs like is really like your shoulder size your your <malay>apa</malay>
your <malay>apa ni</malay>
wrist length ya
and like <malay>lagipun baju yang</malay> tailor is always last longer
<malay>aku ada banyak baju nenek aku daripada</malay>
<malay>tahun pasal</malay> [kan] <malay>ada</malay> tag <malay>ada nombor</malay> [tau] and <malay>nombor dia belum nombor</malay> singapore <malay>yang</malay>
modern <malay>punya</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> nine <malay>tu</malay> ya number <malay>dia lima</malay> or something like that how old is that ya
yup

(mmhmm) chris #jericho#
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mmhmm)
<malay>pasal pasal</malay> (um)
thrifting the word just the word just thrifting [kan] thrift is <malay>macam</malay> cheap <malay>murah</malay>
so <malay>kalau kau</malay> sustainable is when you buy something that already exists <malay>tapi macam</malay> at the same time
[ah] so you don't have to <malay>buat benda baru</malay> so it's not wasteful [lah] <malay>kirakan tapi kalau</malay> vintage vintage is more of like a collection
is <malay>mahal</malay> hundred dollars for a T-shirt for people <malay>apa</malay> [seh] T-shirt one hundred dollar <malay>tapi macam</malay> is
it got it got <malay>apa ni</malay> is valuable is got context [ah] there there's a history to it
<malay>lagi</malay>
<malay>lagi apa ni</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>abeh yang</malay> thrifting <malay>ni</malay> secondhand <malay>murah macam kat</malay> lucky plaza <malay>pasal</malay> is
people <malay>tak nak</malay> I feel like value a a a object is based on the
people <malay>nak ke tak nak</malay> is demand versus supply [lah] that's what makes the price
so ya I think <malay>kalau orang</malay> confuse I think why why is it so confusing
you just see the price <malay>kalau</malay> two dollar that's not vintage <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>entah kenapa</malay>
(mm)
collection like people like collect things like (um)
[oh] ya <malay>lagipun</malay>
<malay>benda yang kita kena tanya ni</malay> actually <malay>kenapa baju sekarang murah</malay>
what makes it so like <malay>orang orang tanya kenapa kenapa mahal tapi dorang tak pernah tanya kenapa murah</malay>
cause there's actually a cause behind that <malay>murah</malay> you know
<malay>pasal orang yang sepatutnya dia bayar tak dibayar</malay>
until very sad that's why <malay>aku macam sekarang aku dah</malay> hundred percent
(uh) prevent myself <malay>daripada beli baju dari</malay> Uniqlo Cotton On
ya actually <malay>aku tak beli baju baru</malay> [lah] actually <malay>pasal</malay>
actually no offence <malay>tapi kau kasi aku banyak baju</malay> and <malay>baju kau semua lawa semua</malay> my size like I want to give people like I want to <malay>macam kasi kasi tapi</malay> !alamak! <malay>lawa pula pakai</malay> [lah]
<malay>abeh satu kali satu kali ni aku keluar</malay> family <malay>aku dorang semua pakai baju kau</malay> [sia]
like the whole family went except for ya [oh] my god
you give me I I wish <malay>orang lain pun ada</malay> this kind of <malay>macam</malay> relationship with friends <malay>atau macam ka~ macam</malay>
<malay>nyai aku selalu kasi aku baju pasal dia orang kampung</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang kampung boleh</malay> gather <malay>baju abeh dia tak suka atau dia besar kecil</malay>
<malay>dia kasi aku</malay> so <malay>aku selalu ada</malay> these people around me <malay>yang akan kasi baju</malay> but then I I don't think other people
have that kind of privilege ya
so got a lot of people cause I some sometimes I <malay>ada orang tanya aku pasal</malay> this sustainable lifestyle like they want to try also then they say
how how to get <malay>baju yang macam</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> fast fashion and how do you even know
ya people always shit on fast fashion <malay>tapi</malay> actually fashion industry as a whole is very
bad <malay>tapi susah</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> ya I also don't have <malay>macam</malay>
much to say other than <malay>macam kalau aku ada baju aku kasi kau</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
yup
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
<malay>melayu</malay>
sorry sorry sorry
(mmhmm)
<malay>ye pasal</malay> [kan] actually <malay>kalau kau fikir fikir balik</malay> [kan] all this (um) wasteful <malay>punya</malay> life
<malay>cepat sangat</malay> is like so fast like it's sudden
<malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>kita</malay> <malay>yang boleh nampak</malay> [lah] the drastic changes actually <malay>dulu-dulu</malay>
how to say [ah]
did you know that plastic bag was created by the swedish <malay>lelaki dia nak</malay> create plastic bag <malay>pastu dia nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> he wants it to be a more sustainable (uh) alternative [tau]
<malay>dia tak nak pakai</malay> tree <malay>dia tak nak pakai</malay> paper bag <malay>pasal</malay> is from trees
<malay>abeh dia tak nak pakai macam</malay> cloth bag because it's (uh) to produce cotton you need a lot of water
so plastic bag is <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>macam senang kau boleh lipat taruk dalam poket boleh pakai lagi tapi orang</malay>
<malay>kita salah guna</malay> [lah] <malay>kita ada</malay> convenience <malay>kita buang</malay> after every use which is
that that whole term of disposable is very
crazy to me disposable how can <malay>satu benda kau buat susah-susah</malay>
<malay>terus kau buang</malay> plastic bag <malay>macam</malay> factory <malay>kena</malay>
<malay>lagi kalau kau belajar</malay> chemistry you know how all this thing is created <malay>daripada</malay> element <malay>dorang semua</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> if you really look from the root [kan] <malay>kau macam</malay> [oh] my god I can't believe I throw that after one use you know
[eh]
(uh huh)
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm)
ya
(mmhmm)
ya
effort is put to
so going back to <malay>yang cakap pasal kedai</malay> Instagram and <malay>orang sekarang banyak buat benda</malay>
the (uh) it's a ba~ like <malay>bagus yang orang sekarang</malay> (uh) try their best <malay>untuk belajar</malay> all these skills <malay>balik buat apa ni</malay>
just <malay>buat benda-benda</malay> simple [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> at least <malay>dorang ada apa</malay>
<malay>ada berusaha untuk buat benda-benda gini</malay> once you <malay>buat</malay> you <malay>akan</malay>
<malay>hargai</malay> you know how to appreciate like how how it's being made and then
that's why you you know like you shouldn't take all these thing for granted you know
once you because we are so <malay>jauh daripada</malay> the the process we don't see it the process of doing all this that's why people <malay>kita tak</malay>
<malay>tak macam</malay> [eh] [a'ah] [eh] <malay>macam mana macam sayur sayur</malay> <malay>orang tanam susah-susah pagi-pagi bangun abeh kita tak makan kita tepikan buang</malay>
ya so
it's actually not our fault [lah] it's just how time has changed <malay>abeh macam tapi</malay> #alhamdulilah# <malay>kita dapat</malay> this
<malay>ilham</malay> this know in our head that we get to <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>belajar</malay> [lah] just educate yourself all this knowledge is important actually
so that future generation
we we can <malay>lagipun kita bukannya</malay> sustainably more aware [jer] I think we just more aware of everything
include the discrimination

<malay>tengok</malay> [ah]
(mm) that's true
pres~
I don't know
I mean
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on <malay>cari kerja ke</malay> start business <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>kau nak buat</malay> business <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
(mm)
but <malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam sikit</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kau masih beli benda kat</malay> habbo
(mm) <malay>masih</malay> spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
[oh] how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like <malay>jual</malay> your <malay>benda</malay> and quit or
(mm)
<malay>banyak sangat benda</malay> [kan]
(mm)
not like what if it gets worst <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> remove <malay>banyak benda</malay> from the game then <malay>orang semua macam tak nak main</malay>
then what happens
true
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but like
sad [sia] they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market (uh) like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game [eh] without the players what do you have like an empty online page
(mm)
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
I think <malay>dia orang macam tak fikir</malay> they gonna cause
<malay>macam</malay> like to them at the end of the day <malay>kita</malay> like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
and that's what has been happening [what] like the
<malay>macam</malay> like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then <malay>orang masih beli</malay> [pe] it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
[kan]
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
<malay>habis</malay> smite <malay>apa jadi</malay>
ya
[oh] really cause I know that day (uh) <malay>siapa naim</malay> asked (uh) #ilyas# to join but then #ilyas# said like the file was like twenty one G_B he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that [lah]
(mm) four days ago three days ago ya <malay>macam</malay>
the file got too big for #ilyas# so like P_C <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> download then <malay>sampai dia</malay> have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why [ah] <malay>ilyas dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like [oh] I cannot play with you cause <malay>sekarang dia main</malay> among us [jer]
ya
I think <malay>baru</malay> [ah] like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but <malay>dia cakap dia</malay> delete <malay>semua benda tinggal yang</malay> programme files
like <malay>dia</malay> basically formatted his P_C ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
<malay>dia cakap dulu</malay> file <malay>dia macam</malay> fourteen G_B and then then after that it went up to sixteen <malay>lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu</malay>
it's probably him ya
I don't know [sia]
cause that time <malay>dia cakap dia punya</malay> app <malay>ada</malay> issue [lah] he couldn't log in so <malay>dia</malay> delete then <malay>bila dia nak</malay> redownload <malay>balik tak boleh</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> format like remove everything from <malay>dia punya</malay> P_C <malay>lepas tu semua benda</malay> like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
ya and he spent so much on that game also [what] I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
[oh] ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want [sia]
I don't know
that'll be cool though can you imagine <malay>yang</malay> character character <malay>dia semua jadi</malay> spongebob <malay>punya</malay> character <malay>macam</malay> mister crab sandy
cute [sia]
(oo) is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
#kumbhakarna#
yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(oo)
and another person [orh]
(hmm) that's hard good looks or fit body
probably go with good looks but I mean <malay>pasal kalau</malay>
<malay>badan sapau pun</malay> I mean you can just go to the gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that <malay>tapi kalau nak muka baru</malay> I mean you can't really do that also [what] so probably good looks
(mm)
ya I guess <malay>banyak banyak duit</malay> at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like <malay>kalau nak</malay> like make yourself fitter and stuff <malay>boleh pergi lari</malay> and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
then yourself [leh]
(mm)
yes
ya
true
I mean to a certain extent <malay>semua orang pun macam</malay> at least a bit [ah]
true
(mm)
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> then there's really like no point
good looks
ya
(hmm)
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but <malay>kalau</malay>
no any other day (hmm)
<malay>kalau ni hari</malay> not much [lah] I'm just going to go home and like rest but like <malay>kalau esok</malay> maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
<malay>nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang</malay> haven't <malay>dah lama belum potong rambut</malay> so maybe I shall do that
and
ya
[oh] ya not not bald [lah] no [lah] like as in like short
I don't know I
<malay>rasa macam</malay> free [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
<malay>sekarang muka macam</malay> maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short <malay>macam</malay> medium length <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak panjang sangat pun</malay>
but ya
<malay>kalau kat rumah</malay> (hmm)
netflix <malay>lepas tu</malay>
[ah]
<malay>main</malay> C_O_D and playing a bit of C_O_D
(um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah]
(mm) ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
(uh) no I haven't played cause like I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>main dengan naim</malay> and #muhammad# they very competitive and then like if #ilyas# is not there like can't really
like tag along so like
so I usually <malay>kalau dia orang dua</malay> [jer] then I I avoid
but like <malay>kalau</malay> the rest <malay>main</malay> then <malay>aku main</malay> [ah] cause I
!huh! really I didn't know
[oh] you didn't say
did you say [oh] I didn't see
I didn't
[oh] no he means he can't even play at all ya
I mean the same thing happened <malay>bila</malay> that time I tried to download <malay>kat</malay> my macbook <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang</malay>
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my P_C
cause I don't think they have a I_O_S <malay>punya</malay> file
ya
(mm)
<malay>satu benda</malay>
just one (mm)
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
[oh] ya <malay>kalau satu benda dapat rumah</malay> [ah]
ya so you like
(mm)
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
[kan]
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
<malay>kau nak beli rumah punya susah</malay>
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
I mean <malay>kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah</malay> then at most <malay>kau kerja untuk</malay>
maybe your savings and then like <malay>sikit untuk makan minum</malay> bills
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
[oh]
I guess
I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to [ah] like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
#yishun#
we move to an island <malay>yang tak ada orang</malay>
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [ah]
ya let's go look for that cow later
<malay>hantu</malay>
so what the cow is the <malay>hantu</malay> or like
is there
interesting we go find out [lah]
[kan]
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
maybe <malay>orang</malay> maybe like someone like <malay>dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa</malay>
<malay>macam buang kat sana kesian</malay>
<malay>dia lari</malay>
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
[oh]
I mean the
the latest the one I think just got removed what the <malay>kampung</malay>
I mean there's still one that exists that like
I don't know #buangkok# some some no as in like an actual <malay>kampung macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu</malay> ya
<malay>yang</malay> that time I went there <malay>untuk yang satu</malay> filming for this
<malay>cerita hantu</malay> [ah]
ya went there and then <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> (uh) <malay>tempat tu memang ada benda</malay> [ah] like there's there's actual <malay>hantu</malay> living there ya
and then like there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> [ah] like this chinese auntie
she owns the place basically and then like (uh)
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
<malay>abeh dia orang cakap macam</malay> (um) like <malay>kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam</malay> have like
good intentions like you can't be there to <malay>macam</malay>
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened [lah] when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
(mm) ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like [oh] I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
she said like <malay>kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur</malay> [lah] just let it be
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
we film from I think like we arrived there at six [ah] so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the <malay>hantu</malay> was late
like really late and then [ah] they wanted to start filming at like eight
and then we had to delay and then wait then (um) when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her S_F_X <malay>punya</malay> costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the <malay>hantu</malay> it was quite quite interesting to see her change [ah] cause
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] she's like I think some
model or something
so she's quite tall [lah] and then like (um)
her features were like pretty [lah] like
like a model person's features
<malay>abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu</malay> and then it's kind of fun [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) that part that was the one [lah]
ya
(mm) ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying [lah] cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal <malay>yang kecil punya</malay> contact lenses it's a full eye one
so like
we were kind of worried [lah] that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god [lah] like <malay>nasib</malay> [ah]
<malay>benda tu jadi</malay> so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary [ah] to see her in the dark
like wandering around and shit
ya [lah] but then it's the only <malay>kampung</malay> I know that exists in singapore [lah]
ya
that <malay>kampung</malay>
I think the aunt~ the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they are very nice and then the when we were there <malay>kita nampak macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay> caucasian people #ang moh# like white people
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
col~
they were like <malay>dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang nampak</malay> then <malay>kita punya</malay> filming <malay>punya benda</malay> then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] what you're doing
then we just like like we told them [lah] like [oh] we're filming a horror movie here
they like [oh] okay cool cool and <malay>jalan</malay>
but it's quite interesting place [ah] cause it's surrounded by H_D_B
quite a few like (um) there's a lot of <malay>kampung</malay> houses [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> maybe <malay>ada lima ke enam orang</malay> [jer] <malay>tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang</malay> [ah]
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that <malay>kampung</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> she does the upkeeping and stuff [ah] and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
that hut that looks like a #kopitiam#
like <malay>ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam</malay> I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
but it's exist now ya
ya it's very close it's like <malay>macam kalau</malay>
H_D_B <malay>dia</malay> like here and then it's just <malay>kat bawah</malay>
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the <malay>kampung</malay> area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the H_D_B so it's quite quite cool
<malay>besar juga</malay> [ah] like maybe it's about the size of like one small H_D_B area
like maybe like eight blocks <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor [lah]
so like ya
it's all <malay>kayu</malay> and then like very old school [lah] <malay>semua macam</malay>
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
stay in the <malay>kampung</malay>
[oh] visit !huh! there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven A_M
ya it's quite <malay>gelap</malay> I mean there there is a few street lights [ah] like around the area but it's quite dark and then (um)
the there's a road that goes through the entire place [lah] so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tempat dia memang besar</malay> like really quite big ya
and but we only hear like
like explore like one small corner of it cause <malay>bila kita masuk kita naik</malay> lorry <malay>kena bawa semua</malay> equipment [kan] so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like #paiseh# [ah] cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the S_F_X stuff
so like
<malay>aku datang</malay> just <malay>tengok-tengok abeh</malay> like <malay>macam tolong sini tolong sana</malay>
and then (um)
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like [oh] !wah! so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya <malay>dah pukul lapan gitu</malay> then she came over
then she was like <malay>kau orang nampak apa-apa tak</malay> and I'm like (um) no and then she said like <malay>kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut</malay> nothing [one]
<malay>dia hantu baik</malay> then I'm like okay
ya
she just goes around does that every time
[ah] but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice [ah] it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
(um)
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting [ah] the place
interesting
(um)
M_B_S
I honestly don't know [ah] I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night [lah]
ya I think same [ah] if like I had to like
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will <malay>tunggu malam baru keluar</malay> cause <malay>panas sangat</malay> like everyday it's so humid and hot
true
but
[oh] ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
(mm)
(mmhmm)
really
that's interesting
(uh) the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes [sia] is it even open I think it is already [lah] if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
#pulau semakau# that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
<malay>tiga tahun</malay> [eh] it's quite recent [sia]
three years quite recent [lah] ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
[orh] [orh]
catty
catty enclosure
(mm)
and jumping on things
(mm)
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed [lah] like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible [lah] to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age [sia] the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from #yishun#
#yishun# has cold weather and move it
but like <malay>kesian juga</malay> [ah] like you when you <malay>tengok</malay> the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot

that's a hard question
<malay>aku nak rumah</malay>
but legit [lah] like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
(oo)
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
(hmm)
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job [oh] my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
<malay>entah abeh</malay>
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
(mmhmm)
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole H_D_B filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
(mm)
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
[oh] ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
(mm)
ya previous
(mm) money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so what the hell
!wow!
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
[oh]
(mm)
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your Q_R code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
(oo) okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> free <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau bayar</malay> then okay [ah] <malay>aku bingit</malay> but then <malay>kalau</malay> free
then collect <malay>dekat</malay> C_C_ <malay>dekat rumah aku</malay> okay [lah] and
I mean ya <malay>memang</malay> [ah] like <malay>buang masa juga</malay> cause
they tell you like [oh] you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing <malay>abeh</malay> it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your I_C right it's literally does nothing different
(mm)
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no G_P_S in it [ah] so like
probably not
(mmhmm)
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
(mm)
(mm)
no one was interested
ya
(mmhmm)
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay [lah] to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their I_C and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
(mmhmm)
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like !oops!
I mean if it had if had G_P_S like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
but I don't think <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
(mm)
I guess
I miss cats
ya
cat cafe
[orh]
same
I just I cannot imagine like
<malay>tak suka</malay>
[oh]
I was like !huh!
ya
<malay>kat bawah</malay> block
!huh! <malay>sini takde banyak kucing</malay>
[oh] that's weird
the hell

(mm)
(mm)
have you seen your cat <malay>luar</malay>
have your seen your cat
that cat
I also haven't see
when I go down
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)

have its own like
safari at like enclosure
<malay>seram</malay> [sia]
true
does your aunt is your aunt scared of cats
[orh]
(mm)
ya
fur gets everywhere though
allergies
how
that's weird
(mm)
you know when I first got my cat it was that bad [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(hmm) <malay>bila</malay> like I have carry the cat and stuff my nose will like start like getting blocked then I'll be coughing
<malay>abeh batuk rabak</malay> [sia] it's like cannot breathe and stuff
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
<malay>sekarang</malay> if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy [ah] like if he comes too close like my face
and then <malay>kalau</malay> when I <malay>mandi</malay> him like
that's when it gets bad [lah] like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's
ya
bathe them right ya but like
stinks ya
he hates it [lah] but like it's fine (uh) it's fine [lah] he just hates it he doesn't like
aggressive
[oh] really
[orh]
I mean get scared [lah] like you can his face he doesn't want to be there
he has that like let me go face but then
like I think he's fine [lah] like cause I I usually carry him while I bathe him
like he's in my hands
what
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but like
you mean like what like people like make the virus or
this happens
(mm)
(mmhmm)
I guess but
I don't know like why is it more common now than like back then or like I mean like to me it's been every every few years confirm got like some
global pandemic [what] then like
every year we just come out with like better medicine and stuff
to like combat it so like
I don't think it would wipe out the human race like but I mean people will die [lah] confirm but like
[oh]
(mm)
faster
that makes sense
into climate change
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think there comes a point where you have to like stop
cause like
how advance do we need to be
stop
just leave
seven hundred languages
ya I mean like really at what point do we stop having to <malay>macam</malay> pursue technology
cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
(mm)
is put to use
ya
(mm)
somewhere else
that needs it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
think that's the issue with like most
like everyone
chasing money
money ya I think the next U_S president should just remove money
there is not no money
the U_S president speaks in malay <malay>kau orang semua</malay> stop it [eh]
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think <malay>kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi</malay> I just I just want to give you a warning [eh] <malay>kau</malay> stop [jer] [eh] <malay>jangan buat lagi</malay> [tau]
then okay <malay>kau balik</malay> like
bro~
the guy was like in for like murder charge and then he just like
escape with nothing
ya
<malay>siapa</malay>
[ah] ya
ya
ya
murderers
ya
[oh] well
ya [sia] and then the girl got like sponsorship opportunity and stuff
nonsensical [sia] like how
why
(mmhmm)
are we
bye bye
okay
[oh] my god stop
okay so (um) actually he was one of the first few (um) like accounts that I watch on tiktok [lah] and I started it obviously time C_B [ah] times you lane
time <malay>semua orang tak ada kerja lain</malay>
ya so he was on my F_Y_P list like [eh] local (uh) local account [lah] like [eh] this one look like singapore like that ya so then I went to see then actually the at first the <malay>dia punya</malay> videos was all quite <malay>macam</malay> angsty [ah] like
[oh] you see this vulgar #tat# #tut# #tat# semua basic~ basically like <malay>macam</malay> all the people like being annoying [lah] time <malay>dia tengah nak</malay> deliver
and then it was very weird because I also saw one video of <malay>dia pergi</malay> #tampines# mall and he was like guys look it's all dead dead and I was and <malay>pasal tu</malay> time C_B [kan] so we cannot go out [kan] and I was like [oh] my god I've never seen #tampines# mall look like that
ya serious <malay>macam</malay> like like some horror story is here
I can't remember C_B april april may ya april may ya
I'm like when did I stop my attachment
ya then only okay I'm not sure if it's recent but like I only recently noticed that he started doing live kind of just scrolling one day like <malay>malam-malam buta</malay> like nine plus I was like [eh] this guy doing live live what [sia]
because at that point in time I just thought <malay>macam</malay> he records and then edits and then posts right so I was thinking he left and then my my impression of live is like you sit in front of the camera and talk right so then I was just like [oh] !wow! !wow! he cause it P_O_V
yes <malay>abang</malay> grabfood P_O_V
and I think the funniest part was that (um) based on his cause his accent is quite vague and like you know he's the kind <malay>yang</malay> like cause of like his friends <malay>dulu kat</malay> secondary school <malay>semua</malay> [kan] and primary school so he like knows how like malay slang also he's like <malay>apa ni</malay> bro
ya so (uh) people will like are you malay are you malay then he's like what only malay is it do grabfood
I was like boo
ya I know right ya then ya but (uh) turns out he's chinese [lah] so and then I thought he was #ah beng# actually
he actually he has the #beng# vibes but the most <malay>kekek</malay> thing is like the way he talks is very <malay>macam</malay> narrator that's what people described it as you got the narrator voice very mesmerizing
then it was like !whoa! wh~ you all think that my voice very mesmerizing
<malay>kelakar</malay> [lah] like
ya it's quite <malay>bahan</malay> actually
ya
exactly so I think actually by right <malay>dia punya</malay> target audience is
(um) like fellow riders but then like [oh] my god they're all this like
all following you it's so scary you know [oh] my god like there was this kid <malay>dia macam</malay>
I was like I say <malay>asal</malay> this <malay>budak</malay> like freaking thirsty you know
<malay>macam dia kata</malay> come live with me <malay>apa apa apa</malay> then <malay>aku</malay> was like
!eww! then <malay>aku</malay> press <malay>dia punya</malay> profile then I was like [oh] my god this is like some eleven year old girl dancing I'll just like get off tiktok
ya [oh] it was so scary so and then (um) so he D_M me to say thanks for sending like coins and likes and stuff then the way he talk [kan] is <malay>macam</malay> corporate <malay>gila</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dekat dia tanya</malay> (um) in which area do you reside I was like reside [eh]
first off <malay>aku dah</malay> block <malay>dia</malay> I was like saying (uh) don't worry I'm not under age I'm like I'm twenty four and he was like okay that's great
ya because of a small lampoon like there was this cause they remember me under sixteen year old girl then I'm just like okay you could in some ways typical is like the wild wild wet
ya because (uh) and then <malay>semalam pun</malay> like there was this girl that was like remember me I'm the sixteen year old girl then I'm just like [ah] [eh] awkward
technically [ah] I mean it makes sense because it's like their generation <malay>yang pakai</malay> [kan] but it's still very disturbing [lah] but I'm just glad that he doesn't like ya he like <malay>tak layan</malay> and then he doesn't assume anything [oh] ya then he was like how do I address you [ah] <malay>aku</malay> was like how do I address you <malay>macam</malay> then
the next for me <malay>macam</malay> the automatic response is miss #farizan# <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>macam merepek</malay> [sia]
#zan# [ah] actually <malay>aku</malay> was like !alamak! <malay>aku terlupa nak tukar</malay> my (um) name <malay>pasal</malay> it's still #zan# A <malay>yang ikut</malay> my (um) I_G and <malay>aku</malay> was like
!alamak! too late to change to air [lah] <malay>takpe takpe</malay> [lah] #zan# [lah] <malay>zan jadi</malay> [lah]
yes [oh] my gosh he was like I'm very tired right now but if I'm not wrong you asked me to call you #zan# right and I was just like yes #senpai# noticed me [ah] <malay>terima kasih terima kasih</malay>
[a'ah] I was like <malay>opocot aku jadi</malay> marauder I there's actually like no real function to it [ah] <malay>cuma macam</malay> bragging rights [jer]
[a'ah] so I <malay>macam</malay> [ah] my dreams
#oppa# noticed me grab ge</mandarin> grab
ya I was I was like planning <malay>kalau macam ini hari</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau aku jumpa dia</malay> I will be like grab ge</mandarin>
probably <malay>dia macam siapa</malay> then <malay>aku</malay> was like confirm <malay>tu kena</malay> instant block
you need only direct ya but
[oh] <malay>ni dia</malay> [eh] yikes
#tampines# that's why so <malay>dekat</malay>
ya actually <malay>dekat</malay> and I kind of roughly know <malay>macam tempat dia lepak</malay>
no [lah] not his but his route yes because like like <malay>kat kat tak banyak tempat yang</malay> that you can
like order food from it's always like those fast food places it's always the macs <malay>yang dekat</malay> the interchange always
every night there will be at least one from there burger king <malay>dekat</malay> the C_C
so I don't know like actually his account <malay>macam</malay> supposed to be like educational <malay>ke apa</malay> at an entertainment but it's so true I think like now I can identify like know the back models and shit in case like <malay>aku</malay> yikes
I don't know [ah] if I should be like like impressed or disturbed or what
right like all the super wholesome and educational tiktoks that you have been like sharing on your I_G I mean thank you for like getting me into
thank you for getting me into this man
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya
ya and then there's the <malay>mat minah</malay> tiktok
ya
(mm) ya ya ya ya
okay
[ah]
[oh]
is that is that the meaning of pull like can I pull you I don't know because I keep seeing it on my feed then <malay>aku macam</malay> what's this [eh] like
I <malay>macam</malay> pull <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> pull follow <malay>ke apa ke macam</malay> but it's like those thirst trap <malay>punya</malay> videos
[ah] [a'ah] [kan] I <malay>tak faham</malay>
we'll find out ya but (um)
what is it
okay but <malay>macam maksud dia tu apa</malay>
[ah] (uh huh) (uh huh)
[oh] ya my god you never respond to that when you eerie is so true [oh] my god like once you just wanna be
I I was just thinking of the <malay>mat minah</malay> call
[oh] my god you must never respond to that when you hear it
it's like (ugh) I'm one of them
[ah]
your true colours are showing your true colours are showing
(mm) same T_B_H
right
(mmhmm)
okay
boom
just <malay>macam</malay>
what
#astagfirullah#
ya correct
ya [kan]
that's the teas
yes actually how did how did you get into tiktok
<malay>macam</malay> how did you discover that app do you remember
right right
it's not a part of or to share or if you share like a an instagram post it always comes in and link right (uh) whereas for tiktok videos you can download it and you can share it on a anti a and anti social media app
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
right
social media right
native post [oh] hashtag today I learn
(mm)
ya ya because <malay>macam</malay> at the start that was what it looked like [kan] it was <malay>macam</malay> in between musically and vine
[kan]
<malay>macam</malay> there's the reputation [kan]
(mm)
technically those people must be underage <malay>juga</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
I don't know how though but
no it doesn't come too often I think that one is just <malay>macam</malay> by proximity like you know the few local
(mm)
you're talking about <malay>macam</malay> algorithm <malay>dia</malay>
sometimes you will realise you videos what have I got fifty and just kept yes doesn't vote so once once you realise just that it's video isn't as popular as between other users then it just doesn't show any
[oh]
!wow!
ya
yes
!huh!
[oh]
that's the thing which I'm god I'm very surprised because like once I post <malay>terus</malay> like it's very fast but then it like just dies off I <malay>macam</malay> okay all right
like then the subsequent <malay>macam</malay> views and stuff will be like people who are what searching for it
ya ya so this one <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>benda-benda bodoh</malay> I don't tag it I just <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know I don't put anything in the caption you know if you find me it is from the song
ever since (um) but ever since (uh) grab ge</mandarin> I privated my tiktok
wait you drunk courtesy and he's already falling
I don't I don't I don't want I don't want weirdos following me
[eh] he's already following me
so now we're friends on tiktok
I do
apparently I'm one of two people who know and I'm just like ya okay
ya so that's the thing right I was like !wow! I didn't know that tiktok <malay>ada</malay> live firstly so then like his live was the first one that I watched
actually I was like should I watch ethnic live no let me watch guide to grabfood [oh] my god
ya so it's (um) it's really interesting it's like you know how (um) I_G live [eh] no not I_G live [eh] I_G live and F_B live <malay>ada</malay> like the likes [kan] but it's just <malay>macam</malay> free [kan] you press
<malay>jadi boleh</malay> spam <malay>ke apa entah</malay> so <malay>apa ni</malay> like tiktok <malay>ada</malay> like some kind of coins system okay like for few coins you can sell like emojis
so they get I guess the creator gets like part of it but tiktok gets like a slice of how much you send
ya
ya so just like [oh] thanks you know it's like ya
ya ya ya
I don't think it's that much [lah] because like I said <malay>macam dia punya</malay> follower base is more like <malay>budak-budak kecil</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> he will he will say say like [oh] thanks for the like double like I send the rainbow puke
he was like [oh] thanks for the rainbow puke and I <malay>pun macam</malay> he's like rainbow puke is not is not cheap I mean it's not even one cup of bubble tea sweet talk <malay>sekarang pun</malay> like <malay>dah lagi mahal</malay> bro
but it tells you [lah] something so I was like okay
so like everyone is always saying stuff like [oh] come to my area come to my area he was like you send me a carousel [lah] [kan] and <malay>aku</malay> was like what is this thing he's talking about
so I went to scroll a few pages of emojis right

the person [kan] like mellow she's a good dancer but <malay>dia punya ajar dia macam</malay> like from the get go is like super detailed
<malay>macam</malay> my brain cannot
<malay>macam badan</malay> angle <malay>tangan</malay> angle
[ah] <malay>kepala</malay> angle I <malay>macam</malay> (ugh)
<malay>goyang</malay>
ya so I said I don't like I don't get the I don't get the flow for K pop I <malay>macam</malay>
ya
ya so I was just like (um)
yes and <malay>loncat-loncat</malay>
so I mean at zero point six it was okay zero point seven still can point eight (mm) I'm starting to fall apart
nine I'm not very sure what's going on I'm definitely at least two counts behind
but it was but the the first then she did the chorus in two days
so the first day (um) afro was like in the corner
then <malay>macam</malay> I felt so demoralized [ah] like it's so <malay>susah</malay> and like
so for me the thing is that like <malay>kalau</malay> stuff that is not a lindy end I don't want to use my brain so I have to use my brain after and then I get very fed up
and it doesn't bring me like joy you know that's the dissatisfaction
I think cause I'm not like a fan [kan] I just do it cause <malay>macam</malay> it looked interesting
right
so like the first day cause I will maybe I was too focused on like myself but I didn't notice the second day it was fun because I was surrounded by jokers
ya only the person in front of me was dancing correctly behind me she's she's one count behind me
so that says something
and then the ones next to her friends <malay>semua</malay> they were like [eh] today I become chicken [ah] I was like that's not wrong <malay>macam</malay> a lot of them their position I'm just like <malay>kenapa ayam kenapa ayam</malay>
!huh!
ya <malay>macam</malay> cool but okay like if that's what you vibe with
homerun
[oh] no sorry sorry the studio beat factory fitness
sorry [ah] <malay>pekak</malay>
(mmhmm) <malay>apa-apa pun pekak</malay>
[eh] <malay>lupa</malay> [ah] K <malay>jap</malay>
[dah] [lah]
okay okay I have I can explain I can explain this is my old one
(um) actually no (uh) this is the one for my games

<malay>dia punya</malay> internal <malay>kalau bukan</malay> sixteen thirty two [eh]
basically it's more [lah] then after that I download a lot of okay I did not download a lot of games I just download maplestory
and then [eh] I try to log in from outram <malay>sampai</malay> past series <malay>belum</malay> log in you
disconnect lag crash <malay>semua</malay> the whole cycle
ya ya ya [a'ah] soon
!whoa! <malay>macam</malay> no ya so then I could I could I really cannot yo~ you like besides gaming <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] like it's just super laggy [ah] <malay>macam</malay> everything keep crashing and I was getting very frustrated
and <malay>macam segala benda pun tak boleh buat pasal</malay> (err) internal memory <malay>dia dah habis</malay> [kan]
so like literally I was running on <malay>entah</malay> something <malay>macam</malay> hundred M_B of free space <malay>ke apa entah</malay>
exact~ exactly so that's why <malay>macam dia punya</malay> performance <malay>pun dah macam tahi</malay> [ah]

so I'm not sure what I should be using this for I I might use it for <malay>macam</malay> work <malay>taruh</malay> like (um) prepaid <malay>ke apa kat dalam tu</malay>
ya so then I don't need to like bother using my

no I'm asking total
okay okay sorry sorry
it's okay
slice of life is one thing that I never really got into
ya ya ya
right cause you have to be super fantastical
<malay>rasa macam</malay> escapism which I'm like [oh] <malay>macam</malay> I don't like to be too close to reality
actually I want to see I don't like it to be close to reality but my favorite #gundam# series are the ones that are closest to reality so
what do I really like
watching can see right on kids central
drama
drama
you just don't want everybody watch
(mm)
it's our like childhood in that
right
ya that's the one everybody watch
it's our like childhood
fantasy [lah] like
like you know brings us together
it was the most <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] okay okay no that's not okay I take that back after seeing things that #bandai# has released recently that's not the most <malay>merepek</malay>
but it's the most <malay>macam</malay> fantasy [lah] like super idealistic you know <malay>macam</malay> the guy must must always get the girl and then <malay>ada</malay> rival <malay>ada</malay> love triangle
that's rude ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>habis orang mati</malay> one episode the next episode everybody's over it like bitch
that's rude
ya <malay>macam</malay> [oh] and then (um) they are like super gifted and talented pilots like out of nowhere <malay>macam</malay>
that's not how it's not how this works that's not how any products
bro no
that's not how that's not how this works that's not how any of this works
because at that time [kan] that (uh) <malay>macam</malay> the way you pilot is still <malay>macam pakai macam</malay> like you driving <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] you <malay>akan pakai</malay> (um) got the <malay>apa macam</malay> clutch <malay>semua</malay> and all that pedals and stuff
it's not like so I thought that was quite smart <malay>macam</malay> the later on the #animes# [kan] they they used <malay>macam</malay> (uh) like it it goes into your brain
and stuff so much [lah] you can you can see like it's instinctual you know you don't need to control it (uh) I was gonna say extra silly physically like it just reads your nerves <malay>ke apa entah</malay> like okay sure like that's fine
like <malay>macam</malay> if you're naturally or maybe you fight a lot like in person so maybe that translates when you fight for granted like okay fine that's kind of understandable
but like <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] they are kids man like there's no way that you can just be gifted like [oh] <malay>macam</malay> drop drop from the sky <malay>gitu</malay> like <malay>merepek</malay>
ya like everybody has like a weird love hate relationship with that series
(hmm)
ya because it's (mm) it's a bit <malay>dia punya</malay> plot
actually no that that timeline the the plot was okay
there's then #gundam# got a few timelines so there's one timeline that he's like like the O_G #gundam# <malay>sampai</malay> like
and then they continue <malay>macam</malay> star wars <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] so it's like !wah! the timelines is like freaking messed up
ya
ya but that one was okay but it was <malay>macam</malay> [eh] a bit too that one a bit too fantasy [ah]
although it did start [lah] it did spur it it started my my thing for #gundam# so okay fine fine I give you that #bandai#
and then like you grow and then you watch it and you're just like what was I thinking
ya okay [lah] fun
(hmm)
ya
yes so how did it go
(hmm)
she's like tall she's so tall
(hmm)
right right
ya <malay>betul</malay>
I really hope the posters get restocked though
did you take the stuffs
!oops!
!huh!
ya
which the bracket in singapore
ya
ya
bracket in singapore [oh] okay she knows [eh]
!wow!
they're so savvy I swear I feel like I need to be on reddit but I'm just like I I don't like I don't like the format of forums
threads and stuff
(mm)
(mm)
so like you know and they have like really topics that you don't want to say like unexplained incline buttons bitcoin as long as you need to you in a here
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya that's the thing that's the thing I've I've just heard it heard about it like in terms of it being a cesspool of negativity
ya so
(mm)
ya ya ya
okay
[oh] ya ya
I've seen it on twitter yes
really weird ya
ya ya
comments [lah]
ya
ya it's always <malay>senang kalau nak cakap</malay>
because you're not in that situation <malay>apa</malay>
ya I see that a lot on twitter also <malay>macam</malay> they will like (err) retweet those those (um) am I am I am I an asshole <malay>punya</malay> post
and then <malay>dia orang</malay> just like throw the whole man away [lah] <malay>apa</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like ya like <malay>macam</malay>
I guess you can write that way but <malay>macam</malay> think about how that person is like going through right
correct ya ya
ya
sassy [ah]
ya
ya
but ya actually I asked (uh) #najhah# about it like how many episodes is it actually it's not that many [eh]
ya <malay>macam kau</malay> they only they only have one season so it's like twelve or something <malay>aku rasa</malay>
maybe at most twenty plus [lah] but that's what I was very confused because the way people talk about it right is is as though it's already reached the same level as much as #naruto# and all that with like five hundred and two seasons [eh] three seasons [eh] in all that kind of
then <malay>macam</malay> !huh! okay <malay>itu</malay> [jer] like ya that's what I was thinking [oh] actually <malay>kalau</malay> I wanted to catch up session quite easy
so that ya but the craze my god
that's that's the awkward thing because actually like I said just now the japanese narrative is P_G twelve
and like the singapore people don't even bo~ the singapore <malay>punya</malay> what I_M_D or something they don't even bother to like remove it like
cause it's in the credits ya so it's like ya
society knows
ya but that's the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I_M_D
I guess ya [lor] like like that suicide and like like depictions of god and stuff I don't know
but <malay>macam</malay> it's very like we we call it like what #anime# typical [lah] canon typical violence
there's the tag they real put one canon typical violence
why about okay okay but you know I didn't realise how important do you think so when I watch this that's called a spy movie kind of question which are because of the area
ya
so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>entah</malay> [leh]
but our censorship <malay>selalu macam tu</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
ya
jesse
<malay>kau rembat</malay> [jer]
me and my western pop culture
<malay>kekek</malay> [jer] [sia]
ya
ya like [ho] <malay>kita</malay> cool
cools
[kan] <malay>kita dah besar</malay>
in this show in full !wow! really
I mean I don't
I have so many replies but I'll just I'll just keep it to myself
serious [ah] a full frontal is an eighteen [jer]
okay okay
okay
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean it's different when you own it
#yikes#
how did #shah# react
so I was like [oh]
I mean it's different when you own it
[oh] my goodness
#yikes#
[oh] my goodness somehow I'm very surprised okay
you're prepared
but usually they will put actually okay no actually that one was for like D_V_D's and stuff right they will put like <malay>macam</malay> N_C sixteen then I said they will put the the like triggers <malay>kat bawah macam</malay>
ya nudity
ya
ya
it's like ya
and then it's like !whoa! full frontal !wow!
what
okay [lah] at least you were like considered legal
[oh] ya that's true
it sound so weird but <malay>macam</malay>
like in the science textbook they always show you <malay>macam</malay>
so you never actually knew how it looks like
exactly [lah] it supposed to be a little like #teng# #teng# #teng# I mean
[oh] yikes
it scarred you
!alah! <malay>benda tu macam benda biasa</malay> [jer] <malay>bagi dia</malay>
you know it brings me back to that convo that we had about <malay>macam</malay> like
and is it okay but I think it's really like <malay>macam</malay> commendable [lah] that you are like now taking on the responsibility even though it's like shit but <malay>macam</malay>
it's nice to know like someone cares for you like someone's looking out for you
I mean I know you might not feel like it because it feels like
ya
ya ya correct
ya let her it's not about like a restrictive right
ya exactly
(um)
<malay>kenapa</malay>
[oh]
wait <malay>kejap dia</malay> interested <malay>ke dia macam</malay> intrigued
okay okay
[ah]
ya ya ya
it's true though
I wonder like how many of my stupid decisions can be attributed to like
the strange perceptions that I had of like relationships (hmm)
it's just like <malay>macam</malay> thinking about it
(mm)
ya
it's so weird that when we say younger is now like sixteen seventeen but time <malay>tu kita rasa kita macam dah besar</malay>

[oh] my god ya

when I <malay>jumpa</malay> that my malaysian friend I was like !duh!

ya I think movie also can so should be okay
[oh] movie <malay>apa</malay>
okay
why it is sad like
wait like <malay>buta</malay> like like how <malay>buta hati atau</malay> like you know
like [ah] okay
[oh]
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like <malay>kenapa dia buta</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh</malay> then after that
[ah]
wait <malay>tapi</malay> the guy know <malay>yang</malay> like like
the guy is <malay>dia apa tu yang punca yang</malay> the girl <malay>punya</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[ah] [oh]
!wah!
but then how [ah] like
<malay>lelaki tu</malay> !wah!
ya
why so weird
<malay>memang macam</malay> like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya [lah] but like <malay>macam</malay> it's so coincidental you know like <malay>macam</malay> the girl <malay>dengan</malay> the guy is like
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
[oh]
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>kedai</malay> ya
what
but <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think <malay>kena tengok</malay> right
but that's really your favourite movie
your <malay>abang</malay> is my <malay>adik</malay>
!wah!
(err)
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show [oh] then [ah] my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
I think it's kind of <malay>takde lagi</malay> is it
<malay>pasal dia</malay> ya <malay>dia orang dah</malay> remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like <malay>perempuan</malay> you know like the girls and then like [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> like when I watch it I was like [oh] my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know (uh) <malay>macam baca buku</malay> all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
(um) they suddenly
(um)
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he I think <malay>dia orang ada</malay> like <malay>sepuluh</malay> seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that <malay>lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>tiga puluh lebih</malay> and until like
all of them I think almost all of them get married
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you <malay>tengok</malay> like <malay>macam dia orang</malay> like grow to become like a better person
so <malay>macam</malay> damn cool because I also because like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam banyak orang ingatkan</malay> like <malay>orang yang suka</malay> science <malay>semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil</malay> like very awkward right like they feel like they <malay>macam</malay> cannot fit into the society
ya
socially less awkward and also because like <malay>macam</malay> if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
[kan] like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
because like I remember one episode [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy <malay>nama</malay> sheldon
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young [lah] so the thing is like he's (err) like professor in this like
school like not really a professor [lah] by research scientists and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like (um) <malay>banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh</malay> fit in
but then over the years <malay>apa dia dia dia cuba</malay> like fit in to like parties <malay>macam</malay> because <malay>ada seorang perempuan</malay> popular <malay>ni</malay> neighbour <malay>dia</malay>
[kan] and then like (um) <malay>dia</malay> like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they will they will feeling very awkward because <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> like <malay>cuba</malay> to interact with like the rest
ya <malay>dia orang semua ingatkan dia</malay> weird <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>dia datang pun</malay> like <malay>dengan baju tak senonoh</malay>
until the party and cannot fit in [lah] but then <malay>lepas tu</malay> then he realise that [oh] my god
like (um) over the years [kan] they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like [ah] people who are like basically like
<malay>apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok</malay> show <malay>ni daripada kecil</malay> call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing [lah] because like <malay>dia dia dia pun</malay> like was single all the way then <malay>lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan</malay> [ah] <malay>kahwin</malay> then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then <malay>tak</malay> he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> to like
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met [ah] through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise <malay>betul tak</malay> like he cannot like
(um) you know like straightaway
like realise [eh] tomorrow you gonna get married this person
ya so they actually show us <malay>yang macam</malay> love
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
<malay>terus</malay> jump to it
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> carry <malay>macam</malay> opposite of each other
ya so <malay>dia orang</malay> cuddle cuddle <malay>dia macam</malay> like [eh] let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy <malay>macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu</malay> then like
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world [lor]
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing [lah] that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool [kan] I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker [lah] don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
[oh] because you <malay>pakai</malay> like all the <malay>duit</malay> birthday for all this
[oh]
[oh] ya you told me [what]
[oh] ya ya the cafe thing then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
I know you said you show me the photos [mah] and then <malay>macam</malay> it's damn nice [what]
[oh]
!wah!
#oma# spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
no [lah] but waffle [kan] <malay>macam murah takkan</malay> they will charge you [lah]
okay but #haji# lane is overpriced <malay>sebab tu</malay> [lah] you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually <malay>murah</malay> ya but it's at where somerset
farrer park ya but the thing is
that means like <malay>macam kalau</malay> they are not like at the central area of singapore [kan] it's usually cheaper
very circular
ya [lah] that's why it's cheaper [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if it if it's at town right confirm <malay>mahal</malay>
actually ya
(uh huh)
what no [lah] but <malay>tu untuk buka</malay> like cafe in singapore quite
like tough [what]
so you become like <malay>ibu</malay>
but you know
design the place itself [kan] <malay>macam</malay> they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
ya but it's not
it's not it's very <malay>mahal</malay> and like ya
it's like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we it's like our like previous <malay>kedai</malay> [lor]
ya it's like you need to know <malay>makanan apa sedap</malay> and then like sometimes [kan] you hire the chef and the <malay>dia tak tahu masak</malay>
ya
no but actually <malay>makanan tak sedap pun tak apa</malay> [tau] cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like <malay>macam</malay> it's cool [lah] like
you know like your <malay>makanan</malay> K cause your <malay>makanan tak sedap</malay> [kan] at least your coffee <malay>sedap</malay> or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
[eh]
ya
maybe you are just like picky
ya ya [lah] you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee <malay>macam tak ada gula</malay>
ya like <malay>takde gula</malay> is like totally fine with me ya
tea without sugar can but coffee [oh] because of the bitterness [kan]
it's just weird
K [lah] okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
actually I want to ask you [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts (um) if you have like <malay>tiga</malay> like wish that you wanna wanna
you can fulfil [lah] okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
ya like okay like <malay>kalau tak ada macam</malay> K if like there's no boundaries because you know like <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya re~ re~ resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so (um) out of these three [kan] like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay [lah] have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
#lee kuan yew# no [ah] is it you can be rich I can't remember
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like [oh] I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like [kan] like <malay>duit apa tu apa tu</malay> it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar [kan] <malay>tak</malay> fun
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know [what]
what
okay I think that's a bit far [oh]
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
cause like I feel like I'm <malay>macam sangat</malay> lost
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
(mmhmm)
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
there's too many like <malay>macam</malay> like direction that you can go like because you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you stay in malaysia then like ya <malay>tak banyak</malay> ya like I think you will only get like
like [kan] <malay>siapa</malay> like most people will go either retail and then like or office world [lah] because in singapore we <malay>kita kita</malay> believe in like equality right
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries [lah] our neighbouring countries [lah]
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries [lah] if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore [ah] no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
so that's why I like I like the so for me <malay>macam</malay> like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working [kan] like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
like you know
even though I know it pays well like <malay>gaji besar</malay> but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's <malay>penat</malay> and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun [kan]
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay [lah] maybe you <malay>kalau</malay> you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start <malay>macam betul susah</malay>
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case [lah]
ya <malay>bukan</malay> like the
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot [lah] hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national rail~ railway railway is [eh] you know the train [one]
[oh] my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay [lah] (um)
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
ya cause you know like if you go #jakarta# like I don't know you wait did go #batam# ya you went #batam# before right and you know like <malay>macam</malay> some places are very crowded then you know they don't care [one] ya
no but maybe maybe because like
they do though because that time I went national gallery then <malay>dia orang semua duduk dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang semua</malay> loiter <malay>dekat</malay> you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then <malay>kena pekik</malay> [sia] they were like !oi! is you new like why
what you doing there !huh! (uh) you never read the sign is it
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend [lah] then I was like [oh] my god what's this maid doing [ah]
[eh] ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like [oh] my god
like [ah] like the maid was shocked [lah] when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya I <malay>tak kisah</malay> so I just like walk away and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
ya because it's okay [lah] but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
<malay>tapi</malay> like
(um) you need to
like you can achieve now [lah] I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy [lah] to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
you are just lucky cause like in singapore <malay>macam</malay> even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
!huh!
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and (uh) cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia [ah] and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya [lah] but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave P_S_E_A account
post secondary [ah]
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya so we all ya I think singapore <malay>bagi kita</malay> like money to like spend for all these trips [sia] so I think it's like I think that's a good thing [eh]
ya
so can use that
(err) if it there's one country my wish list [lah]
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young [lah] I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like #naruto# like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing [lah] last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly #naruto# come in ya po~ [ah] pokemon all this you know and then I was like
[oh] my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
!wah!
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
<malay>dia</malay> sounds like internship [kan] then I was like !wah!
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like #osaka# #kyoto# #tokyo#
and I when #nara# I went like #kanazawa# then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no [lah] I went with my friend but I went (um) I think I went #hiroshima# alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter [eh] wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing [lor]
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like #tokyo# and #osaka# they rarely snow I think
#tokyo# ya #tokyo# rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
[oh] you didn't know I went korea [oh] my god
I showed you ya
[oh] my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the comp~
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only [ah] it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have [ah] thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no [lah] I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
#wei# you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
ya <malay>macam</malay> like people from korea guam that's why
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition [mah]
ya
no [lah] (um) I think K because
<malay>macam</malay> like <malay>banyak orang</malay> that like
most of them [lah] actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so (uh) it's their first language [lah] english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
(um) you know the #seoul# tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya #wei# you didn't know I went all these !wah! it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also [lah] that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper [what]
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in #temasek# my microsoft
korea bought my bags [mah]
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business <malay>macam</malay> it's easy to
okay [lah] it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like <malay>macam</malay> I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
ya
[oh] you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
!huh!
you should go with <malay>afal adik</malay>
I feel like going with your friend [kan]
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went #batam# with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like [oh] no I cannot eat it's [oh] no like this place is
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know <malay>macam tempat</malay>
<malay>tak bersih sangat</malay> [lah] also it's okay ya ya they don't care [one]

if you are not paying for that full package you know you are paying like twenty dollars for that you know
no I guess not I think
[oh] ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage [lah]
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment (err) one star price then I was like
!alamak! why you like that
and then (um)
then then I was like
ya then okay

I like beef boat noodles
[oh] ya we've been to thailand also

ya
I also never tried before
no but you have to know that they are old

okay so
ya
K K K
then last okay okay it's like [oh] my god it's almost like one hour [eh] K maybe okay we ask one last question K one last question time to sleep
ya
but okay okay let's let me think of a good question to ask (mm)
if you were born rich okay if you were born rich singapore
then okay what question you wanna ask do you have any question you wanna ask
ya
what that's so random
no [ah] we're talking [what]
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail [what] if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting [lah]
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other [kan]
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
like <malay>selamat datang ke</malay> podcast <malay>saya</malay>
ya but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> like podcast [kan] <malay>ada</malay>
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between [kan] ya
(mmhmm)
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a #suria# actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
(mmhmm)

hey #nurul#
<malay>apa khabar</malay>
thanks for coming here
ya I want to know right (mm)
what is your ideal vacation like
[oh] for me [kan] I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here <malay>jadi kalau</malay> you like told off what if <malay>sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup</malay> then like <malay>kita dah jauh perjalanan</malay> [kan] <malay>telah tutup</malay> so like
ya [lah] for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I <malay>ada orang suka bunuh</malay> very curious about <malay>bunuh</malay> [ah] and then I also like to <malay>tengok pokok</malay>
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window [eh] <malay>hari ini ada pokok</malay> this colour [eh] <malay>hari ini ada salji</malay> [eh] <malay>hari ini ada</malay> and then like <malay>tapi kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>fikir macam</malay> like
[eh] then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting [ah] like (err) summer <malay>panas</malay> so like the material <malay>lain</malay> and then winter <malay>sejuk</malay> and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about [orh] the money
and then also like the <malay>rumah</malay> like
(um) we have to have heated floors <malay>ke</malay> heated <malay>jamban atau katil ke</malay>
<malay>lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil</malay> [kan] <malay>bila kita tidur</malay> like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about [oh] so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
this small staff [lah] these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya [oh] (mm) so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
so <malay>untuk saya untuk saya</malay> ya <malay>untuk</malay> for me right I want to bring them to
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because (uh)
it's to me it's one of a kind [ah] and then like (uh) so many different
flower species and then can can exist all in one place <malay>habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada</malay> four seasons every country not [ah] countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since <malay>kita takde</malay> four seasons <malay>kita boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> gardens by the bay [kan] to look at the different flowers and also different (uh) month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
see experience all the different species in one area [lah] in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the #kampung glam# area
ya about the old school stuff like (uh) sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
family is it poor family happy family [ah] sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like !wow! so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like (err) last time it was easy to get right <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> like
<malay>mana</malay> [eh] <malay>nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda</malay> modern so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>pun fikir</malay> [lah] like !wah! how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also <malay>macam</malay> not so complicated and then also about games
(um) <malay>nanti kalau</malay> like if you bring tourists over to play games <malay>kalau kita tak berbual</malay> the same <malay>bahasa pun takpe</malay> because you know you just <malay>gitu gitu gini gini</malay> then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya [oh] ya and I want to know (mm) which genre of drama or T_V show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like (err)
drama like between people I mean I prefer (uh) movies [lah] because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch T_V series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed [lah] I also like reality (uh) so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like !wow! so this can happen in real life [ah] then like because like <malay>macam</malay> I'm quite curious [lah] on like
people story <malay>tapi takkan macam</malay> I <malay>nak keluar habis tanya orang</malay> [eh] <malay>jadi macam mana</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>jalan hidup</malay> without being so #kaypoh# about it
and then like after that (uh)
(um) [oh] there are some reality T_V shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality T_V show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like <malay>tengok dia orang macam</malay> like kitchen nightmare <malay>dia punya</malay>
[ah] chef of the restaurant then <malay>dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak</malay> gordon ramsay <malay>pun bantu dia punya</malay> restaurant <malay>kasi betul</malay> this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so <malay>macam</malay> (err)
naive and like [oh] or <malay>tapi</malay> (uh)
<malay>muka dia macam gini mesti orang dia macam gini juga</malay>
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so <malay>macam senang nak percaya</malay> and then <malay>tapi</malay> like when I watch this also I can feel sad [lah] because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and <malay>macam</malay> they cannot <malay>dapat</malay> that connection <malay>dalam</malay> real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing <malay>macam</malay> have you experienced something like that or like
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun [oh] then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
for me my favourite movie <malay>banyak juga</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> <malay>ada satu jadi ada satu</malay> movie <malay>ni yang</malay> I <malay>suka</malay>
(uh) it's called #kahani# ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that (um)
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch T_V series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so (err) ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
<malay>macam</malay> my <malay>kat</malay> my handphone <malay>kat tepi jadi</malay> I <malay>tengah buka</malay> my computer <malay>jadi tangan tu</malay> I took out a keyboard my <malay>kepala</malay> facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
<malay>tengok</malay> I <malay>tu tengah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>bekerja ni</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata</malay> I <malay>tu tengah tengok</malay> bollywood <malay>kat tepi tu</malay>
and like <malay>cerita</malay> bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
yes
I think (uh) also the thing about watching this (uh) a lot of times with different people right it makes me (uh) find out more about (err) the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like <malay>dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang akan</malay> pick up different things that you didn't see
ya so like [eh] I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
picked up in this movie so I think <malay>macam gitu</malay> it's quite cool to like <malay>tengok</malay> (err) with <malay>lain orang</malay> [ah] to see <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay> perspective <malay>tu semua</malay> ya and then like (um)
[oh] what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
(mm)
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch (um)
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like (uh) this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like !wah! damn cool [leh] <malay>macam macam</malay> and then like
(mm) I <malay>pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini</malay> so it's actually <malay>dari sana</malay> [lah] <malay>tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya</malay> ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive [lah] it's like
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important [lah] so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also <malay>macam</malay> quite interesting
ya so very cool cartoons [lah] and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first (uh)
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dengar</malay> soundtrack
(um)
sometimes when I watch movies also <malay>lepas saya tengok</malay> movie <malay>tu</malay> I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know (uh) how the song sound like all that ya what what
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
[orh] ya [lah] soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like [oh] he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the [ah] every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
<malay>bercinta</malay>
[oh] I like this question because I like wishes
(uh)
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes <malay>kerana saya seorang yang tamak</malay>
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace <malay>jadi pasal</malay> (err)
<malay>lebih ramai</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati</malay> #blah# #blah# #blah# and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
[oh] not a lot of people will say food why why why food
(mm)
unusual superpowers !wah! I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like <malay>masuk dalam</malay> and I <malay>pakai baju</malay> and I <malay>tengok cantik ke tak</malay> [eh] and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park !wow! I don't have to queue [eh]
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya [lah] that's that's what I want to
do wanna be invisible because <malay>macam</malay> quite
(uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> freeing [lah] ya freeing then (err) nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so [kan] I can <malay>beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa</malay> I [kan] <malay>pasal tak nampak pun</malay> ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think (uh) the reading about minds one sometimes (uh) I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is (um)
actually why one thing [ah] why cannot be many things I say education ya
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] <malay>satu tahun lima puluh ribu</malay> so you imagine <malay>kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu</malay> (uh)
(err) <malay>ribu puluh ribu kali tiga</malay> it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
<malay>yang tu caranya</malay> a lot of money so then and then (uh) I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like (uh) I remember (uh)
<malay>saudara</malay> where they had to lay <malay>antara dapat duit</malay> bursary <malay>atau budak tu</malay> move on to a better education so <malay>kalau budak tu dapat duit</malay> bursary <malay>maknanya dia kena</malay> stay in
(uh) not so not the best education <malay>untuk dia</malay> and then if that that <malay>budak</malay> goes on to (uh) a better education he might not get
(uh) the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education <malay>macam</malay> it helps to break poverty cycles [lah]
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they [ah] have to choose between these two and both are important right [ah] <malay>yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran</malay> ya [oh] ya another thing actually very important (uh)
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay <malay>kita pergi dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> petrol station <malay>nak pergi</malay> toilet <malay>nak pergi</malay> toilet <malay>tak kat</malay> [ah]
[ah] petrol station <malay>dia nampak tak dia punya jamban</malay> so many different
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
[oh] if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
okay so my friends and I <malay>kita selalu berbual</malay> how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five <malay>habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat</malay> and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies <malay>tapi kita tetap</malay> couldn't <malay>kerja</malay> because <malay>kita perlukan duit</malay> right
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that (uh) people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
[oh] ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right <malay>macam</malay> people <malay>ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja</malay> like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening (err) she has made a lot of friends [eh] from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so <malay>kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya</malay>
[eh] <malay>awak sini berkebun</malay> [eh] then they ask her [eh] can I join or not like
[eh] then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like [oh] it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
!wah! so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun [lah]
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like !wah! how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
for me my hobbies has always been arts [lah] I really like arts whether it's like <malay>macam</malay> music <malay>atau</malay>
makeup eye makeup <malay>lukis ke apa</malay> [kan] it's very fun and like (uh) I think about hobbies
say if I were to play like music or like (uh) art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true [oh] then I wanna ask (um)
see like (uh) what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right <malay>jadi apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> favourite <malay>lagu</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa-apa</malay> genre [lah]
(mm)
think for me (mm)
<malay>kalau lagu melayu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagu melayu</malay> I <malay>ingat macam</malay> more
to <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff [lah] I think my <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
<malay>mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam</malay> memory [lah] <malay>dia nak simpan</malay> memory <malay>tu dia tak nak lupakan</malay> (uh) actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
four episodes ya and then (err) the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs [lah] and it's also by an artist that I really like (uh) actually last year the <malay>dia ada datang</malay> singer last year maybe last year <malay>atau dua tahun lepas dia datang</malay> singapore <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak tak pergi</malay> !alamak!
what about like live music (err) <malay>pernah ada pergi tak dengan</malay> experience <malay>ke tak</malay> live music
to this place
for me I really love concerts [leh] like it's too bad [lah] this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
(uh) then like (mm)
for me [kan] my (uh)
concert <malay>yang macam paling</malay> memorable <malay>tu dengan</malay> my sister <malay>juga</malay> [ah] <malay>ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok</malay> coldplay [oh] actually an interesting thing about this was (uh)
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right <malay>jadi dia orang nak jual</malay> at
a higher price
ya [lah] so like for me (uh)
as a frequent concert goer [kan] you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that [oh] my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable [lah] <malay>tapi dia punya bila</malay> part <malay>beli tiket itu pun</malay> memorable but in a <malay>sedih punya</malay> memory ya
[oh] ya I (mm) what about <malay>macam</malay> (mm) <malay>ni punya</malay> fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
think for me my fashion style I always like to (uh) dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then (uh) if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and (err) I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>setiap orang</malay> [kan] <malay>ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia</malay> I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you (uh) ya do you believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me [kan] (uh)
<malay>apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik</malay> [eh]
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this <malay>ciri-ciri jadi</malay> I <malay>suka orang ni</malay> [lah]
so like (err) personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
<malay>pelik</malay> ya
ya what is it
I think this [one] [eh] your hardest question [eh] how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish (mm) how can I don't know about dish [lah] but I think right for I [kan] you know my <malay>mesti</malay> I <malay>pilih</malay> okay <malay>antara</malay> syrup <malay>limau atau teh</malay> O <malay>ais limau</malay>
ya I think (uh) like <malay>teh</malay> O ice also I mean you can <malay>minum panas</malay> it stays great and then you can <malay>minum sejuk</malay> it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup <malay>limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>mungkin ada tapi</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> ya and [oh] so (um)
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like (um) say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me (uh) just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
[oh] I was thinking
(mm) korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
(err) <malay>apa ni kat</malay> airport <malay>tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan</malay> my <malay>makan tengah hari pun</malay>
<malay>sikit</malay> [jer] I think maybe just (err) what do they eat #japchae# [ah] #japchae# I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate #japchae# #japchae# is noodle ya ya
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
very big [ah] so I if I were to reach there I calculate [lah] like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the <malay>kedai tutup</malay> then <malay>mesti lapar</malay> [kan] so I remember I I I only bought <malay>kacang</malay>
<malay>kacang makan</malay>
<malay>habis tu</malay> I only ate in taiwan
!chey! cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane [lah] so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as (uh) language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around

evolve after that then probably like be a P_E teacher
yes dreams of course I'm old we're old man we have to need to
what do you expect
I I ran around (err)
(um) the secondary school area here
ya just like
few rounds [lah]
and then I exercise a bit at the fitness corner I mean it's important to keep yourself healthy you know (um) okay badminton once in a while
you know
nowadays
food
a lot of
process food
and then like you won't get to like
burn the
chemical a lot [lah] then end up getting cancer and all that
this important [lah]
wh~ what was this though the badminton
[ah]
ya
!whoa! I didn't know that
!wow! what
how is that possible
!wow!
!wow!
okay [lah] I mean it's not that tiring
if you know how to might manage your time <malay>macam</malay> okay one day badminton then one day
<malay>gini</malay> but evolve is just
something I wanna do
two to three years down the road
then I can take like
until like
from there or something
ya
ya it's important it's important to have smart goals you know
what do you mean
I usually run (um) <malay>macam</malay> about
five to four days a week [ah]
so
kind of everyday but just like weekends <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> rest <malay>penat sangat</malay> [kan]
and I'm so taking my part time degree so
quite tiring
so whenever I've
when school starts then whenever I've
free time then I try my best to run [lah]
and
(uh) and
you know my job
like
they
under
they will
I mean this field is quite underpaid [lah] so I'm trying to find jobs that I can you know
like
secure myself financially
(um)
maybe
two K two K plus <malay>pun jadi</malay> [seh]
yours also I heard it's not two K right
(mmhmm)
the internet also they want experience as I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find a starting job to get all these experiences in a good company
that's true like singaporean nowadays they have this kind of problem I mean foreigners you know <malay>dekat</malay> (um)
I mean it's it's common [lah]
but
everywhere now you go like you need experience and this you know
for people like us
<malay>kasi</malay> [lah] you know chance <malay>sikit</malay> [kan] <malay>tutup mata satu</malay> [kan] and just [orh] come
without any experiences in training will be provided [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> [pe] and
training <malay>apa</malay> internship they don't even pay much so you still expect us to have experiences that this a bit too much [ah] honestly
but I hope I hope you do find you know job that you can be you know
stable financially you know support your parents you know that
honestly
super hard you like
about hundred percent ten per cent [jer] companies who does that
like they
they don't appreciate you they
once you do something bad
it tarnishes your whole reputation
everything your hard work all gone
[kan] <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> company <malay>yang</malay> you know really
focuses on your
[ah] employees welfare
you know and job progression is super important
job progression
yes sure
!wow!
that's unfair
how old is she
she's two years younger and she's the head of your
team
!wah! that's a bit unfair
[orh] it's this happens a lot you know politics in the company and
I mean there are no
chances that
the moment you change companies I mean change jobs
it's gonna be perfect you still gonna face this kind of
issues you know work life issues and
I don't know [lah] this life that's
that sucks but
it's important nowadays that
company
you know take into account
I mean that's why
(um)
M_O_M exist
ya so and anything complain [jer]
ya with no power to change
nothing no control over
you know this kind of things
you know
I am a student care teacher
(err) basically I just supervise the kids [lah]
(um) you know
make sure ensure
their safety is well taken care of hygiene
and you know we're
make sure they stick to their routine
like <malay>baca buku</malay> about homework
and then mark their assessment books
but the funny thing is
my boss said that
(um)
they're not academically inclined
but
when the kid
read books
at certain timing
they get scolded
because their assessment books are
incomplete
so like you're contradicting yourself <malay>macam apa apa kau nak dari budak-budak ni</malay>
like you say you want them to rest you just focus on discipline <malay>macam tak kisah dorang buat apa</malay> but then
a moment later you're there changing the
there was [oh] <malay>kena buat</malay> assessments [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah]
that kind of thing so I'm a bit confused <malay>yang budak-budak ni kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>dah balik sekolah penat</malay>
<malay>satu hari dah belajar abeh balik</malay>
the student care and
when you
eat also you wanna talk
you can't
talk at all you <malay>masuk bilik</malay>
start <malay>belajar</malay>
homework
and <malay>tak boleh baca buku</malay>
<malay>sampai habis</malay> assessment book
like
ya
exactly
student care
care
for a reason right need to care
for their well-being <malay>macam</malay> okay I get it you care for their well-being you feed them
you you know you them <malay>macam</malay> shelter but
okay [lah] <malay>kalau makan pun takkan tak boleh berbual abeh terus pergi minum air pastu</malay>
<malay>masuk belajar</malay>
<malay>nak keluar lepas tu nak keluar minum air pun tak boleh</malay> [tau]
and because you drink water already just now so like you have to stay in the room for an hour without drink water without any toilet breaks
yup and you do homework
<malay>kalau</malay> rest <malay>pun</malay> ten minute
and there's no nap time
they know the the funny thing is they know the timetable
and they know what they have been doing
but
I know right my company the withdrawal rate is quite high [ah] maybe because of that you know kids complain <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>penat</malay> you know I don't want to go student care anymore
torturing so
a lot of people
quitting [lah] actually like one month <malay>macam</malay> about seven
a lot
that's the thing
ya and I can't even laugh with them
I can't even
talk to them
I need to scold every time they can't even will sit <malay>macam</malay> you know sit like
like
l~
they fold their legs fold <malay>pun tak boleh</malay>
yes they have to sit <malay>macam</malay> you know upright sit properly
in all the time
that's the thing you just imagine yourself in student care
can you imagine
I mean like no one to control you and all that you just do your own things your parents don't force it upon you I mean we do get guidance
but it's more of a freedom of choice
we were allowed to make
choices
and now we become adults
who knows how to make
you know our own choices <malay>macam budak-budak ni</malay> like <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>semua benda kena</malay>
spoon feed around and then like they grow up becoming like
okay what do I do now
was that a routine no
you know that kind of thing
okay [lah] I mean like this generation is different from back then
okay how about your job scope
I wanna know
it's okay just tell me
[oh] ya I did [oh] my god I miss her so much (um)
her wedding okay she just move out recently
and [ah] I met man the house so so empty

I mean get your own space get your own time get to talk to me
okay [lah] take your time take your time
ya that's true
you know
life has no template they say
you know
there's no schedule so
go with the flow
[oh] I love that
I need to write that's
a perfect quote
(um) me and my family okay
I don't know [eh] I mean like I'm so used to being the second child
and like you know there no responsibilities we still have [eh] have fun and enjoy and when then now that
my older sister is gone
like
they're relying on me
so
I I think I have to be the bigger person right now but I'm still coping cause I don't know how
I don't know I'm really I'm lost
but
okay [lah] slowly slowly maybe I get to learn stuff
but I'm still at a stage whereby
I focus on myself a lot
and I'm scared that
you know I might
I might
lose
the responsibility
<malay>macam</malay> like I don't know I I will learn from it [lah]
I mean like
how about that okay
give me some tips
since you are the older child
[oh] man
I saw this post and they said that (um)
the first child
<malay>macam</malay> they will get like a set of rules
and then and gradually the second third child right it
it kind of
(um) ya pass off so
<malay>macam</malay> it's kind of unfair
but at the same time you you are nurtured
(um)
how to say not perfect but then
better better than the second and
third [lah]
so that's why like I'm lost right now but then you are eld~ the eldest we're like okay okay I get this right I get that right
so ya [lah] are the pros and cons
but
I I hope you know your brothers you know we learn from you you know as a role model because I look up to you also
cringe
(mm)
that's true
that's true
and no wonder I'm friends with you
(um) okay talking about sweet right
I scared [leh] I scared of diabetes
<malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] okay you know like they say <malay>macam</malay> when you
(um)
when you buy <malay>buang air kecil</malay> [kan] then like there's ends
then like
then like
there is signs of you
that get
like
how to say <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada kencing manis gitu</malay>
in my family <malay>punya</malay> history
<malay>ada</malay> okay my my dad is a diabetic patient
my my grandma is both sides grandma my
my grandpa <malay>macam semua ada</malay> this history of
diabetic
don't you <malay>takut</malay> [seh] say like you know I'm young and you know I love peach tea I love you know
his deserts you
<malay>takut</malay> [lah] I mean like I have to take care of my diet [lah]
of course
but
have you heard of it the
ants
[oh] my
I'm sorry
the heart the sugar intake is quite high [lah]
but
okay the thing I am confused about right
like
they say it's not the sugar but it's actually the carbo
because it's
okay like okay
basically if you are
diabetic right you have to eat low G_I food
glycemic index
glycemic index and high glycemic index comes from rice
white rice
so I am like [oh] okay <malay>jap</malay> white bread is high
white rice high okay where is the sugar that's that's the thing people get confused about sugar or
carbs
and then I I went to research about it
actually it's true
like
rice is the cause of it
and you know like
things that are that are easily processed
but you if you eat whole grain
is lower
lower G_I so that you
okay <malay>macam</malay>
the sugar tends to break down slower so that
insulin <malay>tak pakai banyak</malay> even insulin is working perfectly
to combat the sugar
except for white rice and
(mm)
then you think we are malays is in we eat
okay like
rice is a staple food for us
that's the thing <malay>kuah lemak apa</malay> [ah] cholesterol [oh] my god okay there's so much things we have to take care of
I mean I don't mind eating salad
but
the options
<malay>dekat kedai ada ke jual</malay> salad like hawker centre
I mean you can get back that at subway at what eight dollars for salad
we we can buy that for what one dollar than the sauce <malay>kita beli</malay> like ten dollar but then
<malay>pakai tu</malay>
you save so much
that's true <malay>beli</malay> like <malay>banyak</malay> then after that <malay>simpan</malay> in the fridge
<malay>abeh busuk</malay>

is quite hard
to live you know perfectly balanced life nutrition <malay>nak</malay> physically active [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> busy [lah] <malay>dengan kerja</malay>
ya that's true
I mean I've seen a lot of people you know having hard time coping that's why you know peop~ like nu~
nutritionist exist to <malay>macam</malay> lead them
<malay>itu semua pakai duit</malay> [seh] do it see I mean like everything revolves around money nowadays

that's true and parents nowadays also working <malay>abeh balik dah tidur</malay> you know that kind of thing
and ya [lah] it's hard but then that images via weekends are always important you know for us to like you have fam~ quality family time but nowadays youngsters weekend <malay>gi mana</malay>
we <malay>lepak dengan kawan</malay> but I mean it's not wrong but okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> balance [lah] okay one day with your parents one day [oh] I've heard of this story before <malay>satu</malay> okay there's this one (um) student right
<malay>dia punya</malay>
(um) <malay>makcik tinggalkan</malay>
her
grandfather
[ah] abandoned him <malay>dekat</malay> bus stop <malay>dekat</malay> malaysia
and then drove back home
and left him there
<malay>balik rumah dia</malay>
malaysia [lah]
singapore
[ah] <malay>dia tinggalkan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia letak</malay> bag <malay>suruh orang lain jaga tak tahu siapa</malay> [ah]
intention
yes they don't want to take responsibility for him
and then (um) they receive a phone call from the dad (um) the dad call another [lah] his son [lah] another son
<malay>cakap</malay> (um) <malay>bapa nak balik</malay> you know that kind of thing and the son also <malay>tak cari bapa dia</malay> for one month
then went there
and <malay>nampak bapa dia dekat</malay> old folks home
and he said the father said okay me home [lah] then then they say like [oh] it's okay we come next week
again because it's late
they went back
and their father pass away
the father say it's okay I can live in your store room also
the father pass away
ya that's true <malay>macam</malay> you know
maybe the financially <malay>dorang tak boleh</malay> handle the debt
or just maybe tired you know nowadays <malay>banyak macam</malay> drama drama you know
typical but I didn't know you know this kind of thing exist in real life I always watch it in T_V <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ni ya allah tak baik</malay> [seh]
but ya it does exist
and you know the kid is traumatised because of what's happening you know this kind of thing all affect
the the kids ya
trau~ the kids now the kids <malay>ada sekarang</malay> trauma issues
you know
that's true that's true
I mean like
you wouldn't realise that you actually following your parents but then because if they watching it all your life and is this rooted in you
you know and
there's such thing called karma
so you treat your parents like that your your son your daughters gonna treat same thing same way you treat your parents so ya that's why I'm scared I really had to take care of my parents not because it's not just because of karma
ya [lah] they've taken care of me well <malay>apa kecil-kecil kasi makan</malay> this a way for us to repay back
that's true <malay>macam</malay> it it
safety is vector
but it's actually quite good [leh]
because
(um) doing this kind of thing it helps her reduce the dementia <malay>punya</malay> chances
of (um)
you know
the occurring the occurrence of
dementia
so [ah]
how old is she now
but the around
(oo)
I think more the the the the over sixty five [lah]
definition of
(um) <malay>lepak</malay> or re~ relaxing at her old age
you know just having the freedom to go out you know like breathe I I mean like if I'm her also I will
<malay>bosan</malay> [seh] <malay>duduk dekat rumah</malay> you know like the whole thing like

(oo) that I like the question (mm)
(um) I
think [kan] I would
probably would love
love
to
just
(um)
around
okay [ah]
paris area
london because
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> singapore
is it so rushing
everyone is rushing to get here to get coffee only <malay>ni semua nak merebut</malay> [lah] but then
I have heard a lot of people saying that
you know if you really want to chill chill mango <malay>pergi dekat</malay> paris
just <malay>duduk minum kopi</malay> and you
the rest of them are chilling as well
I want that kind of environment you know just to experience
being chillax you know (um)
ya [lah] but that's my goal [lah]
just
ya you how about you
<malay>cantiknya</malay>
like literally you know
there's something very intriguing about
their culture the way they relax I don't know
I feel like singapore just need to chill a bit [lah]
it's just too fast pace but
<malay>ada</malay> pros and cons <malay>juga</malay> fast
pace I mean we're we're successful to certain extent <malay>macam</malay> economy !wah! <malay>jangan cakap</malay> [ah]
but
ya [lah]
<malay>lepak sikit</malay> [lah]
and like
you know the population <malay>pun sekarang</malay> <malay>macam</malay> a lot of older generation as compared to know like like
people like us
so I feel like it's
quite important to just
kind of chill
and take a step back
but you know who are we to control [kan]
I mean it's not weird I mean
it's valid
for you to feel that way because
if me I wouldn't be able to
cope with five kids
<malay>pun</malay>
I mean <malay>rezeki tu</malay> okay [lah] there's <malay>rezeki tu datang dari</malay> very you know
god but like
I don't know and
okay if you are in the country or if you're wealthy it's a different thing but then we are in singapore you know
<malay>makan pun berapa dah berapa</malay> dollar okay <malay>nak beli</malay> pampers <malay>nak beli ini</malay> and
five times five
if I have a high paying job I don't mind
but then what
what are the odds you know you don't know
and
five kids is a lot
a lot to juggle I can't even handle like one
crying baby
why
how
(mm)
we're like that okay
but
I feel like ya I mean like if you have
something to work towards to
I mean you get motivated [what]
in certain way
but
to me <malay>macam</malay> house work is not an issue
I mean I would love to have a maid [lah] I've never been living with a maid before <malay>macam sedap</malay> [kan] <malay>ada orang kemaskan</malay> you and all that
but
it all
comes back to being success successful in the end
she's now why we have to pay ourself
are you planning to take any courses in the future I mean like apart from your specialist diploma
like degree or something
the fees and everything is it
which uni are you looking at
S_M_U
I mean that's good [lah]
planning is
everything
honestly I mean like
you don't just
go <malay>macam</malay> okay (err) go with the flow <malay>macam</malay> go with the flow <malay>sangat</malay> you know
like
[eh] okay
but like
ya [lah]
I mean like
so you took one year gap
ya
[oh] I took a one year gap also
you didn't know after graduation I took a one year gap
ya we did we both did I remember
it's like
okay to me <malay>macam</malay> one year gap is quite productive [leh] like you just take one year to just
think about what you want
actually that's true I mean like you wasted a year
and when your friends are all like progressing already and then you are one year back
so (um) and when that one year gap makes you lazy actually
makes you very lazy it's because
momentum <malay>dah hilang</malay> [tau] <malay>hilang</malay> graduate
<malay>abeh dah tak belajar</malay> [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> #shiok# <malay>dah naik</malay> #shiok#
so <malay>macam</malay> if if you were just to continue and break that one year gap I think we will be more successful but things happens for a reason so ya we are where we are
meant to be
that's why I believe [lah] so that
I mean if you keep thinking about the one year gap you get depressed eventually
because like you will regret
ya
[oh] man why didn't you reach out to me
we were have been talking for what seven years and you didn't know I took a one year
gap come on
no I
after I graduated
I work okay
may I I graduated <malay>kirakan macam</malay> april [lah] [eh] <malay>dah habiskan</malay>
then I
kept up
till november <malay>terus</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay>
do they work part time also
I didn't know that
I didn't know that at all
so where do you get the money from
you need like
that's the thing I know you were good at savings I know you had like
!wah! a lot of saving so you were have been using your savings during that one year gap
pro
pro
pro
[oh] my
god okay okay but not to make you depressed or anything it's okay it's okay things happens for a reason I mean you are not where you are right now
if it wasn't because of the one year gap
you might have been in uni
and you are struggling you will never know
I feel like you
you are successful you you just don't know that
you don't know I mean now you have so much experience
and uni look at that you know
I mean like they really look at experience you know what have you been doing since you graduated they focus on that
ya that's true and I heard that S_M_U is a good school
so better [lah] aim for it and there's a lot of my friends <malay>yang</malay>
they didn't get accepted in uni but they work then after that they apply again and they get
they got in because of the work experience so I feel like you have higher chances of
getting
the S_M_U <malay>punya</malay>
intake
but #inshallah#
I mean like you can I can [lah] I have known you for seven years you're so hardworking
I mean uni hard is going to be hard I mean you need hard like uni life is gonna be hard
but ya [lah] you can manage your time well
so
I feel like you can [lah]
and S_M_U is good because you are taking full time right
answer me
what what what which course are you planning to get
I mean you just mainly just look at your major [what] minor you can choose later cause major okay what marketing is it what
what which part
so minor I mean you can minor in <malay>apa</malay> organisational behaviour right those type of thing right
ya
I think minor minor bus~ in business or what
minor is just
literally the word minor is minor
the major one is a major
you get what I mean
ya so
but marketing is
on demand nowadays
right
[oh] <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
and
healthcare also
I mean like you can market
but under healthcare [what]
why not
[oh] ya I forgot
doctor times
okay
ya but I have heard about it
[eh] I'm but I'm planning to
I'm planning to
going under healthcare also
like under social work
now after this feel cause I'm tired of teaching
just tired of
watching kids suffering
so maybe I will get back to it later
you know you know I'll just explore and
this is the thing I heard you know I don't like when people generalise
us
as job hoppers
ya I mean like it's hard to change one's mind also we can only change our minds
so they are going to continue looking us as job hoppers
but
to me
I mean depends [ah] on the situation <malay>kalau nak</malay> job hop just because [oh] you can't take it anymore that's a different thing but if you want a job hope to get experience you know different fields
why not <malay>macam</malay> you're still young you need to know what you really want in life <malay>kalau tak</malay> experience <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh]
like you know you just going to be stuck
you know mundane for the rest of your life
I'm
but
it's just
it's just not how our generation works nowadays you know we need to find what we love to actually
progress <malay>betul-betul macam</malay> you know be successful
ya that's why passion is important to me
how is it possible
is it a typo or what
[oh] my god that is ridiculous okay <malay>merepek gila</malay>
but
okay [lah] I mean there are so many expectations of us
<malay>macam</malay> we are barely okay
I'm not
try to
I mean there is
people our age
like with so many <malay>macam</malay> experience and really capable
but
<malay>takkan nak sama</malay> okay over generous everyone as the same
you know some people are the weaknesses some people have the different strengths
and
I mean don't ex~
don't over expect too much and also don't <malay>macam</malay>
you know like <malay>letak kita kat bawah sangat</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang macam</malay> [eh] <malay>korang ni tak ada apa-apa</malay> [ah] just nothing you know
middle [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
borderline you know that kind of thing
so I really hope that one day we will find the jobs
we were really passionate about [lah]
that's true <malay>macam</malay> like
I always watch like movies you know <malay>macam</malay>
okay like they get into jobs they like right they work they have progression and all that
and <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat</malay>
in singapore
because all those movies are al~
always based on other other countries you know
<malay>macam</malay> america <malay>ni semua</malay>
I don't know like
okay like
sometimes I do have thoughts <malay>macam</malay> if we want to be like
overseas you know working overseas will we be success more successful like [oh]
you know as compared to in singapore
you get what I mean
[ah] okay okay this now is a fun topic okay I don't know where but I like [ah] rom com
you know romantic comedy
those kind and I like thrills also thrills movies
ya so anything that keeps my adrenaline you know rush because I'm an adrenaline junkie
how are you
so what type like net~

do you watch modern family
[oh] my god you should watch you should watch it's funny
[oh] is it good

okay okay
is it okay I didn't know that I mean like I always
[oh] I mean I I've seen
everyone like posting about stranger things
<malay>apa ni</malay> is stranger things
but like okay [lah] I I might watch it one day but you should watch modern family
it's hilarious
hilarious
okay but if you watch modern family with someone
it's funnier
then watching alone probably like (uh)
okay [lah] funny but [eh] quite boring
not boring
but like it's
nicer with someone
exactly and I'm single as hell
[oh] that's so sweet
<malay>ada</malay>
I mean I wanna watch but I don't wanna get stuck
on on it you know
like people play like among us
but like I don't
I really want to try but I don't want to get stuck on it
is it a hype or is it just for a while
I see okay
that make sense
but I can see you is the type of person who can control you know you have
quite
a decent self control <malay>punya</malay> tolerance but me
I can't like I don't have self control
like once I'm indulge into that [kan] <malay>habis</malay>
it's over for me so I tend I tend to <malay>macam</malay> you know prevent from this kind of thing like okay ya maybe let me indulge with healthier thing that's why I'm joining like #muay thai# gym
know things that
you know are healthy
and
ya I don't mind spending
ov~
over
time on it
alright [oh] my god it sounds like a plan
okay
it's been long since I start playing you know
games
and ya [lah] I mean like
we are twenty two what do you
expect
we rarely [oh] my god did you overcook
it's because it's so hard
is it okay which one the sec~ the older one or
[eh] the younger one
[eh] wait wait wait wait
the
the youngest
[oh] are you serious

I see boring
but
ya [lah] I
I mean I love P_S four
for I usually waste money on play nation <malay>ni semua</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> waste of money [lah] so I stop playing games
but overcook is fun
switch is simple <malay>kau macam</malay> you can bring it around <malay>pastu boleh main</malay>
that's true that's true
I mean but
ya [lah] I mean
I'm trying my best to not spend
not spend on stuff that are unnecessary I mean like
there's a lot of things I wanna do I wanna shop you know I wanna shop for facial stuff makeup
<malay>baju ni semua</malay> but I'm trying my best not to
because
I feel like overspending I won't be able to save
in the future
do you invest in anything
I see [eh] wait wh~ where does he wh~ where <malay>macam mana dia</malay> invest
on so every month
I see but how much does he save per month
<malay>tak sikit</malay> [kan] that's the thing
I only invest on every month I just <malay>kasi macam</malay> hundred seventy <malay>gitu</malay>
and for fifteen years [ah] then <malay>macam ada</malay> you will get back like a lump sum
(um) and in case if you were to <malay>macam</malay> touch wood [lah] <malay>macam</malay> pass away or anything like
you will get
more
than what you save
<malay>macam</malay>
hundred K
how to get [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
I mean it's quite
reassuring [lah] to know that
you know these thing which are the backup plan <malay>gitu</malay>
ya so I feel like you should you should invest on
I mean I can I can like brief you through it [lah]
like
all these investment and all that kind of stuff
it's really productive okay

to eat the fish with you [lah] the
<malay>ikan kerapu</malay>
I don't know what <malay>kerapu</malay>

something fancy for <malay>tengah hari</malay> [lah] <malay>makanan tengah hari</malay> [lah]
(uh) <malay>nasi</malay> you know
<malay>sayur</malay>
fancy <malay>tengah hari macam nasi kalau malam</malay> more like salad [lah] because of your condition right because of your <malay>kencing manis</malay> right your diabetes
so it's best to
to cook the heavy meals for lunch
for the for me the kids <malay>kalau ada nasi ada ikan</malay> they will eat [lah]
(uh) but I don't want to buy <malay>tadi bila</malay> I <malay>beli ikan tu</malay> I <malay>tak nak beli banyak ikan takut nanti simpan dalam</malay> ice box <malay>bau</malay> so I rather just buy <malay>satu ekor ikan</malay> [lah]
<malay>dari beli dua ekor itu hari</malay> I <malay>beli dua ekor abeh tak dapat habis</malay>
you know <malay>susah nak habis abeh</malay> end up <malay>buang</malay> you know so I rather not
<malay>sebab tu tadi bila kat</malay> #sheng siong# <malay>tadi</malay>
I <malay>beli satu ekor ikan aje</malay>
<malay>tak nak membazir</malay>
why
ya
(uh) <malay>tapi ada kala pula</malay> I feel <malay>serba salah</malay> when I do that <malay>kena beli satu pula nanti</malay> the kids I want some more fish you know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang pula bila masak ada</malay> plan <malay>tapi mak bawa makan ke</malay>

I edit <malay>tak</malay> I didn't really require a lot of time [lah] think within less than one and a half hour
or less than two hours <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah] edit
(uh) <malay>tadi</malay> I <malay>berbual dengan</malay> my
my russian teacher <malay>tu</malay> the skype over skype [eh]
he would we were still talking about music cause last week we were talking about music so he ask me he was (err) he was a having a conversation with his friends our (uh) what some he has some friends from thailand so he told me <malay>yang</malay>
there's this lady a friend lady of his who was sharing a video she was singing a song
I and the song was from #tokyo# square then she's like #tokyo# square so he thought that <malay>dia dari jepun ke</malay> group <malay>ni</malay> then I at the moment he said that my eyes lit up I said yes he and I think he knows that singaporean [lah] it's a singaporean group he did a study but he he actually he did a research and he found out that the group was a singaporean group but the song that he quoted that he liked was (uh)
(err) who I don't remember the title keep on loving you or something like that
then I it's like [eh] that's not the famous song from #tokyo# square
but the song actually nice <malay>tapi dia pakai lagu</malay> #sukiyaki# <malay>punya lagu</malay> [tau] do you know #sukiyaki# right there's this
it's all because of you you know that song
I'm feeling sad and blue so they use that melody but the #tokyo# square turned it into a song I think using the lyrics they sing it [ah]
(uh) it's not an original so I told him that when I was young I follow <malay>kak tina</malay> to this concert by #tokyo# square
so #tokyo# square actually that
it's not a tok~ a got a #tokyo# square concert but they perform a few songs [ah]
(uh) because there are many other things that (err) at that show so #tokyo# square was one of them so I I I remember #tokyo# square but the song that that was famous I was telling victor the word #tokyo# slot square is famous for this song called within you I remain is it within you remain or something like that
(uh) that is the originally is from #tokyo# square but there's some (uh) famous <malay>mat salleh</malay> singers sing that song [lah] western singers that (err) sing (err) #tokyo# square <malay>punya lagu</malay> but that is I say <malay>macam</malay> singapore okay comparatively to russia over to
to america right they don't have
a lot of talent [lah] they don't <malay>macam</malay> you know
it's not like it's but this this is like one of the few ones that many people
will remember because you know they would want he went there
no because he liked the melody and he and I said the melody is actually from a japanese song very fa~ very I think is #sukiyaki# [ah] from what I know
(uh) but <malay>dia punya</malay> melody has been reused and reused by other bands [lah] but that is not the most famous #tokyo# square
(uh) because like I mean <malay>nama</malay> #tokyo# square <malay>tapi dari</malay> singapore you know <malay>macam</malay>
that's the that's the unique thing [lah] that he was like
have you heard the song within you I remain ai ni</mandarin> I love you
it's very famous ai ni</mandarin> I need you
because my I think <malay>kak tina</malay> did some events [ah] for local music group in the eighties so when she also babysit us so she
put us somewhere then she brought me with her [lah] so I think one of that that's why she know #tokyo# square
(uh)
and that they were performing <malay>dekat mana</malay> [tau] <malay>kat depan</malay> if I am not wrong [eh] at this <malay>padang</malay> area near parkway parade
they had this show they had this
no <malay>macam</malay> this area <malay>dekat depan</malay> parkway <malay>ke sebelah kat</malay> parkway <malay>ke</malay> one of those area [lah] because parkway was you it was like a famous [lah] you can see shopping cen~ shopping mall shopping center <malay>dekat</malay> eighties nineties <malay>mana ada banyak</malay>
[ah] so you remember [lah]
(mm)
(uh) the open space then they put up (err) the stage right [eh] (um) but you like some of the local music scene right it's like some of the songs right
there were some songs that you like [what]
(uh)

[ah] the malay rock band #ramli sarip# all that there is known <malay>tapi</malay> for the english
medium [eh] english medium <malay>tak banyak</malay> that's why #tokyo# squares is one of <malay>tapi yang</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> sam willows <malay>sekarang</malay> famous there were a few [ah]
(uh)

[ah] ya the malay medium [lah] but it's like some of the
singapore hong-kong talent that went into chinese medium also like #kit chan#

it's only people like [ah] #zizan# #zizan# [eh]
they can really do <malay>loghat</malay> know and they really are very good at imitating <malay>macam</malay> singapore <malay>punya macam</malay> they are not that fluid their ability not that fluid

they can really do <malay>dikir barat</malay> the whole night you know because that is like their training you know
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> for us it's not like that at all that's why I say it's amateurs [lah]
I remember when M #nasir# was talking to a
(err) #hady# [eh] #hady mirza#
for the
(err) what's the talent show [eh]
the <malay>yang yang lama-lama</malay> [lah]

[ah] <malay>tapi dia ada</malay> all the the veteran singer so #hady# was face off with this other
they need to create that rivalry I think on purpose [lah]
[ah] so they have this person in the end <malay>dia menang dua-dua</malay> two of them <malay>memang</malay> [kan]
it's a draw ya
so ya it was
quite I think (err) (err) M #nasir# asked him (err) #hady# where have you been
why now you know <malay>macam</malay> like in a way <malay>kenapa sekarang kenapa tak dari dulu lagi kau datang kat</malay> malaysia you know
because he was (err) wondering what he wasn't he was straying away from

ya but for people to retire they should have money right all that right <malay>mana tengok seroja</malay> I <malay>tengok kesian</malay> [ah]
[ah]
because I think more than half of her salary she was putting away for the house
<malay>dia beli rumah tu</malay> about <malay>satu</malay> point <malay>satu satu</malay> point <malay>dua juta</malay> [tau]
no she said people the
you know the the the my russian course mate that that wanted to (uh) buy a house right that one right she told me that she wanted to sell her house <malay>pun</malay> (err)
(uh) it's slow down <malay>macam orang pun tak nak beli</malay>
so
<malay>rumah dia kata rumah dia sepuluh tahun dia beli rumah tu</malay> I think
I think ten years [eh] twelve years or fifteen years ago
and she said she cannot even (err) make any profit
(err) around the same price as #seroja#
(uh) (uh)
(uh) <malay>dia pun nak jual dia tak nak jual</malay>
<malay>dia tak nak jual</malay>
(uh)
<malay>macam tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak jual harga tinggi</malay> [lah] she just want to sell (uh)
slightly more [lah] or around the same price [lah]
because she already bought a f~ she already got (err) her flat
(err) her not her flat her condo at amber at amber road
<malay>dia punya rumah yang ini tingkat dua yang rumah ke sana tu tingkat lapan</malay>
she want to because she love (err) cycling
[ah] and then she will she loved to cycle at east coast so it to her it doesn't make sense to cycle <malay>dekat</malay>
her condo <malay>tu</malay> [kan] not near the beach right so <malay>macam</malay>
to her is an effort [lah] to go back and forth <malay>naik basikal di situ</malay> and I think a bit #ulu# [lah] because <malay>situ</malay> [kan] <malay>jauh</malay> [kan]
she like cycling but <malay>macam</malay>
I think she wants to cycle near the beach [lah] she doesn't have to
(uh)
ya [lah] but she has wonderful legs [ah]
she looks amazing for her age and then she also does ballroom dancing so it's very interesting but <malay>macam</malay>
for me when I see her I <malay>tengok</malay> I don't think money is a problem of course she like to
<malay>macam</malay> is typical of (err) they're people from their group right they like to think about money they like to make more money but I think for her to be able to
<malay>macam</malay> still <malay>tinggal</malay> that <malay>rumah walaupun rumah tu belum jual</malay> and still have (err) her she's start to pay ready for her house
in amber road
started paying already so she doesn't need there's no hurry
I think around (uh) ten years or so [ah]
no she was the first owner
you mean the amber road or the one at
the amber road [eh]
the amber road I'm not sure maybe [ah]
I think I I don't think is a new condo [ah]
(uh) (uh)
no no hers was second hers was a new <malay>lepas tu dia kata</malay> T_O_P <malay>ada</malay> T_O_P
(uh) it's new it's new
[ah] <malay>tapi besar</malay> because <malay>rumah dia belum habis</malay> renovate [eh] because they had to for stall the
(uh)
(uh) the no the the <malay>macam kira</malay> development <malay>dah habis semua tapi orang semua</malay> I think they <malay>nak</malay> renovate [ah] <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi pasal</malay> renovation <malay>kena</malay> put on hold because of the COVID
she cannot move in
she still have to stay
so I was thinking to myself [oh] not bad [eh] <malay>dia tak payah jual rumah</malay> in order to live in that place you know
because most people they have to <malay>jual rumah</malay> so <malay>maknanya dia ada duit juta-juta</malay> I mean she's already <malay>nak dekat enam puluh lebih dah enam puluh nak dekat enam puluh lebih gitu</malay> and therefore someone like her not having to sell the place
and not having to borrow money from the bank
maybe she has the money <malay>ada duit juga</malay> [ah]
that one <malay>betul-betul ada</malay> (err) pool or view of the pool ya
it's a very sexy you know what the view that because you can see the pool when you enter her her living space
when you enter her living room and then when you go her bedroom directly in front of the the pool in the centre of the pool
<malay>tiga tiga</malay> bedroom
she say three bedroom but I only went to her bedroom because her bedroom ya is the one that opens directly to in front of the very nice <malay>sayang</malay> it was like
[oh] my god sex heaven
(uh) I think I think for <malay>dasha dia terperanjat tapi dasha memang tinggal</malay> condo she shared with a flatmates <malay>dulu dia tinggal dekat</malay> H_D_B <malay>sekarang dia tinggal kat</malay> condo I think she found a new flatmate [eh] and then <malay>macam kat kat</malay> russia [kan] they don't have this quality of
condo [kan]
(uh) so it's a bit you know she's also quite aware [lah] about the development about about buying condo (uh) that #dasha# is aware so <malay>macam macam</malay> it's very sexy [lah]
it's very very nice
no I think she stay I think she stay at condo because <malay>dekat itu dekat dengan</malay> russian <malay>nya</malay> embassy
and and then <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit timah# <malay>dia nak dekat dengan</malay> nature <malay>agaknya orang putih gitu</malay> [kan]
[ah] shared <malay>dengan ramai ramai ramai</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I never ask
(uh)
because I thought I I thought she stayed at #serangoon# garden then then suddenly she went over so that one I don't know that story I don't know
(uh) (uh)
(uh) but I think she like the location <malay>agaknya</malay>
<malay>dekat dengan rumah dekat dengan dekat kerja agaknya</malay>
(uh) because this <malay>mat salleh</malay> they like their nature they like
(uh) <malay>dia naik</malay> bus <malay>dia dia orang naik</malay> bus
I don't know I think she definitely made a choice
because maybe the flatmate <malay>yang dia suka yang sekufu dengan dia agaknya</malay>
!huh!
I don't think it's sponsored
but I can ask [lah]
but it's like I think for europeans is not really
they're not really <malay>macam kita</malay> a bit rude about money we talk about money like <malay>macam</malay> I can ask audrey and she doesn't feel offended but if I ask the question to audrey I think #dasha# will be uncomfortable
because it's not something that europeans like to talk about <malay>macam</malay>
especially french so I think it's something that they
<malay>macam</malay> it's not really the thing [lah] <malay>macam</malay> us <malay>cakap berapa kau beli berapa kau jual</malay>
(uh)
I mean I can't ask that question
but
but she's very (err) thrifty [lah] [sia]
you <malay>tahu</malay> this this year I don't see her spending anything <malay>dia tak beli baju baru</malay>
rent [eh]
(uh)
I think it's two or three of them I think it's two of them in the room
ya
(mm)
<malay>mungkin dengan</malay> boyfriend <malay>dia ke apa kita tak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin ada</malay> boyfriend [lah]
that's why she move (uh)
<malay>kalau</malay> like that okay [eh]
make sense right
(uh) but #sami# <malay>suka</malay>
I know chile said she say she live in a condo because she said that she had her pool is always in front there but she never used so there's to me it's fixed condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam dia dia kata dia ada</malay> swimming pool <malay>kat depan rumah dia tapi tak pernah guna</malay> [kan] (uh) that's fixed to me condo [lah]
(uh)
<malay>macam</malay> some of the <malay>aminah punya</malay> friends right they <malay>tinggal</malay> condo [ah]
(uh)
so they are a bit different [lah] their their the way they
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (err) I guess that's <malay>macam</malay> we have friends in N_U_S I remember I have friends in N_U_S
I mean we are just H_D_B three room four room dweller but that this fence <malay>pula tinggal rumah sebuah tiga tingkat</malay> they're they're thinking already and the way they speak already different
their upbringing is different right
(uh) distinction [lah] (uh)
ya
they don't necessar~ from what I observed right they don't necessary have the best grades I remember when I was in school
I mean
<malay>yang pak ali</malay> [eh] you know <malay>pak ali</malay> always get the best grades <malay>macam</malay> dean's lists [lah] #borhan# also the one the D_J D_J radio <malay>warna</malay> right but they were from H_D_B it doesn't
<malay>macam</malay> ya people used to think that (err)
having coming from a middle class or upper middle class
will give you a distinct advantage yes but not necessary so [lah]
(uh)
they do have the advantage but you know ya resources but they not necessarily the best [lah] the best usually not them [lah]
(uh) I I mean I remember I had this german coursemate near terrace [eh]
she he ya
ya
he was educated <malay>sayang</malay> he was educated when he was young he was educated in #eton# [tau]
he went to #eton# know that was his socialization [tau]
did I ask him what did you do he's <malay>baba budak orang baba</malay>
[oh] I (uh) my father owns a travel agent company
(uh)
<malay>tak tahu betul ke tidak</malay>
(uh) and then
(uh)
(uh huh)
<malay>dia kalau sayang kalau dia hantar dia pergi</malay> tuition
<malay>dia pergi</malay> tuition do you know how much people pay to teach him tuition
they paid five hundred dollar a month
just to teach one subject
(uh)
this is doing N_U_S you know
[ah]
(uh) teaching <malay>macam</malay> he has he has his full time job
even after <malay>tu dia</malay> continue but then he will still had the student that he were charged a lot for you know so <malay>macam</malay> you know you have this
but he's very nice [lah] I think the reason why he wants me to be the partner is because his german is better than mine he doesn't want a partner that is much better than him of course you know so every time <malay>kita</malay> because when you have a partner you have to have a conversation and your teacher have to observe you <malay>berbual</malay> and then <malay>dia dia dia punya orang tidak apa punya orang</malay> so most of the time we speak <malay>melayu</malay> and <malay>baba</malay> so
but you know he was so sweet because you know that
I cannot go to germany but when he went to germany and he asked me what do you want me to buy for you so I I ask him [oh] can you get for me this this this this you know like the C_Ds like from the then he will get for me [lah] of course [lah] he won't pay for it [lah] but because it's my <malay>mahal</malay> right so I pay for it but it doesn't matter
but it is like you order it it will be more expensive so he went over there <malay>dia beli dia ingat</malay> I don't know how it is now terrence
I I found out that he was educated at #eton# so I was like #eton# then #dasha# was telling me I want to teach russia russian language to (err) the people in #eton# but the person who taught them was a professor of russia language and he is not a native russian speaker
but he's a very fluent russian speaker
so he teach the #eton# boys (err) russian [lah]
#eton# is like the boarding school
in U_K in U_K there's a boarding school
no no no <malay>dia nak pergi</malay> U_K actually <malay>tak nak pergi</malay> singapore
<malay>tapi dia kata dia</malay> not good enough [lah] #dasha# <malay>kata sebab tu</malay> #eton# they didn't choose it didn't choose her but actually #eton# then after that the #eton# got
a professor but <malay>dia orang</malay> U_K [lah] U_K
U_K or american [eh] but very fluent in russian and then because (err) project was saying in oxford you have people doing other languages but <malay>macam macam</malay> russian only a few know
you can count on your finger who will
you know will do russian
[ah] ya
(uh)
(uh huh)

ya and and and the thing is is not just (uh) it's not just vietnam but also (uh) indonesia
indonesia and malaysia a lot of their medical students
(err) study in russia because russia (uh) (uh) study medicine in russia
I told you about this malay girl who studied russian I don't know whether she singaporean or malaysian
but the she's actually a medicine student in a medical student in russia
and is she she took a year [ah] to brush up on her russia before she
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> be you know why they go to russia because <malay>dia punya</malay> tuition fee
for medicine is relatively cheaper than you go to U_K or america (uh) it's recognise [lah]
singapore I <malay>tak tahu</malay> but (uh)
there's this girl I thought singaporeans but when (err) #kacha# was telling me #kacha# the owner of the school she was telling me when she was in going to #sarawak# or #sabah#
so there were (err) she was speaking russian to her husband and <malay>dia</malay> she have two children two or three children they all go to #sabah# or #sarawak# then after that <malay>yang orang kat belakang dia</malay> there's this man [ah] (err) medical doctor
<malay>dia kata</malay> [oh] he he he spoke to her he spoke to her in very fluent russian and he actually learns (err) medicine in russia
(uh)

but she cannot come and work here
N_U_S <malay>tak</malay> recognise #kelantan# <malay>punya</malay> medical certificate
so that's why she remained in malaysia he works here so sometimes <malay>dia</malay> come back

to send her daughter to australia
<malay>mahal</malay>
so she want the daughter to but I said can practice she said can your daughter said can practice that's why <malay>dia pergi sana tapi dia takut anak dia tak nak balik dia kata anak dia suka</malay> australia

she wanna do psychology from what I heard she wanna do psychology <malay>siapa si</malay>
soci is hard to get it also
you have to do aptitude test [leh]
ya but we we found out from my
<malay>ustazah yang</malay> teacher that the
class no that the degree that they have like for example <malay>yang daripada</malay>
(err) university of
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
jordan and the university of
not cairo [lah] (err) #al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
#al-azhar#
(uh) it's not they say it's not a degree level you know
it's not considered a degree level <malay>macam</malay> for example you want to be a teacher right
they don't consider a degree for #al-azhar# a degree
yes that's what my <malay>ustaz</malay> told me
so <malay>macam</malay> it has to be like U_I_A U_I_A they recognize degree
(uh)
don't know #allahu aalam#
jordan I <malay>tak tahu</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
could be [ah] because <malay>mak dia mak dia tak nak</malay> but but but (uh) the <malay>ustaz kata</malay> that's the reason <malay>macam</malay> for example <malay>kita dapat</malay> second upper the second upper (uh) or first class you got your pay scale it they are not even considered degree
ya
ya that's why like people say why they go to <malay>madrasah</malay> for that's the big question everybody ask
<malay>siapa</malay>
(uh) #wani# [eh]
<malay>agaknya</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
I don't know now (err) COVID I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
unless they do online [lah] unless they do online [lah] but I don't know #al-azhar# now not that good [lah]
so that's why a lot of people recommend <malay>pergi</malay> jordan
there's <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
the system of learning [ah]
(err) I think ever since the the egyptian spring [ah] uprising ya arab spring
you know syria attack but syria always so they will always be the attack are you know right until the end of time [lah] we know that the story [lah]
[oh] now she didn't go with them she went to the jordanian embassy right
[kan] <malay>itu hari si</malay> king of jordan <malay>datang</malay>
and then she got a rolex watch she was showing it off at the facebook
I don't I don't see her posting anymore because usually she like to post about those people who come from afar cause her part is medical she's actually in the medical tourism line where she does translator she does translation for people from middle east like which I think she know five dialect a few from eygptian like <malay>tiga empat daripada</malay> eygpt and then she knows other dialect [lah] so <malay>dia kata ada kesian</malay> because she was telling me because <malay>dia kenal-kenal dengan ustaz</malay>
<malay>ustaz hasan</malay> so <malay>dia bilang</malay> [ah] <malay>dia bilang dengan</malay> I [lah] some of them come from <malay>negeri yang</malay> you know they come from <malay>kampung</malay> so only know dialect [tau] <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> so they don't even know so she try to bend here bend [ah]
nothing from this this girl this lady you know
and this lady have a condition [ah] <malay>dia kata</malay> then I ask (err) your cousin [eh] how do you translate all those medical term to that because she needs to know what she's getting herself into [eh] [a'ah] <malay>kak tini bukan senang</malay> you know like <malay>nak kena ni nak kena</malay> surgery <malay>nak kena ni</malay> can you imagine <malay>nak kena</malay> like you have to a bypass and how to you have to talk about the heart all that I said if you need to talk in a dialect how
she sometime <malay>tunjuk gambar tunjuk gambar gini cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti orang tu boleh faham dia kata</malay> and then the sad thing the sad thing is the embassy spend thousand of dollars on these people <malay>agaknya derma</malay> I think embassy <malay>derma agaknya</malay> and then spend money on them you know (err) spend the money on translations (err) these translators
[oh] ya because the the king would (err) #hussein# not #hussein# I I I <malay>kenal bini dia</malay> (uh) he was very impressed the singapore side very <malay>cepat</malay> very efficient
but when I was telling doctor <malay>ustaz hasan ustaz hasan apa dia</malay> showing off
can just give to the poor people but I think for him is like a simple gesture
to everybody who work for the embassy on the singapore side
(uh) that is the rumour [lah] that she <malay>tunjuk</malay> the <malay>jam</malay>
(uh) but at that time this is before the trace translator for the hospital this is after that so when after that
she decided to because this one did the sponsorship for the translator need to come from somewhere right so after that there's no funds for them right then she and then she move on to she move on to or she got another job
(err) at the
(uh)
(err) visa at the jordianian embassy [ah]
ya but it's also something that has strength [lah] because her #fusha# is very good like the <malay>orang arab dengar</malay> #fusha# [lah] <malay>yang</malay> I try to <malay>berbual dengan ustazah hadijah</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> #fusha# but okay so <malay>macam</malay> the the difficult dialect is not egyptian [lah] according to them [lah] but I don't know I <malay>tengok</malay> egypt in dialect very different because people say egypt <malay>punya</malay> dialect very near #fusha# the standard model standard arabic but if it drove many people don't speak more than studied arabic everyday
modern standard arabic it's a very formal language
that comes off from the quran [lah] you know it's like
you know but the thing is if it true people speak their dialect so the the what the dialect all the dialect they are a bit different from the #fusha#
<malay>banyak orang arab banyak</malay> [kan] very diverse
that's the that's the thing [lah] so they get whatever they can
<malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> egypt <malay>itu dia tinggal mesir dah berapa lama</malay> she even take she even take #talaqqi# courses at the the famous egyptian scholars when she was there she told me
also she taught she take #talaqqi# she taught she taught me how to <malay>tajwid</malay>
she told me <malay>yang</malay> the and then when I ask #abi# #abi# say <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>ada yang ustaz yang</malay> famous <malay>sampai boleh kalau</malay> you <malay>buat salah</malay> your <malay>bacaan sampai boleh ambil</malay> you know your you know the what is that thing [ah]
when they collect the smoke the cigarette <malay>punya</malay> ashes [leh]
(uh) they can throw that at your face
like <malay>garang</malay> [ah]
you know but that is the the the nature [lah] but then you want to get the #sadat# [eh] they call it #sadat# you you want to get #sadat# so you do that [lah]
let her just stay here [lah] let her she said if her strength is science then let her go to science let her go to poly like her

(uh)
or you want her to go J_C okay [lah] go J_C <malay>pakai</malay> then there's the other thing [lah]
I think (err) <malay>tengok</malay> appetite <malay>dia macam</malay> math and science
language is a bit hard [lah]
but she might she might change her mind because I wasn't very good either my language isn't very good either
we're looking better and better when I was you know
(uh)
I think from what I know in singapore
you do very well if you do science says at your computing you know you do very well
languages not really our core strength [ah]
in singapore you cannot do well <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> I don't think so [lah]
(uh) I mean I have friends who who like for example #murni# and I have a mutual friend
(err) <malay>namanya</malay>
(err) okay [lah] one of our girlfriends [lah]
so I'm not that close to her [lah] because
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] I just <malay>tak cam tak ngam dengan dia sangat</malay> [lah] but she's very close to #murni# so now she's the
I_S_D <malay>punya</malay> translation unit she she's the head you know

or
<malay>tu rumah baru apa</malay>
cause <malay>macam</malay> those <malay>rumah-rumah yang baru</malay> [kan] the layout ya the the the layout is funny and then like if you're opening you open the window to a to another window that kind of thing <malay>aku macam</malay> like ya exactly <malay>pasal tu pasal</malay> we say resale the best that's why resale <malay>punya</malay> prices is still
three hundred
(mm)
(hmm)
no [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> that time <malay>aku tanya</malay> [ah] #naz# <malay>rumah aku punya</malay> two years two years ya
ya means <malay>kalau dah naik</malay> market if I want to buy is really higher already right now that time the the the median
<malay>jauh</malay> [ah] <malay>aku dah aku dah kat sini dah bagus</malay> [tau] cause of a southview <malay>kalau aku nak ada rumah dekat sini aku nak</malay> block <malay>sana nampak hari-hari aku pandang</malay> block <malay>sana</malay> block <malay>mak mertua aku</malay> block <malay>sebelah situ mak mertua aku nya</malay> block <malay>macam</malay> block <malay>aku dia ada rumah empat bilik dekat situ ada ada</malay> E_M <malay>dengan</malay> E_A yes correct then <malay>yang kat hujung-hujung</malay> is E_A <malay>ada tapi mahal</malay>
ya this location quite difficult that time <malay>ada yang</malay> block opposite opposite my house block two zero four <malay>dia jual dia punya</malay> E_M
then <malay>dia jual murah</malay> because the the owner and he is selling on his own
then I was thinking maybe I should just go for it [lah] since I'm not working right then after that we worried about the financial later <malay>gila nasib baik</malay> ya I was thinking of that [ah]
ya I was thinking you know like [eh] this is the best time you know <malay>yang</malay> let's just do it [lah] <malay>nanti kita boleh fikir</malay> cause right now also I'm still paying for for the house using my C_P_F [what]
not not not tapping into his so okay <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>dia bayar dia punya</malay> part is <malay>lapan ratus aku punya</malay> part <malay>lima ratus</malay>
(hmm) but <malay>kalau kita ambil rumah mesti nak kena</malay> increase but then again you'll be difficult [lah] cause if I prolong like this no job no C_P_F contribution and then it's going to be lesser and lesser <malay>bila aku nak itu</malay>
so it's gonna be difficult [lah] so lucky thing also [lah] we never go cause now I'm re~ rethinking twice do I really want an E_M do we really need an E_M is like a lot of space
and a lot of space to clean up
so
ya I will need the space [ah] but at this moment I try to
!chey! <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>kejap</malay> [jer] then <malay>lepas tu nanti lepak nanti aku dah kasi makan nanti semua lepak</malay>
<malay>tak aku aku nak</malay> need bigger space but then <malay>aku pun fikir</malay> bigger space means we probably buy more things
you know so
just be happy [jer] [lah] <malay>dengan apa dengan</malay> space <malay>yang aku ada</malay> because most of the time <malay>pun kita semua lepak dekat luar bukan lepak dalam bilik</malay>
kitchen
(mmhmm) correct
three is just enough in in in <malay>apa</malay> in the end <malay>pun kita</malay> plan at this moment [ah] because I don't know how to fit three kids in three boys into one room
#aira# <malay>yang tu yang tak</malay> she volunteered she say nevermind #hafis# sleep with me
(hmm) because <malay>dia sorang</malay> [jer] <malay>apa yang</malay> she gets everything [what] her own her own like double girls [lah] [ah] but because I was thinking also because their age gap is very very far (hmm) that's why she don't mind that #hafis# sleep with her
which
they are all sleeping together still <malay>tilam tilam kau tu</malay> very useful <malay>bila aku cakap dengan anak-anak aku aku nak buang ni ni katil korang kena pakai katil dah beli mahal-mahal</malay>
no #aira# has her own platform
so she sleep on her own <malay>tilam kat bawah ada dua tilam</malay>
ya in a way [lah] so <malay>gasak korang</malay> [lor]
<malay>tu dah</malay> start <malay>nak berkawan dengan perempuan camne</malay>
[a'ah] [lah] how do you feel about it

to create awareness that how <malay>macam mana</malay> [ah] <malay>sekolah</malay> [ah] for preschool [kan] for preschoolers it's good to send kids (err) to preschool to
as a stepping stone
you know <malay>permulaan</malay> from all the different cases [lah]
ya <malay>ramai</malay> a lot so <malay>bila aku berbual dengan</malay> so <malay>yang datang tu</malay> is a mendaki person and then there's this person I do not know I think she is (err) from
<malay>yang</malay> (err)
maybe from the preschool <malay>punya aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] okay <malay>lagi satu rupanya dia berita harian yang</malay> interview <malay>aku tu</malay> it's from <malay>berita harian</malay> so <malay>aku tanya</malay> actually <malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> interview I <malay>pasal</malay> the preschoolers [ah] cause is it because of this article that I read (err) <malay>budak-budak</malay> [ah] <malay>apa bangsa melayu tak itu</malay>
<malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>tak dorang tak hantar</malay> then I say <malay>kenapa</malay> (err) what's the reason you <malay>tahu tak apa dia punya</malay> reason <malay>dia cakap dorang cakap</malay> is not necessary
<malay>jadi dorang hantar</malay> K one K two [jer] !huh!

so <malay>pada aku macam</malay> like <malay>apa</malay> [seh] <malay>pada aku</malay> like why would you say it is not necessary <malay>pada</malay> that's that's where the interview ya that's why we need to interview <malay>jadi kita nak tahu apa pandangan</malay> you <malay>bila</malay> you [ah] decided to <malay>hantar</malay> [lah] <malay>anak</malay> you <malay>pergi</malay> preschool

the <malay>dia punya</malay> question was very legit [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> okay first <malay>kenapa aku hantar anak aku pergi</malay> preschool secondly [ah] <malay>bagaimana</malay> [ah] <malay>bagaimana</malay> [ah]
(mm) [ah] <malay>apabila menghantar mereka tu</malay> [kan] [ah] did it help

[ah] development self development <malay>tu aku cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dorang punya</malay> motor skills <malay>dorang punya</malay> cognitive behaviour <malay>dorang punya</malay> social skill and then <malay>benda-benda yang yang</malay> preschool <malay>boleh ajar mungkin saya tak boleh ajar</malay> like <malay>saya ni bekerja jadi macam mana nak ajar dorang</malay> math <malay>ke</malay>
more sight words <malay>ke</malay> phonics <malay>ke</malay> it's very difficult for me to read I don't have the <malay>takde macam dia punya</malay> layout on how to teach them
<malay>tapi kalau hantar kat sekolah</malay> [kan] <malay>semua dah ada</malay>
(err) a program for them [ah] <malay>senang sikit</malay>
so <malay>dorang tanya</malay> like (um)
more of it is actually #hasif# because #hasif# is very outspoken
then <malay>dia cakap</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> how do you feel [lah] <malay>bila hantar</malay> like is there any improvement <malay>aku cakap</malay> ya <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] improvement <malay>terutama kali anak saya yang nombor tiga tu dia memang</malay> very (err) friendly
you know he's very active <malay>dia pandai pandai berbual</malay> public speaking <malay>pun dia tak takut</malay>
which is true <malay>tak takut</malay> [seh] [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>gasak</malay> [ah] <malay>sembarang</malay> [ah] you know

we go to a government based [ah] government aided <malay>sekolah</malay> and then <malay>kalau kita</malay> low income <malay>mesti</malay> the <malay>sekolah</malay> has a system for the lower income family <malay>jadi dapat</malay> further subsidies that's number one but if you want talk about <malay>kalau tak nak berbual pasal</malay> finances there could another reason the other reason <malay>kenapa</malay> [ah] <malay>mak bapa tak hantar anak-anak pergi</malay> preschool <malay>kerana tak ada tempat</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ada tempat</malay> (mm) in the neighbourhood <malay>tak cukup</malay> preschool ya so so I <malay>cakap</malay> okay <malay>terus terang</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> #hafif# I <malay>masuk</malay> [kan] <malay>nak masuk</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> infant care

new zea~
I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
ya that was so fun right U_K and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya <malay>bila</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> travel <malay>lagi macam</malay> camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
<malay>bila</malay> time <malay>nak makan</malay> we can <malay>makan</malay> or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to U_K
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus <malay>lima puluh</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar</malay> he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
<malay>pergi</malay> pub [eh] <malay>pergi</malay> pub hot chocolate !wow!

[oh] okay [eh] <malay>tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk</malay> [ah] I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right <malay>macam</malay> hot chocolate or like
I don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate <malay>dekat</malay>
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think

ya
yup yup correct [ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
<malay>yang</malay> the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then <malay>bila</malay> wombat <malay>tu macam bau kita punya makanan</malay> !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come <malay>tak ambil gambar</malay> [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kecoh saje</malay>
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like <malay>kesian</malay> when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay> COVID <malay>pergi mana</malay> [eh]
[eh] but K_L okay you can go K_L by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know K_L #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
<malay>dia penat gila</malay> [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in K_L [lah] like I need my dose of K_L man
ya I really hope this goes away soon [seh] K <malay>tak sabar</malay>
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
<malay>tapi rasa macam</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] <malay>selamat tak</malay> seasick [eh]
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
weirdly I miss the supermarkets <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] <malay>kelakar tak</malay>
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so <malay>lain</malay> right
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that <malay>kita nak</malay> save <malay>duit</malay> [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
I don't know I <malay>rasa apa dah pakai</malay>
(err) wait (err) K let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one <malay>yang kat</malay> farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was <malay>dekat bandar</malay> like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and <malay>macam</malay> all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] <malay>macam</malay> modern
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# <malay>yang mana satu</malay> [seh]
yes yes I remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream <malay>macam bunga</malay> like that <malay>macam</malay> the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was U_K but <malay>macam tak</malay> memorable <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
ya but if I had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (err)
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
<malay>tak</malay> I'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
<malay>pening</malay> [seh] I <malay>tengok</malay>
ya
<malay>faham faham</malay>
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
<malay>macam</malay> there's raclette cheese in U_K remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so <malay>macam</malay> you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're <malay>lapar</malay> like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
<malay>borong</malay> market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
<malay>macam</malay> it wasn't it wasn't like popular or <malay>macam</malay> ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like I remember there was one <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] flavour <malay>ni macam</malay> some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
<malay>pisang goreng</malay> is it <malay>pisang goreng</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> they said that it was <malay>pisang muda goreng</malay> or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] <malay>mana nak dapat</malay> [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie <malay>sebelum tu apa</malay>
ya
what's dragon's den <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh]
<malay>ini macam</malay> shark tank <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but I miss (um) ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas <malay>macam masak sendiri</malay> and all [kan]
ya
I do I do like <malay>macam</malay>
like you know when we were craving for
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or <malay>teh tarik</malay> shop and pay an exorbitant amount <malay>untuk beli</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay>
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than <malay>kat sini</malay>
what what what what do you miss
<malay>kau</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> K_F_C [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or <malay>apa apa yang sedap sangat</malay> [ah]
okay okay
livable boy <malay>sama makan sama hidup</malay> [eh]
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there I think <malay>malam</malay> [eh]
a pie pie face
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! <malay>rindu gila</malay> [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes <malay>kat</malay> U_K
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like
like like I didn't even know something <malay>macam</malay> so basic and simple can taste so <malay>sedap</malay> you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait <malay>apa</malay> what was the filling <malay>dalam</malay> jacket potato <malay>dia lupa</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> order <malay>lagi lepas tu</malay> ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
<malay>sedap sedap sangat sedap</malay>
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and <malay>macam</malay> ya things are just
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita boleh buat kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby <malay>duit</malay> [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
<malay>macam</malay> ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores <malay>pasal dia orang suka</malay> touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
<malay>yang</malay> unbeatable [lah] and ya you I think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand <malay>tapi macam berlambak</malay> [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester
we were so noob man
okay can you jog my memory again york <malay>mana satu</malay>
[oh] and then we had to get somebody to service or maintain [kan] yes yes yes
[eh] it's a once in a lifetime chance [seh] we never know if we are going to pass by that place again [lor]
okay [lah] just want to check it out while we are there <malay>betul aqilah</malay>
so right what [eh] did we go to any theme parks [ah] <malay>kat sana</malay> like I can't remember like during our trip
trying to recall [lah]
(err)
I think we tried to stay away from the theme parks right
ya only only that one (err) that one place <malay>ingat tak tempat tu apa tu nama dia</malay>
enchanted garden or something
<malay>yang ada</malay> the one with the that float what do you call it [ah]
the one that we sat on the float and then like we slide down the slope <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what is it called [ah]
no no no it's not luge
ya but basically there was that fun huge float <malay>kita duduk kat dalam lepas tu</malay> we just slide down the slope ya get it is it

ya like you enter a maze and then you try to find your way out
ya and then (um)
ya I just remember that that thingy [ah] what is it called [ah]
not not rafting [ah] <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
[oh] then <malay>kita ada masuk tu</malay> haunted house haunted house
[kan] <malay>ada macam tempat</malay> I don't know there was this like towards the end of our trip <malay>dekat sana</malay> then <malay>ada</malay> this little like haunted house <malay>yang kita masuk</malay>
<malay>kat atas</malay> [ah] like this house of mirrors or something like that
ya
that was like a house of mirrors
but ya ya that I think that was just one of the theme parks that we went to [lah] [eh] but the beaches there were nice [eh]
beaches I remember we had fish and chips at one of the beaches
(err) no [ah] bondi [ah] bondi <malay>kat</malay> australia
ya at U_K did we go to any beaches trying to remember
we did we did ya we did I remember a photo at the beach ya correct portsmouth
(mm) we really miss the nature [ah]
ya I mean that's something in that you don't have
an abundance of in singapore
ya [eh] but malaysia nature not bad [leh] actually
ya
(mm)
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall [ah]
no [lah] you know whenever we track inside like the canopies like within the canopies
ya like it's cooling
ya
<malay>cari</malay> waterfall we went on a major like waterfall tracking thing in tasmania [what]
like I think we managed to find water like three or four waterfalls ya
ya it can layer on <malay>lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>kat dalam</malay> forests <malay>kena</malay> layer on [seh]
ya but okay [lah] I mean like okay #langkawi# has nice beaches
okay [lah] it's hot no doubt about that probably you got to choose the correct time to go but
unfortunately when it's in asia when it's cool it rains
ya
when we can [ah] while we can
ya my friend has said nice things about spain actually I want to go to spain
you've been to spain and ya I have (uh) know two thousand maybe
<malay>bila</malay> [seh] how come I don't know
<malay>ni</malay> time uni [eh]
wait what did you go to spain for
[oh]
[eh] but you were travelling when you were still a student is it
but (err) <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like last time I never had a chance to travel as a student so like how how different was it travelling like as a student compared to you know when you're working and you have like more money and stuff
like I am sure you had to save up to do certain thing I mean <malay>macam</malay> you've got to plan around your budget and everything [kan]
<malay>jauh gila</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>sabar</malay> belgium is germany right
[oh] okay okay and then <malay>apa jadi</malay>
and then
so wait the cab fare was <malay>mahal gila</malay> or what
so the cab fare was more than that bus fare [ah]
#ish# <malay>rabak</malay> or what
!huh!
so basically you were ca~ trying to catch your train (err) trying to catch your flight you mean
[eh] wait back then you guys had like phones and technology with you right or <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ke kau orang macam</malay> were I don't know just winging it
serious
[oh] my goodness so did you manage to catch your flight
(mm)
okay okay and like the timing wise
<malay>ada</malay> buffer [lah]
this was towards the end of your trip or <malay>macam mana</malay>
wait wait wait wait wait wait at the start of you trip you guys [dah] <malay>takde duit apa</malay> [seh]
okay no cash on hand [lah] you mean
okay
(mm) (mm)
[oh] <malay>faham faham</malay> K K and then
did the taxi driver actually buy your <malay>alasan</malay>
(uh huh)
okay okay
belgium right belgium muslim in belgium okay
[ah] so like he <malay>kena</malay> switched on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter [ah]
[oh] I see like how much it's supposed to cost [ah]
okay okay no [lah] because I'm just wondering <malay>macam</malay> you know some places like you have to switch on your meter because like they they need to
ya it's like a regulation thing ya
[oh] !wah! were you like halfway through at least
okay okay okay
that was the amount that you were gonna pay him [lah]
(mm)
confirm <malay>tengah</malay> panic [eh] <malay>pasal macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>lambat</malay> then you have to find your gate and everything like [oh] my goodness
start of an adventure [eh]
so what what other things did you guys run into over there
<malay>macam macam</malay> what what would (err) the like significant moments of the trip
<malay>ada raih tak kat sana</malay>
[oh] <malay>selamat</malay> [ah] spain <malay>menang</malay>
[eh] wait but you guys managed to watch the game also or you guys just happened to like join in the celebration
I see
imagine if they lost and then their mood will be like <malay>habis</malay>
people will probably be like <malay>maki-maki semua</malay>
ya ya like (uh)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
[oh] I see so how did you guys get back to your accommodation after that
ya after you spend all your money on a taxi fare confirm [ah] <malay>kena jalan balik</malay> [kan]
<malay>jalan balik lepas tu</malay>
and then as like budget students how did you guys manage your food and and other stuff like expenses
serious [eh] <malay>roti</malay> and tuna everyday okay I don't think I can do that
(mm)
no
ya ya ya cause I I think I remember like a hostel dot com or something
(mm)
<malay>prata</malay> [eh]
<malay>prata</malay> is everywhere
okay
wait wait wait <malay>sabar sabar kau orang dah</malay> check <malay>harga benda tu ke belum</malay>
okay okay <malay>habis</malay>
alright alright alright so you guys were like <malay>itik dengan ayam</malay> [ah] <malay>berbual</malay>
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like #prata# <malay>bom</malay> [ah] so <malay>kirakan dia ada macam</malay>
but as in they served it on the side or <malay>memang</malay> it's it's really like with the sugar and all
[oh] my so he gave you guys one first or <malay>macam mana</malay>
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the <malay>manis</malay> one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
I see I see
yup
so what siesta time basically <malay>macam</malay> nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never en~ encountered this before so
<malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the emplo~ employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] madrid
he <malay>pernah kerja</malay> at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large <malay>macam</malay> like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your <malay>ni</malay> the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay>
then wild wild wet last year <malay>ada pergi</malay> [kan]
<malay>lepas tu dia punya</malay> right time <malay>tak silap tutup</malay>

ya <malay>lepas tu yang kita</malay> you <malay>makan kat</malay> perfect catch
<malay>tu pun</malay> best [ah] fish and chips by the river power [sia]
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to U_K <malay>punya</malay> fish and chips U_K fish and chips
<malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak sedap</malay>
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to U_K ya
ya I went to new zealand <malay>dengan</malay> my aunties [lah] and my cousins
(err) well (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>pergi dengan</malay> (um) <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang punya</malay> level of (err) worry is more because they feel that they are responsible [lah] for you
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
I <malay>tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> you <malay>dah dengan makcik-makcik</malay> I
(err) <malay>dia orang dah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah]
and ya [lah] so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my f~ back then [lah] my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the old~ eldest or one of the oldest
<malay>dia dah pergi</malay> counter <malay>dah pergi bayar</malay>
<malay>alih-alih</malay> he was walking on the platform
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya (um) and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
[ah] despite my aunts' protestations
and ya [lah] so he jump [ah] he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply [lah] [kan] you got there
it must be ticked are you fit <malay>ada sakit apa-apa tak</malay> you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera <malay>benda-benda macam gini semua biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> fill
and once you are done ya [lah] I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
so they give you a cert [lah] to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and #nah# <malay>ambil kau punya</malay> cert
ya
actually for new zealand (um)
the year that I went
so <malay>kita dalam kat</malay> new zealand maybe about one or two
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so
my cousin and <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub
<malay>tak tak minum</malay> [ah] [eh] [ah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub ordered hot chocolate
<malay>kita pergi</malay> pub <malay>pergi</malay> pub (err) hot chocolate <malay>tengok bola kat luar</malay>
<malay>tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan</malay> it was raining
(um) and then <malay>bila esok pagi</malay>
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> (um) snow fell
<malay>lepas tu bila</malay> when there was snow (err) we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
(um) the advisory was <malay>tak boleh</malay> drive on the road <malay>dulu</malay>
and then (um) apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow <malay>yang</malay> christchurch (um) felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so <malay>macam lama gila</malay> [ah] <malay>lama tak boleh</malay> snow <malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err)
[eh] did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
[ah] was that the first time I felt snow
ya <malay>betul</malay> I think that was the first time I <malay>rasa</malay> snow
(err) unique experience [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> snow [kan] so
ya ya ya we <malay>memang kita tahu</malay> it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves [lah]
(err)
(err) not for snow but I mean just winter <malay>kita tak tahu pun</malay> there was snow that was gonna happen
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun [lah]
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch <malay>maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana</malay>
the tour company decided okay nevermind we (err) board the bus and <malay>lepas tu</malay> drove to another hotel
and (um) ya we basically <malay>tidur kat</malay> hotel <malay>baru</malay>
<malay>tapi yang tak</malay> #bestnya# <malay>pasal</malay> new zealand
is that
the malls closed at five P_M so you imagine [eh]
(um) winter obvious <malay>sejuk lepas tu</malay>
winter <malay>sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis</malay>
<malay>semua benda semua kedai dah tutup</malay> then so it was quite boring [lah] for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that !wow! at five P_M I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but <malay>tengok</malay> T_V so it was kind of boring [ah] but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night <malay>ke</malay> two extra night
ya
K [lah] how chocolate is the best [lah]
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
so hot chocolate [ah] <malay>sedap</malay>
<malay>tu bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> some pumpkin spice [kan]
[ah] apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
<malay>dekat</malay> queen victoria market [kan]
[ah] [eh] <malay>tu biasa pasal kita terus makan</malay> donut <malay>dia kat luar</malay>
!woo! #shiok# [ah]
!wah! camper van experience <malay>lain</malay> [eh] I think
<malay>kat mana</malay>
wilsons promontory
<malay>betul</malay>
dapat
(mm) ya [lah] I think by then <malay>kita orang macam dah penat</malay> I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then (uh) by the time nightfall <malay>kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan</malay> until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal [lah] having wildlife a wombat <malay>benda yang</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak kat</malay> singapore <malay>tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk</malay> camper van
<malay>melampau</malay> [jer]
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food [ah] [kan]
ya <malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah]
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
<malay>kita tak akan dapat</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda macam ini sebab</malay> tours chances are
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
(err)
ya
ya and I think (um) partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> your time is yours
(um) you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
(um) you can even decide on the spot that !hey! I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I think <malay>yang</malay> even on that trip [lah] <malay>yang</malay> we <malay>kita turun tengok</malay> the river delta [kan] ya
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak tak sabar tunggu ni</malay> COVID <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination K_L [lah] I'm don't even wanna go J_B
I just gonna shoot straight for K_L
ya <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
<malay>jadi kita kasih</malay> [lah] <malay>orang yang nak</malay> fly fly <malay>dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi</malay>
<malay>kita pergi apa yang kita mampu</malay> [jer] <malay>iaitu</malay> K_L K
<malay>apa</malay>
wanna drive all the way (um)
ya <malay>tapi</malay> okay so there are two ways to go about doing it <malay>biasa orang</malay> drive
what they do is they drive
to #penang#
<malay>lepas tu tidur</malay> rest one night and then <malay>esok pagi</malay> just <malay>sambung pergi</malay> border of thailand
ya that one more relax [ah] <malay>takde kelam kabut takde macam</malay> rushing for time
<malay>kalau nak lagi rilek</malay>
drive <malay>ke</malay> K_L <malay>tidur semalam</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> #penang#
<malay>nanti</malay> [lah] <malay>belum buka</malay> K_L <malay>tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar</malay>
#selangor# <malay>tengah</malay> highest for COVID numbers
ya so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu lepas dah tidur</malay> K_L <malay>satu malam pergi</malay> #penang# <malay>satu malam baru pergi</malay> thailand <malay>tapi tu dah kira dua hari</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau nak cepat</malay> then <malay>tidur</malay> #penang# <malay>satu hari esok kita pergi</malay> thailand <malay>ataupun lagi nak cepat terus</malay> to thailand [ah] <malay>tapi penat</malay> [ah] <malay>badan sebab</malay> it will probably be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>empat belas jam</malay> on the road [ah] so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired [ah]
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border [oh] you see
so to me
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand <malay>kalau</malay> the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
then the other alternative is fly to
#krabi# or fly to #phuket#
<malay>sewa kereta kat sana</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> travel around southern thailand
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(err) I don't know [ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay> try <malay>tapi jangan bawa kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>jangan bawa kereta</malay> in
you <malay>sewa kereta dekat</malay> thailand
ya
<malay>kalau bawa kereta sendiri</malay> then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring [lah] so what I want is <malay>kita</malay> save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore [ah]
<malay>naik kapal terbang nak sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>kapal terbang</malay> [ah] <malay>naik</malay> [ah] <malay>kapal terbang</malay>
ya
true but then I felt that okay [lah] I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience [lah] of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship [lah] [kan]
okay [lah] <malay>memang</malay> best [lah] <malay>tak cakap tak</malay> best <malay>tapi</malay> le~
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] bruny boring [lah] <malay>kirakan macam</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> kecil <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>tu juga</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> bunker [lah] cabin [lah]
cabin cabin
ya
okay [lah] <malay>tapi malam</malay> we <malay>kita tak</malay> travel <malay>malam</malay> so you were travelling at
it wasn't that bad
no [lah] I guess when it got
I mean <malay>bila kita baru-baru masuk</malay> when the boat started to sail
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
by the time <malay>kita dah tertidur</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled [lah] [kan] when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and <malay>dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat</malay> [lah]
then <malay>bila pagi dah bangun</malay>
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm [lah]
[ah]
[oh] ya
<malay>tak</malay>
ya I think supermarkets overseas [ah]
<malay>lain</malay> okay [lah] I mean <malay>dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi</malay> I think because of the space that they have
(um) there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
and <malay>harga tak</malay> so <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
because they are the producers [ah] that's why
[ah] meat so fresh
ya because they are fresh produced [ah] <malay>benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap</malay>
<malay>lagipun bila kita kat sana</malay>
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
<malay>memang</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] since
[oh] <malay>dapat dia orang yang</malay> burger <malay>ni macam</malay> best [ah]
true
even the ice cream is different
okay <malay>sabar</malay> which one do you prefer you <malay>lagi suka</malay> van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> ice cream <malay>ke</malay> you <malay>lagi suka</malay> gelato #messina#
van diemen's was ya <malay>betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah</malay> farm
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] gelato #messina# <malay>ada macam-macam</malay> flavour
<malay>tapi yang</malay> #amorino# <malay>punya</malay>
#amorino# <malay>punya</malay> I think <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>kejap</malay> I <malay>tak ingat</malay> whether that one were U_K trip <malay>ke</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak salah tu</malay> U_K [ah]
okay
ya I like #messina# better <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
ya <malay>tu yang</malay> best <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
because you have a variety to choose from [ah]
because <malay>kalau</malay> you you compare van diemen's van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> flavours are
much more predictable in that sense
it's not anything out of the ordinary [lah] <malay>macam</malay> K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
[kan] <malay>atau</malay>
K [lah] apple cranberry <malay>pun boleh katakan</malay>
quite common
<malay>ada apa yang dekat tu dekat</malay> tom's palette
<malay>dia tak ada ke</malay>
okay tom's palette <malay>ke</malay> gelato #messina#
ya <malay>ke</malay>
but then tom's palette <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
(mm) ya
and the best donuts in the world
[eh] do you notice
it could be ya
<malay>tapi</malay> it could also be the fact that
<malay>benda tu kita tak pernah</malay> try [ah] <malay>contoh</malay> [eh] <malay>contoh</malay>
when we went to <malay>borong</malay> market alright K break your head right
we ordered the the bombolinis [lah] the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
(um)
I I wouldn't say that <malay>sebab dulu</malay> dunkin donut <malay>pernah ada</malay> with their bavarian cream
<malay>tapi</malay> the the ones that dunkin donut <malay>jual tak sesedap</malay> [ah]
and
ya okay so <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine [ah] break your head you <malay>punya</malay> donut the dough is soft
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique (um) overflowing
<malay>inti dia penuh</malay> [kan]
so they were oozing out and okay [lah] I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world [lah]
which I am inclined to agree <malay>sebab</malay> about I haven't tasted
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya [oh] and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
<malay>tak pada</malay> I <malay>macam lebih pada</malay> okay like
I felt that it was a cross between <malay>lemak cili padi dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> thai green curry
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>iras-iras dia</malay>
plantains [eh]
did they grill that one grill [kan]
I think it was grilled and then they put (um) brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that [ah]
ya that one
[eh] there was something that I thought about (um) [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] (um) london (um)
the devil brownies [ah]
ya that was a random find [ah] no we went to that
that weekend market
(um) I wouldn't say it's a random find [lah] because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
[ah] correct
<malay>beutl betul betul</malay>
<malay>dah dah lepas tu</malay> I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den [ah] dragon's den dragon's den is this (uh) british show
where aspiring business owners visit this there (err) these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons [ah] so these dragons are
investors <malay>yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak</malay> shark tank [ah] <malay>macam</malay> shark tank [ah]
so dragon's den <malay>dengan</malay> shark tank <malay>lebih kurang</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay> [ah]
(um) so ya she pitch her brownies to them [ah]
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not [ah] but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted <malay>kirakan</malay> you <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
(err) she used that as part of her advertisement [lah]
[ah] but I really good are really really good
ya okay think about it [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> you miss the food overseas
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
no [lah] just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay [lah] when travel <malay>kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak</malay> most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam makan kat</malay> noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
[ah] noodle oodle (um) that's just
soup [ah]
right like like <malay>mi dengan</malay>
ya so if you were to think about it again <malay>macam</malay> is it really that fantastic
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>faham tak</malay>
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the P_F_C paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
ya it's the spices <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> okay imagine nandos
K imagine nandos [ah] so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
[ah] the price the price is way cheaper than nandos [ah]
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
so nandos [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam</malay> up <malay>sikit</malay>
[kan] <malay>ada sudu garfu</malay>
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab [ah]
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
[ah] yes
[eh] the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name [ah] a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice [ah]
ya what else [ah]
what else was nice that we have
[oh] buffet that that buffet was power
[eh] that was a nice chance upon [ah]
that was not in our initial plan [lah] because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
(um) ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay [lah] it's a saving grace [lah]
it's a saving grace because I think
(um) those ya that jacket potato was nice
that thick milkshake <malay>sedap gila</malay>
ya it was milkshake and skittles [ah]
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian [lah] at least [oh] that was some nice jacket potato
<malay>tak boleh</malay> replicate [ah] [eh] so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop <malay>kita masuk</malay>
K [ah] <malay>penat saje nak duduk</malay>
and baam <malay>sedap gila apa tempat ni</malay>
ya
that's true
<malay>betul juga</malay> okay [lah] maybe I think [oh] what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] factory outlets
[kan]
ya cheaper [lah] ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands (err) on prada
understand [ah] it's still thousands [eh]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> bicester village elite [ah] up [ah]
bicester <malay>ke</malay> #bister#
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester [eh]
B I C E S T E R bicester
ya but I think the york <malay>punya</malay> outlets (err) better [ah]
york <malay>yang kita punya kita punya</malay> camper van (um) battery <malay>mati</malay>
yes
<malay>tak yang</malay> job <malay>dia</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita dah</malay>
somewhere near the south
so <malay>kita</malay> travel all the way up <malay>untuk pergi</malay> york
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
that's true [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> travel <malay>untuk</malay> two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
<malay>kau orang biar betul</malay>
okay [lah]

ya I agree
malaysia nature
okay [lah] I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia

so <malay>walaupun masuk hutan</malay> (err) I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
<malay>tapi bila kat dalam panas juga</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab takde angin</malay> [ah]

that's why we should always travel to
temperate climate
four season four season climate
I've been to spain
ya I have (err)
two thousand let me recall [ah] when did I go to spain
two thousand
ya this was uni two thousand seven
seven I think or two thousand eight
I met my friend who was doing his exchange in netherlands
and then from netherlands sort of like
a trip before he gets back to singapore
(um) we went to travel around the areas [lah] so we went to spain (um)
specifically we went to madrid [lah]
(err) at that time two thousand eight <malay>tak salah tengah</malay> euro euro two thousand eight ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah] euro two thousand eight [lah]
so (err) I clearly remember there was one night
I think it was spain versus italy
(mm) ya
ya <malay>kalau kalau</malay> travel as a student
(um) I think you really have to plan
how much you are going to spend so <malay>macam</malay> for us while <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> we either just took the
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
<malay>atau kita ambil</malay> (um) <malay>kita ambil apa</malay> the the budget flight [ah]
so I remember there was one (um)
so we were from netherlands <malay>kita</malay> travel to belgium via bus
so when we reach belgium
(um) we thought that the bus station (uh) at that belgium to the airport was quite near [lah]
only for us to realise that actually
<malay>kita dah terlepas</malay> the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
<malay>jauh</malay> I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium [lah] <malay>mana</malay> belgium is germany
so <malay>kita terlepas</malay> so <malay>konon-konon nak naik</malay> taxi [ah] the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks [ah] ya
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely [ah]
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
(um)
<malay>tak juga</malay> [ah] we were winging it [lah]
ya
[ah] ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>kita cakap dengan pakcik ni</malay> [ah] driver we need to get to this airport so <malay>dia kata</malay> that sixty kilometres away
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour [lah] but sixty kilometres away ya [kan] so it's still quite a distance
at least <malay>macam</malay>
forty five minutes to get there [ah]
so you <malay>macam dah</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] but the worst part is that we will we had no money [ah] there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
this was the start [lah] almost the start I think ya
no <malay>bukan takde duit</malay> [lah] but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the mo~ if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means <malay>untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita</malay> hundred and this one [ah] more than hundred twenty euro <malay>habis kita dah duit dah sikit</malay> then <malay>kita macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
so we negotiated [lah] we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind [ah] he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind (err) I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros [lah] basically
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and <malay>nanti</malay> I will show you all
<malay>dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni lagi mahal</malay> [lah]
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation [kan]
ya [lah] I I think <malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam benda ini juga</malay> so <malay>dia</malay> on
<malay>dia</malay> on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter <malay>dah naik</malay> two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
and then by the time we reach there he
(uh) maybe three quarters [ah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he said
ya and then <malay>dia kata</malay> okay you look [ah] at the meter
<malay>sekarang dah</malay> hundred three hundred and twenty euro <malay>aku</malay> off K <malay>aku</malay> off
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got [lah] and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed [lah] maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey [ah]
<malay>lepak hidup</malay>
ya starting <malay>tu dah</malay> adventure [ah]
run into I
I think the high~ I won't say highlight [lah] but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
no but I think <malay>kalau</malay> spain <malay>kalah</malay> confirm <malay>raih</malay> [ah]
[ah] but because spain won (err) I think o~ I think through penalties [eh] spain <malay>menang</malay> italy and then [ah] because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the (um) there was a big screen <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) live telecast
so <malay>kita ramai-ramai</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana sama tengok</malay> live telecast [lah]
ya and (uh) I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid [lah] [ah] but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
(err) I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think [ah]
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
the trains <malay>tutup</malay> [sia]
[ah] so [dah] happy happy
<malay>jalan</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>jalan</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid [ah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid so madrid <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> portugal so <malay>kita pergi</malay>
so it was netherlands <malay>lepas tu ambil</malay> bus <malay>pergi</malay> belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal <malay>pergi</malay> (um) flight to madrid
ya that was that was an
all the way <malay>makan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>roti dengan</malay> tuna [ah]
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] everyday but basically living frugally [ah]
[oh] I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
<malay>kita</malay>
(um) my friend and I [lah] <malay>kita dah dah dah lapar</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita turun kat kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni kita kebetulan</malay> found a muslim shop which was nearby
no
you go through your hostel dot com <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah]
ya
so (um) <malay>jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>semua</malay> muslim brother <malay>dah masuk kedai dia</malay> apparently <malay>kita ternampak ada</malay> #prata# [ah]
#prata# [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so I don't know whether it was [ah] an instant #prata# or #prata# that they made [ah] <malay>tapi nampak macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so my friend and I [eh] <malay>baik</malay> [ah] this <malay>harapan</malay> #prata# <malay>puas hati</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tu kita dah tengah lapar</malay> so <malay>kita minta dia enam</malay> [ah] <malay>enam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tiga aku tiga</malay> [lah] <malay>enam</malay>
<malay>itu tak perasan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] and <malay>harga dia harga tak mahal sangat</malay> [lah]
true <malay>dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita dah</malay> okay [ah] <malay>enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar</malay> and he couldn't speak english
so
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu</malay>
then <malay>macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar</malay>
no
apparently <malay>dia orang makan</malay> order #prata# <malay>dengan macam sirap ke gula</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali manis nak mampus</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> I think they <malay>tuang</malay> the sugar on top [ah]
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each [ah]
so <malay>kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik</malay>
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ni dia ni kira macam</malay> muslim brother <malay>boleh pakai punya</malay> [ah]
ya
power [ah]
ya that's why
ya
ya
and then (uh) you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita <malay>keluar</malay> (um) maybe like after one or after the two
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four <malay>ke</malay> two to five [ah]
[ah] like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
so it's okay [lah] as in <malay>dia orang tutup sekejap</malay> for them to rest <malay>lepas tu dia orang buka sampai</malay> maybe <malay>sepuluh sebelas</malay>
ya
[ah] yup
true
[oh] (err) in madrid <malay>juga</malay> I where where when we were walking [ah] <malay>masih masih masih</malay>
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> there was this bangladeshi guy
who came up to us
say #assamualaikum# and started to (err) to talk to us in malay
<malay>kita dah kat</malay> madrid [eh] <malay>dia orang bual bual melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>muka</malay> bangladesh <malay>berbual melayu lepak</malay>
so we talk to him when quite further in he said [oh] actually yes he's bangladeshi
<malay>ada pernah kerja kat</malay> malaysia
for
working [ah] so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then (um) you know went back went to spain to work [lah]
I mean if the opportunity presents itself <malay>nak</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>kalau ada kerja yang bagus</malay> okay [ah]
ya working overseas is something
okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months [ah] of exchange in canada
that was a clo~ I wouldn't say there's even that even came close [ah] but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome [ah] to the point that I felt that !hey!
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both [ah]
okay so (um) when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
(um) the M_S_A or the muslim students association they were quite
(um) vibrant and there are very active [lah]
so (um) I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them [lah]
because when I were went there also (um)
it coincided with the fasting month
[ah] <malay>lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana</malay> I mean
<malay>kalau kita kat</malay> singapore <malay>kalau bulan puasa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tarawih lepas tu</malay>
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short [ah]
so ya
I <malay>nak minum</malay> hot chocolate <malay>dulu</malay>
!wow!
<malay>nak cakap apa</malay>
[oh] interesting
okay so <malay>kita memang dah tak</malay>
<malay>makan</malay>
meat products as much as we did before I mean <malay>dua ribu dua belas</malay> [eh] <malay>dua ribu dua puluh dah</malay> kind of okay
so how how far <malay>lang nak</malay> go in to into veganism
I <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
<malay>tapi</malay> in a way I think we're almost
there [lah] almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
I <malay>rasa</malay>
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>macam ada</malay>
selfishness <malay>sebab</malay> I don't
feel the same thing <malay>bila macam guna ikan bilis</malay> just because they are smaller than a chicken or <malay>lembu</malay>
[ah] I <malay>rasa</malay> selfish <malay>sebab</malay> they should be equal
okay
ya ya ya <malay>faham</malay> muk~ #mukbang#
(mm)
[a'ah] in a way [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean <malay>orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing</malay> is our companion pet <malay>banyak orang guna sebagai</malay> [ah] <malay>ada anjing</malay> as pet
but when it comes to chicken or duck
<malay>kita pun pernah bela itik</malay>
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
<malay>manja</malay> [lah] <malay>binatang tu</malay> can be so is that the same comparison
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi kita</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> (err) hunting and gathering food from [ah] natural resource <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
<malay>kalau orang dulu-dulu dia tak berkebun pun</malay>
<malay>berkebun tu selepas</malay>
<malay>dia pergi memburu semua</malay> [kan] then <malay>baru</malay> come this <malay>era bila orang</malay> start <malay>berkebun</malay> and <malay>jumpa teknik berkebun</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>tak ingat</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> go into veganism you <malay>akan</malay>
be a vegan [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> vegetarian
<malay>telur</malay> I cannot leave that I mean I
I <malay>boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu</malay> but I feel like I need my protein <malay>daripada telur</malay>
(um)
[ah] mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
<malay>tapi</malay> the challenge
is
<malay>macam kita dekat sini</malay>
[ah] you I <malay>tak</malay> sure <malay>tapi</malay> I
if I were to be a vegan
the challenge will come <malay>bila balik rumah mama</malay>
and mama
<malay>masak apa yang dia masak</malay> [lah] I don't think I have the strength to <malay>tolak</malay>
because it's not something <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> every day
I I can do that <malay>kalau pergi kedai kawan</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau balik rumah</malay> family <malay>dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan</malay>
but I myself don't have the strength to <malay>tolak apa yang dah ada tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] and <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tahu</malay>
<malay>dia masak sedap gila</malay>
so <malay>susah</malay> [ah]
you <malay>macam mana</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>apa yang</malay> spark your idea <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
vegan
is is there a certain
(err) timeline <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>yang membuat</malay> you <malay>sampai ke</malay> part <malay>yang mana</malay> you <malay>nak jadi</malay> vegan <malay>ni ada cerita dia ke</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> cringe cringey
(mm)
I <malay>rasa</malay>
I
don't have anything
<malay>yang betul-betul macam</malay> the moment <malay>yang</malay> spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
because of all the free time
(um)
and because of a lot of things [eh] <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>bagi</malay> [tau] I [lah] and <malay>dia macam</malay> I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
but actually (um)
in southeast asia
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> we have abundant soy sauce we have that (err) we have abundant soy derived products <malay>macam tempeh tauhu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>sedap</malay> [jer]
[oh] my god
ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay> crave
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
born born to be slaughtered [lah] basically
(mm)
spread <malay>penyakit ke macam nyamuk</malay> you you never know which one <malay>yang gigit</malay> you <malay>yang bawa</malay> aedes
extreme [lah] I mean I I think <malay>dua hari lepas</malay> #kot# I <malay>kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>selain</malay> delving into veganism <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>ada</malay> #kot#
and then
[oh] okay
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>punya azam tahun ni</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
start drawing again
<malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>dah lama sangat tinggalkan</malay> drawing and <malay>sekarang</malay> I <malay>rasa janggal nak buat</malay> the kind of drawing <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>pernah buat dulu</malay>
<malay>janggal gila sampai sampai macam</malay> halfway <malay>tu dah menyampah</malay> [tau]
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> I I [tau] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau</malay> practise every day
<malay>dia makin lama makin</malay> okay so that's one of my
(err) two thousand twenty one resolution
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
(err) come back to
<malay>belajar</malay> italian
and probably greek as well <malay>sebab tu pun dah tinggal</malay> quite <malay>lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu</malay>
(um) <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh]
I
I wish I can say <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> seriously
<malay>belajar</malay> music but
but
but quit <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> I I don't have the same passion <malay>untuk tahu</malay> what's behind the system
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> not not as fulfilling but
by by time
(mm)
<malay>atau</malay> maybe about
(um)
<malay>nak cakap</malay> lack of audience <malay>pun tak juga</malay> [ah]
even <malay>dekat rumah pun</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> not as motivated [lah] <malay>untuk untuk pegang</malay> musical instruments
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
just in case <malay>tapi kalau dah beli</malay> then <malay>tak main</malay>
<malay>bodoh juga</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] my other resolution
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay> [ah] before this <malay>kita</malay> depend on performance and
[ah] fully on music then
if we have side jobs <malay>yang</malay>
work from home
then <malay>tu macam</malay> bonus but by by the end of last year <malay>dia dah</malay> turn to the other way round
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>memang</malay> more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way [lah] because I <malay>tak selesa pun untuk keluar</malay> and perform and <malay>jumpa orang</malay> in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still <malay>nak ada</malay> event <malay>takut juga</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> new year resolution <malay>apa yang dah boleh tiru dah</malay> I <malay>punya</malay>
(um)
greek
I I
<malay>berasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak belajar</malay> japanese <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> food wars <malay>tu tapi</malay>
better <malay>untuk</malay> focus <malay>dekat</malay>
one or two language first [lah] before ventured out
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god ya
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> so far italian is not that hard I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> catch up <malay>balik</malay>
(mm)
[ah] and I <malay>suka sebab macam</malay> once you <malay>belajar</malay> italian you can kind of <malay>faham</malay> french as well <malay>dia ada kaitan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia dia ada kaitan</malay>
quite beneficial <malay>untuk</malay> learn that one language
<malay>sebab dia boleh</malay> branch out to <malay>bahasa-bahasa lain selain</malay> language to <malay>apa lagi</malay> you <malay>punya ni</malay> you <malay>punya azam</malay>
so
okay ap~ what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dia macam</malay>
(uh) I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore <malay>cakap</malay> the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself <malay>dia dah ada</malay> everything <malay>yang dia nak</malay>
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
I <malay>rasa</malay> it's not
a total shit show [lah]
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
and then ending <malay>pun</malay>
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya [lah] cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
(mm)
[oh] but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait [lah]
(um)
what else [ah]
you you you you decide the topic <malay>pula</malay>
if you go
the the
<malay>apa yang akan jadi</malay> in two thousand twenty one [ah]
[ah] two thousand twenty one
I <malay>rasa akan ada</malay>
a burst of
creative contents
for sure <malay>sebab</malay> in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
[ah] <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> musicians <malay>tak dapat buat</malay> shows
[ah] ya artist <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start <malay>macam</malay>
this this cannot
(um) go on for too long I have I have to do something to
to make everything better for myself [lah] <malay>sebenarnya</malay> especially if that's their only creative outlet
<malay>dia</malay> redundant it's very redundant
(mm)
but what about live shows I think (um) live shows <malay>pun dah</malay> start <malay>ada</malay> search <malay>juga</malay> because (um) G_L_C <malay>sebanyak yang</malay> start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay>
social distancing Q_R code scanning and everything so <malay>itu pun</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
(mm)
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
(mm) (mm)
natural selections
(mm) (mm)
I <malay>baca dekat</malay> twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
<malay>dia orang cakap</malay> your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
<malay>macam</malay> flu or fever side effect <malay>yang teruk-teruk</malay>
so I think I <malay>pun tak walaupun</malay> I <malay>takut jarum</malay> but I don't think I <malay>akan</malay> stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
(mm)
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay>
I mean even <malay>sekarang masa</malay> pandemic <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>dah tak ingat</malay> what happened in june in may
duolingo
(mm)
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic <malay>ni akan berlangsung lama</malay> and they cannot depend on skill <malay>yang dia orang dah ada</malay> so they have to broaden their horizon
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
okay can you explain <malay>pasal</malay> stoicism <malay>sebab</malay> I try <malay>baca tapi</malay> I <malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
(mm)
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> philosophy philosophical standpoint
[ah]
(mm)
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
(mm)
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature [lah]
(mm)
<malay>semua ni sebab</malay>
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you <malay>memang dah</malay>
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
<malay>benda ni macam</malay>
very personal because
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding <malay>tak sama</malay> so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
(mm) (mm)
I don't have any other interest
and the new age #plato#
(mm)
okay
once the border <malay>buka</malay>
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called [ah] the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
(mm)
the difference
I want to go to greece again
(mm)
[oh] in addition to that scandinavian countries
scandinavian countries <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama</malay> european
<malay>bukan yang yang yang tak payah</malay> stamp passport <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam</malay> schengen countries [eh] [oh] <malay>termasuk</malay> [oh] then why
[oh] ya ya
sweden
[oh] yes denmark
K [lah] hopefully next time
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>memang</malay> curious on how they can manage to provide
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
what about southeast asia or asia [lah] in general <malay>ada tak yang</malay> you <malay>nak pergi</malay>
<malay>ke kita memang</malay> western centric
euro centric okay my apologies
(mm)
(mm)
I think <malay>sebab</malay> I think the the the reason is because
(um) <malay>dia orang</malay> preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit <malay>macam dekat sini</malay> most of them are
in ruins
(mm)
[ah] you you cannot see with your own eyes
<malay>tapi</malay> asia I
<malay>nak pergi tak</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> indonesia but but but the parts <malay>yang kita tak pergi</malay> before [ah]
I think <malay>tu pun</malay> interesting and for some reason
I <malay>nak pergi</malay> thailand <malay>sangat sangat sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak dia punya</malay> street food
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] #kot# as for now
[ah] india but maybe <malay>bila umur dah lima puluh nanti</malay> [lah] #boulogne# and [lah]
(mm) <malay>selain tu</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi yang</malay> tesla <malay>buat</malay>
the space flight <malay>yang</malay> you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
running [eh]
[kan] they <malay>dia buat dia buat</malay> this (err) flight flight system <malay>baru yang mana</malay> you can travel across the world in less than three hours <malay>ke</malay> two hours [a'ah]
so I don't know if that is still running <malay>sebab dia nak</malay>
<malay>buat</malay>
<malay>benda tu</malay> affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years <malay>ke</malay>
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours !wow!
<malay>balik hari</malay> [jer] <malay>pun boleh</malay>
!wah! long silence very long silence
(uh huh) death to two thousand twenty
I <malay>suka</malay> that documentary
U_S centric <malay>tapi</malay> understandable [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> creator <malay>dia pun</malay> from U_S
but I think it's a good mockumentary [lah] to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one [eh] two thousand twenty
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam</malay> what do you want
and
you <malay>dah cakap</malay> you stoic so I <malay>dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu</malay>
(mm)
okay [lah] if if you could
be your younger self
<malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> change
(mm)
you know what do you have against schools [ah]
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm) I <malay>faham</malay>
(mm)
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] I think I learn more
<malay>kat rumah</malay>
[ah] <malay>dekat dekat</malay> internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually <malay>kat</malay> okay I mean form five <malay>pun</malay> I don't have
and I <malay>tak pakai</malay>
<malay>hujung</malay> form five I <malay>pakai</malay> iphone but before that I <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use [ah] but I
I <malay>lebih</malay> I I understand <malay>bila ayah yang ajar</malay>
but for you most of that internet [lah] [kan]
<malay>kena ambil</malay> to TOEFL [lah] <malay>lagi sekali</malay>
I think that will help a lot
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so <malay>dia</malay> expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until <malay>dia</malay> expire <malay>macam</malay> the last time I <malay>ambil rugi</malay> [jer]
[ah]
then <malay>sia-sia</malay> even if you <malay>dapat</malay> offer travel while once you <malay>nak masuk dia akan minta balik</malay> your TOEFL <malay>punya sijil</malay> then you have to take again
(mmhmm)
two thousand twenty one <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> start of the decade [kan]
<malay>bukan yang</malay> two thousand twenty [kan] last year was the ending
this [one] is the beginning okay
[a'ah] <malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks
<malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks but nothing happen
(mm) very anti climactic
okay [lah] I like new beginnings (um)
I <malay>pun takde</malay> expectation
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
<malay>tinggal lapan minit</malay>
that that [one] quite fast <malay>tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah</malay>
[oh]
<malay>boleh</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>harap</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't have any
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
poll <malay>sekarang</malay>
like <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak dia</malay> from <malay>semua benda sebab</malay>
in a way
I <malay>tak rasa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tadi cakap</malay> [lah] [ah]
afterlife <malay>punya benda kita tak tahu</malay> and it's not within our control [kan] <malay>dan ni pun sama</malay> it's not within my control so whatever happens happens [lah]
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
(um)
and
<malay>apa pun yang dia orang buat</malay> I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
you have yourself and people around you
<malay>tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I I'm quite positive about
this year
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> hopeless <malay>sangat</malay>
it's been awhile since I <malay>rasa</malay> hopeless <malay>dengan</malay>
the whole <malay>tahun</malay>
so you
institution
religion
<malay>agama kaum</malay>
[oh] <malay>kaum</malay> is a very sensitive issue
(mmhmm)
and I <malay>tak suka tengok</malay> Facebook comment
<malay>dia</malay> almost <malay>macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu</malay> you don't have any feelings at all
[ah] <malay>bangsa malas membaca</malay>
<malay>lepas tu tajuk</malay> everything click bait
[ah] I wish that <malay>kena</malay> change
<malay>yang tu kena</malay> change
[ah]
(mm)
but journalism <malay>yang</malay> spark head
<malay>orang yang malas membaca tu</malay> ya <malay>malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun</malay> they have to click in order to know the
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> nurse <malay>yang</malay> nurse <malay>yang yang ni</malay> infected <malay>tu dekat</malay> U_S <malay>yang vaksin</malay> (mm) (mm)
(mm)
and then <malay>kismis dan</malay>
that's my vaccine !wah!
(mm) <malay>tapi yang</malay> news <malay>pasal</malay> nurse <malay>tu</malay> very misleading <malay>sebab</malay> even if you take your first vaccine <malay>untuk dia sampai ke</malay> fifty percent immunity <malay>tu dia ambil dua minggu</malay>
<malay>dia kena</malay> COVID within I think <malay>hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu</malay> it's not even two full weeks yet and even <malay>kalau dah</malay> two full weeks <malay>pun</malay> not a full total immunity
second shot <malay>baru ni tapi</malay>
<malay>orang malas membaca</malay>
<malay>dia buat orang takut untuk buat benda yang betul</malay>
and <malay>lagi pun</malay> journalisms <malay>sekarang</malay> mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then <malay>jadi satu bentuk berita</malay> [ah] <malay>yang penting ada</malay> content ya monetisation and <malay>yang penting duit jalan</malay> K
<malay>tapi</malay> content <malay>memang tak</malay> best <malay>langsung</malay> especially because the audience <malay>dalam</malay> Twitter and <malay>dalam</malay> Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
(mm)
[oh] <malay>dah ni</malay>
<malay>lagi satu minit</malay> there's only one minute left
[ah] <malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> settle you click right [ah] tick [ah]
(mm)
okay [lah] <malay>macam tak rasa sangat</malay> can speak one hour <malay>macam tak</malay>
[ah] [ah] I wish I wish we can talk about something new [lah] (mm)
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K [lah] thank you
okay
yes happy new year
ya [lah] <malay>dua ribu dua puluh</malay> we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
[kan] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>masalahnya</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> resolution <malay>pun dah tak tercapai semuanya</malay>
ya true
(err) of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything <malay>yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap pasal</malay> redo back everything <malay>sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada</malay> I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight [lah] <malay>memang nak nak tu~ turunkan berat badan</malay> [lah] <malay>harap harapnya macam tu tahun</malay> target [eh]
this year target <malay>nya lebih kurang dalam</malay> maybe fifteen K_G ya
(uh huh)
serious [ah] <malay>sihat ke kalau macam tu</malay>
(uh huh)
yes
[oh] I cannot do the skipping <malay>sebab dengan</malay> spine issue [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> skipping <malay>nanti patah pula tulang belakang</malay> so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya achievable so I would say that <malay>kalau</malay> fifteen <malay>maksudnya dalam sebulan kena</malay> target at least two K_G [lah]
<malay>tapi tapi sebenarnya</malay> one K_G half <malay>pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu</malay> [lah] <malay>lebih kurang</malay>
ya so that's another thing [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> vegetarian [kan] <malay>macam</malay> ya before this <malay>sebab baru</malay> adapt to vegetarian so <malay>banyak makan</malay> processed food [lah]
actually adapt <malay>tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi</malay> I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>sebenarnya tak boleh</malay> so I was thinking of this year <malay>kalau boleh nak jadi</malay> vegetarian and grow my own food like <malay>tanam sayur ataupun tanam</malay>
<malay>tanam sayur</malay> [lah] basically <malay>kita orang dah tanam benda lain</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] any~ anyway
ya how about you how about you what is what is your resolution <malay>untuk tahun ni</malay>
(uh huh) (uh huh)
ya the real world comes
okay
(uh huh)
okay alright
okay
for business <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>apa apa</malay> the idea business <malay>yang dah ada buat masa ni</malay>
(uh huh) okay
<malay>apa dia lagi sekali</malay>
I see surprise delivery <malay>menarik</malay>
I see so the surprise part [lah] <malay>yang betul-betul</malay> make meaningful
(mm)
I see I see
okay
(uh huh)
I see so <malay>macam mana sebelum</malay> delivery <malay>ni dia akan ada macam</malay> set set <malay>dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh</malay> customise <malay>ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu</malay>
[oh]
okay <malay>faham</malay>
[a'ah]
so basically <malay>ni macam</malay> (err) profession~ <malay>macam bukan</malay> professional <malay>dia macam lebih kurang</malay> special customisation [lah]
okay <malay>tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam</malay> (uh) food based <malay>ke ataupun</malay>
[oh] interesting very interesting I see I see so <malay>berap~ berapa lama dah</malay> start
[oh] okay [lah] okay <malay>maksudnya dah ada</malay> customer [ah]
[oh] !wow! ya ya ya ya <malay>sebab</malay> ya [lah] <malay>sekarang ni orang pun suka</malay> [eh] <malay>macam boleh pergi</malay> surprise delivery <malay>lepas tu boleh hantar</malay> [eh] <malay>boleh</malay> share <malay>dekat</malay> Insta [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>betul</malay>
I see
(mmhmm)
I see so it's not just it's not just [oh] I forgot the date and I want to send it over I just send something it's not like that [lah]
I see so
I see interesting it's interesting so <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nama</malay> the surprise delivery service <malay>ni apa nama dia</malay>
[oh] !wow! okay <malay>kotak riang</malay> so <malay>kotak riang</malay> basically like <malay>macam</malay> gift (uh) box of happiness [lah] box of happiness
okay okay okay <malay>betul betul</malay> new year resolution [lah]
healthy food what what is the what is the meaning of the healthy food what kind of food
so <malay>mak~ dia sendiri</malay> [oh] okay alright alright like like less carbs [lah] less carbs
konjac #mee# [oh] the one without calorie is it okay okay
(err) I've read about it once ya I know
maybe I should be your customer then
how okay you know talking about healthy food usually healthy food used to be very plain and dry and [oh] my god taste like medicine
so what do you have for now <malay>ada tak benda-benda yang</malay> ya it's still give you some happiness in the world <malay>tapi</malay> healthy [lah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow!
I see <malay>tapi</malay> sugar free how is that achievable even
ya ya ya but but but that's interesting because
why so many people didn't manage to do the resolution like losing weight or anything like like in my own case because all the healthy food [oh] my god
it's terrible
<malay>menarik menarik</malay> so (err) healthy diet healthy food
basically ya [lah] <malay>macam kita pun tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>punya</malay> issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat [kan] [ah] so ya <malay>penting</malay> [lah] very very important [lah] <malay>untuk</malay>
in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and I will be your first customer
<malay>tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah</malay> when you get rich I will be the first person <malay>yang</malay> you have to <malay>belanja</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>aduhai</malay>
[oh] resolution <malay>lain</malay> apart from losing weight I would say that okay [lah] <malay>dia macam satu</malay> we have to look at the whole system [lah] [kan] I started with trying to eat
healthily [kan] I want to (err) I want to lose weight so I have to live live (err) I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just <malay>kita nak kurangkan berat badan</malay> is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet [kan] most of the thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak</malay> [tau]
especially <malay>sayur</malay> [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> I was thinking of and <malay>kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam</malay> supermarket
[kan] so we didn't know <malay>pun macam kita</malay> opt <malay>untuk</malay> healthily <malay>tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat</malay> so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya [lah] (mm) <malay>kita tahu</malay> economically <malay>macam mana</malay>
<malay>macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar</malay> with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal I was thinking of I want to save more money (err) ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt [lah]
[a'ah]
how is that
like for YouTube channel on planting food I see
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
[oh] interesting
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya <malay>sekarang ni ramai juga</malay> [kan] <malay>orang</malay> monetise <malay>daripada</malay> YouTube [kan] and then ya <malay>betul betul</malay> and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
<malay>betul betul</malay> okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>orang kata tanam</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi sebenarnya ca~ nak tanam pun ada cara</malay> [kan] ya ya ya
ya interesting (hmm) okay <malay>boleh boleh masuk dalam</malay> resolutions <malay>seterusnya</malay> okay
ya [kan] so I'll be like
(err) healthy and rich
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so <malay>cakap pasal</malay> healthy and rich [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> sum up [lah] the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word [lah] <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya apa</malay> one word <malay>yang</malay> will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
!wow! [oh] okay alright alright <malay>maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni</malay> the the timeline the the stories not good <malay>yang</malay> you need the plot twist
okay
okay
<malay>untuk diri sendiri</malay> [eh]
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person <malay>macam</malay> it ya maybe with better networking <malay>kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh</malay> bring it forward [kan] ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself [lah] I would say that two thousand twenty <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
<malay>tak jadi apa-apa pun</malay> so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the wo~ kind to the world [lah] like environmentally more friendly [lah]
so that's the idea
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>apa lagi takkan tu</malay> [jer] <malay>apa lagi</malay> share [lah] resolution
okay alright
that's right
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm) ya ya
you you become a boring person [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) what what kind of me time like <malay>pergi</malay> bowling <malay>macam tu</malay>
I get cho~ give me some example on that
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah ada</malay> and then you want to enhance <malay>ataupun</malay> like new skill
because you don't have the money at that time is it
okay what is that I'm I'm so interested to know what is that
[oh] okay musical you have the artistic side [lah] deep inside okay
alright alright
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like <malay>jadi</malay> ya <malay>jadi pemain</malay> guitar [oh] my god
so funny I didn't know you keep it until this this year
I see but not guitar anymore [lah]
I see I see that's interesting that's interesting so (err) you you didn't have any basic yet for piano is it
[oh] alright
(uh huh)
I see but you were in primary is it
[ah] okay ya <malay>masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama</malay> I didn't really update
I see interesting interesting
ya piano is very elegant anyway
then
but but somehow piano i~ like <malay>ini dua benda yang berbeza</malay> [tau] mostly guitar <malay>punya</malay> song it's like metal you know very hard [one] piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it <malay>juga makin besar makin matang</malay> you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
(mmhmm)
okay
I see so with before this <malay>kak long pernah juga ada</malay> idea <malay>macam nak</malay> enroll class [tau] and of course I want to also look into <malay>yang macam</malay> elegant elegant <malay>ni</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>cuma kenapa bukan</malay> piano <malay>sebab</malay> piano requires some set up [lah] then <malay>tak dapat berlatih kat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> so I was thinking of <malay>beli</malay> ukulele <malay>ke</malay> violin something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you [kan] <malay>kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak</malay> wind <malay>punya apa ni punya</malay> instruments you need a whole band <malay>baru dia akan menjadi</malay> or you <malay>main</malay> trumpet <malay>sorang-sorang macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan</malay> spo~ Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward <malay>tu</malay> clarinet that's clarinet so it will
[ah] Squidward [kan] so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
interesting okay [lah] basically [kan] <malay>macam kita boleh tengok</malay> [kan] sometime our education system
focus on more maths science <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] art art is very important human very connected to sap~ any beautiful things be it the beautiful things <malay>tu dalam bentuk</malay> visual <malay>ataupun</malay> audio [lah] <malay>macam</malay> music [kan] because somehow that makes us
(err) be more empathy [kan] <malay>dan buat kita</malay> more human [lah] and in your own case [kan] <malay>macam memang buat</malay> hard science <malay>buat</malay> maths [kan] (err)
at the end you will turn to robot [lah] if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] okay so piano so that's the skill <malay>yang</malay> basically dream [lah] <malay>belum belum</malay> start [ah] do you have any skill <malay>yang</malay> just you want to enhance [lah] <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah ada sat~ dah ada</malay> base base[lah]
how about that
<malay>ataupun</malay> something [lah] <malay>selain daripada</malay> skill (err) musical skill <malay>ada</malay> skill <malay>lain tak</malay>
[oh] mandarin why why mandarin
but mandarin is kinda hard though because <malay>tak silap</malay> mandarin [kan] <malay>dia ada macam empat</malay>
<malay>empat macam apa</malay> [eh] <malay>apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi</malay> something you know
(mmhmm)
ya that's the thing <malay>sebab</malay> basically ya <malay>bila kita boleh</malay> connect to to a person <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> mother tongue it will be <malay>lebih ni</malay> [lah] [kan]
ya ya <malay>lagipun kita pun</malay> multi racial I think it's best <malay>untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga</malay> [kan] <malay>betul betul</malay> interesting interesting
(mmhmm)
offered

so <malay>orang selalu tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>orang</malay> business <malay>ni</malay> at at the end of the success [tau] like the only the tip of the iceberg [lah] when ya and then <malay>macam kita pun</malay> jealous [lah] <malay>bila dia</malay> lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
I would say that I I have been in business for quite some time and it has been hell but somehow I didn't regret any of it [lah] because everyday I woke up I know that that's something I want to do
even though <malay>macam belum kaya lagi</malay> but there ev~ every single day I woke up
I look forward to it and
ya that is something I really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years [lah]
even though I would say that <malay>sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi</malay> it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself <malay>benda yang paling belajar</malay> is you need a good mentor
<malay>macam bila</malay> you <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah kaya ramai</malay> [jer] <malay>orang yang akan datang</malay> [kan] <malay>berpusu-pusu tapi</malay> basically <malay>kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul</malay> care <malay>ataupun</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> ride on us <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
ya that's the thing so <malay>cakap pasal tak kaya tapi</malay> means a lot <malay>sebab</malay>
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself <malay>adalah untuk selesaikan</malay> social issues like
<malay>i~ ikut</malay> [lah] issue <malay>nya</malay> about environmental <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] so because I do believe that in the in the in the <malay>keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan</malay>
<malay>kita perlukan orang buat</malay> business <malay>untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab</malay> if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work [lah] <malay>kita pun tahu</malay> politician have so many other things [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> I would say that business <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide like <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide ya <malay>macam cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>kerja untuk orang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide service <malay>diorang macam</malay> in your case you <malay>nak buat</malay> surprise delivery [kan] you <malay>boleh</malay> make people happy and so I would say that
business gives you more autonomy in some way
so at least you can do what you want
inse~ instead of ya [lah] I used to work <malay>juga dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> boss boss <malay>bukannya senang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita salah pun</malay>
<malay>kita bet~ salah memang</malay> confirm <malay>salah kita betul pun kita salah</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age [lah] <malay>untuk</malay>
try error <malay>jatuh</malay> explore ya explore
[oh] my god [oh] my god that that is interesting
I would say that
<malay>jangan ber~ jangan berhenti terlalu cepat</malay> sometimes you didn't know <malay>macam awak tengok</malay> [kan] business business <malay>yang dah berjaya</malay>
that take years then even just take even one to two years [lah] <malay>yang</malay> one to two years <malay>ni bukannya</malay> entrepreneur <malay>dia</malay> #grant-preneur# <malay>sebab dia dapat duit daripada</malay> grant [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> basically [kan] (err) <malay>orang perlukan</malay> at least six seven years <malay>untuk dia betul-betul ada</malay> strong base [kan] so if you stop too early
<malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>kita nak makan</malay> durian [kan] even though we already see the <malay>buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita bua~ ambik pokok</malay> durian [kan] <malay>kita sibuk nak makan</malay> durian <malay>nak makan</malay> durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit [kan] it's not going to taste good even though you <malay>nampak hari-hari tapi</malay> you <malay>kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> the the biggest thing <malay>ialah</malay> perseverance <malay>untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh</malay>
so I would say that
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening [kan] <malay>tapi</malay>
ya that's the beauty of it [lah] trying to hustle hustle and hustle until one day
you can enjoy the ripe durian
I also waiting for my durian to fall anyway ya
ya not too long two thousand twenty one that free hopefully hopefully
what <malay>kenapa apa ya~</malay> what what what was
[oh] so <malay>itu adalah</malay> interesting part I would say that
I really I really like him
as a lead as a lead charac~ actor because
he is a good actor [tau] so wha~ basically (err) <malay>sebenarnya</malay> [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [jer] <malay>cerita</malay> start up <malay>ni walaupun dia letak satu</malay> lead actor <malay>yang teruk gila tapi</malay> basically <malay>dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang</malay>
lead actor <malay>pun dah terlalu</malay> superficial [tau] <malay>macam terlalu hebat</malay> so <malay>sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda</malay>
so <malay>walaupun awak tak tengok</malay> character #nam do san# <malay>tu sangat-sangat</malay> loser [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically that's how people at thir~ twenties <malay>macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu</malay>
compare to someone <malay>yang dah macam</malay> #han ji pyeong# <malay>yang dah</malay> thirties [tau]
so <malay>tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang</malay> production <malay>ni pun tak sangka dia akan</malay> backfire <malay>macam ni</malay>
<malay>sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada</malay> synopsis [kan] <malay>ada seorang</malay> mentor <malay>yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat</malay> #han ji pyeong# <malay>tapi</malay> because he is a good actor himself <malay>yang membuatkan</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> move <malay>dengan perasaan dia sampai kita ras~</malay> <malay>sedangkan</malay> character <malay>tu tanpa tanpa</malay> interpretation <malay>daripada dia</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin akan jadi</malay> character <malay>yang sangat</malay> annoying
harsh <malay>lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi</malay> because (err) the actor himself [kan] put so many emotions on the face
!aiya! many conflicts (err) conflicting emotions <malay>yang kita tahu yang</malay> he is not bad he is just
<malay>ter~ tersakiti macam tu</malay> you know
(err) <malay>mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> when I think back and if I am mad at #nam do san# I would say that I'm mad at younger me <malay>juga</malay>
but still as a as a
<malay>nonton suka hati kita</malay> [lah] <malay>kita nak suka siapa</malay> [kan] that is our own right <malay>tapi</malay> I would say it's a good reflection [lah] it's a good reflection
three years <malay>pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus</malay> that's the thing
<malay>sebab yang lain ada</malay> character development [tau] the other two friends <malay>tapi yang tu macam</malay> stay like just like that
ya just just better <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> coat <malay>sendiri tak payah pinjam</malay> that's the only improvement made [kan] [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] !aduh!
okay <malay>ada lagi ke</malay> resolution <malay>untuk tahun ni</malay> anything [eh] <malay>untuk tahun ni</malay>
[eh] small thing [seh] <malay>yang buat benda jadi</malay> great and big ya
[oh] my god that's so hard
ya ya
procrastination
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya [lah] <malay>macam zaman</malay> study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute <malay>kadang-kadang boleh</malay> push you
like push you [lah] <malay>macam</malay> in the very last minute [kan] you <malay>boleh</malay> focus and sometimes your creative juice like <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> in real life [kan] when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as (err) <malay>ke~ persekitaran</malay> [lah] environment <malay>macam tiba-tiba</malay> COVID <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
procrastination <malay>akan</malay> backfire you compare to someone <malay>belajar yang</malay> it's just you and your assignment [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm) ya ya
maybe because you are a person <malay>yang</malay> work under pressure
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you <malay>kena</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> combine <malay>kerja</malay> you <malay>dengan</malay> team mate <malay>lain</malay> like just imagine if the team mate <malay>buat macam tu</malay> to you [kan] at the last day <malay>baru dia nak</malay> submit <malay>dia punya</malay>
so it's going to be difficult
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
yeah
drag yourself ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> procrastination
and somehow <malay>sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa</malay> [lah] procrastination <malay>ni pun</malay>
<malay>sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya</malay> social media <malay>juga</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> in my own case [lah] I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so <malay>itu yang menarik</malay> then <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada tengok satu</malay> documentary [tau] <malay>dekat</malay>
documentary <malay>dekat</malay> Netflix [ah] <malay>cerita pasal</malay> social network [tau] <malay>macam mana sebenarnya</malay> since kit~ since <malay>kita guna</malay> all this services for free [kan] <malay>macam</malay> Facebook and all those thing [kan] basically we are
<malay>pelik</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah</malay> customer [kan] <malay>tapi kita tak bayar</malay> so <malay>tu maksudnya kita bukan</malay> customer <malay>maksudnya kita adalah</malay>
data (err) their their <malay>modal macam tu</malay> [kan] so
so <malay>dia dah baca</malay> [tau] <malay>kita punya</malay> behaviour <malay>dia dah baca kita punya</malay> interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so <malay>macam dia tahu macam mana nak</malay> keep us hook <malay>kita tengok</malay> one <malay>lepas satu-satu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi satu</malay> !aduh! <malay>lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar</malay>
ya ya ya
<malay>macam fikir fikir contoh kata</malay> [oh] <malay>rasa nak beli katil</malay> [ah] <malay>tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar</malay>
[a'ah]
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us [lah] [kan] our microphone is always on <malay>kita tak pernah pun</malay> default <malay>untuk tutup</malay> [kan] somehow
ya
ya <malay>tapi maksudnya</malay> ya <malay>maksudnya kalau</malay> [lah] basically okay <malay>kalau diorang dengar diorang</malay> just feed us <malay>dengan</malay> ads okay [lah] <malay>tetap</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli</malay> [kan] but how about if bad people
peeking through your life from there
[kan] so ya
so <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam bila kita bila kita gunakan</malay> service <malay>ni</malay> for free [kan] for free
so <malay>kita</malay> basically <malay>menjual diri kita</malay> to them [lah] like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me <malay>sebab tu pencen~ penting kita baca</malay> like agreements and all term and condition
but I would
ya ya ya ya
<malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] like term and condition if you agree tick <malay>siapa pun nak baca</malay> tick [kan] <malay>kat situ</malay> that that's the thing
so
<malay>tapi takpe</malay> [lah] basically the basically the idea is <malay>walaupun kita tahu ap~ ap~ yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku</malay> at least <malay>kita tahu dia ambil</malay> so at least <malay>kita boleh jaga-jaga</malay> [lah] more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mm)
ya
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now <malay>macam dulu</malay> [kan] like ten years back <malay>kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa</malay> that is something like ridiculously happened [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
[kan] <malay>kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita</malay> (uh) <malay>cik boleh tak saya tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>saya nak tengok apa periuk</malay> (err) <malay>dapur macam mana ada</malay> hood <malay>ke tak ada</malay> hood (uh) ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of peop~ of other person [kan] because that person <malay>boleh buat</malay> live <malay>dekat dia punya</malay>
<malay>bilik</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
ya
ya
ya ya even [oh] my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched <malay>dia siap tunjuk</malay> the secret room
ya that's the ya
and basically [kan] <malay>senangnya sekarang ni</malay> with the technology <malay>ada</malay> the A_R <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik</malay> your plan house plan [tau]
<malay>hanya dengan gambar se~ sekarang pun</malay> technology <malay>yang ada</malay> with with pictures you take pictures you can even like <malay>kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat</malay>
okay so basically what if du~ during the house tour people screenshots screensh~ screenshot and redo back your house plan
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then <malay>macam nak masuk pun senang</malay>
yes and somehow this wealthy people <malay>pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan</malay> post so <malay>orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya</malay> rule <malay>dalam kita</malay> post social media <malay>ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh</malay> post <malay>pasal</malay> vacation after the vacation
yes <malay>sebab</malay> basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then <malay>curi</malay> [lah] <malay>apa saja</malay>
yes yes yes
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dunia sekarang</malay> different [lah] people
it's it's very interesting because people are less communicative
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing [tau] <malay>macam orang dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> communication <malay>nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>masa untuk</malay> interact [tau] so you really have to all out [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> people nowadays [kan] <malay>dia</malay> neglect
<malay>organik punya</malay> communication <malay>tapi dia boleh</malay> share every single thing about <malay>dia punya</malay> life [kan] <malay>tapi bila orang</malay> judge <malay>dia marah pula</malay>
<malay>orang tak</malay> like <malay>tak tak tak bagi</malay> reactions <malay>pun dia marah</malay> [kan] so
so okay <malay>cakap pasal tu</malay> that's there's one more [lah] one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution [lah] twenty twenty one [oh] my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone [tau] so I was like <malay>macam</malay> I want to segment [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa</malay> is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> check <malay>tu</malay> actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then <malay>macam</malay> then all the video sometimes is (err) ridiculous (err) like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
so I want to segment [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>dalam masa tiga jam ni</malay> I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] that's the idea
okay
<malay>macam</malay> quota [ah]
(mmhmm)
!wow!
[oh]
just imagine in the middle of cute cat video and then it stop [kan]
[oh] you can ignore [lah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> parental parental control <malay>yang terus</malay> off [oh] okay okay
just just to remind you [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam guru</malay> discipline something like that [kan]
<malay>tapi ada</malay> apps [tau] <malay>untuk buat benda tu</malay> which is very interesting I just download it [lah] <malay>macam nama dia</malay> forest [tau] so <malay>macam bila</malay> you start the apps [kan] you <malay>kena</malay> set [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak buat kerja berapa lama</malay>
okay so <malay>dia ada beza</malay> [tau] <malay>tiga puluh minit dia punya</malay> shrub [jer] <malay>kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok</malay> [tau] <malay>kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah</malay> [tau]
so basically [kan] <malay>dia untuk bantu</malay> you <malay>untuk</malay> (err) focus so you <malay>buka</malay> app you set <malay>tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja</malay> [kan] so you <malay>tak boleh buka</malay> apps <malay>lain</malay> you <malay>kena tutup dengan</malay> apps <malay>tu sahaja</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>tiga puluh minit</malay> you access your phone <malay>pokok tu akan mati</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi kalau kalau</malay> you <malay>buk~ kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan</malay> notify you okay <malay>pokok tu dah hidup</malay> and basically everyday you have a patch of forest <malay>untuk dibangunkan</malay>
yes very interesting so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> basically [kan] <malay>dia bagi kita</malay> award <malay>macam dia bagi</malay> reward [lah] reward <malay>macam</malay>
okay so <malay>kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> so depress
[a'ah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
ya
ya
<malay>betul sebab manusia ni sukakan</malay> acknowledgement <malay>tapi takkan kita nak suruh</malay> ya yes
<malay>takkan kita nak suruh mak kita kata tahniah empat jam</malay> [kan] it's just like boss <malay>datang</malay> okay congratulations four hours [kan] <malay>tak</malay> logic [ah] [kan]
that's very intriguing [seh] <malay>tu satu benda</malay> forest <malay>ada satu lagi</malay> [tau] interesting <malay>juga nama dia</malay> sleepy town so <malay>apa yang kita buat adalah</malay> (err) <malay>kita</malay> set [lah] <malay>satu hari kita nak tidur dalam enam jam</malay> [kan] <malay>so bila nak tidur kita buka</malay> apps <malay>tu dan tutup</malay> phone <malay>dengan</malay> apps <malay>tu</malay> on on running [lah] okay
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>bangun dalam masa</malay> you <malay>dapat tidur tujuh jam ataupun</malay> you <malay>bang~ pasal</malay> you <malay>tak</malay> access phone <malay>dah lepas</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> set the alarm [kan] you <malay>akan bina</malay> the town
sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping [lah] so you will enjoy it when you so <malay>dia lebih daripada</malay> quality life [lah] so <malay>macam</malay>
interesting I ya [lah] <malay>saja</malay> [jer] <malay>nak tengok</malay> apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep
sometimes I already sleep [tau] <malay>tapi bila bangun terus nak tengok</malay> phone <malay>sebab nak tengok sekejap</malay> [jer] end up [kan]
<malay>mula-mula</malay> [jer] yes end up Netflix <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> so basically <malay>dia memang dia memang ada</malay> design <malay>untuk bagi orang</malay> hook
and <malay>tapi kita kena</malay> take back the power [lah] we have to unhook all that
okay (uh huh)

<malay>ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang</malay> instead of <malay>bela anak</malay> [kan] maybe <malay>sebab bela binatang lebih bagus</malay> [lah] #kot# <malay>dari bela anak</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab bela anak ni</malay>
yeah maybe sometimes <malay>diorang</malay> inve~ investment so
ya ya ya
<malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh] my god zombie apocalypse <malay>tapi agaknya sam~</malay> okay [lah] ya zombie apocalypse <malay>tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa</malay>
I don't know I I have seen the video people <malay>cakap</malay> the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I would say apocalypse <malay>akan berlaku</malay> so be it zombie or not but still [ah] <malay>kata</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers [tau] <malay>macam menarik</malay> [ah] <malay>orang yang boleh buat</malay> bunkers <malay>kat bawah rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> because you want to save peop~ save your family [lah] at least and <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak payah tak payah</malay> zombie [lah] <malay>an~ apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada</malay> food ration
and then at least <malay>ada</malay> survival skill [kan] let's say [lah] <malay>kalau berlaku</malay>
disasters [kan] actually zom~ zombie apocalypse <malay>akan</malay> leads <malay>kepada</malay> disaster [ah] <malay>dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah</malay> [ah] [kan] <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] so (um) <malay>kita kena ada</malay> survival skill
let's say <malay>kalau macam mana kita nak</malay> (um) <malay>menyorok kat mana</malay> [kan] <malay>ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab</malay> ya [lah] so far <malay>nak cakap pasal</malay> zombie <malay>ni kita tak tahu</malay> zombie <malay>tu macam mana</malay>
there's so many kind of zombies some zombies are dumb and slow some zombie are very fast so I don't know [lah] which zombie will come first so that's the that's that's
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see [kan] can only (err) listen [ah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] so <malay>tak tahu cuma</malay> I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared [lah] [kan]
let's say <malay>kalau</malay> zombie <malay>semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita kena</malay>
[ah] <malay>duduk dalam air</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air</malay> at least <malay>kita kena</malay> basic <malay>macam</malay> rafting <malay>ke apa macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya it's not zombie [ah] we call it B_O_B bunk out bag <malay>dia macam</malay>
(err) bag <malay>tu ada cukup</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> something happened <malay>ada macam</malay> first aid <malay>macam ada</malay> dry food and then <malay>macam</malay> (err) your details <malay>pasal</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> your blood <malay>semua</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam kalau orang jumpa</malay> you <malay>terbaring ke apa</malay> you <malay>ni tapi kita panggil</malay> bunk out bag [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> ya but <malay>kalau kalau kita cakap</malay> zombie kit <malay>tu orang akan rasa</malay> [oh] it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie [kan] but actually (err) disclaimer <malay>sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja</malay> [jer] [lah] it don't have to be zombie let's say [lah] <malay>kalau ada orang masuk rumah</malay> you yes war we don't we never know [kan] <malay>macam</malay> even though <malay>kita rasa</malay> everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year <malay>yang buatkan apa pun kita punya</malay> resolution <malay>tak tercapai tu</malay> [kan] so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so (mmhmm)
okay
ya
ya
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it [lah] so <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> overseas [kan] <malay>orang akan macam ada</malay> N_D_A [kan] non disclosure [kan] <malay>macam tu tapi macam</malay>
I would say that <malay>berapa pos~ berapa</malay> probability <malay>dan</malay> possibility <malay>dia</malay> [ah] then <malay>macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya</malay> contractor <malay>tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam boleh berlaku tapi</malay> I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> maybe [ah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> for now I would say that if we <malay>pun orang akan rasa</malay> [oh] this for safety
but for people <malay>yang macam</malay> influential [kan] let's say say it's (um)
(uh) artist celebrity politicians [kan]
but
ya <malay>kalau dalam</malay> movie <malay>kalau macam</malay> mafi~ mafia <malay>ni kalau orang tu buat</malay> bunker <malay>untuk dia dia tembak</malay> [jer] <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] [ah] of course [lah] we cannot do that [kan]
<malay>cakap pasal rumah</malay> it's very interesting [kan] how ya people try to customise house [kan] <malay>macam buat</malay> secret room <malay>macam buat</malay> bunker and now people <malay>sekarang macam buat apa</malay> #catio# <malay>untuk kucing</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>macam buat</malay> hub ya
cat is like social media [ah] hook you [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mmhmm)
why because cause you don't want them to go in the house anymore is it then
okay ya [lah]
ya ya ya
and make them you know that's the thing (err) we call it like cat nourishment [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cats used to live in the wild <malay>tapi kita yang</malay> bring in the home [kan] so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is <malay>kejar rama-rama</malay>
things like that [kan] so that is <malay>tapi kalau ada rumah</malay> the first thing I want to have is swimming pool [lah]
okay
seriously you want to hi and things <malay>waktu</malay> swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least <malay>bukan semua baka</malay> [lah] maybe some some breed can [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I would say bengal <malay>ke apa yang yang</malay> very wild one [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically <malay>kalau perasan semua kucing berenang</malay> most of them <malay>adalah yang</malay> short hair
ya instead of long hair [ah] <malay>macam tu sebab</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then <malay>tak dapat macam</malay> wiggle wiggle <malay>badan dia</malay> how dogs do it [kan]
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place <malay>untuk macam</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> yoga with all the sun you know because somehow [kan] <malay>kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai</malay> mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then <malay>kita</malay> most of the time stay at home working at home as~ and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D [tau] but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight [kan] so I was thinking <malay>kalau ada rumah</malay> [kan] in the middle of the house I want to make sure the <malay>dia punya dinding tu</malay>
(um) made from glass no no made from glass so <malay>dia dek~ dia dia</malay>
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight <malay>macam tu</malay>
ya ya glasshouse glass house
like <malay>buat</malay> like igloo style so <malay>macam</malay> #dok# <malay>macam macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>kubah macam tu</malay>
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> during this trying time [kan] <malay>macam</malay> ya every new year <malay>pun kita buat</malay> resolution [kan] <malay>pastu kita buat</malay> plans and everything because we want to look forward in life [lah]
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>macam</malay> and most of dreamers <malay>pun orang rasa macam</malay> crazy people in the beginning [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau tengok</malay>
<malay>macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik</malay> wright [kan] the the the wright brothers [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> when they want to fly things <malay>siapa</malay> [jer] <malay>yang setuju</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> now that is <malay>diorang punya</malay> determination <malay>tu yang membuat</malay> we can cross country [kan] <malay>kita boleh</malay> experience things on the other side of the world
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay> I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected [lah] <malay>dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat</malay> heavily affected
<malay>sebab</malay> ya [lah] <malay>diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak</malay> operate [kan]
[oh] <malay>tak boleh langsung</malay> ya then most people <malay>yang kerja dalam</malay> industry <malay>tu diorang adalah macam</malay> skillful people <malay>tapi</malay> in one area [tau] so <malay>diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain</malay>
(mmhmm)
I see and I would say they are very good in emergency response [kan] I see
ya that's interesting like paramedics <malay>pun boleh</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> like basic basic [ah] <malay>menarik menarik</malay> so ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
because <malay>senang</malay> [kan] <malay>kit~ bila orang kena</malay> lay off <malay>ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena</malay> lay off <malay>sekarang sangat</malay>
<malay>dan</malay> somehow apart from <malay>dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan</malay> industry re~ re~ revolution industry [kan] <malay>bila</malay> everything's automated <malay>semua benda pakai</malay> robot <malay>pasal dia akan</malay> take away our jobs [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba kita berlaku</malay> economic <malay>punya macam ni yang yang merudum</malay> [kan] so
ya it's going to be very very difficult to most people [lah]
and ya
<malay>sebab itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita buat</malay> business #kot# [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>bantu orang</malay> maybe provide more jobs to people [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> the economy have to run [lah]
ya
ya because somehow <malay>dengan ramai orang kena</malay> laid off employer <malay>pun ada banyak sangat pilihan</malay> so the competition is very very high
yes yes most most business are barely surviving
<malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
and <malay>cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada</malay> business [kan] [lah]
I would say that <malay>kesan besar kepada</malay> education system <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> kids nowadays I would say sometimes se~ <malay>bagus juga sebab orang dah mula</malay> adopt online learning <malay>sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan</malay> interactions
<malay>dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam</malay> universities [kan] some universities are (err) fully (err) ke~ fully on online platform [kan]
<malay>tapi bila kita dekat</malay> university <malay>kita bukannya hanya belajar</malay> theory <malay>dan kita punya</malay> subject <malay>tapi</malay> life lesson <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kita belajar</malay> communicate <malay>kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi</malay> [kan] so all that <malay>adalah</malay> very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some ho~ some~ sometime <malay>boleh juga bagi tapi</malay> I don't know how much the impact will be towards the buil~ character building
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
even though they are tech savvy (mmhmm)
ya <malay>betul betul</malay> ya
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> friends <malay>adalah orang yang</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> choose ya [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
you <malay>boleh</malay> choose and su~ and <malay>boleh</malay> align <malay>minat dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] compare to <malay>ni</malay> then ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> same [eh] <malay>macam</malay> peer [kan] <malay>macam</malay> sa~ same age peer <malay>sangat sangat penting untuk kita</malay> associate <malay>untuk kita faham</malay>
<malay>dan sebagainya</malay> so
ya <malay>akan jadi ada</malay> impact <malay>yang besar</malay> [lah] <malay>kepada</malay> characters building <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dalam keadaan yang mencabar</malay>
ya just imagine before this <malay>pun</malay> graduates <malay>susah nak dapat kerja</malay> because
it's a very competitive market [kan] and now <malay>kita ada</malay> so many
(err) talented people <malay>kena</malay> laid off and compete together with them
ya <malay>macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay> compete each other <malay>pun dah</malay> hard enough and then <malay>kena</malay> compete <malay>lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun</malay> experience it's not going to be easy
<malay>tapi</malay> new economy <malay>pun akan terbuka</malay> [lah] <malay>macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi</malay> influencer [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> ya like influencer <malay>pun boleh</malay> give money
(uh huh)
!wow!
<malay>dah lama</malay> [kan]
life goal [lah]
<malay>cuma bahaya dengan</malay> being influencer <malay>ni</malay> sometimes they are not being human [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
and they ya and <malay>diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu</malay> social status <malay>yang</malay> sometimes unachievable <malay>kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar</malay> [kan] <malay>untuk bagi nampak</malay> abs <malay>nampak kurus</malay> sometimes it's just about angle
then people <malay>yang</malay> see that they didn't know <malay>pun itu adalah</malay> angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that <malay>sedangkan</malay> all that is just an illusion is a diff~ it is just an different angle [kan] camera trick that's the thing sometimes
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi lebih mencabar</malay> [lah] <malay>kat kita punya</malay> youth <malay>kalau keadaan macam ni</malay> ya [lah] lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
(mmhmm)
ya even big brands <malay>pun sekarang dah</malay> start to work with influencers instead of artists <malay>yang memang buat</malay> art [tau] <malay>berkarya</malay>
okay [lah] somehow artist people <malay>diorang</malay> charge <malay>memang terlalu mahal</malay> [kan] and influencers <malay>dia ada ca~ dia ada</malay> bigger fan base
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya <malay>faham</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>dan</malay> arti~ artist <malay>dan</malay> actress <malay>ni dia terpaksa</malay> produce something <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>baru orang boleh</malay> look up to them [kan] compared to influencer <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>pergi makan pun orang suka</malay> [kan] <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>pun orang suka</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam cuma tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh</malay> set rea~ unrealistic thing [ah]
so !fuh! <malay>banyak juga kita borak ni</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> resolution <malay>cerita pasal</malay> zombie apocalypse <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> so ya hopefully <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>yang penting kita</malay> start <malay>sekarang buat sekarang macam</malay>
ya <malay>boleh</malay>
it's going to be a tough year but it's going to be interesting and fun [lah]
yes hopefully okay
(mmhmm)
<malay>untuk</malay> family [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> family (err) I would say that more collaborations <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] before this I would say that I live on my own [lah] <malay>pun duduk macam jauh</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> I want this family to be more collaborative like <malay>masak sama-sama</malay>
<malay>buat kerja sama-sama</malay> and even though <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu</malay> you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one [kan] even though of course [lah] <malay>macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically [ah] but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
(err)
<malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>kita pun kena bergerak sebagai</malay> family
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay> how about you <malay>apa yang</malay> you (uh) foresee for as a family <malay>punya</malay> movement
(mmhmm)
(mm) even the silly silly stuff [lah]
ya true true
<malay>aduhai</malay> okay [lah]
ya
ya ya ya hopefully [lah] <malay>macam</malay> and it don't have to be far <malay>pun</malay> but at least places that we can
just leave the work behind and just connect as a humans [lah] as siblings as
daughters and son and all ya [lah]
okay <malay>jom rasanya</malay>
<malay>rasanya</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>kita</malay> start put in the planner <malay>ataupun buat</malay> vision board [kan] <malay>letak dekat dalam let~ sham~ semua lawa-lawa</malay> [kan] and <malay>satu benda lagi</malay> it's good [tau] actually <malay>bila kita</malay> tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us [lah]
(mmhmm)
ya because when we say it [kan] <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> at the end <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> at the end of the year <malay>nanti macam</malay> [eh] <malay>apa jadi dengan</malay> <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
I was looking through our the booking right
then <malay>aku</malay> realise
<malay>mahal</malay> [sia] it's like seven hundred dollars for the one that we are going ya is because it's the <malay>apa</malay> last week of the year [what]
[kan] then <malay>aku tak tahu macam mana</malay> like we need to have more options I guess
ya okay
but unless we go for the <malay>apa</malay> [ah] smaller rooms [ah]
because the one that I found was
that one <malay>untuk yang</malay> the suite room so <malay>aku rasa macam besar sangat</malay> I mean we don't really need a that big of a room right no but I think can go for the smaller rooms
the same place because
okay (err)
<malay>aku rasa boleh</malay> [ah] but I think it's about <malay>dalam empat ratus gitu</malay>
<malay>aku rasa</malay> [ah]
ya but what's your budget
hundred plus [ah] below two hundred should be okay right
ya I think <malay>aku rasa</malay> for now <malay>empat orang</malay> but
ya I think only four [lah] right
unless dylan joining I'm not sure
ya so (err)
but I'm checking my friend like cause my friend got the (uh) call (um) membership
so he got discount [lah]
ya
that one is sofitel is at #tanjong pagar#
very near [what] the hotel I mean I mean you can go I mean it's around cit~ there's a lot of cafes there also [what]
ya
ya I think it's all nearby there [lah]
ya technically I don't know also what to do
ya but we need to decide soon [lor]
yup
the price confirm <malay>makin mahal</malay>
it's gonna keep on surging until like new year I guess
ya [lor]
ya [oh] ya my company just say like they might not close for the week so I might have to take leave ya
but then I think I'll take the whole week [lah] I see how [lor] technically I got no leave
zero
again okay last year ya [oh] ya last year we had the what
botanic gardens theme [ah] the boy <malay>bunga</malay> theme
ya no but whenever #tanjong pagar# theme
don't know
I don't know O_L [lah] maybe O_L theme
[oh] ya are we doing gift exchange also
we haven't plan this yet
[oh] ya <malay>dia belum</malay> decide right
ya
[oh] really [ah]
from which (err) supermarket
prime is hard to find you know there's only like <malay>berapa</malay> [jer] <malay>dalam</malay> singapore <malay>ni</malay> [tau] <malay>nak cari</malay>
ya
#sheng siong# #sheng siong# also hard [sia]
I mean you see my area around down here there's no #sheng siong# the nearest is #bukit panjang# mall
giant [lah] since we just with brandon
[eh] last year we did giant
!aiya!
[eh] N_T_U_C ya ya N_T_U_C
so what
ya I remember the cause I think N_T_U_C got more things to buy
<malay>kipas</malay> [oh] it's at terrence's house now his house got two fans you know <malay>sebelah-sebelah</malay> [leh] like one black one white I don't know why if you want both right the whole dining table that can fly away like that it's so strong
<malay>bodoh</malay>
ya <malay>bodoh</malay> so big [sia]
ya so what is just the four of us [ah] #xing jing# [oh] no with the others right because we doing dinner <malay>dengan yang lain-lain</malay> [kan] <malay>malam</malay> so
(mm)
who's the free one [ah]
can you plan
please
<malay>kau</malay> plan [lah] then <malay>kau bilang kita</malay> then we will just decide I mean we will just a vote
you have to be codes
ya they <malay>bodoh</malay>
this is not chinese new year
this is christmas so <malay>tak payah</malay> #lohei#
dinner
I think dinenr can go all out [lah] I guess not all out as in <malay>macam terus</malay>
<malay>apa sakan</malay> [ah] but more like a
but now buffet very irritating [ah]
no there is there is buffet but you cannot like it's not serve [lah] I mean like it's not open and you have to order from them so it's like a la carte kind so you keep on ordering from them then the <malay>makanan</malay> will <malay>dia ada</malay> server will send to you yes I know right ya so I think it's not a good time for buffet
ya
but buffet town though
you know there's the the one that just got halal buffet town ya cause they got very nice salmon head like grilled salmon head
ya it is
(mm)
he <malay>kena</malay> bullied
what what do you mean location <malay>kena</malay> change you mean the buffet town run away or what
is it I there's only one buffet town I think it's at raffles city
I know
[oh] ya buffet town got not vegetarian option though maybe have I don't know
cannot be go buffet you want to eat salad right
ya
[oh] ya but they haven't confirm their attendance also
for the dinner <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> [eh]
okay
(um) terrence I haven't check with him yet <malay>tapi aku rasa</malay> maybe <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> because that week he's going back to school already
[oh] ya true also
I mean if we're not going to into phase three anytime soon I think
did you see the news yesterday
they say like because of the
trace together like the
there's only fifty percent right now like people using it and the token collected and they need to be at least <malay>macam tujuh puluh</malay> percent <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> go to phase three [lah] so
ya so it looks like not going to phase three anytime soon
yes
and then we cannot book separate table also cause technically we are not allowed to
no they don't allow but because of that [lah] they're afraid intermingling so actually by right you cannot book
more than five even though your request for separate tables only unless you are a family members [lah] <malay>yang tinggal dalam serumah</malay> right
ya
different timing
ya
can
okay also like like terrence friend have a christmas <malay>punya</malay> dinner [kan]
so what they did was because they I think got there's fifteen of us
so they separate into three different sessions
so got the lunch session teatime session and dinner session
precisely [lah] I mean you cannot meet [lah] but
so <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> like
ya
ya so I don't know whether we are still going on with the dinner or not
[oh] ya just five of us [lah]
without partners [lor]
(mm)
that time you did right like the four five of us
last meet up it's just five of us [what]
korean ya that [ah]
#farin# birthday
[oh]
[oh] yes
ya I mean just let them let them tell their partners [lor] that
#bo# #pian# [lah] [kan] <malay>macam tak boleh apa</malay>
ya
ya so I think the dinner one is settled
I mean technically it's not even a <malay>macam</malay> public holiday on that day right
so they don't have to spend it with their partners anyway
twenty nine right you say or twenty eight I mean it's the night of the
staycay right
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
ya okay
I think he never go there before so you should be safe <malay>dia tak ada</malay> benchmark <malay>untuk tempat tu</malay>
ya
(um)
at west he can come
but he only come at night after work [lah]
then the next morning he will <malay>aku rasa</malay> go to the work straight
ya
(mm)
ya [lor]
so the tuesday morning <malay>aku rasa</malay> he has to go back to work [lor]
monday right
is it really
ya
[oh]
okay I thought it's monday and tuesday
you
!hais!
okay [lor] we shall see how then we need to dig up more
ya
cause I remember I ask my friend for monday tuesday <malay>punya</malay> time slot I mean (err) rates ya
then he say it's like seven hundred [oh] my god like the one the I bought was only four hundred [sia]
ya because it's technically already the end of the year already a lot of people doing staycation so
you know right technically there's nowhere to travel also everything is expensive here
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay> taiwan
you are in a cold room
!whoa! but luckily I went taiwan [sia] just before lockdown
ya
(err) not as good as that one we we went that time
ya it was that one I go on march it was <malay>macam sejuk</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> just like aircon kind yes
on some days it was quite hot actually but some days it was quite nice then ya
but that was a stressful trip
!hais!
!hais! ya
ya
[eh] but I heard the vaccine are coming in right so I think
there should be the light already like at the end of the tunnel
T_P_E
(um) ya
but you know the that time the who say [ah] which minister
the he say <malay>macam apa</malay> like
he's not going they are not going to <malay>macam</malay> vaccinate everybody <malay>kat</malay> singapore
like it's only like selective like they're not going to do a mass vaccination
ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> save <malay>duit agaknya</malay>
ya
so I think we have to queue to get vaccinated kind
probably [lah] elderly maybe the front liners
ya
it's probably like those flu vaccine vaccinations [lah] wait those are compulsory right
ya may~ maybe they make it compulsory but not so soon
I don't know
but until then I don't think we can travel [lah]
want to give up
ya because I think singapore is the safest now one of the safest ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
was there [lah] [oh] my god
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> purpose [kan] I mean at home technically don't wear mask also
so <malay>kalau anak dia dapat mak dia dapat</malay> they can just spread to each other [lah]
(err) they have another issue to tackle there [oh] my god
(mm)
are you talking about succulent
[oh] cactus cactus <malay>yang kecil-kecil gitu</malay> [eh] then
[oh]
<malay>dua</malay> cactus
the normal one cactus
no the normal cactus <malay>yang besar dia ada</malay> thorns then <malay>macam bulat-bulat gitu</malay> and <malay>dia punya</malay> shape
straight then <malay>bulat-bulat</malay> [eh] right ya isn't it a normal desert cactus
succulents are technically not from a desert I think
that's okay welcome to the plant world
<malay>kau siak</malay> [ah] !hey! <malay>mahal pokok tu</malay>
(mm)
[oh] I don't think that you can probably survive in our climate though
as in real life okay I see
what [sia] cardboard
[oh] what
<malay>kau tanam pokok</malay> durian [jer] [lah]
I mean even though you don't eat durian but
ya
!hais! anyway I have an assignment on an essay [lah] so I need just (err) your your point of view [lah] I guess
(mm) it's about (um)
locked down like
like they say like they are more problems than benefits when it come to lockdown like
it affects a lot of thing
like so I don't know what do you think
kind
I mean
the experts say [lah] the lockdown causes more <malay>macam apa</malay> problems than benefits ya
why
(mm)
ya
true [leh] ya ya
ya but
no no it's usually quite sudden kind a week before at least I guess
(mm)
ya
(mm)
good [what] lockdown good [what] I was enjoying the C_B period
(mm)
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
so you feel that there's more societal problems [lah] rather than businesses businesses still okay right
thirty to
[oh]
ya
(mm)
okay but I think there's a benefit to that you know because like these forces are entertile~ but like enterprises this small enterprise right
they go digital like because like the government has been like I feel [lah] like always been pushing
S_M_E all these to go digitalisation but nobody's doing anything like but I think this lockdown really pushes everyone to just straightaway go and
like to and what embrace digitalisation [lah] so I think it's quite good in a way like
ya
ya she can straightaway (err)
<malay>macam dulu dia tak pakai</malay> grab but <malay>sekali</malay> now [oh] I need to have a grab account like you know so it
it pushes them to do it [lah] rather than <malay>kau tahu macam kalau tak ada</malay> COVID like everybody is still
<malay>macam</malay> oodle the oodle eats like that ya it came out about during C_B also got famous because of this so
okay [lah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya [lah] #alhamdulillah# I need the money so what's the problem
ya but but they are given trainings you know and they were even even like given grants and money <malay>untuk</malay>
to avoid this (err) to convert their platform store into online platform [lah] so
<malay>aku rasa</malay> okay [lah]
(mm)
true I mean you will lose your human touches also [lah] right I guess ya but also the thing like this lockdown like
a lot of people just start their own business like a lot of H_B_B now like because of a lockdown so I think
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam macam semua orang jual apa jual apa</malay> what's that famous thing they make during lockdown
everybody become a chef <malay>kat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>semua buat</malay> #dalgona# coffee <malay>macam kau</malay>
okay ya I think so then like societal I think also got benefits like
(err)
I think it brings families together
kind
<malay>macam</malay>
you will just stuck at home with your family [lah] you got no choice but just to interact <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> like
that's all [lah] like
so
ya
I know
but although yes I agree that it can be quite a challenge because like <malay>kalau kau baca</malay> that time the news they say like domestic abuse cases on is on the rise was on the rise because
not every family can get along [lah] hundred percent get along so
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
all the one she studied at the corridor that one right
ya probably
ya I can imagine like those like
staying in a rental apartment with like nine or ten family members in one !wah! then
ya
right ya
(mm)
ya obviously
ya
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I think right another benefit right is definitely their environment like have you seen like you go out during C_B it's like a jungle out there
I mean it's such a good time you know for everyone to heal for the world to heal like
ya
you think your floor will the grass will be three second on the floor already
ya you know what I mean
ya definitely bro
they are better [lah] because you know carbon footprints were reduced [lah] I mean
not a lot of cars were out there
that the biggest benefit [lah] of the lockdown it reduces like reduces the
cases like at the very enormous straight [lah] like just
ya
ya
ya
okay [lah] at least they are well taken care of I hope coming from what we see on the news I think they are quite well taken of just that I think
the problem lies because they are being locked for too long so it cause a lot of emotional and emotional distress [lah] I would say
ya so
ya
ya you can't visit [leh]
ya I mean what can you do also right
ya
(mm)
ya
then <malay>aku rasa</malay> like I think they <malay>dia orang tak</malay> concentrate more much on the emotional part of a lockdown like they just implement without thinking of
maybe they did [lah] like factor in this issue
but they just don't know how to tell singaporeans how to manage their emotions I mean
but it increases like distressed like emotional distress and see like people are going crazy you know
probably probably that one is like not a priority I guess I don't know
I mean during the C_B even like <malay>dia punya apa</malay>
not counsellors [lah] what what is it calling
<malay>orang yang</malay>
counsellors is it not counsellors
ya it's not even consider essential at that point like they can't even work ya they have to work from home and go
ya so
so it's not even essential at that point so ya
so they don't really care about that part <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but
ya
(mm)
I know right I want a bit longer
ya I mean this is probably the once in our lifetime we have this I mean hopefully yes [lah] but then not expecting more
ya ya ya
I mean in this lifetime you can say that we have a point alive and everything just reset like the whole world reset ya
during our time
ya probably the start of a new civilization
ya [eh] can you think for me anymore problems or not for lockdown I need to write my essay
societal business and emotion is under society [lah] I guess
wildlife or nature sorry yes
you just any problem right
I think there's nothing to argue about it I think when you the problem can be like you walk in a grass then touch touch your leg
mosquito because of overgrown right all these then they bleed mosquito remember the this case [lah] on the rise during C_B
ya but because you don't trim this grass then all this leaves you never clear it except all these leaves and
can collect water [one]
no there is there is so tiny dot on the water you never dry out right
can breed mosquito [one]
it's true okay [lah] but that's not really a problem I guess
it just go without the track [what] [sia] <malay>bodoh</malay>
ya but I think the biggest benefit now is in china the this
all the the la~ the animal trade the exotic animal all this
they have to really
the businesses have to shut down [lah]
like before this there was there wasn't any like regulation on exotic animals in china
but at least it's one step ahead I feel [lah] at least now there is a rule before there's really no rule at all
so whether they enforce it or not ya
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] confirm <malay>ada</malay> [lah]
ya
you know but the article say like twenty thousand farms were forced to close and shut down I think that's a good start like twenty thousand farms like a lot [leh]
is it
aren't we not at the top
[oh] we're not the predator
I don't know
the animal kindom we are probably one of the lowest [lah]
but we have brains though they got no brain I mean they have brains but they are not intellect
ya I mean they they can do always fight for survival defining this thing in nature
ya
ya okay
no okay then I think it'll be issue also imagine like this twenty thousand farm closed down already these animals where do they go you know like
they're gonna released back into the wild it's gonna cause like a major disrupt to the ecosystem then <malay>macam</malay> suddenly <malay>kau dalam hutan tu kau</malay> introduce <malay>monyet kau</malay> introduce pangolin <malay>kau</malay> introduce lemur <malay>pelanduk</malay> I don't know what or it released dolphin into the forest you know
ya so what's gonna happen to this animal
<malay>pergi mana balik rumah kau</malay>
ya <malay>ni bukan</malay> library [tau] <malay>kau taruh lepas tu kau taruh balik kat tempat asal kau ambil</malay> [tau]
it's that not easy you know
that they can't give the animals like tickets to go home on themselves
they probably gonna like
I don't know
or maybe they do a clearance sale I don't know
everything must go right I mean I don't know like
there's also the vail is not releasing back to the wild I guess I mean it you can visit back to the wild but
you have to know where to put it back to [lah] but it's not possible [lah] per se
[oh] my god
[oh] that one that they kill all the animal [ah] but cause the one all is affected in~ infected with the coronavirus [what] ya yes yes
they carry it on their body
so it's spread through the minks
so they have to kill or <malay>macam</malay> that one [lah] like what chicken flu like that [eh] bird flu chicken flu
they have to kill all the the chickens [mah]
I think until now nobody knows where it's from right
ya
<malay>sekali</malay> coronavirus from plants [leh]
yes
<malay>apa apa merepek kau</malay>
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya inside the middle [ah]
(uh huh)
ya ya ya isn't that the cheese (err) [ah] swiss cheese plant
stop it [lah]
what's your other plant how's your other monstera doing your current monstera
but you at the me~ at the latch right
what's the per buying put it outside
put back inside
five times [leh]
what is a prayer plant
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but monstera is an indoor plant [what] right
it's just need a little like
sun
I thought you need the evening sun or something
(mm)
ya
ya
technically they are bushes [lah] weeds
ya so you have been blocked by the trees right they are being shaded right
ya
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
not really [leh]
ya
no but first life I think very short always wilt [leh]
<malay>kau masih</malay> [tau]
but you know I was talking to one of terrence friend he study plants he's like a farmer [lah] but he's not farmer but
he said actually all these plants right
when they say like it's good for your
(err) the air the in the room all these I actually just flexible if that kind like because they don't emit enough to actually cause a a difference like unless you have like ten hundred like a hundred monstera in your room kind then yes you can feel so actually one of this talk [leh] like it doesn't make a difference actually
ya so you just make yourself feel better
good job ya that's fake by the way
cause the sun ever come in so we come back and rear plants
but need a bit of sun also [what] light can [ah]
ya
mother in laws tongue
ya I know
<malay>dah mati ke</malay>
can [ah]
ya probably can [lah] I don't know
I don't know it just grows short [lah] from small to big [lah] I guess shoots ya
!hais!
I only need to buy one plant <malay>untuk taruh dalam</malay> office <malay>aku</malay>
no [oh] my god that one
<malay>mati kesian benda tu</malay>
but actually <malay>mati</malay> a very terrible death to do
ya [sia] <malay>kau teruk</malay> [sia]
then we got scraping <malay>benda tu</malay>
no [meh]
I thought you called spraypaint to do or something
yup
[ah]
(mm)
the humidity very dense right very cold
you're not the plant you don't what it's feeling should we die during night you know like screaming in pain for like the next eight hours
but know all you think about is aesthetics you don't care about the plants feelings
I think the safest plants are those you see in the office
offices that have plants right is safe because it's been tested to survive in office (uh) condition which there's aircon and not enough sunlight kind
!aiya! the typical <malay>kau tahu jemputan selalu dapat pokok tu dia orang taruh kat pasu</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> coconut tree but it's not
what is it called [eh] <malay>yang</malay>
it's not coconut tree <malay>yang pokok-pokok yang</malay>
fern <malay>gitu</malay> is it look like a fern
!aiya! very the
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] serious
I think you know if you see but don't know what plant is discovered but it's a very common plant
ya something like that
ya usually events that kind of <malay>pokok</malay> [lah] you know like those
standard <malay>pokok</malay> I don't know
it's the typical <malay>pokok</malay> at events you know
!aiya! you don't know [one] [lah]
why
cause iron can scoop you can put your steak on it
(mm) [oh] my god
(mm)
yes that's one thing <malay>pokok pisang</malay>
!hais!
(mm)
spray is it then
(mm)
[ah]
ya ya of course you can't pour on the leaf though
(mm)
ya
okay technically it's commercial so they have to make it last for very long the water I guess
no as long as you do drainage right it's okay ya because in awhile also [what] if rain you can't stop the rain right ya most of the time it's drainage so you cannot cover the base like what you did that time go plastic wrap at the tulle scotch tape
(mm)
no depend not off plus you can do that or not
I guess I mean you can go out plant
(mm) ya
ya you can't water you everyday if not will die [sia]
(hmm)
[oh] my god it's so expensive though
it's like I don't know the price
ya you better up your green fingers first
enough [lah] too much plants [ah] mosquitoes moving around
you got a lot of mosquito then a lot of ants all those and insects start coming in
because you talk the wildlife standard plant standard issue plant [eh]

okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay [lah] that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
petty a petty reason for me to dislike someone would definitely be his his or her <malay>punya</malay> (um)
(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not dis~ not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
okay [lah] be~ okay okay okay <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>orang tu nak</malay> hang out <malay>dengan</malay> I right <malay>tapi dia macam</malay>

but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
(uh)
[ha] okay
<malay>apakah</malay> okay wait wait wait
<malay>ceritakan suatu pengalaman yang sebenarnya lucu tetapi mungkin tidak lucu pada masa itu</malay>

you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house

what do you think of the house [ah]
!huh!
ya ya what do think of the house [ah]
(mmhmm)
keep talking [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean for me ya [lah] I mean it's I do feel
I mean once in a while like I do feel <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>sedih</malay> that
<malay>yang apa ni</malay>
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
I mean certain things you like a bit <malay>sedih</malay> right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah]
ya
your your your your new phone <malay>masih banyak</malay> battery [kan]
you just get <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health <malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know
(um)
ya [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [jer] [ah]

I sometimes I just just sometime sometimes I <malay>tengok</malay> the <malay>gambar semua</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> like
you know cannot believe that <malay>macam tak percaya</malay> that
you know we started off from here
and it became like one

(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like <malay>tukar</malay> and then <malay>cakap bahasa melayu</malay>
you know <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way <malay>nak cakap melayu</malay> all the way because
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pep~ pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay>
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay> means like I'm about to cry you know like I'm about to
I'm about to really go dri~ deep
with my feelings but when I say I'm expressing like I just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when I say I <malay>nak luahkan perasaan kat</malay> you [ah]
<malay>maknanya</malay> I <malay>macam ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cakap sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena</malay> (uh)
<malay>nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena cakap</malay> [lah]
then <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> <malay>macam berat sangat</malay>
<malay>macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal</malay> !wah! see
<malay>janggal</malay>
you do~ you <malay>tak tahu makna janggal</malay> you <malay>teka makna janggal apa</malay>
just <malay>teka</malay> [lah]
yes ya
<malay>janggal maknanya</malay> awkward
yes
[eh] no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
<malay>jap jap jap jap</malay> let me check <malay>yang ni</malay>

don't know okay okay I <malay>tanya lagi</malay> [eh]
<malay>sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu</malay>
pe~ <malay>koalan~ soalan pertama fahamkan anda</malay>
you <malay>faham tak</malay>
no <malay>kemahi~</malay>
<malay>kemahi~</malay> (mm) okay <malay>mahir tu apa</malay>

<malay>serta-merta serta-merta</malay> is immediately ya or instantly [lah]
right <malay>sekiranya anda boleh serta-merta meraih tiga kemahiran apakah kemahiran-kemahiran itu</malay>
I'm asking you
if you can okay if you can attain three skills if you can instantly attain three skills what would those would those three skills be
being frugal is not a skill
a skill what can you do with your hand
(mmhmm) okay
why
(uh huh)
[ah] okay
(uh huh)
<malay>mana</malay> [lah] I <malay>tahu</malay> you <malay>tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>diri sendiri</malay>
okay I'm go~ I'm actually going to attempt to speak malay in this [ah] okay <malay>kemahiran yang pertama yang ak~ yang ingin saya</malay>
<malay>yang ingin saya</malay> [oh] my god what is that thing
[eh] <malay>mana dia</malay>
[eh] <malay>jap jap jap jap kemahiran yang pertama ialah</malay>

I believe
okay
okay
okay <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
<malay>suatu hari</malay>
<malay>anda bangun dari tidur dan mendapati bahawa anda telah menjadi seorang pelakon</malay>
<malay>siapakah pelakon itu dan mengapa anda memilihnya</malay>
okay
<malay>pelakon</malay>
<malay>yang saya</malay>
(um) <malay>memilih</malay>
[ah] <malay>ialah</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
<malay>siapa yang jadi</malay> spiderman <malay>yang barunya yang</malay> the latest one tom holland ya
<malay>saya ingin menjadi</malay> tom holland <malay>kerana</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) <malay>sungguh</malay> (um)
(uh) talented
I have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)
that <malay>dia muda</malay>
<malay>saya ingin menjadi muda kembali</malay>
(uh)
<malay>muda dan</malay> (uh) <malay>berjaya</malay>
ya tom holland
<malay>bagaimana pula dengan anda</malay>
<malay>pilihan</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay <malay>kejap jap jap</malay>
okay (um)
[eh] <malay>jap jap</malay> you know what I want to <malay>tengok</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your brother <malay>hantar</malay>
then <malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
ya <malay>satu jam kena berbual satu jam</malay>
just <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>satu jam</malay> the no okay the thing is I think what the
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) wheth~ how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now I'm speaking in english and then suddenly I <malay>tukar</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> you <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
I think <malay>saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila</malay>
<malay>yang paling mustahak ialah apabila</malay>
<malay>dan kenapa</malay>
<malay>dan dari situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>memberi</malay> (uh)
<malay>kesinambungan</malay>
<malay>bagaimana</malay>
<malay>dan apabila</malay>
(uh) <malay>diorang diorang ingin</malay> (um)
<malay>diorang ingin mengetahui</malay>
<malay>cara-cara</malay>
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes woul~ okay what I find such studies very interesting because they alw~ like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to feed~ you have to you have to understand because
nec~
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as m~ as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this conversa~ is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk <malay>ni semua</malay> we don't really
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where I can just easily go in go out <malay>nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap</malay> english <malay>cakap</malay> english
and
then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] but the fact that <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> certain words <malay>macam</malay> like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like <malay>macam</malay> !alah!
ya
ya <malay>macam dia macam tak</malay> natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes <malay>lagi dua puluh minit sahaja</malay> okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I <malay>nak tengok yang</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your your brother <malay>hantar tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] I'm glad that they that the <malay>yang</malay> [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
<malay>nasib baik tu yang benda tu</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dah habis</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
ya <malay>rumah kita besar</malay> [sia]
yes
[a'ah] <malay>macam lama</malay> [sia]
no [lah] I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> first first christmas
to fully <malay>pindah</malay> but I mean we can slowly live there
my things I'm gonna <malay>letak sikit-sikit</malay> [tau] I'm not gonna like one time go there I'm just gonna put things bit by bit because I <malay>takde kotak</malay>
I probably gonna take a few <malay>kotak</malay> and all that for of course office
<malay>muat ke</malay>
[oh] <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] ya
I really <malay>suka</malay> the <malay>yang kitanya</malay> flooring flooring <malay>kita cantik</malay>
ya
[ah] [oh]
<malay>yang yang kerusi belakang tu kena</malay> screw [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>semua</malay> [ah] <malay>semua kena buat</malay> [ah]
if <malay>ikat</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam kelakar</malay> [eh] <malay>takde</malay> T_V <malay>kat dalam bilik ni</malay> [eh]
[ah] [sia] <malay>besar</malay> [seh]
I mean <malay>kita boleh pergi</malay> later
we can go later we can go tomorrow
!wah! [eh] the counter <malay>tak cantik</malay> [ah]
yup
no [lah] <malay>kita kena let~ kena kena letak dulu</malay> [pe] [oh] <malay>takleh</malay> [eh]
okay so okay
!ee! best [lah] I <malay>tengok</malay> I I I <malay>tengok</malay> the kitchen best [seh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh]
I think the kitchen <malay>cantik</malay> [ah] like after we <malay>letak</malay> after the <malay>apa ni</malay> the
<malay>dia</malay>
ya
after <malay>dia letak</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap</malay>
I think the whole idea <malay>yang</malay> [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
I kinda like it though
<malay>ye ke</malay>
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] <malay>ini diorang boleh</malay> spray [eh]
okay
so <malay>yang ni nanti nanti</malay> next few days <malay>baru pasang</malay> [ah]
<malay>kena tunggu benda tu kering</malay> [eh]
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
<malay>besar sikit</malay> [tau] <malay>tebal sikit</malay> actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya <malay>lebih tebal sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
if were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be [ah] <malay>ni ni</malay> quest~ <malay>ni ni soalan</malay> best
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
<malay>pilihan pertama</malay>

!wah!
okay clap
hello hi #madir#
I'm okay
<malay>aku penat</malay>
a bit <malay>penat</malay>
I think the reason would be
if he
like
smells bad
I don't know like
<malay>tak se~</malay> I mean like sometimes the
if someone is <malay>busuk</malay> and then like
I mean you think like the person <malay>tak mandi</malay> like is poor or what <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know
ya
<malay>abeh kalau orang tu</malay> (uh)
hang out <malay>dengan</malay>
you like wants to hang out with you do you still
okay
ya I mean
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>sekali pergi</malay> dating with my friend
with my date
and then like we (uh)
we were walking
<malay>sekali dia kata dia</malay>
<malay>nak</malay>
<malay>sakit perut</malay>
<malay>abeh dia kentut</malay>
and then
he shat she shat in her in her pants
so like we have to find a toi~ like a toilet nearby just to
wash [lah]
yes and throw away the underwear and everything
ya
<malay>kat katong</malay>
after dinner we were like
<malay>tengah jalan-jalan</malay> and then like because like had a huge I mean like big dinner
ya [lah] and then want to <malay>jalan-jalan</malay> to just to keep (uh) keep the food down
<malay>abeh te~ tengah jalan-jalan sekali sakit perut</malay> and the <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>terkincit</malay>
how about you
okay
is it still recording
I think the house is quite nice
I mean I love it it's very homely now like
like <malay>macam</malay> it's a it's a home [lah] I mean
like you feel like (err)
it very it's very comfy and cosy
like you can <malay>ajak</malay> your friends <malay>semua datang</malay> and <malay>lepak</malay> and can do stuff like
ya I mean no need to go out and everything
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya as I started to <malay>angkat</malay> the T_V like from my current house to that house I also feel <malay>sedih</malay> like
it's like I'm really like <malay>tinggal</malay> this I mean like leaving this house leaving my what
[ah] with my parents <malay>semua</malay>

it's not even your fault [sia] it's not even your yo~ you and simon's fault you guys are like preparing for it and then like had had it been (uh) how it was planned I feel like it wouldn't be this stressful or this difficult by now like everything should have settled down you know like the <malay>majlis</malay> are over like you get <malay>duit salam</malay> you know
I told #aqil# I had no expectations like <malay>kalau dia nak kahwin kahwin</malay> [ah] but other than that I'm just thinking at my own time [ah] cause like I'm not trying to find someone to settle down to start a family with like
of course <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak nak macam</malay> okay I need to find a man <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh kahwin</malay> no it's like I want to find a man that I love and then slowly everything will (uh) fall into place [lah] like if y~ if we <malay>kahwin</malay> then <malay>kahwin</malay> like but ultimately I feel like (uh) it's important that #aqil# and I learn about each other first and like trust each other and like be accepting [ah] of one another
so like we end up finish right now where we're just trying to figure each other out so <malay>pelan-pelan</malay> [ah]
[oh] you know you know he's so cute he was like when are you going to be my girlfriend like officially my girlfriend
(err) like a couple of weeks ago cause I tell him like by default I feel like we are boyfriend and girlfriend
because we are exclusive <malay>kita tak cakap</malay> we we <malay>kita tak berbual dengan orang lain</malay> like we love each other like we see a future in each other <malay>tapi</malay> (um)
I still have this need to officiate it
and then he was like okay at the end of the year
ya ya
at the end of the year cause like he says that he wants me to focus on school and work like he doesn't want me to worry about this
so he say [ah] like let's celebrate or officiate (um) <malay>hujung tahun</malay>
so I was like I guess can take it as a test like I don't know like just wait it out and observe
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] babe but there are certain things that I'm still not used to I <malay>tak biasa</malay> like him looking at my phone
he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> text he must see me <malay>siapa</malay> call
I'm not used to that and then he's like I <malay>nak tengok</malay> your gallery I was like is this what my friends do his eyes are all (ugh) in my mind like low key I'm still like single because like mentally like I'm trying to like you know
get myself there and tell myself like I'm in a relationship
never I never tell him this yet
ya
[oh] right so anyway like in december he <malay>kata</malay> like he wanna get promise rings that he says that he want to get promise rings for us like start working towards marriage and then I <malay>macam</malay> [oh] then he <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] actually <malay>dia dah</malay> start saving like he's very (uh) thrifty like
he doesn't spend like he really saves you know like he can really save money and like that's one thing that I like admire about him [lah] he's very responsible spender so like he saying that he has already started saving money then I was like [oh]
just like
I think it's quite cute [lah] like how sure he is of me
ya
you know like he told me right (um) the last girlfriend [ah] he never they never officiate the relationship like after a few months of dating she was like you're my boyfriend right and then he told me like in after one month less than a month of me and him like seeing each other he he felt so sure of me that he wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend that he ask me directly you ca~ do you want to be my girlfriend I was like [oh] so like i~ to him it means a lot [lah] that he ask me then I was like [orh] okay
then
ya
that's why he says he's really sure of me
(um) also like I feel like honestly deep down I still have unresolved issues you with #hassan#
me I still have un~ unresolved issues with #hassan#
like a lot of things happen because of him like <malay>macam</malay> me and my parents like ya like me and my parents
ya we're still not talking [tau] babe
then I was really sad cause during my birthday <malay>dorang tak</malay> wish I (um)
happy happy birthday
never wish me then but they bought me a cake
they they bought me a cake at nine P_M then they say we waiting for you to come home to cut cake but actually I went sleepover !wah! I felt like the shittiest daughter ever [sia] babe
but it's okay
ya ya ya they bought me a cake
so like that's the thing there's so many like [ah] loose threads or like (uh) consequences on some like those aftermath of me and #hassan# that I'm still trying to figure out because I don't want to go into a new relationship with #aqil# and have like all these things unresolved like if I want to be with #aqil# I want to be with #aqil# only and not have like [oh] this is because of #hassan# that's because of
like what happen in the past and all that
then on like on the low key I still care about #hassan# like sometimes I wonder like is he doing okay and all that
I
I know like I know he's an adult like I know <malay>dia boleh jaga diri dia sendiri dia dah besar</malay> like he'll be fine but on the low-key I still like think about him sometimes like is he okay like is he eating well is he like
take care of himself
I think so [ah] because like he was a great boyfriend [sia] babe only things m~ things messed up after the relationship
so like I was so sure of #hassan# [ah] I wanted to fight it out fight it out for him [oh] my god okay I <malay>nak bilang</malay> you something [ah] yesterday yesterday <malay>semalam</malay> I told #aqil# this I say I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> #aqil# (um)
I went through a lot of shit
for the past like couple of years like since last year [ah]
and to be honest right I'm so glad it happened because I got to meet you
like I really felt that way [sia] babe like
like the thing with #hassan# all that shit that went through like I went through with the other guys like
I will go through it a million times knowing the fact that I'm going to meet #aqil# and this is going to happen
ya
it's so crazy like how like at peace I am with how things ha~ like how things (um) <malay>tertulis</malay> [ah] [lah] like is everything <malay>tertulis</malay> [what] like
how things play out
ya but it's just like only time [ah] babe only time will tell like the outcome of with me and #aqil#
<malay>belum</malay> I <malay>belum</malay> delete I still I still <malay>masih ada kat</malay> phone
<malay>dekat my</malay> phone
<malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I <malay>tak tahu asal</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> delete
I I <malay>tak nak tengok</malay> [ah] the <malay>gambar-gambar</malay> like it makes
okay
thank you babe like you just
factory restore it's not on my laptop it's on my phone and you just delete everything
but I have some things that I want to keep like myself and friends
<malay>kau nak</malay> but
ya I don't know [ah] like
I mean I really really hope #hassan#
everything will work out well for him because I really still want him to be happy he deserve happiness [ah] babe he's a good guy
I mean during the relationship [lah] after that I don't know what happened
right
(uh) after after #hassan#
cause you were still with #audi# and then like we went out remember you me #hassan# you me #hassan# #audi# ya
ya
honestly right I have this theory that sometimes like people suppress their true colours or their true form and they become someone else that they think that the partner like prefers ya and then when things don't work out their true form like comes back
the~ like you think you know someone until like they don't have feelings for you anymore and then you will really know who that person is
I feel so [eh] babe
(uh) like when he was with me he was like before me he was very like (um) cold like he's very (err) like
a~ [ah] very action [ah]
like he's a very action person I feel like it's because it's like it's like defence mechanism like it doesn't let anyone in he doesn't he's not friends with just everybody like h~ he picks his friends very picky with his friends and then like (uh) when me and him started hanging out he became more friendly he become more open and more like outspoken and all that
and then (err) he became less judgemental
and then when we start we stop like being in a relationship we broke up he became that person that I kinda saw in the starting of the relationship
so I'm just like then I wonder [ah] like how long can a person actually suppress themselves like what if you get married to this person
that's like trying to be <malay>macam</malay> they are trying to
be someone that they're not
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (um) <malay>dah kahwin</malay> after a few y~ after a few years <malay>dah penat</malay> like pretend to be someone that you're not
then their true form comes out !wah! scary [ah]
deep talks okay where's the malay lines let's put in some malay in here
[ah]
okay
<malay>cakap melayu</malay> [lah] okay so <malay>itu saja tentang</malay> #hassan#
[ah] <malay>tentang</malay> #hassan# <malay>dan</malay> #aqil#

I think it'll be fun
[orh] yesterday (um) we saw #aqil# [ah] class like classmates schoolmates at marina barrage then they're like h~ he was with his girlfriend [oh] my god the girlfriend <malay>cantik gila</malay> [sia] I was like freak look like girl crush as fuck and then like (uh) ya <malay>melayu</malay> but she doesn't look malay I think she's mixed then
I like <malay>macam</malay> like I say hi [ah] but I like frozen a bit so tell I a bit shy cause like I'm flustered and then s~ #aqil# was like are you like shy then I was like no I just a~ I couldn't tell him that I'm like like I'm secretly crushing on your friend's girl
then [ah]
[ah] ya the the they were in the lot and then like #aqil# saw them then #aqil# was like [eh] and then he park near th~ th~ near their lot in their lot
ya
we bought like (err) Decathlon chairs so like we would like sit outside and just like look at people
because right babe when we <malay>duduk</malay> in the car #aqil# need to on the aircon and then it will run on fuel so like
!huh!
no he doesn't like because he sweats easily
I am not complaining [ah] cause I also don't mind the aircon his car anyway I <malay>tak</malay> complain [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>pun nak</malay> aircon the <malay>kereta dia</malay> anyway so a~ up to you [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> on aircon I okay [jer] you <malay>nak</malay> waste <malay>nak</malay> waste gas
<malay>nanti</malay>
he is a good guy
ya
ya
ya
(mm)
but I think one thing that I need to like (um) get used to is <malay>dia punya cemburu</malay>
<malay>cemburu</malay>
like his jealousy
ya like he tells me he's not a jealous person <malay>dia cakap dia tak</malay> jealous <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>cakap pasal</malay> like my guy friends or like #shah# #shah# [sia] #shah# is like the most platonic friend like he's the most respectful friend ever
then like he gets like kind of jealous then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] maybe because he doesn't have many like girlfriends and even if he does they're not good looking
like to me I <malay>tak</malay> jealous <malay>pasal</malay> like you can have as many girlfriends as you want
but as long as you know how to be loyal in a relationship and you know boundaries that's what's important to me
#firdaus# is an idiot
like to me it's like (uh) old friends that's fine if you h~ if you found a new girlfriend that [one] I'll be suspicious but old friends to me is like <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dengan dorang</malay> you <malay>dah lama dah dengan dorang</malay>
ya
so like the fact that you and <malay>dorang tak</malay> together that means like you guys don't want don't have anything [lah] between you
you know
we got seven more minutes
I <malay>punya</malay> timer five three two eight
how about yours
ya same
but honestly like I I'm also like
I'm also quite scared to introduce #aqil# to my family you know like that's that's one of the biggest fears
[orh] <malay>pasal</malay> #aqil# <malay>tak</malay> practising like he doesn't know the basics babe
<malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya his parents is not like didn't bring him to like classes or like
you know
I feel like kinda is you know why because he doesn't have the ba~ he didn't grow up with the basics
so it's kinda hard to like
I don't want to push him I don't want I want you to d~ like you know but one thing that kinda made my heart melt a bit was that day he was saying that he wants to talk like he's not scared of meeting my parents
he was saying like I love your daughter i~ I'm working hard [ah] to earn a a stable income and I'm also working to better myself as a muslim then I was like !oof! damn cause he <malay>dulu tak pernah puasa</malay> then he say for the last two years he's been <malay>puasa</malay> full [lah]
but he doesn't pray he doesn't know how to pray doesn't know how to like read stuff
so <malay>macam</malay>
okay I mean I don't want to be that girl who's like [oh] my husband has to be no I've never been like that I always feel like it's a joint effort like it has to be the both of them
and then sometimes I feel like #aqil# like morals also questionable
like he [ah] he's okay to drink he's okay to like
do stuff
but
then he will like judge people who d~ who do that also
especially practising muslim so <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] but <malay>macam</malay> I have friends who like drink but then they go <malay>solat jumaat</malay>
then it's like ya then it's not morals but I think it's more of like his view on people like <malay>dia dia punya</malay>
<malay>pendirian</malay> [ah] like <malay>dia rasa</malay> like it's okay for him to do it because <malay>dia tak</malay> practise he's not a practising muslim <malay>tapi kalau kawan dia buat kawan dia</malay> practise practise religion then <malay>itu salah</malay> so like I don't wanna ya so like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay like that's your view too
that's your opinion but
to me I've always been a to each their own kind of person like
<malay>gasak kau</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat apa</malay> you you <malay>dah besar</malay> you <malay>tahu apa salah apa betul apa</malay> so I <malay>tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>dia nak buat apa</malay>
not my responsible to~ to <malay>tegur</malay> you because you <malay>dah tahu</malay> all this you <malay>dah tahu</malay> and like <malay>siapa</malay> I <malay>nak tegur</malay> you know
ya
so I think part <malay>yang dia</malay> like in terms of i~ I'm just scared <malay>macam</malay> my parents <malay>ada</malay> high expectations on #aqil# like they
they <malay>nak ni nak tu</malay> then they will they will I scared they feel like #aqil# is not a good enough person to like
can be my husband which is not fair [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> they say that based on their own checklist when it should be on my checklist because it's for me
like I <malay>yang nak kahwin</malay> [pe]
ya
right
I think my my parents <malay>punya</malay> fear is also because like if I get married they're passing all their responsibility of me to that guy
so they are scared that that guy don't care about his responsibility on me not just like monetary wise not just like health but in terms of preparation for the after life [lah] like once <malay>kita dah</malay>
<malay>meninggal</malay> like you know that kind of thing
(mm)
<malay>macam tak</malay> sincere [jer]
your mum
ya
[eh] how's your mum is she okay
(err) I think december
like I would ask him to meet my parents first before we plan for what's ahead
and then
(uh)
most likely early next year
or mid next year
then if like in december if my parents are okay then we will like apply for house you know look for our <malay>macam</malay> we will start planning [lah] like properly <malay>macam</malay>
apply for house then like (um) because #aqil# just started working so his C_P_F is <malay>tak banyak</malay>
but I told him [ah] like my C_P_F is enough to tank the down payment
so he's like [oh] no [lah] but like he wants to
then I say it's fine (um) like we can like plan [lah] like
I feel like I feel like #aqil# is very very reasonable <malay>dan dia punya</malay> like
<malay>dia tak macam kata dia kata dia</malay> [tau] <malay>dia</malay> like <malay>dia dia</malay> will <malay>dengar cakap orang</malay> then after that he will like process and then he would
try to understand and see other people's view [ah] like I feel like that makes it that makes him someone very easy to work with
<malay>macam</malay> be with
like as a partner <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>dia faham</malay> like the what is understanding in malay babe
<malay>pecah</malay>
alright
ya so the correct so the third year <malay>aku</malay> move out (err) then I was (uh) staying <malay>dekat</malay> my aunty's <malay>punya</malay> place [lah] so what happens is (uh) I was there (uh) for actually <malay>aku duduk kat rumah dia</malay> [kan] for very long it's about
(uh) overstay my welcome is because I think it's too too long [lah] it should be
(uh) I they gave me hints [lah] ya they gave me hints towards the end of the so I I stayed <malay>dekat dia orang punya</malay> place for one and a half years ya one and a half years (err) my my bedroom was actually literally the hall the hall way (err) they had a sofa bed down there so I was sleeping there
and then (uh) that was the the time where <malay>aku</malay> just (uh) you know just tried to just tried to to survive [lah] you know but the good thing was that I was not out in the streets I was I was actually you know I had a I had a roof [lah] and then I was you know so that was a good thing [lah]
correct so that was that was (err) (err) you know (err) at the end of the three years then (err) <malay>aku</malay> early this this this year [ah] first of january actually
(err) sometimes okay terms sometimes <malay>tak</malay> okay [lah] so that means <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> she will invite me back [tau] <malay>macam</malay> (um) you know to to her to the family home [lah] but (uh) sometimes we will have some discussion she she was kind of like try to open up a discussion and then you know we will have our little debate ya and then after
yes and then after that I I you know many many a time I told her that okay I'm never coming back but in the end I still come back you know that kind of thing [lah] you yes (err) so the the the the very interesting thing that I realise that when I came back
(um) she totally changed <malay>bukan</malay> change <malay>macam apa</malay> [ah] so she totally <malay>macam</malay> (uh) you know she she's more (err) she she literally like (uh) tries to bother about what I'm doing you know (uh) getting to know what I'm doing and that kind of stuff I don't know what happened in the time that I was not there <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> she I don't know whether she realise [lah] that I think family is more important than you know having I mean making making everybody conform to a certain practice or whatever that kind of thing [lah] so I think the the the harmony is you know in in in having a family and all that so so I I would say that she she tolerates me [lah] now (err) but but the good thing is that in the last six to seven months [eh] we have not had a single argument I think she has learnt to accept
earlier okay okay

I I I I also feel the same way as you you know because last time [ah] whenever it I'm the same as you [ah] <malay>mesti kalau macam cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>mesti nak menang</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> in an argument [eh] <malay>kalau mesti nak cakap mesti nak menang</malay> so I'm always <malay>macam</malay> energetically fight back [tau] [ah] passionate <malay>macam</malay> fight back [tau] but nowadays [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I I don't know [ah] <malay>kenapa</malay> it's just maybe maybe it's also because we we had gone through (uh) certain thing ya sort of like grown up you know being out there alone being by myself you know independent and all that
so (uh) <malay>kita macam tak tak</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> there's no more energy to to [ah] to to expand to to argue [tau] <malay>macam</malay> at the most <malay>pun kalau</malay> even if we don't agree [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> the conversation will just die off like that rather than it turning into become a heated argument it will just die off you know and and that's honestly that's what I prefer [lah] you know it's just you know you just you just stop [lah] just you just don't don't don't speak [lah] but but it's something that I have always (um) like <malay>macam</malay> I I'm really thankful that (um) she's no longer you know the the the the person that she used to be because ya because (err) I I knew back then [eh] I knew for a fact that I could not live with her I definitely definitely could not stay in the same room with her
back then but then now I realise okay [lah] you know she's also ageing and she's also going old and all that I'm not sure whether is it because (err) <malay>dia pergi haji</malay> (uh) last year you know the previous year she she went for a pilgrimage you know and and she was very lucky it was just before COVID struck you know so she managed to go with my dad and then after that (uh) she came back and (err) I think I don't know [lah] maybe maybe the experience over there changed her or or you know it could be it could be the case that she realise some things when she's there you know
and then after when she came back ya when she came back (err) she was more (err) you know (err) she was more more able to control herself [lah] her emotions [lah] and on my part also I try to I try to control my own emotions [lah]
ya
yes it's not a one size fits all kind of thing yes correct
yes correct exactly
yes yes
ya ya ya
actually you are right you know I'm like you know Kinder Bueno <malay>tak yang the coklat</malay> Kinder Bueno okay okay I te~ I tell you what's the relation [eh] Kinder Bueno <malay>dia punya</malay> chocolate it's hard on the outside but when you get to the inside it's actually really really soft

yes yes I understand yes
ya ya ya ya
I understand ya

[ah]

yup yup yup
yes I remember that conversation very very well I remember it vividly yes of course you were the one who got me to try out for S_Q <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang yang yang ni apa</malay> we we we had we had a few we had a few conversations one was one was (uh) the the S_Q part when you call me over the phone and we talked a very very long time you remember that part ya that was the first time [kan] so you ask me to apply for S_Q <malay>punya apa tu</malay> (uh) opening [kan] <malay>yang yang</malay> ala air steward
ya (err) I told you about my eyesight and I also told you about (uh) I didn't know it at whether I'll make the cut and all that and then you you were like [eh] come [lah] just just follow me [lah] you know just just go you know together and that kind of stuff ya and then and then that was the first convo that I that I remember very vividly the second convo than we had was at in~ <malay>dekat tak ingat tak dia dekat kita dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>kat</malay> #yishun#
will you remember we weren't outside we were sitting in an open area <malay>dekat</malay> northpoint <malay>dekat</malay> McDonald's and then <malay>kat luar</malay> and then we were talking about things like illuminati [lah] we were talking about all the stuff that you know you remember or not and I still remember that I still remember that convo I still remember all our convos bro no no no it's okay it's but I I I I will always remember so
you you you I I know for a fact that you you when I talk to you right (um) the way you the perspective that you give to me is a different perspective [tau] which which means okay <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example [eh] I you you I like just now I was telling you about you know how I was out and that kind of stuff and then and then you were you were telling me about how you understood that such people behave in a in a certain manner because of you know somethings and all that for me I wouldn't be able to understand [tau] <malay>kenapa dia macam gitu</malay>
like but but so when you when you give me this kind of things right then you you are letting me know a a different perspective (uh) a different way of seeing how you know the person behaves in that kind of stuff so I think (uh) it's quite it's it's something that (uh) there I I would I would (um) and then there's always a lot of things for me to learn [lah]
I am I am I still am actually yes you did yes you did
well I I knew that being a pilot was what I want but I didn't know that I could also try out to become like say for example an air steward you know what I mean which is not really flying flying but it's still this the the the I mean you are in the you are in the industry and you are very near to where you want to be technically ya you know so (err) and and and it was honestly right my mind [ah] is always a one track thing so let's say for example [kan] <malay>aku cakap</malay> okay I told myself [ah] I I want to become a pilot but (err) I will only think about okay how do I become a pilot how do I do this how do I do that I I wouldn't think of okay maybe there is another way maybe I can become a air steward first then I can jump into you know into a fancy and that kind of thing [lah] so I I don't have that kind of (err) presence of mind [ah] to think that I should do this and then it would eventually lead me on to the thing I'd go the straight out
for me
[oh] right
so so my my life in in this industry [lah] in this aviation industry started out with (um) with simulators so it started out in the in the confines of my own in my my room (uh) on the computer so my dad was the one that I credit for for giving me this passion [lah] because he wanted to become a pilot himself <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> eyesight (err) <malay>macam tak</malay> (err) how to say [eh] (uh) not hundred percent [lah] not not not not a six six [lah] vision [lah] so (uh) and at that time [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> very strict [kan] <malay>kalau kau punya</malay> eyesight is not perfect eyesight then you you don't even get a chance <malay>dia lain</malay> [ah] [ah] [tau] yes correct correct
no as in as in there's other planes there's there's other aircraft out there there's so many act~ act~ actually actually you are right <malay>sebab tu</malay> [eh] they realise [eh] in (err) in (err) eventually they realise that having a six six vision is not a requirement you can ya they change they change in nineteen ninety eight
nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine I remember this very vividly because I still remember I was in secondary school and they the first organisation that made the change was R_S_A_F which is the air force so <malay>dia orang</malay> (uh) they publicised in the newspaper the very first pilot titled pilot [tau] who was wearing glasses ya and they put his picture big big down there I remember man on that day I bought like three copies of the newspaper I cut out all the picture and I pasted it all over my room just just to motivate myself and say that look all is not lost because I started wearing glasses when I was primary four already ya ya so I was very I have always felt that it was an impossible dream to achieve
because because <malay>dah tak boleh apa</malay> because you <malay>dah pakai</malay> you <malay>dah pakai</malay> glasses then that's that's it [lah] you you no more already [lah] no more chance right so [ah] so that was what spurt on my motivation (uh) and and make the fire burn the fire was winning back again so after that when I was in (uh) so after I finished secondary school right I set my sights on the youth flying club so what I did was I join the youth flying club and I managed to pass the interview you know and and go through the the thing and I managed to (err) (err) start the flying course [ah] so that time (uh) they were offering for those people who were successful and being accepted in the course they let your parents (uh) fly in the aeroplane for free therefore one flight <malay>macam</malay> familiarisation flight [ah] so both my parents actually got the chance to to to try out [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> then after that <malay>apa tu</malay> they they brief us and then (err) they they brought my parents up and then just to show them how it's like to fly and all that [lah] this was a very long time ago <malay>sekarang dah takde lagi</malay> [tau]
<malay>sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>sekarang</malay> is no more already no no more they they don't offer that kind of stuff already but last time they used to so what I did was I went through the course and when I went through the course it kind of cemented my my ambition (uh) even further because I felt you know [ah] bro the very first time I flew in the aeroplane it was during my familiarisation flight <malay>dekat</malay> youth flying club [tau] and this was when I was sixteen [lah] when I was up there it was such a different feeling
that I couldn't I I didn't want to land man I didn't want to go back down to earth I wanted to keep flying
[oh] definitely man I will want to fly man I want to have wings man no need I don't need speed man I want to fly as high as possible
there's there's that's technically true but it's not flying lightning speed ya but when I landed when my when our plane landed and when I stepped off the plane I couldn't feel my feet [lah] bro I was just floating I was literally just still floating I was on cloud nine I was just I was just you know but that was the thing [lah] that was that was this that told me like okay you know I have to I have to make this somehow come true a dream and all that [lah] ya so I pursued it you know I I kept on pursuing it and I studied all that I could <malay>tapi aku</malay> I made a mistake
one of the mistakes was that I thought that I needed physics <malay>macam</malay> science [ah] science <malay>punya</malay> subject [kan] (err) I I thought that I needed science in order for me to be able to become a pilot
actually I realise I did not need to have science per se I just needed to understand the concept of flying
(uh) it was a mistake because I took the wrong course when I was in junior college last time [ah] I I'm I'm an arts person I was more of a arts person I should have taken an art subject because that's my stronger that my forte but I chose science because I thought I needed science to become a pilot but science wasn't exactly my (uh) my my my strong point I mean only the aerodynamic but my physics teacher was so (uh) puzzled because <malay>did cakap apa</malay> [tau]
(uh) [eh] I realised that you can do this topic very very well it was on aviation and aerodynamics [ah] but your other topics [ah] you <malay>rabak</malay> man you cannot make it why [ah] then I realise that but it was it was (uh) (uh) only way way way later [lah] then I realise that (uh) okay I I I actually
[ah] no no it was a academic (uh) more of a academic kind of (uh) mistake [lah] (uh) I mean it was a academic (um) how to say [ah] misstep which which I could have my my my (um) my potential was was was higher if I had been in arts but I chose to be in science [ah] which means then after that (err) the after that okay so after that I had another setback
and when I was (uh) just before I enlisted in two thousand five I think two thousand five two thousand six [ah] I had this medical condition so okay so backtrack a bit [ah] when I was in J_C I had to undergo an operation which was appendix appendicitis [ah] so I had to remove my appendix because (err) it literally blow up inside my stomach ya the doctor was saying if I had (err) not (err) what (err) gone to the hospital [lah] (uh) if I've gone to the hospital one day later they wouldn't have been able to save me
ya ya ya it was that bad I was literally <malay>aku tak boleh bergerak</malay> I was just I I and I still remember that day was my (uh) examination my english paper <malay>punya</malay> examination E_J_C and (err) I couldn't I couldn't move I had to call my dad for help you know send me over then when he saw my condition he's like I'm bringing you to the hospital right now [ah] okay so what happens is this this this condition after I remove the appendix right
it it was okay for about a year or two but then there was a complication and it was a medical complication (uh) in which this this (uh) operation actually made my stomach lining weak
(uh) because they have to cut they have to cut through [mah] so apparently I think there's a hole there and what happens is that my my (err) my intestines my my innards they actually can slip through that hole and form a hernia
so it was a it was a one medical condition after another [lah] basically so it was first it was an appendix then (uh) it gradually became a hernia after two to three years now the problem with hernia is this for medical [eh] in a medical sector your intestines (uh) usually you know they're very long right and if let's say if they slide down towards your groin area ya they can get twisted
when these intestines get twisted it becomes a medical emergency and you need to have a immediate surgery to
(uh) apparently that can be fixed okay (err) and and basically what happens is (uh) if you fix it (uh) generally it won't happen but there is a chance that it might recur again after you fix it
so guess what I fixed mine two years later
it recurred again ya it recurred again so (uh) that was another dent in my in my in my dreams [lah] basically ya so that was the reason why that time you know <malay>aku pergi</malay> [ah] S_I_A <malay>punya</malay> air steward <malay>punya</malay> interview <malay>tu yang aku</malay> pass
(err) actually I pass the interview okay but because they they they saw the hernia condition I failed my medical that's why <malay>aku tak aku tak dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>jadi</malay> (err) air steward as well ya so in the end in the end I so you you see how how it all ties up [lah] how it all times ties back together
this this this this (uh) this condition but (um) the good thing was I went for another op so I I fixed I fixed the condition
and (uh) hopefully hopefully [lah] [ah] cross my fingers that it doesn't it doesn't return again [lah]
!huh! this year I'm thirty five bro
so I I have already I started flying when I was (uh) in the U_S you remember there was a period of time I don't whether you know or not I was okay so I was in the U_S because I joined the university that is (err) (err) specifically flying related
so (uh) they teach you how to fly and they teach you I mean you get a degree and all there at the end of the day (uh) but I was in the U_S and it was this time when I was in the U_S that I actually learn and train and I and I actually got to to fly you know real real flying [lah]
and this was in twenty fourteen twenty fifteen somewhere around there
I I don't man I had to I had to use for the operation <malay>aku pakai ni aku pakai</malay> my medisave (uh) my my <malay>apa tu orang panggil</malay>
(uh) I offset from my medisave a bit and then I paid (uh) <malay>pakai</malay> insurance [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my medical insurance [ah] ya (err) for U_S I was working my ass off man I was working three jobs at that point of time
<malay>apa</malay> working
am I still what
in that in that in in in that [ah] [oh] debt (uh) I was out of debt but I think now with my new house I will be indebted again
<malay>ada ada sikit sikit</malay>
<malay>ada ada sikit</malay> (uh) my mortgage [kan] every month is (uh) one point one K (uh) <malay>aku punya</malay> (err) they cut off <malay>aku punya</malay> C_P_F (uh) eight hundred
so <malay>aku kena</malay> top up three hundred every month there is correct yes in the future [lah] <malay>aku aku aku</malay> I was thinking [lah] anyway that [one] is is is always an option I I'm keeping it as an option for me [lah] which is why I wanted a bigger place (uh) the other reason was because <malay>aku ada terlalu banyak barang-barang</malay> [ah] all my baggage my
[eh] I don't mind man I really don't mind <malay>kau tahu rumah aku kat mana tak dekat</malay> it's just beside admiralty M_R_T [jer] also admiralty M_R_T is at woodlands I mean the woodlands area [kan] and (uh) the it's only about <malay>macam</malay> five minutes
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay> it's not it's (uh) it's it's just opposite the M_R_T ya it's opposite the M_R_T it's a residential <malay>punya punya</malay> place [ah]
ya ya ya ya
okay what are you what are your plans you tell me your plans
okay okay yes
yes when I was in the U_S correct yes correct I I managed to fly with them (uh) [ah] no no no I was in a I was in a a corporate (uh) site I was actually doing (uh) business business aircraft when I was in the U_S
yes I was there (uh) okay [lah] it was it was (uh) it was it was a good it was a good experience but the problem is (um) when you are overseas [eh] (err) your how do I put it [eh] you you're considered as an expat [tau] so expats they they are a bit particular it depends on the administration [lah] so that's the reason why (um) most of us [kan] <malay>kita belajar kat sana</malay> we gain the experience then we come back here and then we we try to (uh) apply with the local <malay>punya</malay> okay so right now right now (err) so okay so so right now what happens is this [eh]
I managed to get myself a stint together with singapore flying college so singapore flying college needed instructors
so (uh) average [lah] it's just typical because for me and they consider they consider me as a entry level [lah] I'm not I'm not a <malay>macam</malay> senior captor and all that kind of thing so for me I'm more like the first officer or second officer type of (uh) about four K about there [lah] about about (uh) thereabouts okay so when COVID happened
yes so when COVID happened (err) this this whole thing the whole industry was affected everybody was you know down nobody was flying and and it was a very bad (err) I mean it was just a very bad timing [ah] it was the worst hit industry ever (uh) unfortunately a lot of the planes that stopped flying will never fly again you know because it it becomes too expensive to maintain them and (uh) they lost too much of money that is virtually impossible to to revive all these aircraft and what some of the aircraft that they operate also quite a bit old [lah] so so the best interest is just to retire these aircraft and they will never fight again [ah]
to the parts [ah] they get (uh) they they have this place in australia they call it alice springs it's a it's a aeroplane graveyard
graveyard yes so
(uh) some of them they do but most of them for the most part (err) they don't need right they just they juts leave them there [lah] they just leave them there too ya it's a it's a ya
they can they can but I think I mean who I mean when when they they put it there [ah] nobody wants to (uh) you know [ah] then there's no particular entity or organisation that actually is in charge of this [lah] you know to to so so the the easiest way is just to leave them there and then just you know just just leave it be [lah]
[oh] man they have a lot man I I'll show you pictures of (uh) of the airplane graveyard over in the U_S ya they have they have one in the U_S they have one in australia you know they have a lot [lah] this kind of places
correct correct it was it was another avenue and and I realise that it was (uh) it was an avenue that others have done before and did it and they made it so it was quite okay [lah] so I thought it was (uh) it was a good thing so I thought I I tried it out at that point in time and and I did [lah] and I'm glad I did you know and I'm and I'm glad we we we went through it and we we we tried it out and we try our best you know ya
yes yes yes yes that was in during reservist right I think yes I already signed <malay>kita dah</malay> sign contract <malay>kita dah</malay> sign #dok# we even we even (err) graduated <malay>kita semua dah</malay> celebrate [seh] we went out drinking I mean
[ah] <malay>tak tak tak tak tak</malay> I didn't go through the I was supposed to go through yes correct I was already together with the rest of the other so called batch mates
yes I know I know I know that was thing so I mean there's there's setbacks [lah] along the way there's you know there's <malay>ujian</malay> there's setbacks there's (uh)
yes ya ya ya ya
yes yes
yes correct
ya I know right <malay>macam nasib kentang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> there's always something there to to you know but it's okay ya ya I know know I've heard of it before [lah] this phrase I know I know
<malay>tapi</malay> I mean I I've always thought that there is a silver lining [lah] you know in in every ya so <malay>aku</malay> I I'm I'm I'm still in it you know I'm still in it and I'm still waiting you know ya yes yes correct I'm still waiting so I'm hoping that when this COVID thing is over you know and everything you know go slowly goes back to (uh) goes back on track and all that right (uh) I I'm pretty sure [lah] one day [lah] one day I (uh) you know I I I I have a deep faith for for this for this thing so one day I will I'll you know I'll be I'll be able to to do it [lah]
but but for now (uh) I got the next best thing which is (uh) flying drones [lah]
[eh] it's a different skill set [lah] [sia] it's a yes yes correct I know I know I just imagine myself (uh) being on the drone so when I see it I was like [oh] okay ya [lah] but but by by I mean it's it's the best that I can do (uh) (uh) that's relatable and that's (uh) you know but I think (uh) they they have already announced <malay>macam</malay> plans [lah] you know
(uh) they want to push us to become (uh) flying instructors so ya so so I think it's just a matter of time where when this thing you know dies down and everything is (uh) back to normal again right (uh) I think you know hopefully [lah] hopefully I won't be too old and my age becomes a factor and I'm like shit now I'm to old <malay>aku tak boleh</malay> [ah] #dok# flight <malay>tak boleh</malay>
I will I will make aeroplane noises flight attendants in your positions my passengers [eh]
ya that's the that's that's what I I hope not to happen [ah] but if that ever happens [ah] you will know why [ah] you know all about the history behind it [lah] you can tell people [oh] yes I know this guy I know what happened to him ya [lah] yes yes yes so this is his story this is his autobiography his life story you know [oh] my goodness

sometimes they okay instead okay sometimes H_B_L it's like it's either <malay>kau buka</malay> computer then like
Zoom <malay>semua kau akan berbual</malay> with your <malay>cikgu</malay> [kan]
<malay>tapi aku punya</malay> H_B_L [kan] it's like we talk
no we don't talk like we do assignments so we just have like a few questions like less than five
it's like damn fun because it's like
(um) that one whole week right they don't give like
one assignment
on one day it's like
one assignment like five question like monday until wednesday then that's your deadline wednesday night
so one of our question [eh] sometimes cause
okay our H_B_L [kan] like H_B_L intern H_B_L intern [kan]
so like rarely they know
like about us
so one of their question that they ask
was what [ah]
if you can be any kind of colours what will you be
so what is your answer
ya
why
(mm)
can it's up to you but why
white stands for purity okay then
for your inner soul
<malay>apa</malay> inner soul <malay>kau</malay>
(mm) ya maybe [ah] a bit of both
okay you <malay>kau</malay> guess <malay>apa aku</malay> choose
why blue do I look like a blue
no [oh] my god okay correct answer but <malay>aku</malay> chose orange
okay cause orange [kan] is like more of sunset it's like most of the basic [eh] the main colour of sunset is orange
ya so I just chose orange [lah] at first I don't know but then
<malay>aku cakap</malay> like since I like sunset then like the
primary colours is orange [kan] so <malay>aku cakap</malay> [ah] like (um)
<malay>aku</malay> chose orange <malay>sebab</malay> it's the primary colors of sunset and
sunset is like represent of me [ah] <malay>macam dia</malay> can make my soul like very calming
ya so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay [ah] then end up <malay>aku dapat</malay> five points
ya
serious
I think whoever work like
on air right stewardess
they enjoy like they can see all those sunset and sunrise [sia]
ya
yup true
I want to be stewardess but then end end up <malay>aku pakai hijab</malay> so like cannot
actually can
fly emirates
<malay>kawan aku</malay> [eh] no #huda's# sister <malay>yashira dia</malay>
ya <malay>tapi dia sudah</malay> quit <malay>sudah</malay>
she [oh] cause <malay>aku cakap dengan dia</malay> like <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> air stewardess
then she said like go [ah] like try but then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like
cause I'm using <malay>hijab</malay> [what] so it's hard
then <malay>dia cakap</malay> she have friends that during flight like on air then they open then after <malay>bila</malay> touchdown they will use back
but for me like complicated like you know <malay>macam</malay>
you know yo~ like you get what I mean
<malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>pelik</malay> like ya but I really want [sia]
ya that's why <malay>tapi macam</malay>

<malay>kalau kau</malay> on the way <malay>kerja</malay> that means <malay>kau tak pakai tudung</malay>
so I think <malay>kalau kau sudah</malay> fly #bangkok# or something then
<malay>bila kau sudah sampai</malay> hotel <malay>kau nak keluar balik</malay> then <malay>kau pakai tudung</malay>
so <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kalau</malay> like <malay>kau punya kawan macam</malay>
they say like [eh] just now like I thought you never like you know like people assume [what] [eh] you use <malay>tudung</malay> you know

I'm still finding jobs but then right it's so hard
like you know okay just now I saw this job search
for temperature screener <malay>dia dekat</malay> #bukit batok# hospital
so <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> it's like not flexible but then it's like it's a hospital <malay>tapi tak ada</malay> aircon
[kan] <malay>pelik dia cakap</malay> like note [kan] <malay>dia cakap</malay> below like for the note they said (um)
<malay>tak ada</malay> aircon so like whoever <malay>dap~</malay> like shortlisted

like
<malay>dia tak tanya aku</malay> permission <malay>untuk pakai kasut itu</malay> like out of nowhere <malay>aku nampak kasut aku keluar dari kotak</malay>
then after that <malay>aku</malay> text <malay>dia aku cakap</malay> one more time if I see my shoes like this
I will throw your nike inside the water
<malay>sebab dia punya</malay> nike [kan] she's very protective of it
so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay like I understand like I won't use it because it's <malay>mahal</malay>
then after that (err) <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(err) <malay>dia cakap</malay> I was airing it [lah] <malay>habis dia cakap</malay>
<malay>dia pergi bilang kat</malay> sarah <malay>dia cakap</malay> why #mariam# so rude then <malay>pada aku macam</malay> it's basic [what] it's <malay>kasut</malay> birthday <malay>aku habis kau pakai macam sesuka hati kau</malay> [ah]
<malay>habis</malay> after <malay>dia cakap dengan aku</malay> (err) okay [lah] so from now
(err) you just use your own stuff I use mine like stop bothering me so <malay>pada aku macam</malay>
the least you can say is sorry [what] like at least <malay>aku jaga barang kau baik-baik habis dia nak cakap dia cakap</malay> sarah like
(um) <malay>aku pakai barang dia semua tak minta</malay> permission like bag <malay>dia kenapa macam aku sudah</malay> make it <malay>aku sudah minta kau</malay> permission it's just that <malay>kau macam tak</malay> acknowledge it you know
then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ah] whatever [lah] then (err) <malay>dia cakap dengan</malay> sarah I want to buy C_D_G shoes so like
(err) #mariam# don't have to like nag then <malay>aku macam</malay> I won't nag if you don't
if you know how to like
ya if you know how to take care of my shoes you know that time one time right I washed it
then out of no where suddenly the next day <malay>dia pakai</malay> then <malay>ada kotor lagi</malay> like do you know how pissed I was like
<malay>aku baru cuci</malay> like <malay>sudah bersih habis</malay> like <malay>kau pergi pakai</malay>
like you have a lot of like expensive shoes like go use [lah] but then end up <malay>kau nak pakai aku punya</malay> C_D_G <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dua ratus yang kau sudah cakap yang</malay> a~ [lah] <malay>aku boleh beli habis pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>beli</malay> like you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so annoying like
(err)
annoying <malay>satu kali itu yang</malay> like these few days like we've been like <malay>macam</malay>
(um) how to say [ah] like <malay>macam</malay>
!huh!
okay not really arguing like okay you know that tension in the air
ya like <malay>macam</malay> these past few days [ah] like me and #aisha# we have like this tension then sa~ sarah <malay>satu kali</malay>
(oo) I sense tension then <malay>aku macam</malay> [ha] [lah] <malay>kau</malay> just stop
cause
I I won't say it's okay [ah] but
I don't know [lah] I mean if she say she will stop using my stuff then okay [lor] but
I doubt she will stick to that
confirm <malay>nanti balik</malay> [kan] <malay>dia akan cakap aku</malay> (err) <malay>pergi buka beg sekolah aku</malay> cause that time I use her timbuk~ bag
confirm [one] then
but then <malay>aku</malay> still haven't use her nike shoes so now I'm just trying to find like
a way to use it
no okay cause okay one thing for me right I will ask permission but then for her right she won't
she won't ask permission for her <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>kau tengah tidur kau tengah tidur</malay> so like <malay>aku sudah tanya sudah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> what what common sense is that like I don't get it
no
<malay>aku penat</malay> [sia] rant <malay>pasal dia</malay>
okay so one thing about sarah her size is small
that's why so it's like she don't have this kind of thing where we have to argue about shoes like
cause me and #aisha# our shoe size is not that
far [lah] it's quite same but then sarah is just way out of like just <malay>terjauh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>aku pakai kasut</malay>
(um) merry [eh] <malay>kasut apa tu</malay> doctor mart
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak boleh</malay> fit <malay>aku boleh</malay> fit but it's so <malay>ketat</malay> like is it the first time when you use it will be like damn pain or what
cause <malay>aku tengok huda pakai sudah macam kasut ke bawah blok</malay> [tau] <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> just
like comfortable
ya <malay>tapi</malay> sarah <malay>punya</malay> is not my size so <malay>bila aku pakai</malay> it's like extra <malay>ketat</malay> and like pain
but then <malay>kalau aku</malay> lose the <malay>macam</malay> the strap <malay>dekat belakang</malay> [kan] then when I walk it's more uncomfortable cause my <malay>kaki</malay> will <malay>ternaik</malay>
you get what I mean
that's why so like I was thinking if I should buy
like for next year birthday present but then the thing is
<malay>aku macam</malay>
<malay>malas nak</malay> go through [ah] the blister blister
<malay>aku punya kasut yang</malay> doctor mart <malay>yang</malay> high cut <malay>dulu itu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi dia</malay> #swee# #swee# [jer] [seh]
[a'ah] <malay>macam</malay> since
<malay>dulu bila aku pakai</malay> like okay <malay>dia macam</malay>
#swee# #swee# <malay>tapi</malay> like there's a little bit of space <malay>tapi sekarang sudah</malay> #swee# #swee# so like
<malay>aku</malay> cannot use thick socks I have to use like
not thick socks but then like still a long socks for me
so I really don't know like sarah can use [lah] but then she rarely use
those kind of
ya
so
I mean I have a lot of like outfits to like match with it but then
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak nak</malay> like <malay>kaki aku</malay> blister
like no thanks later will ruin all the fun because I will complain about my blister and all
<malay>berapa banyak</malay> doc mart [ah] <malay>kau ada</malay>
ya
one okay I saw two of it what's the another one
[oh] [oh] okay okay okay okay
[ah] but you rarely use that now
no you can just use it anywhere like go lot

that's the purpose of it [lah] to go beach getting tan
okay <malay>bila bila kau nak esok</malay>
okay <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] imagine <malay>kita kaya gila</malay> [eh] !wow!
okay <malay>boleh bila kau nak</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> imagine [eh] !wow! I I can't imagine like myself being rich
I mean I can be rich like by working hard
but then like <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>macam</malay> you grow up being rich
like you grow up with like a mansion like you don't have to worry about anything
it's so it's so fun
okay <malay>aku tanya kau</malay> [eh] what's one topic right
<malay>kau</malay> don't want to talk about
like <malay>macam</malay> sarah right and her <malay>kawan</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> one topic her <malay>kawan macam</malay> don't like to talk about is like <malay>macam</malay> sex
ya but then <malay>aku tengah terfikir</malay> like <malay>kawan aku</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku aqilah</malay> [kan]
she don't like to talk about money
ya <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>kawan aku tanya aku</malay> [oh] bank <malay>engkau berapa</malay> like <malay>aku cakap</malay> [oh] nine dollar
<malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> it's so flow and easy <malay>tapi</malay> for <malay>aqilah macam kira dia macam berapa</malay> [sia] bank <malay>engkau</malay> like we want check like
cause <malay>kita semua tak nak keluarkan duit</malay> then for #aqilah# [kan] <malay>kita semua diri dekat tepi dia</malay> then <malay>dia pergi</malay> cover [tau] <malay>dia punya</malay> account
<malay>dia punya</malay> that screen then <malay>kita macam berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada berapa</malay> [seh] <malay>kau ada</malay> then <malay>aqilah cakap tak ada</malay> [lah] like nothing like not much
cause but I think confirm a lot cause she work as bond
like after her poly then she will work like this company [ah] then they will pay her eight hundred
eight hundred every month like ever since she started her bond so <malay>macam</malay> I think two years already her bond like
<malay>sudah</malay> ongoing
so <malay>macam</malay> confirm a lot then <malay>lagi</malay> her parents <malay>bagi dia</malay> like <malay>duit</malay> allowance
then ya that's one thing [ah] that I realized for #aqilah# she don't like talk about money
but then for my oth~ like #syara# and #shak#
<malay>itu aku tak</malay> sure
[oh] <malay>aku rasa shak tak suka berbual pasal</malay>
like
sex [ah]
[ah] <malay>aku rasa shak tak suka</malay>
ya I think
