okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay [lah] that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
petty a petty reason for me to dislike someone would definitely be his his or her <malay>punya</malay> (um)
(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not dis~ not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
okay [lah] be~ okay okay okay <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>orang tu nak</malay> hang out <malay>dengan</malay> I right <malay>tapi dia macam</malay>

but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes

I mean for me ya [lah] I mean it's I do feel
I mean once in a while like I do feel <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>sedih</malay> that
<malay>yang apa ni</malay>
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
I mean certain things you like a bit <malay>sedih</malay> right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
(mm)

you just get <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health <malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know

<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak tahu nak berbual apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh] I <malay>tangok yang tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] (oo) they got a lot of question
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like <malay>tukar</malay> and then <malay>cakap bahasa melayu</malay>
you know <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way <malay>nak cakap melayu</malay> all the way because
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pep~ pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay>
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay> means like I'm about to cry you know like I'm about to
I'm about to really go dri~ deep
with my feelings but when I say I'm expressing like I just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when I say I <malay>nak luahkan perasaan kat</malay> you [ah]
<malay>maknanya</malay> I <malay>macam ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cakap sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena</malay> (uh)
<malay>nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena cakap</malay> [lah]
then <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> <malay>macam berat sangat</malay>
<malay>macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal</malay> !wah! see
<malay>janggal</malay>
you do~ you <malay>tak tahu makna janggal</malay> you <malay>teka makna janggal apa</malay>
just <malay>teka</malay> [lah]
yes ya
<malay>janggal maknanya</malay> awkward
yes
[eh] no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
<malay>jap jap jap jap</malay> let me check <malay>yang ni</malay>

okay <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter

what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
<malay>suatu hari</malay>
<malay>anda bangun dari tidur dan mendapati bahawa anda telah menjadi seorang pelakon</malay>
<malay>siapakah pelakon itu dan mengapa anda memilihnya</malay>
okay
<malay>pelakon</malay>
<malay>yang saya</malay>
(um) <malay>memilih</malay>
[ah] <malay>ialah</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
<malay>siapa yang jadi</malay> spiderman <malay>yang barunya yang</malay> the latest one tom holland ya
<malay>saya ingin menjadi</malay> tom holland <malay>kerana</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) <malay>sungguh</malay> (um)
(uh) talented
I have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)

<malay>saya ingin menjadi muda kembali</malay>
(uh)
<malay>muda dan</malay> (uh) <malay>berjaya</malay>
ya tom holland
<malay>bagaimana pula dengan anda</malay>
<malay>pilihan</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay <malay>kejap jap jap</malay>
okay (um)
[eh] <malay>jap jap</malay> you know what I want to <malay>tengok</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your brother <malay>hantar</malay>
then <malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
ya <malay>satu jam kena berbual satu jam</malay>
just <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>satu jam</malay> the no okay the thing is I think what the
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) wheth~ how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now I'm speaking in english and then suddenly I <malay>tukar</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> you <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
I think <malay>saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila</malay>
<malay>yang paling mustahak ialah apabila</malay>
<malay>dan kenapa</malay>
<malay>dan dari situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>memberi</malay> (uh)
<malay>kesinambungan</malay>
<malay>bagaimana</malay>
<malay>dan apabila</malay>
(uh) <malay>diorang diorang ingin</malay> (um)
<malay>diorang ingin mengetahui</malay>
<malay>cara-cara</malay>
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes woul~ okay what I find such studies very interesting because they alw~ like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to feed~ you have to you have to understand because
nec~
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as m~ as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this conversa~ is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk <malay>ni semua</malay> we don't really
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where I can just easily go in go out <malay>nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap</malay> english <malay>cakap</malay> english
and
then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] but the fact that <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> certain words <malay>macam</malay> like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like <malay>macam</malay> !alah!
ya
ya <malay>macam dia macam tak</malay> natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes <malay>lagi dua puluh minit sahaja</malay> okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I <malay>nak tengok yang</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your your brother <malay>hantar tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] I'm glad that they that the <malay>yang</malay> [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
<malay>nasib baik tu yang benda tu</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dah habis</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
ya
then when we only pick one
so glad we pick the the nicer the the darker one because it's actually much nicer
ya <malay>rumah kita besar</malay> [sia]

[a'ah] <malay>macam lama</malay> [sia]
no [lah] I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> first first christmas
to fully <malay>pindah</malay> but I mean we can slowly live there
my things I'm gonna <malay>letak sikit-sikit</malay> [tau] I'm not gonna like one time go there I'm just gonna put things bit by bit because I <malay>takde kotak</malay>
I probably gonna take a few <malay>kotak</malay> and all that for of course office
<malay>muat ke</malay>
[oh] <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] ya
I really <malay>suka</malay> the <malay>yang kitanya</malay> flooring flooring <malay>kita cantik</malay>
ya
[ah] [oh]
<malay>yang yang kerusi belakang tu kena</malay> screw [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>semua</malay> [ah] <malay>semua kena buat</malay> [ah]
if <malay>ikat</malay> [ah]

okay so okay
!ee! best [lah] I <malay>tengok</malay> I I I <malay>tengok</malay> the kitchen best [seh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh]
I think the kitchen <malay>cantik</malay> [ah] like after we <malay>letak</malay> after the <malay>apa ni</malay> the
<malay>dia</malay>
ya
after <malay>dia letak</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap</malay>
I think the whole idea <malay>yang</malay> [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
I kinda like it though
<malay>ye ke</malay>
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] <malay>ini diorang boleh</malay> spray [eh]
okay
so <malay>yang ni nanti nanti</malay> next few days <malay>baru pasang</malay> [ah]
<malay>kena tunggu benda tu kering</malay> [eh]
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
<malay>besar sikit</malay> [tau] <malay>tebal sikit</malay> actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya <malay>lebih tebal sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
if were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be [ah] <malay>ni ni</malay> quest~ <malay>ni ni soalan</malay> best
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
<malay>pilihan pertama</malay>
<malay>adalah satay</malay>
<malay>satay lembu</malay>
<malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketupat sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi kuah satay banyak-banyak banyak letak banyak bawang banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>banyak bawang</malay> and <malay>banyak timun</malay>
(uh)
ya <malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
I can eat that I think for every single meal
<malay>pilihan kedua</malay>
<malay>seperti anda</malay>
<malay>adalah nasi sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng adalah hidangan</malay>
<malay>yang lengkap</malay>
<malay>dia manis dia pedas ma~ ada masin</malay>

<malay>dia lengkap</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng</malay> is what I would call a perfect meal

but it is a perfect meal
you know it is one of the my most favourite things in the world
