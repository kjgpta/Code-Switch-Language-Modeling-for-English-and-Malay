so ya
I <malay>nak minum</malay> hot chocolate <malay>dulu</malay>
!wow!
<malay>nak cakap apa</malay>
[oh] interesting
okay so <malay>kita memang dah tak</malay>
<malay>makan</malay>
meat products as much as we did before I mean <malay>dua ribu dua belas</malay> [eh] <malay>dua ribu dua puluh dah</malay> kind of okay
so how how far <malay>lang nak</malay> go in to into veganism
I <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
<malay>tapi</malay> in a way I think we're almost
there [lah] almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
I <malay>rasa</malay>
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>macam ada</malay>
selfishness <malay>sebab</malay> I don't
feel the same thing <malay>bila macam guna ikan bilis</malay> just because they are smaller than a chicken or <malay>lembu</malay>
[ah] I <malay>rasa</malay> selfish <malay>sebab</malay> they should be equal
okay
ya ya ya <malay>faham</malay> muk~ #mukbang#
(mm)
[a'ah] in a way [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean <malay>orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing</malay> is our companion pet <malay>banyak orang guna sebagai</malay> [ah] <malay>ada anjing</malay> as pet
but when it comes to chicken or duck
<malay>kita pun pernah bela itik</malay>
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
<malay>manja</malay> [lah] <malay>binatang tu</malay> can be so is that the same comparison
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi kita</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> (err) hunting and gathering food from [ah] natural resource <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
<malay>kalau orang dulu-dulu dia tak berkebun pun</malay>
<malay>berkebun tu selepas</malay>
<malay>dia pergi memburu semua</malay> [kan] then <malay>baru</malay> come this <malay>era bila orang</malay> start <malay>berkebun</malay> and <malay>jumpa teknik berkebun</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>tak ingat</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> go into veganism you <malay>akan</malay>
be a vegan [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> vegetarian
<malay>telur</malay> I cannot leave that I mean I
I <malay>boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu</malay> but I feel like I need my protein <malay>daripada telur</malay>
(um)
[ah] mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
<malay>tapi</malay> the challenge
is
<malay>macam kita dekat sini</malay>
[ah] you I <malay>tak</malay> sure <malay>tapi</malay> I
if I were to be a vegan
the challenge will come <malay>bila balik rumah mama</malay>
and mama
<malay>masak apa yang dia masak</malay> [lah] I don't think I have the strength to <malay>tolak</malay>
because it's not something <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> every day
I I can do that <malay>kalau pergi kedai kawan</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau balik rumah</malay> family <malay>dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan</malay>
but I myself don't have the strength to <malay>tolak apa yang dah ada tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] and <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tahu</malay>
<malay>dia masak sedap gila</malay>
so <malay>susah</malay> [ah]
you <malay>macam mana</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>apa yang</malay> spark your idea <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
vegan
is is there a certain
(err) timeline <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>yang membuat</malay> you <malay>sampai ke</malay> part <malay>yang mana</malay> you <malay>nak jadi</malay> vegan <malay>ni ada cerita dia ke</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> cringe cringey
(mm)
I <malay>rasa</malay>
I
don't have anything
<malay>yang betul-betul macam</malay> the moment <malay>yang</malay> spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
because of all the free time
(um)
and because of a lot of things [eh] <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>bagi</malay> [tau] I [lah] and <malay>dia macam</malay> I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
but actually (um)
in southeast asia
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> we have abundant soy sauce we have that (err) we have abundant soy derived products <malay>macam tempeh tauhu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>sedap</malay> [jer]
[oh] my god
ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay> crave
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
born born to be slaughtered [lah] basically
(mm)
spread <malay>penyakit ke macam nyamuk</malay> you you never know which one <malay>yang gigit</malay> you <malay>yang bawa</malay> aedes
extreme [lah] I mean I I think <malay>dua hari lepas</malay> #kot# I <malay>kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>selain</malay> delving into veganism <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>ada</malay> #kot#
and then
[oh] okay
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>punya azam tahun ni</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
start drawing again
<malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>dah lama sangat tinggalkan</malay> drawing and <malay>sekarang</malay> I <malay>rasa janggal nak buat</malay> the kind of drawing <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>pernah buat dulu</malay>
<malay>janggal gila sampai sampai macam</malay> halfway <malay>tu dah menyampah</malay> [tau]
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> I I [tau] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau</malay> practise every day
<malay>dia makin lama makin</malay> okay so that's one of my
(err) two thousand twenty one resolution
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
(err) come back to
<malay>belajar</malay> italian
and probably greek as well <malay>sebab tu pun dah tinggal</malay> quite <malay>lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu</malay>
(um) <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh]
I
I wish I can say <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> seriously
<malay>belajar</malay> music but
but
but quit <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> I I don't have the same passion <malay>untuk tahu</malay> what's behind the system
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> not not as fulfilling but
by by time
(mm)
<malay>atau</malay> maybe about
(um)
<malay>nak cakap</malay> lack of audience <malay>pun tak juga</malay> [ah]
even <malay>dekat rumah pun</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> not as motivated [lah] <malay>untuk untuk pegang</malay> musical instruments
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
just in case <malay>tapi kalau dah beli</malay> then <malay>tak main</malay>
<malay>bodoh juga</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] my other resolution
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay> [ah] before this <malay>kita</malay> depend on performance and
[ah] fully on music then
if we have side jobs <malay>yang</malay>
work from home
then <malay>tu macam</malay> bonus but by by the end of last year <malay>dia dah</malay> turn to the other way round
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>memang</malay> more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way [lah] because I <malay>tak selesa pun untuk keluar</malay> and perform and <malay>jumpa orang</malay> in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still <malay>nak ada</malay> event <malay>takut juga</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> new year resolution <malay>apa yang dah boleh tiru dah</malay> I <malay>punya</malay>
(um)
greek
I I
<malay>berasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak belajar</malay> japanese <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> food wars <malay>tu tapi</malay>
better <malay>untuk</malay> focus <malay>dekat</malay>
one or two language first [lah] before ventured out
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god ya
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> so far italian is not that hard I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> catch up <malay>balik</malay>
(mm)
[ah] and I <malay>suka sebab macam</malay> once you <malay>belajar</malay> italian you can kind of <malay>faham</malay> french as well <malay>dia ada kaitan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia dia ada kaitan</malay>
quite beneficial <malay>untuk</malay> learn that one language
<malay>sebab dia boleh</malay> branch out to <malay>bahasa-bahasa lain selain</malay> language to <malay>apa lagi</malay> you <malay>punya ni</malay> you <malay>punya azam</malay>
so
okay ap~ what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dia macam</malay>
(uh) I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore <malay>cakap</malay> the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself <malay>dia dah ada</malay> everything <malay>yang dia nak</malay>
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
I <malay>rasa</malay> it's not
a total shit show [lah]
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
and then ending <malay>pun</malay>
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya [lah] cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
(mm)
[oh] but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait [lah]
(um)
what else [ah]
you you you you decide the topic <malay>pula</malay>
if you go
the the
<malay>apa yang akan jadi</malay> in two thousand twenty one [ah]
[ah] two thousand twenty one
I <malay>rasa akan ada</malay>
a burst of
creative contents
for sure <malay>sebab</malay> in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
[ah] <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> musicians <malay>tak dapat buat</malay> shows
[ah] ya artist <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start <malay>macam</malay>
this this cannot
(um) go on for too long I have I have to do something to
to make everything better for myself [lah] <malay>sebenarnya</malay> especially if that's their only creative outlet
<malay>dia</malay> redundant it's very redundant
(mm)
but what about live shows I think (um) live shows <malay>pun dah</malay> start <malay>ada</malay> search <malay>juga</malay> because (um) G_L_C <malay>sebanyak yang</malay> start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay>
social distancing Q_R code scanning and everything so <malay>itu pun</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
(mm)
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
(mm) (mm)
natural selections
(mm) (mm)
I <malay>baca dekat</malay> twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
<malay>dia orang cakap</malay> your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
<malay>macam</malay> flu or fever side effect <malay>yang teruk-teruk</malay>
so I think I <malay>pun tak walaupun</malay> I <malay>takut jarum</malay> but I don't think I <malay>akan</malay> stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
(mm)
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay>
I mean even <malay>sekarang masa</malay> pandemic <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>dah tak ingat</malay> what happened in june in may
duolingo
(mm)
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic <malay>ni akan berlangsung lama</malay> and they cannot depend on skill <malay>yang dia orang dah ada</malay> so they have to broaden their horizon
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
okay can you explain <malay>pasal</malay> stoicism <malay>sebab</malay> I try <malay>baca tapi</malay> I <malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
(mm)
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> philosophy philosophical standpoint
[ah]
(mm)
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
(mm)
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature [lah]
(mm)
<malay>semua ni sebab</malay>
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you <malay>memang dah</malay>
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
<malay>benda ni macam</malay>
very personal because
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding <malay>tak sama</malay> so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
(mm) (mm)
I don't have any other interest
and the new age #plato#
(mm)
okay
once the border <malay>buka</malay>
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called [ah] the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
(mm)
the difference
I want to go to greece again
(mm)
[oh] in addition to that scandinavian countries
scandinavian countries <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama</malay> european
<malay>bukan yang yang yang tak payah</malay> stamp passport <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam</malay> schengen countries [eh] [oh] <malay>termasuk</malay> [oh] then why
[oh] ya ya
sweden
[oh] yes denmark
K [lah] hopefully next time
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>memang</malay> curious on how they can manage to provide
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
what about southeast asia or asia [lah] in general <malay>ada tak yang</malay> you <malay>nak pergi</malay>
<malay>ke kita memang</malay> western centric
euro centric okay my apologies
(mm)
(mm)
I think <malay>sebab</malay> I think the the the reason is because
(um) <malay>dia orang</malay> preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit <malay>macam dekat sini</malay> most of them are
in ruins
(mm)
[ah] you you cannot see with your own eyes
<malay>tapi</malay> asia I
<malay>nak pergi tak</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> indonesia but but but the parts <malay>yang kita tak pergi</malay> before [ah]
I think <malay>tu pun</malay> interesting and for some reason
I <malay>nak pergi</malay> thailand <malay>sangat sangat sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak dia punya</malay> street food
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] #kot# as for now
[ah] india but maybe <malay>bila umur dah lima puluh nanti</malay> [lah] #boulogne# and [lah]
(mm) <malay>selain tu</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi yang</malay> tesla <malay>buat</malay>
the space flight <malay>yang</malay> you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
running [eh]
[kan] they <malay>dia buat dia buat</malay> this (err) flight flight system <malay>baru yang mana</malay> you can travel across the world in less than three hours <malay>ke</malay> two hours [a'ah]
so I don't know if that is still running <malay>sebab dia nak</malay>
<malay>buat</malay>
<malay>benda tu</malay> affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years <malay>ke</malay>
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours !wow!
<malay>balik hari</malay> [jer] <malay>pun boleh</malay>
!wah! long silence very long silence
(uh huh) death to two thousand twenty
I <malay>suka</malay> that documentary
U_S centric <malay>tapi</malay> understandable [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> creator <malay>dia pun</malay> from U_S
but I think it's a good mockumentary [lah] to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one [eh] two thousand twenty
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam</malay> what do you want
and
you <malay>dah cakap</malay> you stoic so I <malay>dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu</malay>
(mm)
okay [lah] if if you could
be your younger self
<malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> change
(mm)
you know what do you have against schools [ah]
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm) I <malay>faham</malay>
(mm)
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] I think I learn more
<malay>kat rumah</malay>
[ah] <malay>dekat dekat</malay> internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually <malay>kat</malay> okay I mean form five <malay>pun</malay> I don't have
and I <malay>tak pakai</malay>
<malay>hujung</malay> form five I <malay>pakai</malay> iphone but before that I <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use [ah] but I
I <malay>lebih</malay> I I understand <malay>bila ayah yang ajar</malay>
but for you most of that internet [lah] [kan]
<malay>kena ambil</malay> to TOEFL [lah] <malay>lagi sekali</malay>
I think that will help a lot
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so <malay>dia</malay> expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until <malay>dia</malay> expire <malay>macam</malay> the last time I <malay>ambil rugi</malay> [jer]
[ah]
then <malay>sia-sia</malay> even if you <malay>dapat</malay> offer travel while once you <malay>nak masuk dia akan minta balik</malay> your TOEFL <malay>punya sijil</malay> then you have to take again
(mmhmm)
two thousand twenty one <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> start of the decade [kan]
<malay>bukan yang</malay> two thousand twenty [kan] last year was the ending
this [one] is the beginning okay
[a'ah] <malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks
<malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks but nothing happen
(mm) very anti climactic
okay [lah] I like new beginnings (um)
I <malay>pun takde</malay> expectation
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
<malay>tinggal lapan minit</malay>
that that [one] quite fast <malay>tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah</malay>
[oh]
<malay>boleh</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>harap</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't have any
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
poll <malay>sekarang</malay>
like <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak dia</malay> from <malay>semua benda sebab</malay>
in a way
I <malay>tak rasa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tadi cakap</malay> [lah] [ah]
afterlife <malay>punya benda kita tak tahu</malay> and it's not within our control [kan] <malay>dan ni pun sama</malay> it's not within my control so whatever happens happens [lah]
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
(um)
and
<malay>apa pun yang dia orang buat</malay> I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
you have yourself and people around you
<malay>tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I I'm quite positive about
this year
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> hopeless <malay>sangat</malay>
it's been awhile since I <malay>rasa</malay> hopeless <malay>dengan</malay>
the whole <malay>tahun</malay>
so you
institution
religion
<malay>agama kaum</malay>
[oh] <malay>kaum</malay> is a very sensitive issue
(mmhmm)
and I <malay>tak suka tengok</malay> Facebook comment
<malay>dia</malay> almost <malay>macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu</malay> you don't have any feelings at all
[ah] <malay>bangsa malas membaca</malay>
<malay>lepas tu tajuk</malay> everything click bait
[ah] I wish that <malay>kena</malay> change
<malay>yang tu kena</malay> change
[ah]
(mm)
but journalism <malay>yang</malay> spark head
<malay>orang yang malas membaca tu</malay> ya <malay>malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun</malay> they have to click in order to know the
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> nurse <malay>yang</malay> nurse <malay>yang yang ni</malay> infected <malay>tu dekat</malay> U_S <malay>yang vaksin</malay> (mm) (mm)
(mm)
and then <malay>kismis dan</malay>
that's my vaccine !wah!
(mm) <malay>tapi yang</malay> news <malay>pasal</malay> nurse <malay>tu</malay> very misleading <malay>sebab</malay> even if you take your first vaccine <malay>untuk dia sampai ke</malay> fifty percent immunity <malay>tu dia ambil dua minggu</malay>
<malay>dia kena</malay> COVID within I think <malay>hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu</malay> it's not even two full weeks yet and even <malay>kalau dah</malay> two full weeks <malay>pun</malay> not a full total immunity
second shot <malay>baru ni tapi</malay>
<malay>orang malas membaca</malay>
<malay>dia buat orang takut untuk buat benda yang betul</malay>
and <malay>lagi pun</malay> journalisms <malay>sekarang</malay> mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then <malay>jadi satu bentuk berita</malay> [ah] <malay>yang penting ada</malay> content ya monetisation and <malay>yang penting duit jalan</malay> K
<malay>tapi</malay> content <malay>memang tak</malay> best <malay>langsung</malay> especially because the audience <malay>dalam</malay> Twitter and <malay>dalam</malay> Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
(mm)
[oh] <malay>dah ni</malay>
<malay>lagi satu minit</malay> there's only one minute left
[ah] <malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> settle you click right [ah] tick [ah]
(mm)
okay [lah] <malay>macam tak rasa sangat</malay> can speak one hour <malay>macam tak</malay>
[ah] [ah] I wish I wish we can talk about something new [lah] (mm)
cause otherwise just normal conversation
okay
K [lah] thank you
okay
