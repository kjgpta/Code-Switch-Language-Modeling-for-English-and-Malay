so #fathul# I have a question for you (mm) if you have three wishes what are (err) what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would (err) void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say (um) by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things (hmm) maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and af~ after all to live happily is what everyone wants [lah]
and lastly (err) the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world <malay>sebab bila</malay> you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good [ah] when you can do things <malay>yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat</malay>
(mm) and some skills that I want to have (err) maybe include (err) having all the capabilities to al~ all the knowledge that that exist in this world [ah]
(mm) <malay>pasal ilmu ni</malay> but <malay>dia ada banyak</malay> (err) <malay>rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi</malay> (hmm) <malay>kalau dapat ni</malay> best [ah] <malay>pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat</malay> (mm) and <malay>bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni</malay> (mm)
so <malay>ini adalah yang tiga</malay> wishes <malay>yang saya nak</malay> (mm) so <malay>kita</malay> (err) what about you #fathul#
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily (err) to us to some people to live happily is to have (err) the money and the wealth
<malay>pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh</malay> spend on whatever and what not and <malay>bila awak dapat</malay> spend whatever and what not then means (err) with every spending <malay>awak akan rasa</malay> this happiness
(err) so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy [ah] and intelligence also [ah] this is to me I think it relates to me also [ah] because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
(uh) so maybe for now we move (uh) to the next question which is (err) superpowers #fathul# what (err) if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
[ah] [eh]
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of [ah] the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you (err) by accident
<malay>kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang</malay> teleport <malay>ke tempat lain</malay> so <malay>dia jadi</malay> the source of this (err) <malay>kuman</malay> [lah] so <malay>dia yang</malay> spread to others
<malay>dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus</malay> (mm) so I stay over this view whereby teleportation ac~ could actually increase
the the
the amount of (err) infection or the possibilities of (uh) infection rate [ah] you have anything to argue
yes correct
okay <malay>mungkin awak dah cakap ini</malay> okay maybe <malay>saya</malay> agree <malay>sikit</malay>
maybe <malay>awak ada</malay> point over there
<malay>tapi yang</malay> contact tracing <malay>tu mungkin tak tak senangkan</malay> [lah]
<malay>pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia</malay> teleport <malay>kalau dia sendiri dah suka</malay> teleport
(mm) <malay>tapi ini</malay> interesting point of view (mm) so <malay>kalau awak tanya saya apa</malay> superpower <malay>yang saya nak saya nak</malay> power of regeneration
so <malay>contohnya</malay> (err) <malay>jari saya terpotong</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti dia akan</malay> heal <malay>sendiri</malay>
<malay>saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki</malay> dislocate [ah] dia genera~ re~ regenerate <malay>sendiri</malay>
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk (uh) ambitions that I have
or maybe (uh) I wo~ I can take risks without having worrying that I might (uh) injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe (err) get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win [ah]
provided I am strong [ah] and maybe with this regeneration
(hmm)
I can donate let's say some parts of my (uh) limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
(hmm) where I have this ability so I can do is (err) I request my leg to be cut off and then give away (err) in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard (uh) tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
(mm) what do you think about this regeneration ability
(mm) it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
<malay>dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang</malay> high risk
<malay>itu me~ meminta kematian</malay> [lah]
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having (uh) to be looked at or without (err) being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
(hmm) I have this
think of living in isolation (uh) maybe one maybe <malay>satu hari bila dah dah</malay> experienced everything <malay>yang kita nak</malay> [ah]
I want to be (uh) isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self [ah] to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems (uh) affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
(mm)
how long maybe until I feel peace [ah] so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I ca~ I cannot give a number of years or months [ah] but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months [ah] then slowly maybe I will
(err) increase the number of the period [ah] slowly
okay <malay>mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya</malay> and <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena</malay>
<malay>bergaul dengan orang untuk mem~ untuk memahami keadaan orang</malay>
<malay>sebab tanpa kita me~ ber~ bergaul dengan orang</malay> we will never know what they face
(hmm)
we can never do something to improve the people around us
so for example <malay>bila kita tahu orang ini mengha~ menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong</malay> so <malay>kita akan mencari</malay> solution <malay>untuk menolong seseorang itu</malay>
so <malay>mungkin apa awak cakap</malay> (err) <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] and <malay>tapi bila awak</malay> (err) <malay>saya</malay>
(hmm) <malay>hairan</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa awak</malay> (err) question <malay>bila seseorang itu nak</malay> isolate maybe for months
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable [lah]
but it has to be looked in a certain way [ah] whereby the person
(err)
he is not affecting badly (uh) around the people (uh) (uh) he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state [ah]
(uh)
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
his child behind then <malay>anak-anak dia akan merana</malay> [ah] and
<malay>kalau</malay> months okay months maybe <malay>saya rasa maksimum</malay> (err) maybe not more than nine months [ah]
lesser than that <malay>mungkin</malay> okay
<malay>kenapa</malay> nine months <malay>sebab</malay> within this nine months (um) <malay>budak tu dia akan</malay> grow and after this nine months
they will change a lot [lah] so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small (err) goals small (err)
small achievement so this child will live without (uh) having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife [ah] he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife (err) agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free [ah] to do anything that he wants
do you think so
[eh]
okay <malay>soalan tu</malay> interesting <malay>sepuluh tahun</malay> <malay>mung~</malay> means <malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay>
<malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay> okay <malay>saya</malay> definitely <malay>akan suruh diri saya</malay> (err) <malay>ini</malay> [ah] invest [ah] invest in bitcoin
(uh) cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
(err)
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary [ah] but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams [ah]
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart [ah]
(mm) so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self (err) I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self [ah]
<malay>sebab</malay> at <malay>umur</malay> ten years old <malay>memang awak cakap betul</malay> (uh) <malay>nak nak faham tentang</malay> certain <malay>barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat</malay> convince [ah]
<malay>se~ se~ sa~ satu orang ni</malay> at ten years old <malay>dia akan ingat</malay>
and maybe along the way <malay>mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas</malay> and then <malay>dia akan</malay> start
(err) thinking back (err) <malay>apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya</malay> ten years <malay>bila saya ten-year-old</malay> <malay>akan</malay> <malay>betul</malay>
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
(mm) and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
(um) what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos (uh) I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and (uh) an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud [lah] or maybe just email yourself [ah] so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
(err) a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself (uh) since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is (err) I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see (err) how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe st~ (err) start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
so <malay>mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan</malay> (err) (um) <malay>akan</malay> interest <malay>awak</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> maybe one day <malay>juga awak akan jadi</malay> famous because of this [ah]
(mm)
K
you maybe you next we should talk about (um) near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
(err) some luck you managed to stay alive [ah] so for you (err) <malay>apa yang</malay> experience <malay>awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian</malay>
I need to add on <malay>apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati</malay>
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was (err) I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
it happens whereby we have to train where (err) train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> capsize <malay>habis tu bila</malay> capsize <malay>ini kita kena</malay> grab <malay>kawan kita punya kayak</malay>
and get back up [ah] so <malay>bila saya tengah</malay> practice capsize <malay>ini</malay>
instructor <malay>jauh</malay> so <malay>kita jauh daripada semua orang</malay>
<malay>habis tu kita bila saya tengah</malay> capsize <malay>kawan saya dia</malay> lose control of <malay>dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah</malay> capsize <malay>terus saya</malay> tap <malay>saya punya kayak</malay>
<malay>bila saya tengok terbalik ini</malay> so <malay>kawan saya punya bot tak ada</malay>
<malay>saya dekat situ saya</malay> stuck [ah] <malay>saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada</malay> skirt skirt <malay>ini akan</malay> prevent water from entering our kayak
<malay>nak keluarkan</malay> skirt <malay>tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay>
tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> (uh) in hope that <malay>kawan saya dengar saya</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal saya tengah dekat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap tap tap <malay>dia tak dengar</malay> alright <malay>bila dia dengar ini dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas</malay> incident <malay>dia cuba</malay> paddle <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tolak dia</malay> so <malay>dia nak</malay> paddle <malay>susah sikit</malay>
so <malay>saya dekat bawah air</malay> maybe for one minute [ah]
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was (uh) stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall (uh) is when I was
(err) riding bike (uh) it happens maybe due to
(err) rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to (uh) overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next (uh) topic that I have in mind which is (err) a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
(uh) ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
(hmm) whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that (err) there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
but I was skateboarding and <malay>dalam mimpi tu saya rasa</malay> best <malay>nak bila</malay> skateboard <malay>ni rasa seronok</malay> [jer] and
<malay>bila</malay> skateboard <malay>tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun</malay> [oh] [eh] <malay>rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak</malay> skateboard [ah] [ah] <malay>dari situlah saya start</malay>
start skateboard <malay>tapi nak belajar</malay> skateboard <malay>ni dia susah sangat</malay> (err) it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
(um) synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example (uh) few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
(err) I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future (um) a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go (uh) deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took (uh) I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
and <malay>bila dapat tahan</malay> breath <malay>saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar</malay> (uh) free dive and that time <malay>bila kat</malay> swimming pool (uh) <malay>saya ada</malay> swimming <malay>dekat</malay> nine metre pool [ah] [ah] <malay>itu saya cuba</malay>
and <malay>dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat sampai ke</malay> bottom <malay>tapi ter~</malay> I was having difficulty breathing [ah] and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that I have
so you have anything to add on
