<malay>tengok</malay> [ah]
(mm) that's true
pres~
I don't know
I mean
we're still alive so might as well might as well find something to hold on <malay>cari kerja ke</malay> start business <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>kau nak buat</malay> business <malay>apa</malay> [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya
I saw I saw your masks how was it
(mm)
but <malay>ada juga</malay> [ah] <malay>macam sikit</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>abeh kau masih beli benda kat</malay> habbo
(mm) <malay>masih</malay> spend like hundreds of dollars on buying credits
[oh] how long already
when was the last time you bought
okay
but like you planning on staying or like once they move over to a new platform are you gonna like quit or like <malay>jual</malay> your <malay>benda</malay> and quit or
(mm)
<malay>banyak sangat benda</malay> [kan]
(mm)
not like what if it gets worst <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> remove <malay>banyak benda</malay> from the game then <malay>orang semua macam tak nak main</malay>
then what happens
true
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
but like
sad [sia] they had like this one opportunity to make it so much better with the new platform
and then they had to remove like the main aspect of the game
ya I guess but like I mean I guess it is a market (uh) like a money making game like they made it to earn money but then like
your players are like a main of the game [eh] without the players what do you have like an empty online page
(mm)
ya I mean it's not as if they are not making money you know they are making a lot
ya
I think <malay>dia orang macam tak fikir</malay> they gonna cause
<malay>macam</malay> like to them at the end of the day <malay>kita</malay> like we we like the game so much that like no matter what they do also we still continue buying we still continue playing
and that's what has been happening [what] like the
<malay>macam</malay> like some items they release and then they increase the price to like thirty five when previously was twenty five and then <malay>orang masih beli</malay> [pe] it's not they like everyone just okay no I'm not gonna buy anymore
so I guess that's why to them it's like no matter what they do we will still buy
[kan]
habbo
habbo is the main reason why yes
<malay>habis</malay> smite <malay>apa jadi</malay>
ya
[oh] really cause I know that day (uh) <malay>siapa naim</malay> asked (uh) #ilyas# to join but then #ilyas# said like the file was like twenty one G_B he couldn't even download it anymore after he deleted everything from his laptop
but like kind of weird though like a game is so big that [lah]
(mm) four days ago three days ago ya <malay>macam</malay>
the file got too big for #ilyas# so like P_C <malay>dia tak boleh</malay> download then <malay>sampai dia</malay> have to delete everything and try again couldn't
ya that's why [ah] <malay>ilyas dia cakap dengan aku</malay> like [oh] I cannot play with you cause <malay>sekarang dia main</malay> among us [jer]
ya
I think <malay>baru</malay> [ah] like three days maybe three days ago ya
I don't know but <malay>dia cakap dia</malay> delete <malay>semua benda tinggal yang</malay> programme files
like <malay>dia</malay> basically formatted his P_C ya
ya that's why that's why I don't understand why is it so big I mean like doesn't make sense at all like smite is so big
<malay>dia cakap dulu</malay> file <malay>dia macam</malay> fourteen G_B and then then after that it went up to sixteen <malay>lepas tu sekarang dah dua puluh satu</malay>
it's probably him ya
I don't know [sia]
cause that time <malay>dia cakap dia punya</malay> app <malay>ada</malay> issue [lah] he couldn't log in so <malay>dia</malay> delete then <malay>bila dia nak</malay> redownload <malay>balik tak boleh</malay>
so <malay>dia</malay> format like remove everything from <malay>dia punya</malay> P_C <malay>lepas tu semua benda</malay> like he tried to download download download and then couldn't so he just give up
ya and he spent so much on that game also [what] I mean we all have
I guess
I heard they they were doing a spongebob
ya I heard I don't know someone said spongebob then I was like I don't know
[oh] ya that one I heard also but I heard I heard spongebob I want [sia]
I don't know
that'll be cool though can you imagine <malay>yang</malay> character character <malay>dia semua jadi</malay> spongebob <malay>punya</malay> character <malay>macam</malay> mister crab sandy
cute [sia]
(oo) is there a snail god
I don't know maybe
who could be that
#kumbhakarna#
yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(oo)
and another person [orh]
(hmm) that's hard good looks or fit body
probably go with good looks but I mean <malay>pasal kalau</malay>
<malay>badan sapau pun</malay> I mean you can just go to the gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> gym <malay>boleh pergi</malay> like have a like a regimented like exercise routine for yourself and then you probably could get that <malay>tapi kalau nak muka baru</malay> I mean you can't really do that also [what] so probably good looks
(mm)
ya I guess <malay>banyak banyak duit</malay> at least about ten K for a nose or something I don't even know probably will be too much but like <malay>kalau nak</malay> like make yourself fitter and stuff <malay>boleh pergi lari</malay> and like exercise and stuff and then you're there it's fine so probably good looks
then yourself [leh]
(mm)
yes
ya
true
I mean to a certain extent <malay>semua orang pun macam</malay> at least a bit [ah]
true
(mm)
I mean also like after a certain point in your life like you can't really keep up
with like the fitness level and stuff I mean unless you're like one of those like super athlete and stuff [lah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> then there's really like no point
good looks
ya
(hmm)
after this I don't know never really have a plan today but <malay>kalau</malay>
no any other day (hmm)
<malay>kalau ni hari</malay> not much [lah] I'm just going to go home and like rest but like <malay>kalau esok</malay> maybe maybe I might go cut my hair
<malay>nak potong rambut pasal dah panjang</malay> haven't <malay>dah lama belum potong rambut</malay> so maybe I shall do that
and
ya
[oh] ya not not bald [lah] no [lah] like as in like short
I don't know I
<malay>rasa macam</malay> free [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
I just haven't had the
the like courage to go shave my head again
I don't know like
<malay>sekarang muka macam</malay> maybe I want to keep it a bit like short but not too short <malay>macam</malay> medium length <malay>gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak nak panjang sangat pun</malay>
but ya
<malay>kalau kat rumah</malay> (hmm)
netflix <malay>lepas tu</malay>
[ah]
<malay>main</malay> C_O_D and playing a bit of C_O_D
(um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [ah]
(mm) ya mostly netflix if like watch so many shows over the past
(uh) no I haven't played cause like I don't know <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>main dengan naim</malay> and #muhammad# they very competitive and then like if #ilyas# is not there like can't really
like tag along so like
so I usually <malay>kalau dia orang dua</malay> [jer] then I I avoid
but like <malay>kalau</malay> the rest <malay>main</malay> then <malay>aku main</malay> [ah] cause I
!huh! really I didn't know
[oh] you didn't say
did you say [oh] I didn't see
I didn't
[oh] no he means he can't even play at all ya
I mean the same thing happened <malay>bila</malay> that time I tried to download <malay>kat</malay> my macbook <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang</malay>
I I don't play with my macbook I play on my P_C
cause I don't think they have a I_O_S <malay>punya</malay> file
ya
(mm)
<malay>satu benda</malay>
just one (mm)
probably a house with like a farm attached
you said one thing but I didn't
[oh] ya <malay>kalau satu benda dapat rumah</malay> [ah]
ya so you like
(mm)
with its with its own private jet
no but like a house would be fine I mean it's one item
[kan]
ya I mean a house will be nice like
at least that's settled especially in singapore
<malay>kau nak beli rumah punya susah</malay>
you don't need to work anymore I mean like you can work like small little jobs
I know right
ya basically that
I mean <malay>kalau kalau kau dah ada rumah</malay> then at most <malay>kau kerja untuk</malay>
maybe your savings and then like <malay>sikit untuk makan minum</malay> bills
so but ya that's it
what what should be free
[oh]
I guess
I guess
(mmhmm)
ya
but like I guess that's how the
the world has come to [ah] like everyone all the governments own everything and then you have to pay them
unless you move to like some
like island
#yishun#
we move to an island <malay>yang tak ada orang</malay>
build their own houses that kind maybe
but ya
ya
by there's an island
I didn't know
cow
you mean there's this one like random
what on earth
coney island
ya ya I've heard of it I have never been there though
(uh) <malay>pergi</malay> [ah]
ya let's go look for that cow later
<malay>hantu</malay>
so what the cow is the <malay>hantu</malay> or like
is there
interesting we go find out [lah]
[kan]
it's an island so that means the cow wandered in on its own
I mean
maybe <malay>orang</malay> maybe like someone like <malay>dulu simpan lembu kat rumah abeh dia bawa</malay>
<malay>macam buang kat sana kesian</malay>
<malay>dia lari</malay>
but it's such a weird thing to to happen in singapore
I don't know what is the lifespan of a cow
[oh]
I mean the
the latest the one I think just got removed what the <malay>kampung</malay>
I mean there's still one that exists that like
I don't know #buangkok# some some no as in like an actual <malay>kampung macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>orang dia tinggal dalam rumah macam kayu</malay> ya
<malay>yang</malay> that time I went there <malay>untuk yang satu</malay> filming for this
<malay>cerita hantu</malay> [ah]
ya went there and then <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> (uh) <malay>tempat tu memang ada benda</malay> [ah] like there's there's actual <malay>hantu</malay> living there ya
and then like there's this one <malay>makcik</malay> [ah] like this chinese auntie
she owns the place basically and then like (uh)
they rented the house that we were filming in from her
<malay>abeh dia orang cakap macam</malay> (um) like <malay>kalau datang kat rumah tu kena macam</malay> have like
good intentions like you can't be there to <malay>macam</malay>
like give a bad name to the place and stuff
cause like previously something happened [lah] when they they tried to like film like a horror thing there and like something happened
ya I think I was telling
(mm) ya it is the thing that confuse me cause the auntie told us like [oh] I see you guys are nice people so it should be fine
she said like <malay>kalau nampak apa-apa jangan tegur</malay> [lah] just let it be
like it won't harm you unless you do anything to it
and like we film from
yes
we film from I think like we arrived there at six [ah] so we set up and stuff and then the actress for the <malay>hantu</malay> was late
like really late and then [ah] they wanted to start filming at like eight
and then we had to delay and then wait then (um) when the actress finally came I had to put her and line her S_F_X <malay>punya</malay> costumes and makeup and stuff
so like she became the <malay>hantu</malay> it was quite quite interesting to see her change [ah] cause
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] she's like I think some
model or something
so she's quite tall [lah] and then like (um)
her features were like pretty [lah] like
like a model person's features
<malay>abeh kita kena tukar muka dia jadi macam hantu</malay> and then it's kind of fun [lah] but <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) that part that was the one [lah]
ya
(mm) ya we cut the the wig
then like ya at first it was like kind kind of worrying [lah] cause she kept complaining like
or like uncomfortable and this that
and then we had to put in contact lenses and stuff and it's not the normal <malay>yang kecil punya</malay> contact lenses it's a full eye one
so like
we were kind of worried [lah] that wouldn't work out but then like at the end she was okay with it so thank god [lah] like <malay>nasib</malay> [ah]
<malay>benda tu jadi</malay> so quite cool and like it was quite kind of scary [ah] to see her in the dark
like wandering around and shit
ya [lah] but then it's the only <malay>kampung</malay> I know that exists in singapore [lah]
ya
that <malay>kampung</malay>
I think the aunt~ the the people who stay there are quite like welcoming
they are very nice and then the when we were there <malay>kita nampak macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay> caucasian people #ang moh# like white people
they they were just wandering the place like
seeing
col~
they were like <malay>dia orang datang abeh dia orang tengok tengok</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang nampak</malay> then <malay>kita punya</malay> filming <malay>punya benda</malay> then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] what you're doing
then we just like like we told them [lah] like [oh] we're filming a horror movie here
they like [oh] okay cool cool and <malay>jalan</malay>
but it's quite interesting place [ah] cause it's surrounded by H_D_B
quite a few like (um) there's a lot of <malay>kampung</malay> houses [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> maybe <malay>ada lima ke enam orang</malay> [jer] <malay>tinggal sana banyak rumah yang tak ada orang</malay> [ah]
that's the thing I don't really know I only know the auntie like her job is to mainly take care of that <malay>kampung</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> she does the upkeeping and stuff [ah] and then like I know there's there's like one that they that
that hut that looks like a #kopitiam#
like <malay>ada kerusi-kerusi semua kat luar abeh macam</malay> I know that that place they close down already so I don't know what they use the space for
but it's exist now ya
ya it's very close it's like <malay>macam kalau</malay>
H_D_B <malay>dia</malay> like here and then it's just <malay>kat bawah</malay>
ya it's quite interesting it's like surrounded by blocks and roads but then once you enter the <malay>kampung</malay> area you really feel like you end up somewhere else cause
the trees are quite tall
then like only behind the trees then you see the H_D_B so it's quite quite cool
<malay>besar juga</malay> [ah] like maybe it's about the size of like one small H_D_B area
like maybe like eight blocks <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
it's quite big ya
the houses are all like one floor [lah]
so like ya
it's all <malay>kayu</malay> and then like very old school [lah] <malay>semua macam</malay>
like no electricity and stuff
but then they I think they added in electricity so like some houses have electricity now
quite cool
stay in the <malay>kampung</malay>
[oh] visit !huh! there's mosquitoes though
that's like the one thing I just didn't like about the place like especially at night
cause we were filming until like what seven A_M
ya it's quite <malay>gelap</malay> I mean there there is a few street lights [ah] like around the area but it's quite dark and then (um)
the there's a road that goes through the entire place [lah] so like along the road it's quite bright but like in the houses itself it's quite dark unless you are in the one with people [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tempat dia memang besar</malay> like really quite big ya
and but we only hear like
like explore like one small corner of it cause <malay>bila kita masuk kita naik</malay> lorry <malay>kena bawa semua</malay> equipment [kan] so when we brought it all out we just put it at the house there and then we were only at that house
so we only saw the surrounding by when we were in the lorry
ya
no cause like I mean kind of like #paiseh# [ah] cause we didn't like come there to explore and then they only call me down to do the S_F_X stuff
so like
<malay>aku datang</malay> just <malay>tengok-tengok abeh</malay> like <malay>macam tolong sini tolong sana</malay>
and then (um)
the auntie was very nice so she's the one who came down and talk to us
like she kept coming by and like saying like [oh] !wah! so cool and stuff so it was quite quite cute
ya <malay>dah pukul lapan gitu</malay> then she came over
then she was like <malay>kau orang nampak apa-apa tak</malay> and I'm like (um) no and then she said like <malay>kalau kalau nampak apa-apa tak payah takut</malay> nothing [one]
<malay>dia hantu baik</malay> then I'm like okay
ya
she just goes around does that every time
[ah] but ya
it is a
ya
even though like you're right in the centre of everything else
but like it's quite nice [ah] it's quite cold that night
cause of all the trees and stuff
(um)
yes guardian angels
ya the auntie lives alone now quite
yes her guardians
but ya quite interesting [ah] the place
interesting
(um)
M_B_S
I honestly don't know [ah] I
what else to do in singapore
what what else can we explore
where
go at night [lah]
ya I think same [ah] if like I had to like
if I wanted to explore and then go to places I think I will <malay>tunggu malam baru keluar</malay> cause <malay>panas sangat</malay> like everyday it's so humid and hot
true
but
[oh] ya I'm not awake
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go hiking is
is something else
(mm)
(mmhmm)
really
that's interesting
(uh) the zoo
is the zoo even open
open right
they wear face shields
cause we need to see them smile
cause not they will think that they are trapped
and sad
yes
yes [sia] is it even open I think it is already [lah] if not how how they make money
they need the money to keep the animals there
they shouldn't move
make them like let it be free
like the lions and elephants roam singapore
can you imagine
#pulau semakau# that's the bloody landfill right
put the cow there
I haven't been to the zoo in years
<malay>tiga tahun</malay> [eh] it's quite recent [sia]
three years quite recent [lah] ya
I mean honestly nothing much has changed so I don't know really know why how you want to keep going back to see animals in cages
ya
cat
[orh] [orh]
catty
catty enclosure
(mm)
and jumping on things
(mm)
like the other time I went I saw the polar bear
that one was depressing as hell like the polar bear's fur was like just it just looks depressed [lah] like the whole ya the bear was skinny as hell
and then like I mean their they are like naturally born for like
cold climate and stuff and singapore is nothing but that I guess it's really horrible [lah] to put polar bear in there
he died
he died
you
ya didn't look like old age [sia] the the bear just look like it was dying for years already
it was so skinny
I don't know apparently it was born in singapore
so they say like
ya I just feel like it's from #yishun#
#yishun# has cold weather and move it
but like <malay>kesian juga</malay> [ah] like you when you <malay>tengok</malay> the polar bear it's just so skinny and frail looking and like it was alone that in its entire life I think
just wandering around it's blue cage
like
I feel like a polar bear need ice
singapore is so hot
I want go <malay>yang tempat apa tu yang dekat</malay> gardens by the bay [ah]
<malay>pergi satu kali</malay> [ah] when in maybe secondary school
poly ya secondary school the last time I went
ya
it was not [meh]
it was
it was [lah] cause I don't remember wearing for R_C things in poly
no it was in secondary school I swear I think I don't think it was in poly
cause it was very long ago
gardens
by the
I opening
(uh) five A_M to two A_M
and it was opened in twenty twelve
how many years ago eight years ago
ya [sia]
sec four [lah] so probably in sec four cause I don't remember going in poly
like I always go way before poly so like
end of sec four
ya
no
no it was open
they said they open in twenty twelve
twenty nine june
fifty million
visitors as of twenty eighteen
you thought one day
[orh]
it's quite pretty [lah] the the indoor garden is nice
I like
plants
that I don't mind
ya
thirty
ya all our thirty dollars
cause of gardens by the bay and #changi# airport
<malay>tiga</malay> wish
(hmm)
that's a hard question
<malay>aku nak rumah</malay>
but legit [lah] like
basically the first thing I would ask
for is a house like
a dream house
like not not in singapore somewhere cold
right ya
(oo)
true
not worry about anything
and then they just make you like someone who doesn't care about anything anymore
that's what genies can do
so if your wish is from a genie then ya
genie in the bottle
(hmm)
I would wish to be
legit
no that's such a tiring job [oh] my god
I would wish to be richer than jeff bezos
so I can own him
and then I take all his money and give everyone else
<malay>entah abeh</malay>
but ya I just would wish for like unimaginable amount of money I think that would solve a lot of problems
(mmhmm)
the money won't exist
okay like that like that imaginable amount of money
like a whole H_D_B filled with cash that amount
and like by cash is like hundred dollars bills not by twenty cents
then like ya that amount of money
and use it to
or maybe find the cure to every disease in the world
and then use it to make money
that's what everyone does
(mm)
yes
can you imagine having like the the power to
solve every disease out there
ya some some random white guy gonna make billions out of that
should do it
but what was your third wish
what was your third wish
[oh] ya
just be like unbothered
yes
ya
(mm)
ya previous
(mm) money is like half of our issues
true
can you imagine if you had like three wishes and then first wish was to wish for five hundred more of you
what with five hundred clones
I don't know then everyone of you got like three more wishes
that would be cool
I guess
someone getting their wishes
don't know
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so what the hell
!wow!
plot twist
genies
ya
but like would you waste your wish on that
[oh]
(mm)
fair
why
ya
yes
right
COVID has been putting so many things on hold
how life has changed in like what less than a year
it's so weird
all like
in december last year we were all like
being crazy and having fun and like
not even thinking and then suddenly in february
right
being in school like right now
not on zoom classes
ya ya sure
ya but life would be so different without having to scan your
your Q_R code
everywhere you go
and
I guess ya
true true
just hide your identity all the time
ya I love it
ya
and that's nice
but like the safe entry thing is kind of annoying
(oo) okay [lah] <malay>kalau dia orang nak kasih</malay> free <malay>ambil</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau bayar</malay> then okay [ah] <malay>aku bingit</malay> but then <malay>kalau</malay> free
then collect <malay>dekat</malay> C_C_ <malay>dekat rumah aku</malay> okay [lah] and
I mean ya <malay>memang</malay> [ah] like <malay>buang masa juga</malay> cause
they tell you like [oh] you you don't need the code I mean you need the token thing <malay>abeh</malay> it's not like it's as if you walk past and scan it you have to actually bring to the person to scan
so what's the difference of like using that compared to your I_C right it's literally does nothing different
(mm)
or like if it actually has like any actual benefits like
I don't know like they actually know exactly where we are that kind of thing
so like whoever you actually come in contact with that has COVID then they can track
but like from what I've heard there's no G_P_S in it [ah] so like
probably not
(mmhmm)
and they haven't really spoken much about it like
on the on the news and stuff like it's just very hush like you just come and collect that's it
I didn't even know
(mm)
(mm)
no one was interested
ya
(mmhmm)
ya they
into this kind of stuff ya
I mean okay [lah] to be fair like the older generations some of them don't have smartphones
so like for them to access like
shopping malls and stuff will be hard
but like they have their I_C and that's something I know like old people won't lose
so like
ya
(mmhmm)
you know it's like you can't drop it you can't
get it like near water
like I'm pretty sure someone's gonna drop it
yes
drop it like right after you get it
like in front of the person like !oops!
I mean if it had if had G_P_S like data in it like would you mind
why
monitored
but I don't think <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
true
(mm)
but I mean if it's in the government then like
kinda messed up if the government is using it to
make fund like
criminal stuff
(mm)
I guess
I miss cats

<malay>abeh batuk rabak</malay> [sia] it's like cannot breathe and stuff
and then ya I would like cough and then have trouble breathing
<malay>sekarang</malay> if I carry him it's still fine but like my face gets itchy [ah] like if he comes too close like my face
and then <malay>kalau</malay> when I <malay>mandi</malay> him like
that's when it gets bad [lah] like he I really cannot breathe like I will start coughing
and stuff
but I don't know what is the reason for it I think it's

seven hundred languages

cause like I feel like everything is fine as it is
like I mean if you want to find like cures and like
(mm)
is put to use
ya
(mm)
somewhere else
that needs it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)

like everyone
chasing money

there is not no money
the U_S president speaks in malay <malay>kau orang semua</malay> stop it [eh]
what the
but do you hear about the the that orchard towers thing
the murder thing the guy got off with a warning
can you imagine like in the courtroom the judge is just like okay I think <malay>kau dah bunuh orang ni tapi</malay> I just I just want to give you a warning [eh] <malay>kau</malay> stop [jer] [eh] <malay>jangan buat lagi</malay> [tau]
