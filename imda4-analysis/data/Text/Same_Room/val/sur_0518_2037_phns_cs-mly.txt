then <malay>nanti</malay> you <malay>nak tengok cerita apa</malay>
[oh] that's some random thriller show right
what you mean bridge the cursed bridge
so is the cursed bridge
so it's about a bridge
I don't know now got what movie
can we watch the hunt
intruder we already watch
Greenland
want to see this one of the worst show in the world
Greenland <malay>apa lagi</malay>
to be honest <malay>kan</malay> I don't know how they record
like how they record these movies
like during this pandemic
like <malay>macam mana macam mana dia orang</malay> record
how
during a lockdown
what do you mean okay let's say the average amount of time needed
to make a film
is a year okay is a year
so okay let's say they start the production in
august
august last year
so then <malay>tiba tiba kerja</malay> continue continue continue then (err)
april [kan] lockdown
okay so from august to april
let's say they recorded like sixty percent of the show
okay
then how what happen to the forty percent like how they record it
is more of editing
make sense
but what if they start recording okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [ah] then that means the movie wouldn't be out [what]
ya cause it's a shit show
ya
okay you think about it
girl wants to be a guy
but she wants to fight
so don't fight if you can't fight
no
it looks stupid
no
I mean <malay>pernah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say like you know you're scrolling through the channel [kan]
then <malay>macam</malay> [oh] disney channel then got #mulan# then <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] then like [oh] whatever
then there's this one stupid dragon and small dragon with all the
all the ancestors
the father
ya then the I think like was it because of the dad <malay>macam rasa</malay>
disappointed <malay>pasal anak dia perempuan</malay> so <malay>tak ada orang yang boleh</malay> carry on
[oh] so which #mulan# have I been watching
but my story line makes more sense
okay like let's say okay if let's say your father
was a soldier and cannot go to the war would you go
for the war on the behalf of your father
no you won't you won't exactly you won't
why would #mulan# do that
what do you mean by no choice
I think I watched [lah] but I don't remember [lah] [kan]
no the thing is
okay
no no no no no no we're talking about #mulan#
so #mulan# [kan]
she wants to
go for the war
she has to go for
okay what do you mean by <malay>terpaksa</malay> because if she's <malay>terpaksa</malay> [kan] okay at first she's a guy [eh] she's a woman
woman is not required to go for this [one] [what] this [one] N_S
ya woman cannot go
but then why is sh~ she forced to go
[oh] okay okay okay I
ya
okay
okay
why
so if let's say everyone is a girl
okay
makes sense makes sense makes sense makes sense
<malay>tak tak pernah tengok</malay> that's like okay I watched the movie but I don't know what the hell the movie is about
I watched before
<malay>dia</malay>
no no no I watched already you see
#mulan# go fight fight fight fight fight then she sick
then she go see this ice
place then (err)
she she <malay>sakit</malay> then she <malay>baring</malay> I think sick or whatever I don't know
then the doc~
[ah] sick
so after she got sick
then she lie down then the doctor check check check (err) then the tell the main emperor emperor prince
coy commander (err) leader [ah]
[meh] she's a she's a girl
ya that that's the movie [what] right
she got caught in the se~
okay but then the most important she got caught at the ice place
by by who
#hans#
so is #mulan# like
based on the real life
<malay>orang tengah berbual pasal</malay> #mulan#
let's finish the #mulan# first [lah]
haven't
okay okay then how about that dragon
with the
#wushu# finger
kung fu panda
okay okay okay okay #wushu#
#wushu#
okay #wushu# then the ancestor how is that
got to do with any cultural
significance
why not
why I just help me understand
no you make me make me understand #mulan# first then I'll make you understand #aladdin#
what do you mean I know that she got caught at the ice place
cause she got shot not got sick
okay why she go to the war
okay so
[oh] so even okay the dad <malay>tak boleh pasal dia sakit</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> in the go~ in that government even though <malay>kau sakit ke apa</malay> [eh] sorry
even though if you <malay>sakit</malay>
okay even if you <malay>sakit</malay> or not <malay>tak kisah</malay> you have to go is that the rule
so the the #mulan# <malay>dia macam kasihan</malay> [kan] that's why she left that note
(oo) makes sense
nineteen sixty five [eh]
!wow! that's about eighteen twenty three man
so what do you want to know about #aladdin#
okay [ah] honestly I think it's stupid [ah] because
okay because
she don't let me drink water [ah]
cause he
cannot [meh]
then you want me talk for one hour no drink [ah]
!huh!
okay
<malay>dia pasal</malay>
this one guy
[eh] wait how's the show [ah]
how how did he find the lamp
[oh] what to <malay>curi</malay>

okay whatever okay
so in the
(err) go inside the movie [eh] go inside the cave

he met the genie inside he met the genie inside the cave
ya

ya
you know #aladdin# is the monkey [what]
#aladdin# was just like on the cliff
tell me your wish
then they sing a song
but I don't know the song is in the original movie or not is there a song in the original movie
then they sing song
then they rub then he rub rub rub already ask for the first
that was the monkey's first wish
ya that was the genie's first wish
(oo)
okay whatever then after that
the three the three wishes no we have to end this
podcast

there's this okay
there was this one girl <malay>yang</malay>
I was with <malay>macam sama sekolah</malay>
since nursery
so <malay>kita</malay> just grow like from nursery K one [eh]
nursery K one K two whatever whatever whatever [kan] <malay>sampai</malay> P six
we're together so our family very close from
this
then my <malay>adik dengan dia punya adik pun sama kelas</malay>
so then <malay>dia orang macam kacau kacau</malay> my <malay>adik</malay> [kan] <malay>adik dia</malay> [lah]
but then I was just minding my own business
then my mum you know [lah] my mum you know ac~ actually any mum
<malay>kalau</malay> they if you find one
guy and one girl in the same class for very long time then they will just start to assume <malay>yang kau orang ada benda</malay>
ya so <malay>begitu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it was just like <malay>macam</malay>
how to say [eh]
a topic in <malay>macam mak bapa berbual</malay>
they both talk talk talk talk talk talk talk then
<malay>bila</malay> primary six
after P_S_L_E [eh]
[kan] then I <malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [ah]
then <malay>macam rasa macam suka suka macam nak jumpa</malay>
<malay>ya allah</malay> [eh] wait [eh] <malay>belum habis</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay>
ya so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
<malay>suka nak jumpa</malay> that kind of thing
so that time I don't know why I had the balls to do it
so just straight tell her

at secondary school [eh] primary school I was like more of a yes man
yes man is like
you know there's in a group there's that [one] that takes charge <malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak keluar</malay>
there's that one guy okay [lah] <malay>kita gini</malay> [ah] then everyone <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] go [ah] no problem <malay>macam</malay> yes
so there's that one leader in that group
and there's one joker in a group
usually the joker is either small or fat
[kan] it's always like that joker is always small size or fat
yes
<malay>gemuk</malay>
actually when the ro~ robot <malay>tu dengar gemuk</malay>
then the robot ro~ <malay>dengan</malay> A_I <malay>dengar apa benda dia ni bual pasal gemuk</malay>
okay
so ya there's leader <malay>ni</malay>
and the rest [kan]
actually just just two people <malay>tahu</malay>
then the rest [kan] is the yes man
so <malay>macam</malay> let's say okay

okay you imagine this triangle [eh]
then you draw two lines inside
so this is the field this is the goal this is the goal so maybe you just throw to your team mate that's in this (uh) right rectangle he score
so what my team did
<malay>kita</malay> okay my rule [kan] at that game okay <malay>dia</malay> I think is seven versus seven or something like that

I will just in the middle again all I had to do
was to capture that intercept the frisbee from the opponent
