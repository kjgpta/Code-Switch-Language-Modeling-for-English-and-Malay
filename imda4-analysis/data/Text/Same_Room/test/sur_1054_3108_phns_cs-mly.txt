so
mama
so mama you already you know right that <malay>kakak</malay> [kan] <malay>suka makan ayam goreng</malay> right and then lately <malay>kakak macam makan</malay> popeyes <malay>sebab</malay> I think popeyes <malay>punya ayam goreng</malay> is way nicer than K_F_C what do you think
but I think
popeyes <malay>punya ayam</malay> is more crunchy [eh] I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to K_F_C and then ya the mashed potato popeye <malay>punya</malay> like <malay>lebih sedap</malay>
and then compared to K_F_C K_F_C <malay>punya tak sedap langsung</malay> I mean like it's it's it's nice
K_F_C's one is nice but
(err) the popeyes' one has a lot more things in it compared to K_F_C K_F_C is just like mashed potato and the gravy but popeyes is like gravy mashed potato then got like the vegetables and everything
ya
(mm)
[oh] ya you know (err) starbucks right now cause (err) christmas
starbucks right now it's christmas right so
(err) they got the toffee nut
crunch latte and then they got these new other flavours also like really want to try before because that time so many times I want to try never get to try the starbucks one before but ya
(err) but they say it's quite sweet because my friend
allowed me to like taste some of hers then it's was like okay [lah] quite sweet but actually quite nice also
and then they got the one at N_T_U_C they sell the packet [one] also
feel like buying it because you know like home
like
I be my own barista at home right because of co~ (err) coronavirus and everything
so ya do you want to try it with me
I want I don't know I want like I want what's that called the turkey with the cranberry sauce
I don't know why but I think because I watch
so many videos of people like preparing christmas
dinners thanksgiving dinners then I'm like I keep on wanting it and also want my
what's that called [ah] gingerbread cookie because
<malay>lagi-lagi</malay> like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
and then [oh] christmas cake the log cake everything ya I also want that one
ya
ya that's why
and then
like right now also I think you know I got my performance right then everybody want to celebrate also very hard because
(um) because of the coronavirus the maximum group of five thing and all
which is okay [lah] but at the same time quite sad especially when it's around this time of the year when it's like christmas and then everyone to
everyone want to throw like chalet or like meet up to gather together
but then you still have to wear your mask <malay>macam susah</malay> and then it's also <malay>tak</malay> fun <malay>langsung sebab</malay>
you cannot meet your friend
ya
[oh] ya they got the hundred dollar fees the hundred dollars
tourism voucher right and then like
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> complain
<malay>dia susah</malay> to <malay>dapat</malay> the vouchers <malay>sebab ada berapa banyak</malay> website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website <malay>tu</malay> then in the process <malay>semua pun macam</malay> very <malay>sulit</malay> and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> first of december
and then starting to starting on monday also got the mask
can take our masks also I don't know if you know
ya
I don't know [eh] I think so like I saw at <malay>kita punya</malay> void deck they put the poster everything then they say (um) start date thirtieth this monday [lah] thirtieth november until like
two weeks later
ya and it's very dirty and like very uncomfortable already cause the metal keep like the metal thing at the nose is like twisted and bent already
haven't yet haven't yet school holidays still got school
ya
like usual [lah]
ya
I also don't know we all don't know yet
[oh] I don't know I see first how cause we also don't know what we want to do with the vouchers cause in case we got any celebration or what
then (uh)
the mask
ya the mask I never put in the washing machine but it because keep on using and then keep on washing then like when you dump in your bag when you take it off or like when you want to eat all these are very hard
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean <malay>kemas</malay> and then the after is yellow very dirty then <malay>macam macam asyik lunyai</malay> and everything so ya
the one that I painted all cannot use because the paint smell very strong then if I tried I tried wearing it but then
like he did like that
ya
ya cannot
ya even after washing cannot wear cause it's very (err) smelly and all
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask <malay>tak boleh dipakai</malay> so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that <malay>dia punya</malay> paint very faint very thin <malay>macam</malay> acrylic <malay>dia</malay> it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with (err) like a bit more <malay>macam</malay> like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last [mah] so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very <malay>rugi</malay> because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
so I've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles [one] but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag <malay>banyak</malay> all my stuff so ya I don't know see how [lor] even if I buy like (um) the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
ya like that [lor] don't know how see first
I also don't know we see how we have whole month then we have school we also don't know how then ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
I don't know see how like if I can get into uni then go into uni [lah] if cannot then see how start working first or what
ya like that [lor] see how don't know how already
cause it's also quite hard [what] poly and J_C very different you know go into uni~ then with the whole coronavirus also very hard already
tomorrow got my (err) I got school what so then after that I need to rush my assignments
ya
ya if can by monday if not by tuesday because I need to print it out and then submit by thursday morning then on monday also I got another assignment due so that one I need to clean up also
ya
until six seven P_M
ya
C_C_A no more already but the normal class is until six P_M seven P_M like that
okay
ya
[meh]
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then <malay>kalau tak habis</malay> then I will be rushing then <malay>susah</malay> if I rush because
I got like my two thousand word assignment essay and then got my (uh) reflection journal that I have to clean up
finish already the reflection journal finish already but then I have to clean it up and then
for the
essay the two thousand word essay I'm only at like nine hundred words so ya
two thousand
ya
ya
but it's actually very easy just the organisation and the
because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but but it's actually quite easy [lah] because I got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like (um)
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya I still have my religious school until next year
no it's not finish end of this year semester ends mid year [what]
ya
I think so [ah] that one also not so sure you have to check with the <malay>ustazah</malay> again
no
ya
ya the water sports sounds fun [ah] but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so <malay>tak tahu macam mana</malay>
until june two thousand and twenty is <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
ya
I also don't know see what have [lah] what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is I think tomorrow will like
I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
(um) chop chop type of person ya you know so <malay>kena</malay> we all <malay>nak buat macam cepat-cepat</malay> because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then <malay>dapat rehat cepat</malay> so ya
ya
ya
I think you can ask #adi# if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got <malay>madrasah</malay> tomorrow
no [eh] no preference
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog <malay>goreng</malay> or like fishball like that
the <malay>epok-epok</malay> also just now (err) <malay>orang sebelah kasih</malay> also like very nice also
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but the <malay>epok-epok</malay> like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very <malay>garing</malay>
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
(um)
bake it
[oh]
I think like the <malay>epok-epok</malay> when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old #chang kee# [one] cause it's like
(err) taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat <malay>sebab dia banyak inti</malay> and then <malay>dia pun macam dia pun macam</malay> very crunchy <malay>rangup</malay> like that
the old #chang kee# one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the #ondeh-ondeh# and the red velvet one
ya the #ondeh-ondeh# one
but it's like
the #ondeh-ondeh# one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the #ondeh-ondeh# because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was (uh) on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
but it was like very little but got flavour [lah] and then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap macam rasa macam</malay> those #ondeh-ondeh# cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>manis</malay> and everything then I cannot <malay>tahan</malay> also
ya
the <malay>apam</malay> I ate and
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
[oh] then I don't know cause the <malay>apam</malay> was actually supposed to be one for me and one for <malay>adik</malay> but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if <malay>adik</malay> ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the #bhatoora#
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the <malay>apam</malay>
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the #briyani# with the potato also can
and then the the <malay>kuah</malay> from the #bhatoora# also still have
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the #bhatoora# like in the morning eat very nice [ah] but also like really oily
I think they fr~ like I ya they deep fried or something
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to <malay>tuang</malay> it's on the #bhatoora#
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
[ah] got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like [oh] maybe can make hummus then we eat with hu~ we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying [ah] so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first (uh)
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
doing hummus right <malay>tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan</malay> hummus
<malay>macam sedap</malay> [seh]
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
[oh] ya #baklava# also very nice #baklava# with like <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
#kunafe# is which one
(mm) I don't think I tried #kunafe# before but I think I've heard about it before
the bak~ is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first (uh) I think like
[ah] cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
[oh] ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then <malay>bila dah nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam rasa dia berbeza</malay> cause <malay>orang lain yang buat</malay>
so ya <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> [ah] like
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at #joo chiat# right like (err) that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
!huh! #ang mo kio# A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W [oh] no that one is shake shack
[oh] I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream <malay>macam tak</malay>
ya the whipped cream it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's not like <malay>serasi</malay> in that not not not <malay>serasi</malay> it's like <malay>tak</malay> equal like that <malay>bila dia</malay> spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
I think the #satay# when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the <malay>lemak</malay> and then you know the #satay# <malay>punya minyak</malay> [ah] like that right and then you eat with the <malay>lontong</malay> the <malay>bawang timun</malay> everything then you <malay>cecah</malay> in the <malay>kuah</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay>
ya the <malay>babat</malay> I thought the <malay>babat</malay> #satay# I wouldn't like but when I ate it <malay>bila masih panas</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap gila</malay> then <malay>macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan</malay>
I think the I don't know for me was the <malay>nasi</malay> was nothing special it was like <malay>nasi minyak</malay> like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice [ah] but the they have the like the <malay>sambal</malay> not the <malay>sambal</malay> but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli <malay>makan dengan</malay> green chilli <malay>gitu</malay> with the <malay>nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam</malay> crunchy crunchy <malay>gitu</malay>
but the <malay>daging</malay> very nice <malay>macam makan gitu macam sendiri</malay> because it's very easily peel off then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay>
and then <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>minyak</malay> right I was thinking if like if <malay>kalau kat rumah sendiri</malay> right the <malay>nasi</malay> you put in the <malay>minyak</malay> then you <malay>panaskan</malay> you <malay>buang</malay> you <malay>buat macam nasi goreng</malay> like that
ya but I think I like it [ah] cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
not a lot of flavour but like just the <malay>daging</malay> taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli <malay>makan tepi gitu</malay>
but the sad thing is the vegetables <malay>dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit</malay> [jer] the lettuce and everything ya
<malay>sebab</malay> if I have a lot then <malay>macam makan pun macam tak segan</malay> right then can put and wrap everything nicely
ya
ya
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then <malay>nasi</malay> then we still have a bit of the <malay>serunding</malay> right
and (uh)
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and <malay>serunding</malay> will taste nice so I think <malay>macam beli</malay> lettuce <malay>atau</malay> cabbage <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>serunding</malay> and then <malay>buat macam</malay> wrap wrap <malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>sambal belacan</malay> and then a bit of <malay>macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak</malay>
<malay>kat dalam makan</malay>
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know (err) during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for K_F_C you know even their K_F_C right the K_F_C each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
no [eh] I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so <malay>nak beli barang tu semua</malay> but maybe we all like
<malay>keluar keluar</malay> to cause <malay>hari ni</malay> is
(uh) naomi's birthday and then like we all thought <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita pun terlupa</malay> then it's like [oh] then we just okay [lah] december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
so
ya
ya during december then (err) I also meeting like some of my (err) like
(err) #kailey# and #ayumi# the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like <malay>macam</malay>
to cause like <malay>dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya</malay> timetable <malay>semua</malay> very busy right so <malay>nak jumpa</malay> and then <malay>macam makan sama-sama</malay> or something then that time I told you me and #ayumi# we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right <malay>dia belanja</malay> because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what [ah] see how
I want (uh) we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how [lah] because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed [ah] because like we all thought like (err) we all planned already and then like that night last minute (uh) that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her [mah] but don't know how [lah] see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped <malay>kena</malay> find <malay>orang baru</malay> [ah] don't know how see first
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
bet the person bought <malay>lebih sedap daripada</malay> you <malay>beli</malay> because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak was-was</malay> also <malay>nak makan</malay>
so ya then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>beli besar pun</malay> like knowing you you know like you <malay>makan</malay> one slice then you can <malay>simpan</malay> if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel [oh] the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at #jurong# point anymore I only eat the
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like <malay>lemak manis</malay> everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit [lah] because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one !wah! very nice I <malay>rugi</malay> they never buy the apple flavour
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
if not then go eat at <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> or something <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap</malay> and then like
you guys can eat #bingsu# or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
it's <malay>besar</malay> so <malay>dua orang makan kenyang</malay>
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat [lah] but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things [what]
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like <malay>belanja</malay> her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it [seh]
if not
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like <malay>macam</malay> treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
<malay>minum teh</malay> like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you <malay>boleh makan kat situ macam</malay> tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where <malay>macam dia orang makan</malay> [ah] you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
then
that time also
(uh) my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the (uh) tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also <malay>dia minum macam sedap</malay>
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive [lah] but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if <malay>betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan</malay> catch up with one another
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like <malay>buka</malay> the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> it's
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
the desserts all like really nicely <malay>macam betul-betul sedap-sedap</malay> they got assortments <malay>macam</malay> like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain <malay>macam susah nak pakai</malay> voucher <malay>ni sebab</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> really <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> hotel <malay>mana</malay> accept hotel <malay>mana tak</malay>
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people [lah] but you cannot like hund~ (err) four hundred dollars
ya
I think
(err) if not you can go #bugis# like the #bugis# #haji# area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to #bugis# street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's (err) like it's like affordable (uh) not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
(err) ya and then if not you can go to the that time the #joo chiat#
#changi# area
the ya then <malay>macam</malay> got a few cafes [lah] if not also the
around her area
#choa chu kang# area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite #ulu# [mah] so ya
ya
that time I went with her at #jurong# east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like (uh) the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad [lah] but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like #bugis# or something to <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>berbual-berbual kat situ</malay> because atmosphere <malay>pun</malay> #shiok# and then <malay>makanan pun</malay> actually really not bad and then nowadays #bugis# area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
