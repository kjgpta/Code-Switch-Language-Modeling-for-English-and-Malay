ya for me today was okay [ah]
<malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
<malay>tadi</malay>
today today was my off day
and I got like three days off you know how I told you <malay>macam</malay> I
<malay>ada kira-kira</malay>
<malay>sepuluh hari lagi</malay> left
of (err) leave to clear and like it's been taking me forever to try and clear my
ya my leave [lah] then
(err) I've been trying to clear so
slowly slowly [ah] slowly <malay>gila</malay>
then like (um)
today we had some random meeting
about (err) strength training like (err) for media analyst and
the whole melt waters melt water (um)
like the whole company [lah] from asia pacific to australia to
what's that to #shanghai# and what not
ya and like the forgot which teams [lah] but
ya it was practically like a
workshop where they told us
they like share with us what our
strengths are because we had to take like this test [lah] before
going for this
workshop ya so like I found out that some of my
strengths was quite reflective
(mm) it's like a strengths test like a aptitude test like that
ya what are my strength
ya but they didn't look at more on strengths (uh) they didn't even ask anything about the weaknesses so I think a bit <malay>macam</malay>
a bit
<malay>apa tu senget</malay>
ya
ya a bit skew~ skewed (err) ya a bit skewed [ah] the questions but it's tech~ it's just basically to see your strengths
ya
it's like strength
strength analysis workshop something like that
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] ya
then we had to break up in groups and all that then after that right after we broke up in groups
(err)
the first time we broke up into groups I was put together with the my boss's boss
like this guy called luke or something I forgot his name
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
ya I was inside luckily I had one of my colleagues inside there so it was my colleague and then another person from the #shanghai# branch and then ya we just shared [lah] then
I went first in that group and when I went first
the <malay>apa tu</malay> the
I took like I think around three minutes [lah] let's say
then we all spoke right but then the break up room was about to stop already then we only left with one more guy which wa~ that which was that boss guy [lah] the luke guy my boss's boss ya
so like he's like [oh] (err) there's not much time left but my strengths is this this this
then he like he he he talk talk talk so he got cut halfway it was quite funny ya
because like ya so they will say like ten nine eight seven six five four there's a countdown [lah] to tell them to tell us that the break room is (err) going to be closed
ya so it was quite funny then they had another second break up but my computer kind of (um) shut down on the zoom [orh]
[eh] not shut not my computer shut down like
my computer like the sh~ zoom didn't respond
I think because of the change in the break up like from the break up rooms to the zoom meeting
so ya I had to close my zoom and then reopen again
ya nothing wrong with my computer don't worry ya so it was it was okay [lah] not bad
then after that the second one I found out that some of my teammates just halfway they just left damn rude right
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [seh] <malay>kurang ajar gila</malay>
it's not it's <malay>tak</malay> compulsory <malay>tapi macam</malay>
good to know [lah] when you put in effort to you know
to make it happen ya
ya

secondary school also when <malay>kita buat</malay> lit

then why you take
[ah] okay okay understand understand

speedy <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah]
<malay>dia tak nak berbual dengan kita pastu selalu gini</malay> [tau] like everytime <malay>dia</malay>
everytime <malay>kita nak</malay> everytime I want to talk to him right then he always run away but then when we don't need him around he's always ya he's always around like what the hell
ya [seh]
okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak cukup</malay> attention
<malay>tak cukup apa tak cukup</malay> attention <malay>kesian dia</malay>
but ya (uh)
actually my last week was quite interesting [ah]
not interesting
but <malay>apa tu</malay>
but
(err) because remember I had one colleague jaden
no not jaden smith just jaden (err) he joined the new shift [lah]
ya my three A_M shift correct
so <malay>dia baru</malay> join
so it wa~ like his first day was just me and him
because there was this other person but he <malay>selalu</malay>
[oh] no that day he that day
me and jaden
<malay>kena</malay>
left by like we were sent we were like left to our own devices by our senior because that senior had to do (err)
what was that (err) had to go to the dentist for a
wisdom tooth surgery
ya it was quite <malay>rabak</malay> (uh)
it was quite horrible because he said he told us in the he told me the night before texted me [eh] just tomorrow
(err) tomorrow what's that [ah] [oh] tomorrow
I may not be able to [oh] no tomorrow I might need to leave earlier
and he was I_C [ah] mind you he was like the guy in charge that day there was only three of us [eh] on shift when supposedly it was supposed to be five people on shift
ya ya so I I was co in charge [lah] on that day
no it's not a big deal [lah] that job it's just
someone to be (um)
someone to be who's who will answer to the client [lah]
ya so like
he told me at the night before like at nine o'clock mind you and shift was going to start at three he's like [eh] just I think (err)
I may need to leave tomorrow morning after six A_M S_M_S
ya so we have this deliverable that we have to send at six
ya so after that he said he might need to go I was like okay [lah] why then he said [oh] because I have this teeth
problem like I have been having toothaches for the past few weeks and then tomorrow was the like the next day was the only day that he could get
(err) <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)
appointment
as soon as possible
because that night I think it was hurting very bad [lah]
no no no like probably at eight o'clock probably
<malay>nak kena siap apa nak kena siap abeh nak kena pakai baju</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>abeh nak mandi semua</malay>
I don't know [lah] I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt [lah]
obviously like
you could be lying also but why would you lie about that you know what I mean
especially on a day where there's two people
ya is it doesn't make sense
so anyway he told me that [lah] he told me <malay>macam</malay>
(err) okay I need to leave then he said he told our boss also our project manager then okay [lah] I told him okay [lah] then go ahead [lah] you I will handle even though it's jaden's first day [ah] then that was jaden's first day also
so I had to train him
I had to retrain him because he's he's been
on N_E_A or like our other client
(um)
!wah! damn long
like for six months
so he has been out of the loop for very long
he's not [lah] but like
he's practically new because
the last time he was on this shift
was months ago
like
almost I'd say a year ago
to be safe ya
(um) we are now separated into clients ya
[oh] cannot say
yes
anyway
stop
ya you don't need to know [lah]
ya the other one is ya
so ya that was quite interesting day [lah] because like I think I was just spewing a lot of information on jaden and jaden was like [eh] wait wait wait [ah] !walao! !walao!
ya he was so lost and I felt so bad because like
I only
ya I tell you later the other thing later
so <malay>macam</malay> he was damn lost [ah]
no I tell you another thing later like so I just saw my schedule
like you know I've been on this
three A_M shift for six months plus now right
so like
and it's because of my korean classes also so like
I told my boss [lah] I feel bad
(um) hogging this
seat in shift in this particular shift because the other juniors also need to try
this shift right so
(err) I requested to go to N_E_A
so she said
okay she will see so I had this conversation with her in like september so I was supposed to move to
[eh] no in october sorry I was supposed to move to the this N_E_A shift in
in what day [ah]
in october
suddenly I saw I was still in the shift one
so I was like what the hell
ya I asked her already she can take me out
into either a new shift or she tell me in advance that she's going to put me at a different timing but I will just ask for off on the days that I'm working [lah]
ya [eh] on the days that I have ya on the days that I have my
my language classes then <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> cin~ <malay>tak cakap apa-apa</malay> never say anything so <malay>aku macam</malay> okay
then like I and
I only found out about this
movement to N_E_A this confirmed movement to N_E_A because I had to ask
ya usually she will like
you're supposed to go to people when you're telling them like
[oh] you're changing shift
like it's normal to not go to people but this is because I'm changing clients
ya so it's a bit <malay>macam</malay> give me some heads up (uh)
ya so it's quite
ya but now I'm going to change to N_E_A shift
in december
same timing
three A_M to twelve P_M
bit earlier because my current shift is three thirty A_M to twelve P_M [eh] twelve thirty P_M
then now it's like (err) three A_M to twelve P_M
I can but it's because of my timing for work
[eh] for my classes
ya
no no it's already been destroyed before
ya I did that
ya
ya [lor] so like
I'm quite excited because it's a new I've been on this shift forever right you know
I'm so tired
(uh) yes but then
(um) I'd have to
retake like I'd have to rearrange my korean classes (uh)
ya but I'm going on this N_E_A shift for like three months
maybe three months around there
three months first
ya it feels like that correct
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya
and then like very hard to meet people hard to meet you meet friends meet family make plans I think it's the making plans that is a bit difficult (uh)
like ya I cannot force people like I cannot <malay>paksa orang</malay> to
<malay>datang</malay> and you know
to
like follow my schedule because it's crazy for them to follow my schedule
and then <malay>macam</malay> it makes more sense for me to follow other people's schedule but like
I'm
my sleep is deprived
I have to really plan <malay>macam</malay> straight away after finish
twelve thirty
I have to sleep
and then I have to wake up at like I don't know six seven
<malay>pastu keluar lepak</malay> and then go straight to work <malay>atau</malay> sleep a bit more and
go to work ya
ya correct correct so it's especially with my korean class it's even more harder because
it's in the afternoon then if I have to meet people at night then I can't sleep
know what I mean
ya
(mm)
<malay>tidur</malay> [jer] <malay>kerja</malay>
ya and because my shift <malay>pukul berapa pukul tiga</malay>
<malay>tiga pagi sampai dua belas setengah petang</malay>
it's like
if I were to sleep in [kan] that's literally my whole work day
gone so it doesn't feel like an off
ya
sleep ya
ya
correct correct
don't know I don't know I think
high chance right that I will be on this N_E_A shift
for six months
maybe because this
this shift right
only one malay can take
this particular shift for N_E_A
so like
a lot of the malays in my
my my team [lah] at least they are
they are not big fans of
(um)
this client
this !huh!
no <malay>takde takde takde</malay>
no they <malay>dorang</malay> big fans of N_E_A <malay>macam</malay> the workflow and all that even though it's a bit more chill (uh) actually
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>maksud dia</malay>
ya around different workflows different deliverables everything [ah] because it's a totally <malay>lain punya</malay> client ya
yes but
you can always learn (uh) you know what I mean
and it's a job [ah] you are getting paid
<malay>tiga ribu</malay>
plus
ya
you just learn [ah] you know what I mean
this job my job also you don't even need
a
particular degree I have one of my colleagues whose who took chemistry
ya she she took chemistry in the U_S <malay>pastu</malay> (um)
she applied
for this job because this job entry level is it's good for entry level people (uh) because it's it's you learn on the job kind of thing you know as long as you're good with computers
and excel you're good to
you're you're good
ya
yup
yes correct
ya
ya
so I mean it's good [lah] I I think I've been stuck on the previous shift for too long
that I've been very complacent <malay>macam</malay> I've
like this current shift that I'm on [lah] I've been too complacent
not complacent <malay>macam terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
<malay>terlalu banyak</malay>
(um)
<malay>apa tu terlalu banyak</malay>
I don't know I I just I
what's the word [ah] complacent (uh) when like
when you let things pass
easily now
like last time I used to ya last time I used to be like super like !whoa! like you know about this like
(err) [oh] <malay>yang ni jangan nak kena betul-betul tengok</malay> the the deadline and all that
like [oh] because we have to we have to make like attend~
a clock report right every ten A_M
you have to send a report so around nine to ten or eight to ten we start proofreading
<malay>abeh kita</malay> proofreading we put everything [ah] like whether the date is correct
the
sentence structure the
numbering for the all that all that answers [lah]
the numbering and all that and the [oh] categorisation and all that is <malay>betul</malay>
so
then now I'm just like
skimming through instead of going job by job one which is bad but like
like I one time I caught myself doing it (uh)
like last month or [what] then I realised [oh] shit this is very bad I need to
be more serious of my job
or ask for a change in environment
ya
ya then people you work with also makes a big difference [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> whether they
whether they <malay>apa tu</malay>
whether they
can work with you or not [ah] like listen to what you say
or like they are able to
volunteer because <malay>kita punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak ada nak kena</malay> #chope#
reserve
<malay>macam</malay> you must #chope# certain deliverables [lah]
ya
correct so like every morning okay I tell you the process of <malay>macam mana kita kerja</malay>
okay so <malay>pukul tiga setengah</malay> I <malay>bangun</malay>
three fifty I wait for papers to come in so papers come in three fifty
I've to download the papers from this (um)
this file
then like
(um) from this file three fifty I download already then we have to read the papers at
we have to read and like make headlines and
like type out the headlines [lah] like what are the headlines for today so
let's say <malay>pukul lima</malay> we have to send headlines
so one person will have to say what send headlines
yes five in the morning
send headlines [lah] ya
so have to send headlines so someone has to say like [oh] I'm going to send headlines today
so if you happen to be partnering or like in a team with someone who
doesn't speak up or doesn't like who has no initiative it's going to be very tiring if you keep
because I'm the kind of person <malay>yang</malay> I cannot <malay>tunggu</malay> for people
people if they want it they have to say it
first if not I will take it and I will get it done
ya like
correct
correct so you
me if I were to ask things like that right it will make it me seem like
I'm not a I'm not
like I'm not a <malay>apa tu</malay>
like I cannot be I cannot make decision like I'm undeci~ indecisive
I just want people to I have to be like smart about it (uh) when I when I think that people are not doing it
ya
ya and
ya
(mm)
often time
but now
that was last time (uh) remember I told you there was like one time in between july <malay>sampai</malay>
september <malay>ke</malay> august
there was like this team that
full of seniors very jaded seniors
<malay>pastu</malay>
jaded ya
just jaded like <malay>macam</malay>
they don't like their new people in this shift
or like their newer people in this shift
so <malay>dorang macam lepas tangan cepat-cepat</malay>
(mm)
!wow!
they're going to they're going to cringe at this
so bad
so bad so bad
ya so
no jaden is actually my senior
he came in before me
yes
okay now they'll think that you're trying to be smart they know this
they know this
you're not trying to break the form or anything they know this
<malay>orang ketiga</malay> [lah]
no
<malay>apa benda</malay> home wrecker
<malay>kayu tiga</malay>
I don't know
I think so
I'm so sorry for the person who has to transcribe this
do you need us to read a dictionary we can do that too
no I think <malay>dorang nak</malay> more natural conversation so that
this whatever A_I can pick up
I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> we are talking directly to you know now we have to like just have a conversation between ourselves so that you know in the future we are actually helping
people
(mm)
(mmhmm)
it's too loud
okay
okay
(mm)
ya [lah]
no but I just
I don't know <malay>takut</malay> it's not accept~ because I don't they also never say like what
kind of conversation
[oh] so they have to do it again and it's so hard to find a quiet place
everything is so noisy we live we live in a H_D_B you know what I mean and we're our neighbours are so close to each other literally there's a guy
banging on the damn
dustbin door ringing through like all the blocks
ya
right but it's okay [lah] I think it is their job [lah]
[a'ah] [lah]
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]

why
(mm)
I still haven't watch actually that's why I
ya
but ya I think that [one] will be quite interesting
because it's ya
don't know [ah] movies are
just tough stuff [ah] because
there's a lot of planning to put into it if we want to start our own
film
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
will you do it on your own or will you like go out to like (uh) <malay>tanya</malay> or ask anyone I don't know
ask someone who's in the scene that you know of do you know do you have any contacts
!wah!
okay okay I also had scriptwriting
I had a filmmaking class also
okay
then it will be just this (uh) you know like like the the when you do all the project by yourself then it's just all your name right
done by whatever written by no then like it's just two of us and then plus the actors or whatever then it will just be the same thing directed by written by produced by #blah# #blah# #blah#
(mm)
(mm)
you
I want to see a produced by me
but like you see [ah]
these kind of things need money
I know but where you how are you going to live
[ah] okay
we're not going to put our whole heart and soul into it right
yes yes
ya but like not all your mon~ and not all your money
but this kind of thing definitely need <malay>macam</malay> to set up to set aside like at least
two months for filming at most if you're lucky
[ah] but it's there's people to I mean there's people and actors to deal with also [what]
and we have our jobs also if we have a job when you have a job
ya that's if I can off day that
meets with your off day
know what I mean
ya
but okay [lah] not that bad
#han# [orh]
why
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm) understand
okay
I don't know how to check how do I check
haven't played a lot of games yet but I will try it later I have a lot of time
(mm) I try play on Borderland [lor]
I I haven't bought yet
expensive no
[oh] yes you're right you're right <malay>betul betul betul</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> #betuls# okay [lah]
(mm)
I kind of blew my money on Shopee for the eleven eleven sale
but I bought really stupid things [eh] like (ugh)
things for speedy for my cat
(um)
I bought camera through you right I bought webcam for my
computer but it doesn't even work now later you need to check whether it works
because like
what else [ah]
[oh] I bought masks
okay later I will show you I bought the remember I told you I bought (um)
to for the #mugen# train I bought the demon slayer masks
cute <malay>gila</malay> [oh] my god it's very cute
ya ya I <malay>dah</malay> wash <malay>lagi</malay> I <malay>dah basuh</malay>
I <malay>dah kering</malay>
I <malay>dah apa lagi</malay> (err) vocabulary <malay>boleh kasi dorang</malay>
I <malay>kering</malay> I <malay>dah</malay> squeeze dry
I <malay>dah</malay> compress <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
semp~
ya I <malay>dah</malay> I've done quite a lot of things [lah]
ya so as in it's drying now <malay>tengah nak kering</malay> I'll show you later you can try if you want to take home
<malay>bawa balik</malay> [ah] <malay>mana satu yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
I I I I I only want one which is the
#nezuko# [one]
I ordered four
because it all looks so pretty <malay>semua lawa gila</malay>
of course [lah] but like I have other masks too
ya but I I'm a bit scared of being like
to be seen as a weeb
<malay>dia macam</malay> those who know will know right
and then people think like (err) this girl anyhow only does she even know the movie <malay>dia tahu ke tak tahu ni dia main pakai</malay> [jer]
(mmhmm)
ya
#adli's# watching
ya
ya we've talked about this before <malay>berbual</malay>
does it feel ya does it feel like it cheapens the
movie now that everybody watches it or do you think it's doesn't matter
like you know how when it when it's <malay>macam</malay> when it's very a niche group of people watching a niche show right it makes the show more special
I feel like when everybody watches it
dia <malay>macam</malay> it feels a bit cheaper because like
[oh] now they are going more mainstream <malay>lebih</malay> mainstream
the special
ya
ya
(uh huh)
correct they need to
ya
accessible
ya
it becomes very accessible (uh) that's the thing
but I mean it comes with goods also [ah] because like
thankfully
due to the
popularity of <malay>macam</malay> demon slayer for example
or #haikyu# maybe it's gotten quite popular
not as popular of course [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> ya so like
it's easier for me to buy merch let's say merc~ merchandise <malay>nak beli nak beli apa lagi</malay>
<malay>nak beli</malay>
ya <malay>macam</malay> these merchandise <malay>nak beli baju</malay> you know
it's so easy to find
ya [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> if you if it were another show for example <malay>macam</malay> Fruits Basket
<malay>atau</malay> I don't know what's another show I don't hear it (err) hunter by hunter X hunter
quite popular [eh] <malay>macam</malay> you know what I mean
like if if it's a very niche show it's very hard to
appreciate it better with like merchandise or support them more like artist more
which is what's the english name
okay
(mm)
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya so that's what I'm talking about [ah]
hard to be a fan when they're not very
well known so <malay>macam</malay> that's why I say there's pros and cons [ah]
ya
(mm)
so like
okay understand
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh]
busy
for korean dramas also
ya
(um) because I don't know [ah] it's different [ah] it's a different
country different things they appreciate I just talked to my
you <malay>tahu</malay> [kan] I <malay>ada</malay> classmate <malay>jepun</malay> in my korean class
so <malay>dia</malay>
(err)
she's very she's very quiet [lah] but
she doesn't follow a lot of
korean
things even though she's taking korean class
so <malay>macam</malay> most of us <malay>kita ambil sebab kita</malay> either
interested in the culture
we watch K dramas
<malay>kita tengok dengar lagu</malay>
<malay>kita tengok cerita</malay> K drama <malay>dengar lagu</malay> K-pop or like you know just korean artist
so like
this lady she doesn't
indulge in these things
like she's just taking it for fun (uh)
so I asked her like [oh] how about ya so I asked her <malay>macam</malay>
how about japanese content how are they like then she's [oh] she doesn't actually watch a lot
and she say <malay>macam</malay>
there are not
as many well known
(um)
japanese dramas
if you think about it
kind of true or J or J like
ya japanese drama like those with episodes
you don't do you know any
ya exactly
apart from anime like
<malay>macam</malay> real people
ya real dramas
(um)
it's not as popular [lah] in japan
so ya that's why she said she didn't then I ask her what she does in her free time so [oh] I just do writing because she does (err) makeup
like (uh) she studies
(err) what's that called cosmetics I think
(um) I'd say she's in her mid thirties
ya her husband is in singapore [lah] that's why she's here also
ya
I don't think so I think they're both japanese
probably ya but then she said she's going back to japan next year
for new year's
so she might not join the class but anyway I asked her like how's
the life in japan <malay>macam</malay> how was her school life or like at least [lah]
then she said [oh] she actually like didn't like school a lot because
she just didn't like it [lah] then she said she prefer being out
no I don't think maybe I don't know
ya
but she's she
she's quite nice [lah] then she shared with me like about her school life (uh) how <malay>dia kerja</malay> part time
(um) like during high school and all that
quite interesting [ah] it's it's I love this class because <malay>macam</malay>
I get to talk to so many people from other countries in my class there's a taiwanese girl
there's a indonesian lady there's a vietnamese girl
and like the eleven year old <malay>punya</malay> remember I <malay>berbual pasal</malay>
cute <malay>gila</malay>
and this japanese lady so like half the class is
international so like
I'm ver~ I'm closer to the indonesian [one] [lah] because
ya because like I like I talk to her about <malay>macam</malay> my trip to #yogyakarta# the like last year
and then she would share with me about her time also <malay>macam</malay> in #jakarta# and how <malay>dia rindu</malay> [lah] <malay>rindu gila dengan</malay> #jakarta# <malay>tapi</malay> she she feels like
she will definitely stay in singapore for a bit because this place <malay>paling</malay>
<malay>paling selamat</malay>
for in terms of safety
general safety and for COVID [ah]
<malay>tak kat</malay> #yishun# not at #yishun#
#jakarta#
ya [lah]
but she used to live in #yoyga# also #yogyakarta#
and then (um) <malay>dia macam</malay> I don't know
very nice [ah] they all very nice people I'm just very glad
I I guess
I don't know they would look as I don't know
I mean different people are different [lah] what are you talking about
speedy ya so
it was quite fun
taking korean I think I can understand a lot
of like whether I watch
I can try
I can try but just know you can check what okay okay
<malay>boleh boleh</malay>
[ah] I have a lot I have a lot teed up in my
(uh huh)
okay
okay give me give me like give me two more months
because it takes me one month to finish one term
so like give me two more months maybe I'll be more pro
<malay>sampai tahap maksima</malay>
kidding
<malay>apa</malay>
(um)
I mean we are learning from a child's
perspective but we are adults so we understand it better right
so (um) I'm I'm guessing if I were to go korea now I can speak basic
korean like I can ask where the toilet is I can ask how much and understand how much a certain item is I just it'll take me awhile to (um) calculate [lah] because <malay>dorang punya</malay> numbering is very <malay>susah gila</malay> it's like
<malay>dorang</malay> count [kan] <malay>dorang punya</malay> currency <malay>besar gila</malay> [kan]
in the thousands so like
correct hyperinflation like of indonesia <malay>sama juga</malay>
so <malay>nak kena</malay> you must really calculate [lah]
when your and you must because numbers are different also they have korean numericals
they have chinese numericals
ya correct
yes so like (um)
<malay>banyak fikir</malay> [ah] I feel like it's easier for me to write then it is for me to speak which is not a good thing because you're supposed to be able to speak better because you're learning a language
to speak that language you know what I'm saying
correct I mean that should be the case for some kids [what]
definitely you'd know how to speak more than
exactly but <malay>macam</malay>
ya you'd know this right since it's your ya so
it's just
ya I just have to keep practising but I have no one to practise with at work also no one wants to <malay>layan</malay> my korean I feel like I'm such a
whatever a korean weeb is
when I try to speak korean
ya #koreaboo#
but it's because I want to improve but I just bought key caps
from Shopee
ya I'll show you later it's very very nice bro
<malay>lawa gila</malay> it's very it's super damn it's super nice
!wah! I don't know how to explain it's like it shines through and it's very clear because I was a bit
suspicious
when I saw ya when I saw online [lah] because you know how you don't trust anything online ya that's why
you can't really trust a lot of things online so
(um) I used to because it was cheap but it was originally about twenty plus dollars
no it was eighteen and then during eleven eleven it was
fifteen dollars like !wow! and like it's hundred and four [eh]
and and I'm quite lucky that it
and it (um)
that it fits
ya
it's they say it's for Logitech [eh]
say it's for Logitech
