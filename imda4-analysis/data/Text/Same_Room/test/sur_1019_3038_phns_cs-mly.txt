the promo ended already because [ah] you sign up with a A_I_A insurance then you paid a little bit then you get this price
ya eight dollar <malay>dia</malay> giro not giro [ah]
but it doesn't add up one eight zero
ya
that why <malay>aku rasa macam sayang nak</malay> cancel

(mm)
and then <malay>macam</malay> the equipments are not
not that I
<malay>aku bagus</malay> [nah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay>
I been there once and then but I just don't like
like very
