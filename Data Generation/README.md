# Data Generation methods

People generally generate code switched data using various methods like dependancy parsing, part of speech, etc. One of the main problem with Code-Switched data is that it is speaker dependent and not defined by rules. So, we are generating Code-Switched sentences with the help of POS tagging results.

Now, we took a step further and did pairwise POS tagging rather than word by word POS tagging.

We propose three data generation methods using Pairwise POS tagging.
