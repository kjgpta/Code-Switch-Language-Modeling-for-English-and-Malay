bahagian three debat tajuk three 
uh terima kasih anda for  proposisi for sharing anda titik , i represent  pembangkang and therefore , saya berdiri is that kematian penalti , should not be abolished and itu should be continued , let saya address , beberapa of  titik , provided proposisi first 
well  proposisi mentioned about  bible f y saya lain and , chinaCity in Virginia, United States and korea are using itu as a political alat to get rid of lawan 
well i itu is unfortunate that orang are , using ini 
kematian penalti , but in  wrong cara , but if kita have a strong keadilan sistem thats independent of ,  political sistem and  kerajaan , and itu independent and strong 
and there should not be a kes where itu happens right , so therefore is key that kita ensure that  keadilan sistem is independent 
and strong 
and be able to and not corrupt right so to test a fundamental uh uh sasaran that kita should drive that but itu doesnt min that definitely should be abolished just because of orang of abusing  sistem , 
plumbum to kematian penalti under  syariah undang-undang , about itu uh depends on what negara itu is , but for most negara like 
eyeing  fundamental tenet , and fundamental asas for hukuman , and for  legal sistem for  keadilan sistem is that , whatever crimes that orang are doing , 
in tertib to , deter mereka from doing a jenayah mereka should be punished in a same takat and a same uh 
asked to compensate in  same cara as what  jenayah that mereka have done , or even a bit more to in tertib to deter mereka right based on  keterukan , of mereka jenayah , right so if seseorang has minor jenayah mereka are also mildly , punished only to a small takat kanan , uh 
and but if seseorang has committed a major jenayah then mereka will be punished more major accordingly , right , so 
as in depending on im not going to debate about syariah undang-undang because itu a different , itu has itu links with agama but right saya think kita want to avoid agama perbincangan over here , but in general kanan , zina 
is  different masalah to have , so im not sure why itu is leads to kematian penalti , but i think in singapura itu theres tidak such kes so i think kita wont talk about itu , but in general kanan back to  uh  soalan about whether kematian penalti should be abolished , 
if seseorang has killed seseorang 
else  pembunuh 
can only be forced to compensate by dia own kematian kanan that thats why ada padanya ini kematian penalti that itu has been present in beberapa negara , 
for itu sebab kanan that is because itu is  only , good sebab or good cara for  orang to make good , 
and mengimbangi and to be punished for  jenayah that mereka have committed 
uh if compared to lifetime penjara itu is not sufficient right , if not if  kematian penalti is abolished , and if replaced with punished by lifetime penjara , then wouldnt then probably uh beberapa pembunuh can just continue to go and murder a lot of orang 
and then mereka will just go to  penjara and then be fed and have a good hidup have a good tempat perlindungan for  rehat of mereka hidup , and then would mereka 
be sufficiently compact um deterred from killing orang probably not right , mereka may , committed to , kill more orang before mereka get jailed right and or even go and commit more peo kill more orang in tertib to get fed for  rehat of mereka hidup , 
okay then theres lain titik about ,  
ini kematian penalti itu proposisi has mentioned is that 
um in which  proposisi mentioned various kes kajian about christopher and danielCity in Illinois, United States , 
and , and various mangsa and so on , um 
but itu not very clear also what  proposisi is saying as in why sh kematian penalti should be abolished , as in there could be various different kes where orang , uh think that  jenayah should not be 
uh punished by kematian , there could be various sebab in different keadaan or 
or , 
uh selok-belok in masing-masing of  kes nuansa in , masing-masing kes , but generally kematian penalti should not be abolished because 
for pembunuh mereka 
forcefully taken  hidup of other orang , without keizinan , without mana-mana sebab , 
then mereka have to be punished right and what is  bentuk of hukuman for mereka  best cara is kematian kanan because mereka took away seseorang else hidup and then , how do mereka compensate itu wang may not be sufficient , lifetime penjara may not be sufficient and therefore mereka should pay with mereka own , uh hidup kanan and 
uh but i think saya masa is up so now back to  proposisi 
terima kasih anda for  proposisi first let saya address  titik about  christopher and danielCity in Illinois, United States , well uh itu is most unfortunate saya think probably there could be beberapa , uh leeway for 
give beberapa , uh pengecualian , but as in itu could be , probably just an pengecualian to give up to pardon  ,  pembunuh from  kematian penalti , but ini is a pengecualian rather than a norma , as in  kematian penalti can still be there and there could be beberapa uh langkah or beberapa last resort 
for there to be a re a sebab as in a kaedah 
for  pembunuh to be pardoned by  , presiden or  prime menteri of a negara , based on , uh certain kriteria and certain sekatan , so i think itu could be done , so , itu is not really a argumen for , for be for abolishing  kematian penalti , on a overall asas but of kursus there could be langkah on kami 
kes by kes asas where there could be , uh cara for , that  kematian penalti to be avoided for such orang , 
uh where  mangsa have um pleaded for mereka 
and okay so then move on to other titik about  per harga tag and not should not play tuhan and take hidup , well then  soalan is if kematian penalti is abolished what is going to be  penggantian right , so i will assume  penggantian will be a lifetime penjara 
so can i ask um who will be paying for itu are anda going to pay for itu im not going to definitely go and pay for itu 
will  kerajaan be paying for itu if  kerajaan is , paying for itu then wouldnt itu take a tol on , on kami cukai and semua yang , right bayangkan if  negara , needs  wang  cukai and  wang to survive and to boost  ekonomi , but instead mereka spend  wang on , 
memberi makan and uh , 
giving , 
tempat perlindungan and makanan for semua yang , uh penjara orang in  penjara who are 
therefore ,  keseluruhan of mereka hidup , wouldnt  negara , not be able to sustain 
as in , 
uh saya think that there must be a baris dilukis of kursus if 
mereka did  pembunuh take  hidup of other orang 
uh forcefully then mereka should pay for itu right as in 
mereka paid tuhan diri mereka sendiri and therefore 
mereka , mereka should also , mengimbangi by with mereka own hidup as well 
right so is quite , tricky as to what is  
ralat 
if  kematian penalti is abolished what is going to happen , right ,  second titik is about , 
um anda ,  proposisi mentioned 
should find cara to improve as to why  orang committed  jenayah , but itu kerja has to be done of kursus as in , to prevent uh orang from going around to murder orang right of kursus , pendidikan is key uh as in 
 mental kesihatan of orang is  kunci and  masyarakat nilai and  , 
ralat bantuan 
as in , social pekerja can help orang uh anda know , to identify ini jenis of , uh isu earlier , so orang will dont go and 
jangan mahu to go and kill orang 
of kursus that should be done now that tidak mean that kematian penalti should be abolished um , 
mm 
and anda mentioned that  proposisi mentioned that , in eropah interestingly theres slow pembunuhan kadar and theres tidak kematian penalti as well , and in u s ada padanya high pembunuhan kadar and , 
ada padanya kematian penalti , oh itu is mereka may not be as direct korelasi but itu is a deterrent kematian penalti is a penghalang to to 
to deter orang from pembunuhan of kursus , at there could be , different sebab as to why  kematian penalti in  u s tidak , 
uh penghalang orang from 
committing pembunuhan , there could be underlying sebab between in  u s where orang are 
 , kecenderungan or mereka are very stressed or mereka have , a lot of kemarahan build up that led to mereka , committing a pembunuhan and mereka dont penjagaan about , mereka own hidup , uh but  masalah is if mereka dont want 
whether mereka care about  hidup of other orang and whether mereka care about hidup of mereka is a separate isu right , so kita are just trying to say that , 
if mereka have taken  hidup of other orang then kita make mereka pay back by taking mereka own hidup , um mereka may not have been deterred by definitely because mereka dont nilai mereka own hidup , but other orang do nilai mereka own hidup and , and thats a serious keadaan so , so 
itu can not be , be that mereka dont nilai mereka own hidup and therefore other bangsa hidup should not be valued as well , and so that is  kematian penalti should still be there , um 
and just to and  last titik about  kematian penalti s uh misteriCity in Illinois, United States sistem , well i think itu is always there as in as long as manusia are around , that there may be orang doing uh murdering orang , and kematian penalti , should always be there as a penghalang to , deter orang from going around and taking  hidup of other orang 
uh forcefully and 
wrongly because orang still nilai mereka hidup , and therefore kematian penalti should not be abolished 
terima kasih anda very much , 
positive pengalaman 
ya 
pelanggan perkhidmatan ah 
i mean okay so um that masa 
three tahun ago like two tahun ago saya had to buy a hadiah for saya kawan so i went to  stor but itu didnt had  stok that i wanted so i wanted to buy ini like jellycat kelinci saya dont know if youve seen itu before is really ya is a jellycat kelinci so itu very cute and itu very soft 
soft so saya kawan are saya kawan is in cinta with itu jenis of like mainan so i went down to  stor and saya wanted to buy one but mereka didnt have itu in stok  warna that saya wanted so  
 wanita at  kaunter basically asked saya to wait um awhile lah and shell put  tertib in for saya and mereka will contact saya over  telefon 
once itu sedia so mereka call saya a few hari later then mereka said 
mereka said that saya  warna that saya wanted has already arrived lah and then  saya think i didnt know much about like  stor sendiri so i only went down with  idea that okay i wanted to go buy ini kelinci 
and then over  panggilan mereka actually told saya that mereka had a personal personalisasi perkhidmatan for  kelinci sendiri ya so like saya could engrave 
um like mana-mana nama that saya wanted onto  bunny telinga and saya want saya thought that was a really like a really good um perkhidmatan that mereka had lah but i tidak know that about itu lah so  wanita was so nice like dia tell saya how itu work lah like  
 jenis of warna saya can do  fon as well as how long itu would take lah 
so after ya then i , saya was like wow ini is cool like saya can engrave saya kawan nama on itu so i told mereka okay i wanted itu and then um mereka took saya through um filling out  bentuk and semua itu so i just email semuanya to mereka and then 
like after itu mereka just shipped itu out to saya very quickly so i think itu was really like wow 
over  panggilan mereka told saya how to do itu and then mereka emailed saya after itu and then mereka said okay ya heres anda hadiah 
ya oh uh also right because 
because of um that  whole penyesuaian perkara kanan mereka also had like hadiah lilitan perkhidmatan so i opted for itu also cause like  wanita was like anda know anda since itu a hadiah 
since is only like anda top up lain five dolar just for a nice kotak and like reben and semua itu so i was like ya 
and what about anda have anda had mana-mana suka anda love 
ya 
ya 
poli 
one of  kelas 
so exclusive , 
so exclusive 
oh 
saya im , 
hmm 
ya theyll be like tidak anda need itu , 
but then at least itu was a good seperti at least mereka got  petunjuk that anda werent uh anda werent free enough to listen so 
but then last masa i got panggilan right do anda have anda had like a nice menjamu selera pengalaman and like anda actually wanted to give like positive penarafan to like maybe a restoran or what 
oh 
woo what what did anda had 
apa  aesthetic 
whoaCity in Illinois, United States , 
yes there theres a gambar ah 
mm 
nah , okay 
mm 
wooCity in Illinois, United States did mereka give 
did mereka give anda  bucu tempat duduk 
whoaCity in Illinois, United States but mereka gave anda 
oh 
hmm 
oh itu nice of mereka pelanggan perkhidmatan 
whoaCity in Illinois, United States mereka remembered itu really great eh 
saya sendiri 
okay  perkara is restoran itu not sesuatu cheap but itu not sesuatu expensive also , so depending on where anda go so i wouldnt call saya sendiri a regular but i go there uh once in sebentar lah which is i dont know if anda heard of itu itu ini halal japanese restoran called isuramuya , 
ya so ini isuramuya or is a segelintir to say  nama , but  first masa i went for itu cause saya kawan was telling saya how like oh anda know a new japanese halal restoran open up in uh barat at j kiub so i was like okay so i went there with saya kawan  first masa 
and then , 
um itu where saya found saya cinta for ramen because 
ive never tasted ramen before so itu was  first perkara that saya wanted to try when i went to  restoran so i kita went in and then  keseluruhan 
 perkhidmatan was super nice sebab mereka were like uh jadual for how many for three okay , then mereka actually brought kami like um semua  menu and semua itu lah so i bought saya ramen then saya kawan bought mereka own makanan 
so while kita were waiting kita actually um kita actually wanted to try out other hidangan cause kita saw other jadual had like ini 
uh ini really nice looking perkara , so what happened was that kita already gave kami perintah so kita were waiting for yang perintah to be cooked right kita actually called ini pelayan back and then kita told mereka that kita wanted more and then mereka were more than happy to actually tell kami 
itu uh sure mereka can do itu for kami so saya was really happy and really excited and then  hidangan came out really 
fast  itu would within like ten minit um i already got served saya ramen and then saya kawan got mereka makanan later on 
and then 
ya itu was super fast sebab mereka set up  table very fast mereka gave kami  menu very fast mereka cook  makanan and then after itu 
when i finish semua  makanan and semua that right tidak one actually came to disturb kami unless kita called for mereka 
and i think itu is a big tambah in 
when saya want to go out and dine lah which is that if i dont panggilan for anda , i dont perlu anda ya but if i need anda then please come , so ya that was a good perkara sebab there are beberapa pengalaman where anda know youre eating separuh jalan and seseorang cuba to come in and clears away anda 
while youre still eating so i feel itu 
itu not a good 
and like itu ruins  pengalaman which mereka didnt do lah so im pretty happy with like how mereka actually 
allow kami to have kami own ruang and masa 
to enjoy  hidangan ya so itu was one of saya really good pengalaman with a restoran 
and then um oh saya actually want to know more about what penjagaan kulit youre using and like why would anda choose itu 
other jenis or other jenis of jenama 
uh itu can be a produk itu can be a jenama what like what penjagaan kulit do anda use that youre going to like syor to saya 
oh 
mm mm 
lebur semua  solek wow 
saya i like innisfree saya sendiri 
saya like innisfree saya sendiri but i would honestly want to recommend like saya use ini uh on  sisi when saya have like breakout or if i am if i dont feel too good about saya kulit , which is  mempunyai anda heard of itu  muka shop  aloe gel 
is in ini green tab mandi 
oh saya tuhan  first masa im 
what ah 
ya is  bulatan jenis ya so i stumble across itu  first masa when uh saya was in secondary sekolah and 
because  perkara is i wasnt a big um solek slash penjagaan kulit enthusiasts i tidak know apa sahaja about itu saya was a really had tidak petunjuk uh 
really big idiot , about itu adegan so , when saya first , itu came across ini that orang were telling saya that oh itu helps acne terdedah kulit itu helps sensitive kulit 
so i wanted to try itu out lah so when saya did i realise that um  bahan mereka use were really uh organic and obviously itu uses aloe veraCity in New York, United States which is a really good tumbuhan to help with uh kulit masalah 
so when saya first tried itu out itu actually help to um clear a lot of saya jerawat uh a lot of saya jerawat and semua that and itu was really refreshing rasa lah because 
tidak  tab mandi was so easy to use ya itu very penyejukan is very cooling so like 
youll have that refreshing feel when anda use itu yeah i mean itu easy to apply also i dont know if anda see  tab mandi before when anda just have to open and then 
stick itu out itu so easy to use so easy to bring around also 
ya so i use itu whenever i um , whenever saya have to go and sleep or do itu ill honestly recommend ini over mana-mana other aloe veraCity in New York, United States produk mainly because of semua  good pengalaman other orang has had before 
and like how itu compares i think  innisfree bija baris is amazing lah but like if anda need  
a quick baiki ini perkara works really well 
of kursus ive tried  tumbuhan sendiri before ya but  tumbuhan sendiri is a itu a rumah is a rumah perkara so , beberapa orang who are not , 
uh whats  perkara called orang who are not um , hardworking enough to prepare  tumbuhan versi of  aloe veraCity in New York, United States should opt for  , muka kedai one , 
ya 
saya sendiri okay 
uh orang would call saya a bit weird but i generally tidak mempunyai called saya telco perkhidmatan in many tahun , mainly because saya use a pascabayar uh rancang i dont know if anda heard of itu  gomo rancang 
yes itu under singtel ya saya used to use singtel once and then mereka had ini gomo perkara so i bought that one saya jangan have a isu with itu so i dont call mereka 
so , pretty satisfied but what about anda 
okay 
ya oh tidak 
mm 
negative produk ulasan 
okay , 
okay pasti so um ,  first soalan is about um a negative pengalaman with a pelanggan perkhidmatan ejen 
over  telefon for produk or perkhidmatan , so um saya think tambang was to be honest with berkenaan to insurans 
like when saya had a really bad pengalaman , because i think mereka were calling from uh saya dont know like prudential or sesuatu honestly dont even know how mereka get  nombor anda know thats  most annoying bahagian like 
saya dont even know how mereka get  nombor itu like as though mereka just come up with beberapa random nombor and panggilan anda up and confront anda whether anda want like insurans or sesuatu , and i jangan think itu just a prudential s isu i feel like a lot of insurans syarikat do itu , 
so im like uh anda can just anda know just calm diri anda down why anda need to do , itu so annoying because 
mereka will just call up and then like soalan anda about 
so many perkara even when anda are like not even relevant to getting  insurans and theres ini wanita who called saya up from like um saya think beberapa insurans syarikat , and then dia was confronting saya dia was like oh anda should take  insurans anda should take itu , and then  whole masa saya was trying to reiterate to dia that saya was like eighteen and i mean while im an dewasa technically im still like 
uh a j c pelajar , and saya really did not want  insurans and dia was just so fussy about itu dia was just like , anda should take itu up anda know like dia was just enforcing itu and i was like apa  masalah right now i dont get itu , like i mean , i think like itu goes back to mereka , i mean to  peranan that mereka have to play which is like 
mereka probably get like komisen with setiap insurans that mereka like isih of are able to sell or sesuatu , 
but i mean i dont sesar anda for itu like anda can really try and convince orang to take itu up but itu just , 
youre trying to convince  wrong orang like ya saya dont even have a profil and i dont really have like apa sahaja itu got to do with insurans saya mean at ini titik in masa when im still like 
a pelajar , saya ibu bapa too pay for insurans and like im not supposed to take up an insurans on saya own or apa sahaja , and like anda just give saya one panggilan and then youre like oh anda know anda should take itu up for sure itu definitely itu bagus for anda know anda have like , a good portfolio for anda and anda have like 
of safe sisi for diri anda anda know in kes anda have uh mana-mana kecederaan or apa sahaja can just came for insurans and im like , tidak itu not how itu works ive , im not even like a full dewasa yet like saya just dont get how itu works and itu was just 
very like annoying and itu turned out to be like a very bad negative pengalaman because , 
itu was very clear that saya did not want to like um , did not want to take  insurans up but  wanita kept on berkeras and itu was just very painful to continue  perbualan because 
saya was trying not to be rude and i just wanted to like let dia know that i really was not interested and im not even qualified to even like setuju on saya own sisi , but dia was just very adamant and itu was just very 
um painful because uh ya dia just did not even understand  whole keadaan and dia was just trying to sell itu as much as dia could , and then i was just like oh im in  tengah of  pelajaran and saya just cut  telefon , itu was so scary and itu was so sad 
ya that itu was very painful , basically because itu was very long draggy and unnecessary ya how about anda 
mm ya mmhmm , ya exactly , 
mm , 
ya saya agree honestly when anda wi fi goes down itu actually are  most painful perkara , itu like youve rely so much on itu especially with like covid and semuanya going online itu like literally anda main sumber of , connect being connected to  dunia especially when anda are like 
semuanya is online like anda atas talian kelas and semuanya , itu so painful when like literally  one main perkara anda needed goes down 
saya tekaan for saya like ive had like several negative pengalaman also like i tekaan um for saya itu was with berkenaan to um 
saya guess um like penipuan and barang saya guess  perkara is that um , ini penipuan are there to 
main and like make anda fall for mereka and perkara is that itu itu becomes very painful because anda dont really know who to trust and not , and  perkara is that because um orang hari ini mereka tend to like really rely on like a lot of 
perkara and then mereka try and like memeras as much wang as mereka can out of anda , itu like youre so scared that anda dont even know whether anda should like 
terlibat or like engage mana-mana panggilan or even provide mana-mana maklumat over like telefon or like over dawai like certain aplikasinya or apa sahaja , and  perkara is that , while certain while providing maklumat for contoh over anda telefon 
itu supposed was initially like a very reliable mod of perbualan and like itu was supposed to reassure anda that anda are , doing sesuatu right , now itu like very scary because anda really dont tahu who to trust and even when  right orang call itu like anda begin doubting whether itu  wrong orang , and itu very scary and like itu sangat 
itu hampers anda produktiviti also because anda dont really , know who to trust and who not to trust anymore , and i think itu like a big isu with berkenaan to a lot of perkara now because orang really begin impersonating other orang , and while technically itu not like  
sesar of like individual syarikat perhaps but i would say that  fakta that mereka sistem are vulnerable to ini really 
enable orang to like alih on with like ini jenis of 
pengalaman , and i tekaan like lain negative pengalaman that saya have with berkenaan to , um 
with berkenaan to like um an pengalaman was with berkenaan like pakaian and like kasut and aksesori 
 perkara is that um a lot of tempat especially post covid because a lot of mereka jualan tidak turn up very great when a lot of orang at rumah 
mereka tends to like put up diskaun and semuanya 
and like diskaun like while mereka tend to be very attractive at beberapa titik in masa mereka tend to be like a little off as well because 
sometimes anda dont really know  additional like 
kriteria that comes to get a diskaun and like syarikat are not very explicit with what  kriteria is , and mereka always tend to like flash diskaun like amazingly on mereka laman sesawang or like i dont know surat khabar or sesuatu , and then youll read  first pernyataan and then anda will fall for itu , and then ill be like thinking oh saya tuhan ini is so fishy but because mereka advertise itu itu like youre just 
down there to believe itu , and itu seems so believable especially because a lot of orang are like i dont know like  great singapura jualan and like a lot of diskaun and jualan coming up , so anda just naturally thinking okay maybe ini is true 
and then after anda are like prompted to buy itu or like anda actually purchase itu 
then when itu comes down to  final langkah then mereka tell anda oh actually ini is only for like ahli or like ini is only for like orang who purchase ini produk on atas of ini produk , and itu so annoying because 
uh youre supposed to like literally be explicit about what  kandungan are what youre supposed to or what youre expecting out of pelanggan , and ive experienced itu like quite a nombor of masa with berkenaan to like especially tempat like , 
especially online sumber basically like um kedai that really give off like a lot of diskaun like online platform like for contoh like 
um lazada or like um i jangan know like Korsel or like even like pakaian kedai like teduh and barang , and itu becomes very annoying because mereka when mereka put up diskaun theyre not explicit with what mereka want , and mereka pelanggan perkhidmatan tends to be very like 
mengecil about itu because mereka think that , because itu in like a font , ralat 
one titik five at  bawah of  halaman were supposed to know itu or sesuatu , and im like how am i supposed to know ini like anda literally put itu at  bawah 
halaman anda made itu sound like itu not even important so saya andaian is that saya am not supposed to take big notis of itu , and like mereka tipu like so fussy about itu theyre like oh itu not kami sesar and then because youre already at  bayar kaunter or like youre at  last pentas of like anda pembayaran , youre just like okay never mind ill just alih on with itu , and then anda just pay itu and then youre like maybe i tidak have 
even have like started  whole proses , and itu just so painful because anda spend semua anda wang berfikir that ini was semua anda needed 
and then now at  final pentas mereka tell anda ini jenis of maklumat itu like very 
i jangan know itu not very nice of mereka also , because mereka really werent eksplisit with what  syarat were , and like when anda really try and contact mereka regarding  keadaan theyre not being mana-mana , better with berkenaan to help sama ada and itu can sort of be very painful because anda 
fell for sesuatu that so like , surreal itu kanan itu very like itu not okay to mereka is not a big isu but like , to anda when anda are really like , like specific with berkenaan to anda , wang or like anda really wanted to save on like certain perkara or like anda really wanted an electronic 
good like really badly and then anda wanted to save up on itu , and anda buy itu and then anda end up having been like cheated on anda wang , itu like itu very painful basically and itu 
itu happened a few masa to be honest like on different platform especially like online platform , and even like kadang-kadang like in stor jenis of like , nilai and jualan and semua that uh semua yang jenis of perkara 
so i tekaan that was like a pretty negative perkara that happened to saya also 
ya how about anda 
ya , mmhmm mm yup , 
ya exactly 
exactly , 
ya oh saya tuhan i agree with itu also , and  perkara is that sometimes like also like ini atas talian kedai mereka have like a lot of tersembunyi kos and itu can be very annoying because anda dont even realise itu itu there itu just like , 
like just lain versi of like putting mereka terma and syarat in like one titik five saiz font ,  perkara is that if anda buy like a produk itu like , ten dolar like locally in stor and then youre like okay let try just try and save wang and then go atas talian and then itu like saya dont know so for like 
four dolar or sesuatu or like five dolar ,  perkara is that mereka dont even tell anda  kos of itu until anda proceed to checkout and then anda pay semuanya and then theyre like oh itu actually six dolar worth of like penghantaran , and then itu like youre so bummed because , anda thought that itu cara cheaper atas talian and then mereka dont even tell anda apa sahaja about itu 
up till  momen anda proceed to check out , and itu happens on a lot of different platform but especially that syarikat that really exhaust like 
ini aspek of like delivering itu to anda pintu depan , and like a lot of syarikat if like online platform like beberapa of mereka like 
ya theyre mereka explicitly stated that oh itu coming from ini negara , and penghantaran kos can like vary according to when anda want itu by or like how long  jarak is 
which is very like berguna but ada padanya like a lot of syarikat out there which arent very transparent with itu , and itu very painful when anda want to like pembelian sesuatu and then anda dont know  exact like perkara until anda proceed to checkout or like anda , proceed to buy or purchase  perkara and itu can be from like almost setiap different syarikat like even with berkenaan to like 
penghantaran on a syarikat like for contoh ambil makanan im able to like beli , 
um penghantaran like for item but  perkara is that because itu based on anda kedekatan 
a lot of  caj tend to be very low but when anda tend to purchase itu directly from  syarikat mereka dont tell anda that 
oh mereka will like for contoh like um i jangan know like katering perkhidmatan or like restoran online , like mereka will already inflate mereka , like mereka harga when anda want to buy mereka from like an atas talian stor , with berkenaan  hidangan or like i dont know sesuatu , and then mereka will also charge anda on atas of itu for anda penghantaran so itu like itu can be very like ini instead 
incentivizing if anda want to like pembelian itu from  stor sendiri , and then itll make anda feel like well saya might have just anda know gone saya sendiri and like gotten beberapa senaman and then purchase itu at a lower harga and came back , and then itu like youre beginning soalan whether ini perkara are really like out there to like just 
rip of anda wang or youre actually given a nilai for itu ya , 
rekod 
pengabaian 
ya prompt three of four 
what is itu what frustrates anda 
ha saya know  aplikasi frustrates anda right then , 
ya 
slow perkara is  appen ah 
eh actually good leh itu gives anda a perniagaan idea leh to do sesuatu 
more to  aplikasi leh anda can come up with a new aplikasi leh that old orang can use because anda always have a funny idea for  aplikasi kanan 
ya so anda can use semua  ulasan to create a new aplikasi for old orang eh 
uh 
since anda already got semua  maklum balas 
uh ya 
uh what frustrates saya ah 
a lot of perkara lah blue bola black bola also have lah but i prefer white bola lor because easier to see when playing bola sepak in  gelap lah 
i dont like orang who use yang black colour bola and  blue colour one seperti can not really see in  gelap because saya got 
a bit of  malam kebutaan so i cant really see ah 
i pemacu pretty well because saya lampu sorot is quite bright lah , 
mm , 
apa  worst hari anda witness anda lor anda after anda get anda first isteri then anda get anda second isteri then i keep quiet i never say to sesiapa sahaja 
okay kita dont say uh whats  worst perkara youve witnessed 
keep quiet about ah , 
saya really keep quiet leh uh 
what are  worst perkara saya have witnessed and kept quiet about i think very rarely saya can not remember now lah what about anda 
recall a adegan for a cereka that made anda too angry to watch 
netflix lah anda say anda like to watch netflix pasti anda will know sesuatu lah 
recall a adegan from a cereka that made anda too angry to watch ah 
actually most of  chinaCity in Virginia, United States eight rancangan lah 
tanduk anda 
ya because anda know like apa going to happen and yet  lelaki or  gadis still go and do  perkara kanan 
so like make anda quite uh quite angry kanan 
sebab saluran eight shows quite predictable kanan so , anda know apa going to happen then in  penghujung itu still happen 
and also maybe saya can not remember exact adegan lah but i think most of  tunjuk uh most of saluran eight drama shows lah 
ya because i tidak netflix mah 
anda borrow saya lah 
describe  masa when anda are unable to help seseorang in perlu ah 
last masa when saya was in  when saya was taking bas ah 
then saya saw 
seseorang being knock down 
but i tidak dapat and then i tidak bantuan lah because saya after saya saw eh 
actually  orang die already lah lepasan away already ya so 
so i couldnt bantuan dia lah so actually i think eh saya help dia but then actually but then there got orang already lah so i also 
tidak bantuan lah , 
ya so huh lihat then huh 
bloated tidak tidak tidak tiada siapa come yet 
tidak mempunyai bina um  polis semua ini tidak mempunyai datang yet so , and then after saya saw  badan was in a very weird sudut so i think there was tidak cara dia is going to be alive lah 
nota what is anda greatest takut , 
ha saya know ini one isteri nombor three 
oh anda isteri which one mm 
what is saya greatest takut 
saya greatest takut 
is 
not being to saya full potential lah so 
so i always have ini berfikir ah that if 
like  worst 
when anda die 
then anda go up to heaven then anda see 
anda diri anda 
tidak anda dont see because anda see  orang that anda supposed to be itu bermaksud who are anda full  satu that reach anda full potensi 
so anda see that lelaki wah  lelaki actually if i mean if anda had done itu diri anda , anda will become itu lelaki also so i think that is saya fear lah 
so anda have to do itu lah 
so i want to try to be as much as possible 
do anda have phobias how did anda overcome mereka 
saya know last masa anda got fobia of perkahwinan lah but how anda overcome 
beberapa more got two perkahwinan ah anda , 
tidak fobia at semua ah 
tidak fobia anda got tidak tinggi fobia ah 
tidak tinggi phobia okay i think i dont know whether is itu call a fobia or not lah saya think scared lah so , back when saya was doing ini bungee lompat lah 
then before saya go up there i saw orang in hadapan of saya 
so  orang will hold  tali 
uh tidak saya think jangan know hold  tali or mereka will push anda uh so theyll say 
like mereka will count down five four three two one anda know mereka will count down so  orang will always five 
four three then three ah 
tolakan anda so 
so uh how i overcome ah sebab saya dont want mereka to push saya 
saya dont want mereka to shock saya so in  penghujung when mereka say five 
then i lompat already , ya so thats how i overcome i tidak 
thats how am i overcome lah so ini really applies to semuanya uh so before , 
sesiapa sahaja want to do sesuatu i do first then i wont be so scared lah 
ya correct 
itu one was in phuket 
ya 
so from then seterusnya i think 
itu not so scary already lah so in  penghujung after itu saya tried lain like 
three more masa  bungee lompat 
ya now old can not do already lah but younger still can lah 
ya maybe anda ulang tahun kita do bungee lompat for anda lah 
terangkan sesuatu anda watch or read that give anda goosebumps 
sesuatu anda watch or read that give anda goosebumps ah 
sesuatu that saya saw lah sesuatu that saya saw 
itu masa when saya stay in jepun when im driving suddenly im as when before saya saw  perkara ah 
saya rambut already berdiri and after itu 
like three saat later i , then i saw  perkara 
so that one really give saya goosebumps lah semua  rambut in saya badan semua stand up ah 
tidak rambut also grow rambut also ah 
wah okay 
then anda got tidak merinding at semua ah 
like tidak ah dont have ah anda scare diri anda okay , aiyo cham lor aiyo , 
aiyo saya getting merinding also ah 
anda should tell saya first lah , then saya can describe sesuatu that i got merinding from anda lah , 
tidak ah 
uh , 
pecah masa again ah 
wooCity in Illinois, United States tidak perlu to continue , 
wah what is anda greatest takut anda got tidak takut right because anda got two perkahwinan , apa anda greatest takut 
anda got a lot of wang ah to pay  cerai uh alimoni ah 
apa anda greatest takut tidak takut , 
what is itu what , what is itu 
anda also dont even know , 
losing anda close yang oh 
okay uh describe an peristiwa that made anda very angry 
anda bapa asking anda to do  app perkara lah 
anda cant remember an peristiwa that made anda very angry anda ibu and bapa asking anda , app 
of kursus anda like to save right 
mm 
rumah lah mm aiya rumah jangan say hutang lah 
mm 
so anda change isteri never ubah right same lah 
made saya very angry ah , that 
that anda have so many isteri lah 
uh ini , i mean i think ah saya everyday also very angry so i dont remember which , 
saya ibu bapa made angry ah tidak not really quite angry mereka semua made saya irritated lah so lor 
uh make saya very angry ah 
seseorang that describe an peristiwa saya think tidak 
tidak that one im not angry that one is like 
peristiwa that made saya very angry ah , i think mostly is due to driving lah there are a lot of orang dont know how to drive properly ah 
then uh ini one then too many peristiwa lah 
uh tidak im  same orang and saya before driving and after driving also very angry one 
ya so thats why , 
so what disgusts anda 
ya oi anda i asked what disgusts anda 
oh saya disgust anda ah i dont know anda say anda admire saya 
jijik anda , 
uh three one three , oh 
three t g one three 
what disgusts saya ah 
sometimes ah 
saya can dont like jangan najis for three hari and then i wah feel very disgusted jijik sial like wah how datang can not , i think got sembelit or what that can not poop out 
so really quite disgusting leh actually then once itu come out ah wah  tandas mangkuk stuck then anda see woo 
wah three hari worth lah itu become hardened , 
so that one disgusts saya lah 
mm then what disgusts anda 
saya cerita ah 
british sikap 
mm 
but anda also got a lot of wang what anda also can do apa sahaja anda want mah 
mm bagus , ah jangan know anda also meh 
then what is  isu that anda feel upset over because anda feel  dunia needs to do more about itu 
saya think  dunia ah 
keperluan to eat more healthy ah 
sebab semua of semua  
processed makanan 
i min for saya also right wah very easy to buy so wah 
i feel very upset ah like , like semalam i want to 
buy ini healthy snek palang 
then i see wah 
four dolar lima puluh sen leh for itu small saiz then i look at  other 
at  similar sized wah ini one sial unhealthy and itu only one dolar lima puluh sen so wah then so i thinking to myself wah if i want to become fit ah 
or saya want to eat healthy wah ini is 
ini is very , ya itu very expensive for saya so ini is sesuatu that , that if mereka want orang to be more i min to be healthier i think mereka should 
at least make  harga similar saya mean ini with such dispariti such perbezaan 
how setiap , i mean like h p b lah whatever yang u s mereka say wah a lot of obese lah then what of kursus anda see mcdonalds five dolar 
anda wan na makan healthy salad wah six seven eight dolar so let say if anda dont want to spend so much wang , then makanan is just makanan to sustain anda right of kursus anda go for mcdonalds right then when anda keep eating mcdonalds then , 
anda will become fat so ini one saya think  dunia needs to to do more lah 
true lah like of kursus anda need to exercise okay let say ini two lelaki 
makan healthy makanan of kursus  long jalankan ini healthy lelaki with healthy makanan , will be better mah but let say if mereka dont have  senaman anda see semua ini obese orang mereka also dont senaman mah so in  first langkah 
ya so obese ,  first langkah itu should be mereka diet mah right so itu lebih mudah for mereka 
i mean if mereka can eat sesuatu , 
tasty makan sesuatu filling 
im pasti mereka will go for  lebih sihat makanan but just because of  harga only 
and chicken sayap is so cheap 
ya lor terangkan 
a masa when anda hurt seseorang perasaan 
when saya say anda have three isteri lor 
why ya poligami ah 
describe a masa when anda hurt someones perasaan , 
uh , 
saya think maybe 
actually uh a lot of masa i didnt know i hurt seseorang feeling until like 
few bulan few tahun later so itu probably when saya speak 
saya minda lah so without filtering itu lah so i think a lot of masa lah not only one masa lah 
saya think sarahs sleeping already lah 
but one kewangan 
well if saya ill prefer to do itu as married pasangan because if anda were to single orang kanan anda will not be able to anda know buy a rumah at until  umur of tiga puluh five and above 
because as a married pasangan as long as anda are married or youre widowed anda can uh buy a rumah at like dua puluh one and above but if anda are single anda can only buy a rumah at like at  umur of tiga puluh five and above right ya 
yes itu true because single orang also mereka can somewhat rent a rumah anda know mmhmm ya to rent a bilik on anda own 
yes because if mereka are currently going to stay in a rented rumah which has like tidak keluarga ahli will be uncomfortable for mereka right 
ya 
okay so suresh so contoh like if anda want to like renovate anda rumah like would anda like want to get a pinjaman from  bank 
mm ya okay 
well i am actually like anda know 
not itu umur to buy a rumah so tidak 
but ya so err itu a tidak , 
oh mmhmm 
ah ya 
ya or find bilik eksekutif bilik 
ya saya also actually believe like once anda uh want to buy a rumah kanan anda have to pay  ejen anda have to uh give  ejen like , about one or two peratus of  , wang that anda get right ya right 
ya and if anda are ya and if anda sell  rumah is like anda will get uh  ejen will get like two to four peratus 
ya so thats why  peratusan peningkatan membandingkan to membeli and selling  rumah itu right 
who saya um well ive pemikiran of investing a sifat but not really sure how to start but ya 
oh ya 
yes because if not anda will , have lesser keuntungan , yes anda will lose more than anda gain so 
c p f ya itu is possible to use c p f because ya so in hundred of  rumah  down pembayaran of purchasing  rumah is twenty five peratus or  pembelian harga basically ya 
well anda can use c p f about twenty peratus in ordinary akaun with uh five peratus of tunai ya so anda have to 
yes yup , anda have to use kami own tunai to pay 
yes true because  higher  c p f basically anda dont have to fork out more wang in anda tangan comparing to when anda know 
mmhmm okay 
oh if saya i would rather apply for h d b pinjaman 
because uh if i apply for bank pinjaman mereka are much more stricter saya know seseorang that apply for a bank pinjaman has um masalah actually ya , mereka have masalah paying for  , for  bank pinjaman so  orang changed to h d b pinjaman so that itu will be easier because bank pinjaman are 
has mereka own minat more than  h d b pinjaman 
ya 
yes h d b pinjaman is rather more lenient then bank pinjaman because if anda didnt pay  bank pinjaman on masa youll be reprimanded out of  rumah 
mm okay , 
for , for floating kadar or fixed kadar 
ya so uh i feel like floating kadar rumah pinjaman are basically like cheaper than  fixed satu 
comparing like floating and fixed  different is about three titik five peratus because a floating kadar is eleven from five per 11 titik five peratus however  baiki is fourteen peratus so basically anda save a 
wang if  floating kadar meningkat by about how many peratus like two titik five contoh 
right , 
ya 
yes might fluctuates itu true 
ya 
mm okay ya itu true so um 
if anda do have like mana-mana other bank akaun comparing to like anda know one bank akaun to for like saving for like anda know spending 
oh okay because currently i have like two bank akaun one is basically for like penjimatan and  other satu is basically for saya to spend wang 
mm okay ah so um 
okay 
so suresh ah maaf , so um in a pos covid dunia what perubahan are anda making in terma of perbelanjaan and saving tabiat 

mm 
ya true do anda feel like anda actually really spend lesser 
or more membandingkan to when anda before covid and during covid 
mm 
oh okay saya see because for saya when in during covid i feel like i spend more wang comparing to when saya was when theres tidak covid because when youve been like staying at rumah for quite awhile youll be like 
bored or dont have mana-mana item anda spend anda have more perbelanjaan right ya understand like 
anda buy contoh uh contoh like makanan 
anda dont want to go out or anda know itu during  tempoh where anda can not go out 
ya and  tertib harga is usually theres a penghantaran which is anda know , spend more than what anda go out 
ya so do anda think anda should own a kredit kad 
itu true because kredit kad has mereka own like anda know anda might overspend 
yes itu true i understand because sometimes when anda pay using  kredit kad and when anda cant pay back on masa or anda pay back later there will be minat kadar that keep on increasing masing-masing bulan by  masa that anda know contoh if anda ya if anda never pay for  perkara for five bulan 
mm 
yes itu true 
so um 
how do anda invest anda wang to academic kekayaan and or planning for bersara 
okay ya i understand , 
so anda wouldnt uh anda wouldnt try to invest right because youre not sure of how jenis itu works 
mmhmm for saya i dont think im going to invest in apa sahaja yet because currently saya have to find out cara on how to start investing anda know 
if anda start investing now anda dont know how itu works along  cara whats  nilai drops so whatever anda going to lose a lot ya if anda dont know how to do 
ya is very risky , right okay 
so asrad what , maaf , what nasihat would anda give to seseorang in tertib to reduce mereka pendapatan cukai 
yes itu true anda earn a lot anda should save more instead of , ya instead of like wasting more wang 
mmhmm itu true 
yes higher bayar higher cukai okay mmhmm 
oh yes true ya to have a lain penjimatan anda know 
ya itu true okay so 
in saya paparan saya nasihat to give seseorang to reduce mereka pendapatan cukai kanan is basically 
well 
to stop anda know spending a lot comparing to when anda earn 
yes itu true if anda to be honest if anda were to spend a lot of wang anda will , 
mmhmm 
okay , so what can anda do to earn extra pendapatan or improve anda pendapatan aras so for saya right what i do to earn extra pendapatan is i like to tutor orang right anda know right so ya tutoring basically itu like a sisi kerja 
anda can do where anda can help orang anda know to improve 
to improve with mereka pendidikan and also to improve  jumlah that anda get anda gaji can increase a bit right how about anda 
yes itu true ya 
and especially in tertib to earn like more right anda know orang are doing ambil now 
yes thats one of  perkara that orang do grab 
helps mereka earn more pendapatan while being able to drive around 
yes itu true once anda rent mereka kereta anda will have to pay a certain jumlah , 
okay 
so yes itu true 
yes anda have to know about like barang about cari h d b because anda know were getting older and were gon na be purchasing one soon 
right , okay so , so mm how do anda save 
mm okay understand ya itu was nice okay 
bahagian three negative pengalaman 
okay , so um , 
saya tekaan on ini tajuk saya can probably start first 
there was a masa where uh saya was forced to change saya rancangan ah against saya will ah 
uh that was when saya was planning itu was when saya was actually in india , then ya saya was in india 
ya 
anda wanted to go , 
well bagaimanapun 
ya 
tidak uh ini one was just to india and i went to uh dharamsala lah 
so what happened was that uh 
kita of kursus lah kita do kami kerja rumah kita 
then kita prepare thoroughly already , then 
uh ya lah even buku  hotel not oh okay at itu masa ah itu was not uh internet , digital pemesanan umur yet , so itu like anda call  hotel anda say ya ill be coming that jenis of perkara , then anda go to  hotel uh anda go to  lapangan terbang 
then anda will look for  teksi and say oh ya ini one saya seem to have read about anda have to avoid ini teksi and go to ini teksi but then , booked a teksi , and then tell dia okay ini is  hotel kita want to go to , so ini was about eleven p m at malam , 
uh after arriving at  lapangan terbang is already around eleven p m at malam so youre driving along with 
ini indian uh manusia  one of  local teksi pemacu , and then uh halfway dia stopped by a 
uh a bangunan 
ya an pejabat bangunan which  lampu were out and , semuanya so dia go in , wake up itu lelaki inside there and then dia says , ya uh 
itu supposed to be a so called pelancong 
maklumat 
uh pejabat pelancong maklumat pejabat , and there are a lot of mereka in in india 
and then uh so ini lelaki supposedly got on  telefon spoke and spoke to , seseorang on  other sisi who say who was  hotel orang ah 
then dia say oh semua booking full semua booking full and i say oh can anda help saya call ini orang then semua booking full , but of kursus lah  suara at  other sisi is always  same satu 
so itu actually a scam ah , so ya , is a penipuan so , so basically that lelaki brought saya there and try to convince saya that  or  hotel saya was trying to go to is full already , and then uh 
dia took saya near there dia didnt actually bring itu bring saya in 
into  tempat dia says okay anda walk there diri anda because saya dont mahu to go in um im takut of going in because ini kawasan is very bad 
itu what dia says lah but of kursus wah first malam in , first malam in india 
first masa saya was travelling uh alone that in itu cara then in  tengah of  malam then being dropped off by ini teksi pakcik whos telling anda sesuatu like ini , so 
of kursus lah i chuak lah uh saya dont feel very comfortable in going 
so dia , dia then say okay lah saya take anda to other tempat then kita went around uh tempat by tempat in  other hotel and then finally settled , in one of  more expensive yang lah and then dia was expecting beberapa jenis of komisen ah but then of kursus saya didnt give dia ah , 
so itu was one of  , that was one of  masa where saya uh had saya rancangan so called derailed 
ya 
ya saya was struggling at itu masa uh alone at itu masa to meet up with uh lain kawan that was uh later bahagian of  perjalanan 
itu was ya itu was jenis of a penurun lah ya itu was 
an interesting pengalaman to  very mula of  perjalanan uh was like itu already 
but good perkara is later on ada padanya uh up and turun lah 
but , ya 
in saya minda at itu masa saya was just wondering uh apa going to happen next , and uh whether uh mereka will actually jenis of potong out one of saya buah pinggang in uh itu like one of yang horror cerita or not 
ya so itu was , 
and saya was wondering like what was ini guys uh what does ini lelaki have to do with ini hotel  panduan one of  lelaki living in  hotel or berfungsi in  hotel tells saya that , uh that lelaki has tiada apa-apa to do with ini hotel but uh at itu masa of kursus like i dont know what to believe 
so , saya also didnt take mereka perkataan 
for itu lah , so itu was one of  more interesting episod 
ya 
itu true , 
mmhmm mm 
wah seriously ah , 
oh 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 

mm 
mm kemurungan orh 
ya mm 
mm 
mm 
mm mm 
mm 
aplikasi ah ya appeal lor , mm 
yup , ya 
yup ya 
mm 
mm saya think might have closed 
tidak saya aplikasi is still open ya yup , 
mmhmm mm 
ya 
yup , 
are nicer to anda 
mm 
itu would have been damn scary manusia 
saya tidak akan have imagined ya saya wouldnt have imagined how id urus niaga with itu 
ya 
ya 
ya that was pretty harrowing actually 
uh bayangkan 
saya cant bayangkan like uh 
what anda had to , what anda had to 
what do anda have to tell anda keluarga and semua itu barang and anda had to go back like ini 
itu must have been kinda like 
wow terrible ya mm ya , 
saya think 
ya 
one of  masa i also felt like uh utterly helpless and then uh 
tidak satu to turn to was when saya lost itu jumlah of wang when uh 
when saya did that impulse perdagangan lah ya on  alibaba stok 
then i tekaan at itu masa itu was like uh saya keluarga  rehat of saya keluarga were holidaying in 
in , in 
australia then saya have to cut saya perjalanan short come back 
then itu was 
itu was totally feeling like a 
saya was 
a aib and saya was really like uh wasted semua  usaha that saya ibu bapa gave saya and itu was really 
one of  lowest titik of saya hidup lah like saya was , sitting in  tandas and then crying ah 
itu was a shitty momen , and 
ya itu was like 
uh 
mereka spent semua  wang on saya educating saya taking penjagaan of saya semua ini masa saya kakak was working 
and then mereka didnt have , one of saya kakak tidak have  manfaat of uh being educated 
in a universiti saya got  peluang , to do itu , and then eventually uh semua  usaha mereka put inside saya was jenis of like uh let down to  momen where saya realised saya really 
uh 
was pretty low , 
tidak that was around uh two thousand plus 
ya itu around two thousand plus and then 
ya 
ya uh when mereka i p oedCity in Minnesota, United States 
itu , itu , itu was at exactly at  masa when mereka i p oedCity in Minnesota, United States then  , stok spiked and then went down low saya just took a , took a very bad pertaruhan 
and borrowed wang not borrowed wang saya just bet , bet against kredit 
then to 
make  perdagangan 
then itu didnt end up , itu didnt end up well at semua 
so itu was a huge kerugian 
and saya also at itu tempoh of masa saya was very negative saya was like very nasty , and uh saya was very 
bad to sesiapa sahaja uh sesiapa sahaja who came in kenalan with saya like uh saya was very demanding very nasty like saya will just 
sebatan out at sesiapa sahaja so , 
hmm not sure whether anda were maybe 
cant ingat that 
tempoh of masa  few bulan after itu perdagangan perkara right went by as a kabur ah saya cant even remember how i 
managed to go through like uh 
but one of  perkara which jenis of lekat kembali was 
um beberapa lelaki telling saya that dia lost five masa more wang than saya ah 
then itu jenis of beri saya , beberapa perspective anyway i think masa up 
bahagian two positive pengalaman 
uh so i think uh 
im  , like one of  most of  masa when im  paling bahagia is when im with saya kawan because im a very social orang so i enjoy to uh gantung out with saya kawan and jenaka and ketawa together 
and i think most of  masa that i find saya sendiri laughing really hard is when im having like simple masa with saya kawan like in  kantin eating together having like makan tengah hari or makan malam and then semua sharing about mereka hidup pengalaman and 
and like jenaka normally and itu always ini jenis of masa where saya feel very happy sebab saya realise that saya have orang around saya that penjagaan about saya and are willing to kongsi mereka pengalaman with saya and ini and 
just ini simple olok-olok and tukar is really heartwarming and i always find saya sendiri laughing at mereka jenaka 
so uh 
ya so um , 
describe anda 
ya 
like semua yang masa during recess kanan like semua yang masa then kami kawan will like bincang about stupid perkara , and then kita will just like ketawa itu so funny 
uh cause kami kawan very , random ya very retarded very random then mereka will just like 
say stupid perkara that will like surprise kami and itu always very funny 
menyeronokkan masa 
so like ya 
so like uh what are anda best kenangan that anda have when anda were in sekolah , 
ya 
ya 
ya 
uh so err 
there are many like kenangan that im very fond and bangga of but then one of um  outstanding yang is when saya was in j c saya was  naib presiden of saya c a and so i had to plan a lot of konsert and uh 
like kem for saya c a one of  momen that saya felt very like bangga and like touched is that when saya planned ini kem for saya um band and itu took kami around three minggu to plan itu wasnt easy because 
ya kita had to like rancang out ya  penyelarasan to like get semua  logistic done and then make sure that semua is on  same halaman and barang and make sure that  freshies feel welcome 
so itu was really masa penyaliran and then especially since itu was at  same masa as kami c t which is kami semester uji 
and yang are tidak jenaka because kita were ya itu was j two 
ya so itu was like jenis of bad sebab saya had ini saya basically never studied at semua for saya uji and then i spend like saya poured saya jantung into ini kem with semua  persediaan and barang and then um during  kem itu wasnt like 
itu was smooth flowing but theres obviously beberapa cock up and perkara dont happen and stuff but at  penghujung of  kem saya still can remember that  momen that kami whole cerita baris finish itu was a pembunuhan kes and barang and then when semua started ya like itu was  tema ah 
tidak  kem 
ya  berarak percutian camp that kita like planned for like three minggu ya then uh itu was very like menghangatkan hati and saya felt really proud when mereka semua started clapping at  penghujung of  kem when kita exposed who is  pembunuh and semuanya 
ya mereka semua just started clapping for kami and then i felt really touched and like overwhelmed sebab saya felt like saya three minggu of kesusahan and tekad and Ketekunan uh paid off after like , by seeing mereka 
like rasa grateful about what kita have done ah and then i realise that 
saya would like to do more perkara like ini 
to enjoy other orang to let other orang have fun and make kenangan with one lain 
ya and saya felt very proud of itu tidak itu was in berarak 
ya 
tidak  c t uh so like  c t one , how about anda do anda have mana-mana such kenangan 
uh 
mm 
wow 
wow what  
did anda expect itu 
did anda expect itu like yang gred 
oh meridian ah 
oh 
wah 
oh 
wah 
wah 
oh itu really nice 
uh talking about akademik ralat , actually saya akademik saya um kajian perjalanan also havent tidak that smooth also like uh throughout saya whole secondary sekolah 
like orang always doubted saya keputusan because i really dont like to study and i sleep a lot in kelas so i dont really pay perhatian and then i always have to catch up semuanya by saya sendiri because i dont bayar , perhatian in kelas and so saya keputusan were quite bad 
like um saya had guru like telling saya mak that saya should give up before like saya chinese guru asked saya to give up higher cina because dia said that if i take itu i will just get f nine and itu like a losing pertempuran and dia talk saya mak to ask saya to drop higher chinese three masa 
ya but then uh ya terima kasih tuhan saya didnt wah itu saved saya hidup ya but then end up uh even though dia keep like saying barang about saya and stuff 
end up saya proved dia wrong lah and then also like saya got other guru such as saya h o d of sains like called saya and saya mak and talked about how saya keputusan uh are in bahaya keadaan 
and that uh saya may have a peluang to actually get into j c if i improved dia said may and then like saya mak was just like 
sial worried and barang and then like setiap hari  guru keep saying anda know mereka keep saying like ini jenis of perkara to saya like setiap hari then like itu itu was like really uh disappointing , but end up when saya keputusan came out and itu was okay 
like uh better than what mereka expected 
ya then i at itu bahagian that masa saya actually felt like a little like overwhelmed and like quite touched sebab uh , i managed to prove mereka wrong lah like  perasaan of like going against what other orang say 
itu really um 
touching and itu gives anda goosebumps because anda realise itu youre capable of proving orang wrong and doing what anda set out to do in  first tempat so i think that itu very important to believe in diri anda and be positive 
how about anda 
ah saya think itu very important to have like a positive pandangan in hidup and like keeping semua  good close kawan next to anda cause i think that anda social bulatan really affects how anda turn out in hidup 
like itu like itu always yang orang around anda that motivates anda and encourages anda that give anda  keberanian and  ghairah to move forward like without ini jenis of encouraging orang like anda all that i met in j c like saya can not imagine surviving j c without 
a kumpulan of kawan to go through together semua ini barang with saya ah so i think that itu very important to have like good kawan by anda sisi so that mereka can give anda can get like rub off mereka positive getaran 
and become like a better orang ah 
ya so i think that kita are quite lucky to have like such good kawan , 
uh so like okay putting kajian semua yang aside so how would anda describe like a perfect happy hari in anda hidup now since itu covid and like kita have so much masa to ourselves 
itu nice 
mm 
saya realise that now especially in masa of covid itu very important to appreciate semua  little perkara in hidup like when anda wake up and  matahari is shining ada padanya a gentle angin itu feels really peaceful and menenangkan and  overall getaran 
ya itu just very like happy and then now that anda go out and then anda can see anda ibu bapa like sitting at  dining jadual and barang because like bila-bila masa anda are in sekolah anda can not see mereka and whenever mereka are working anda can not see mereka also so itu like very reassuring that anda can get mereka kehadiran anytime anda want 
especially since saya abang is back already and then uh setiap masa hes in sekolah like overseas saya can not see dia but then now like hes always there 
uh not really ya now dia is too there j k like hes always there and then like saya know that when saya want seseorang to like bincang with or like go out for a pemacu with mereka tipu always there and itu like ini little momen where saya can like control  perkara around saya 
and see saya keluarga semua  masa that i feel like itu very heartwarming and very um happy to be able to experience such pemasaan now lah though in  tengah of covid but itu like  perak lapisan 
in  gelap clouds so i think like ya ini jenis of perkara really make saya hari ini jenis of barang 
ya itu true 
ya 
so anda are  joker 
ya itu very nice to have seseorang to like keep hyping anda up especially when anda feel down ya then  positive getaran just like come Ke arah anda and anda start to gain tenaga again so i think like itu cukup 
like um , good to have like high ketegangan 
most not semua of  masa ah but like most of  masa i think that uh 
by having high ketegangan and like a positive pandangan right itu can really change anda hari to hari lifestyle even in like setiap little perkara like just going out to get air and feeling kebahagiaan from quenching anda kehausan ini jenis of little perkara , really can change anda hidup 
ya recently i ya 
i feel like permainan play a huge bahagian in kebahagiaan ini hari especially when anda have capaian to so much wifi 
ya 
saya think so too 
negative pengalaman 
hmm

dia wants to create a nice berfungsi persekitaran for  orang around dia 
ya next masa saya tell anda  full cerita lah but like 
oh can call 
but i jangan know i honestly right apa sahaja anda are good with right 
as long as anda are good in sesuatu anda will be able to do well anda know 
what  neraka 
jangan siao eh 
why what anda do 
negative pengalaman 
um saya think i ingat was saya uh saya auntie dia had barah but itu was like maybe twenty tahun ago lah dia had barah and then dia had to go through kemoterapi 
and uh then after itu dia personaliti ubah dia began like to talk nonsense dia uh not aware of apa happening and dia can like see penglihatan see perkara itu happening which kita can not see 
so is very sad sebab were quite close to dia so shes a shesCity in Illinois, United States quite a shesCity in Illinois, United States a , a civil Hamba shesCity in Illinois, United States quite intelligent and um , anda know semua of a sudden dia had barah so  keseluruhan like one or 
two tahun perkara change very fast so itu is very sad to see 
anda know uh , dia perubahan lah ya what about anda do anda have mana-mana pengalaman 
okay for saya um when saya like saya bapa actually was um uh itu was a lejang pesakit 
but dia is still able to uh do a lot of perkara but then suddenly dia like ralat had to be admitted to hospital and uh ada padanya , many perkara i want to do for dia but theres tiada apa-apa saya could do for dia 
sebab uh saya thought saya can take penjagaan of dia i thought i can give dia physio but itu not easy to do so when saya tried to do perkara for dia i cant so i feel quite bad lah that uh itu , although i really love dia i really want to do sesuatu for dia but yet 
whatever saya did is not enough lah not good enough 
what about anda 
mm okay 
okay setiap masa like if ada padanya a masa where uh i quarrel with uh either saya suami or i pertengkaran with saya uh keluarga ahli or bersaudara and saudari or sometimes with kawan know sometimes were upset anda know so anda know that jenis of 
tempoh will be a masa where saya think that haiya tiada siapa cares about saya ah im alone anda know uh im so sad tiada siapa understand saya anda know uh yang , yang are  masa ah i mean there are masa where anda 
perkara like wah not doing anda cara aiya why ini tiada siapa cares about saya im  only orang anda know uh doing semua ini perkara for mereka and yet mereka dont penjagaan anda know and makes saya feel very sad lah 
so what do anda often worry about 
okay for saya because um sometimes as kita umur ah i see orang friends semua ini mereka 
ralat mereka have sickness mereka have uh barah mereka have a different jenis of uh anda know sickness or pass away so uh sometimes i will worry that uh would i be healthy uh what will happen to saya if i grow older anda know or for saya suami okay uh 
are kita going to be healthy so what if kita uh one of kami is down one of kami have uh beberapa penyakit anda know apa going to happen anda know err ini jenis of perkara lah although itu tidak good to worry but 
i think as kita umur theres ini jenis of perkara start to worry 
but of kursus when im younger saya will worry itu about pekerjaan about uh kewangan tahu but now kita are older well worry about kami kesihatan so setiap masa i mean , i try not to worry i tell saya sendiri see kita anda know kita have been through so many perkara so many hard masa where anda know err 
financially were not well but yet now were okay anda know err kerja bijak that masa kita have to struggle but now anda know itu itu not a not a masalah at semua so now kita start to worry about kesihatan so itu never happen but then yet kita want to worry so i keep telling saya sendiri anda know ya dont think so much ah jangan worry so much ah 
orh 
ya so at different pentas of hidup at different umur saya think kita worry about different perkara ah but worry is sesuatu like ralat anda know itu negative and itu not good for kami kesihatan 
kita always tell kami uh kita always um saya and saya suami always say 
bimbang sendiri is negative is uh releasing racun into kami badan so why do kita want to worry , especially when were worrying about kami own kesihatan so bimbang will not make kami kesihatan better will only uh worsen anda know so try not to worry lah cuba not to think so much lah anda know if itu , uh just try to keep diri kita sendiri healthy 
ya i mean itu not going to happen but yet kita worry that itu going to happen , 
saddest momen ah , 
kay maybe because err saya suami is quite a ralat 
risiko pengambil so dia likes to take risiko especially in perniagaan itu why kita can open kafe kita can do certain perniagaan semua ini so sometimes  perkara ralat i mean in youngest hari in during  dia youngest hari uh so dia 
dia started beberapa perniagaan and then kita get kami into financial kesukaran so there are masa where uh im very sad because uh maybe anda know  for  silap kita made maybe err like saya caused saya uh ibu bapa to worry about saya uh sebab orang to come uh anda know 
need mereka bantuan ah need orang to help kami because financially anda know when kami perniagaan gagal orang 
err kawan lah kawan and saudara got to help kami so im very sad anda know so yang are  masa where saya feel that uh if i dont make semua ini silap saya wont have to anda know make orang help saya and get orang into like 
beberapa masalah also lah sometimes lah so yang are  saddest momen of saya hidup lah 
what about anda is there apa sahaja that 
mm 
ya there was a i think saya mum outside , answering a telefon panggilan but saya think dia should be finishing soon 

okay dia already put down  telefon already 
okay uh do anda want saya to go out and uh okay just hold on ah ya okay ya 
okay so is itu okay now ya 
ralat again also i think ada padanya uh not really sesuatu but maybe as saya said  saddest momen is linked to  saddest momen so itu like uh if 
kita could change like kita wont kita dont get into semua yang uh failure yang perniagaan uh not dont take semua yang risiko maybe kita dont have to cause so many orang to be so uh sedih or anda know perkara like itu lah 
err yes maybe saya bapa when saya bapa lepasan away so is considered a kerugian so that masa saya was uh sad ralat 
i mean semua orang is sad but at  same masa kita i also felt that , i kita i talked to saya kakak kita talk anda know were semua very sad kita semua are crying but kita talked 
kita say that itu better to let dia go because dia never suffer sebab dia dia dia suddenly had a jangkitan a urine jangkitan and then was admitted and  that malam dia had a lejang and then dia never wake up so err itu only lasted like for two three hari 
and ralat after that dia never wake up and then dia just passed away so kita were sad but then at  same masa kita semua kita tell kami anda know dia didnt dia didnt menderita like beberapa other orang where mereka can be in  hospital for tahun mereka cant anda know or mereka have dementia or mereka cant even have a kualiti of hidup but yet theyre still alive 
so i uh kita kita talk about itu kita discuss and kita say that uh 
uh is actually uh not a menderita for dia so kita are very happy that dia didnt menderita in ini hidup 
when hes alive were able to treat dia well kita take cared of dia kita brought dia for cuti anda know and now that uh just a very short tempoh of uh perjuangan uh penyakit and dia had to leave kami were sad but kita think that um itu good for dia so after talking kita kita can kita are able to overcome itu very fast 
so kita semua felt that saya bapa had a good hidup 
and uh leaving kami is uh dia , is uh leaving ini uh dunia of penyakit lah 
ya tidak just now lah ya 
okay ya okay so what make anda stressed ah , okay , 
mmhmm for saya ya ya okay 
sebab im wearing kepingan telinga 
okay saya ask mereka to go and ya , maybe saya mak is okay saya just 
kay how about now ya 
so ya so what uh what makes anda stress anda were saying that anda 
for saya i told anda that uh saya had a kafe 
so , setiap masa  when pelanggan comes in especially is a kumpulan of orang 
so when anda know i prepare makanan and saya see saya pelanggan waiting so i , feel very stressful because i dont want orang to wait for too long and ralat , and saya also feel that wow if i am so stress will be able to produce good makanan 
anda know then when im tekanan saya can make mistake 
so when i dont like  perasaan of orang waiting for saya anda know itu very stressful and uh especially orang looking at saya making  kopi or preparing  makanan , 
so that tekanan saya also lah ya but of kursus uh i mean in kerja sometimes uh like there are tarikh akhir semua ini so i also feel stressful with semua ini perkara lah ya 
mm so far not really personally not really lah 
ya 
um saya as saya said im not a risiko pengambil 
so i think that um uh saya biggest  biggest takut is uh if i try to achieve , matlamat let say material matlamat financial matlamat semua ini saya have to take risiko so if i take risiko saya may lose out certain perkara so i better be contented and uh not to like 
anda know be so err uh like wanting to achieve , so many perkara in hidup ya 
ya so describe a masa anda felt trapped or helpless sorry ah saya think saya mak is talking ah tahan on ah ya just hold on ah ya 
ya sorry saya neighbour datang and visit saya mak 
okay 
okay can anda hear now ya 
okay so sorry ralat anda say sesuatu about 
ya for saya is uh once saya suami was uh doing beberapa perniagaan and then um financially dia got dirinya into beberapa masalah so i feel very helpless saya cant bantuan dia 
so yang are  masa where as saya said dia because dia take a lot of risiko in uh perniagaan doing perniagaan so sometimes i want to help dia but there are masa where saya tidak boleh because uh itu not within financially not within saya keupayaan or uh  perkara that hes doing saya cant bantuan dia so i felt very helpless lah 
uh sometimes i feel orang ill treating other orang let say like domestic pembantu or uh pekerja anda know so sometimes i feel orang are not respecting ini jenis of err orang so i feel quite disgusted lah 
so describe an peristiwa that make anda very , very angry 
ya so for saya i think uh because saya travel so sometimes in overseas ah saya see uh especially in chinaCity in Virginia, United States ah beberapa orang like uh throwing spitting throwing rubbish cutting baris gilir uh semua ini perkara makes saya quite angry lah so sometimes i will like tell mereka off 
anda know if mereka cut saya baris gilir or mereka just uh ludah uh or mereka just throw , uh tisu Kertaspaper size or mereka just anda know tidak adab semua ini ah so itll make saya angry ya 
orh saya kerja ah err actually ini is a three bulan contact 
um which allows like um cashless pembayaran and anda can just do semuanya on  telefon lah itu like a diri checkout jenis of perkara so anda scan  kod bar using anda telefon kamera and then anda also pay in  aplikasi lor so orang can also just skip  baris gilir lah ya so after talking about ini aplikasi are anda interested wai chen 
at first anda have to download  harga adil aplikasi then not semua have to fairprice aplikasi mah even though mereka always go fairprice right 
link anda plus kad or link anda pembayaran kaedah ya so i agree lah a lot orang rather queue 
and use  traditional kaedah 
so wai chen 
since anda dont have a kerja now right 
are anda interested in saya current kerja 
ya sebab like perlu pengalaman right then itu like previously anda were like learning reka bentuk that is so different from  h r right but then okay lah good lah that anda are trying sesuatu new okay so anyways anda know saya kerja right im very busy lah like so many shift right like one minggu saya work six hari leh itu  highest komitmen kerja that ive ever like done 
then are anda seseorang that is very auspicious 
okay so itu like im quite auspicious lah then 
so um ada padanya five of kami um saya ibu bapa saya and saya two adik beradik lah i got one abang and one kakak 
so um saya and saya kakak kita kedua-duanya kongsi a bilik 
saya just go into saya ibu bapa bilik and then i just stupid like itu was malam masa then i took out saya telefon then i 
 bilik was very dark ya so i took out saya telefon right then there was ini like cermin at saya ibu bapa wall 
saya just took out saya telefon and then i on  denyar cahaya well i take  selfie then anda know what saya see behind  cacing 
saya saw a freaking badut 
sesuatu berlaku also so okay saya abang right dia likes to wear cincin 
like  gelang jari leh ya 
i jangan know how also lah like  gelang just like magically like 
ubah jari leh how is that possible kanan 
itu really so hard to take out so anda know i might im like quite auspicious lah like sesuatu like might be really in ini bilik anda know or in ini dunia 
ya so thats saya cerita lah okay so how about anda do like believe in mana-mana like hantu cerita or what or have anda encounter apa sahaja 
um like since okay since anda dont believe in mana-mana like hantu kanan in  dunia lah then 
burn mana-mana like kemenyan or like give solat during  seventh bulan 
okay ya then adding on kanan anda know actually okay lah saya just started saya kerja not long ago lah but then i made a very good kawan over there 
shesCity in Illinois, United States indian and then kita also like kongsi about kami personal pengalaman lah regarding ini um seventh bulan cerita but i think that dia pengalaman kanan that dia told saya didnt happen during seven bulan itu just happen like normally lah then 
on  bapa ya saya think cause  bapa friend is very greedy and 
 bapa wanted  bapa friend wanted mereka wang even though after  bapa has died lah 
then after dia cast  black magik kanan 
dia casted on  on saya kawan best kawan abang 
ya so saya kawan also jenis of percaya that 
ada padanya ini supernatural perkara happening around  dunia lah yup 
ya so 
anda just feel that oh 
anda just pretend not to see mereka lor ya cause itu like a normal perkara for anda already what then i think saya would also try to use itu to saya kelebihan lah ya or saya also use itu to try to scare saya kawan ya do anda remember one of kami kawan nama shen yi , dia have  third mata 
for saya ah i think i am sia sebab tanduk wah when jumpa seseorang right 
say semua  perkara to mereka like saya will just im seseorang who just speak without thinking lah saya think ya 
sebab saya feel like oh if anda tell saya anda perkara saya also tell saya perkara lah ada padanya tiada apa-apa to hide lah ya but if itu sesuatu very personal saya think saya might think twice before telling anda 
so ya saya think im seseorang that 
okay moving on let not talk about kami kawan anymore let talk about diri kita sendiri 
so how has ini covid pandemic affect anda hidup wai chen 
ya so itu was actually 
actually right itu not as bad as i thought lah sebab saya can enjoy saya favorite makanan at  keselesaan of saya rumah ya 
saya dont really need a grand perayaan lah like what orang always have lah like anda know orang when mereka reached dua puluh one tahun old kanan mereka would like to have yang like chalet or i jangan know hotel perayaan lah like , invite a lot of kawan over and then 
latar belakang macaroons or like whatever then anda had to post i g lah ya 
how about anda wai chen are anda like sad that anda can not celebrate when youre twenty one tahun old like properly 
ya then did anda like receive mana-mana like makanan penghantaran sebab kanan on instagram cerita kanan anda see  orang like oh mereka like to tertib kejutan penghantaran for mereka kawan ya so do anda receive mana-mana 
perkara i see online regardless of like instagram cerita youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States or like twitter lah ya so right once i see sesuatu is good kanan 
saya think that itu a very lebuh raya 
itu a very small cawan in  gambar itu looks very small but then when itu came 
itu actually okay 
quite normal lah purata to 
or like more than what saya expected lah 
but then when saya open  cawan kanan 
saya just want to like faster makan sesuatu lah when im lapar but then 
i went on e z beli to buy like one karton 
then i waited like 
two minggu to come lor which was quite fast also lah considering now that 
so apa sahaja special anda have tried during  covid like anda know  dalgona or like 
have anda like tried cooking more often 
then during covid right 
so okay so um after eating so much right 
im pasti that anda feel guilty 
err recently theres ini very popular mm 
influencer jenis of um 
kecergasan pelatih called chloe ting have anda tried mana-mana of dia senaman video 
then for saya orh okay lah 
um gim rakan 
gabung more senaman into saya daily routine lah sebab tanduk okay when i scroll youtube right 
cuba to everyday do dia senaman also one ya then dia also got ini two minggu senaman rancang where anda will like kereta api i think anda whole badan lah ya but then for itu one right itu a bit difficult 
just do more senaman lelaki 
anda take thirty seven minit right but then actually i feel like itu more than thirty seven minit right sebab 
when anda texted saya itu was like one jam ago and i believe that 
from anda rumah to  m r t stesen anda wont take like 
empat puluh or fifty minit coming here 
haiwan ah 
itu a very scary perkara lor sebab 
even though itu mungkin like i think itu ten peratus  rakan penilaian anda really affect anda overall like hasil leh 
so ya okay lah saya can understand when anda say anda didnt go to lany concert lor so i hope that next masa anda will be able to go to dia konsert lah ya then for saya right okay saya was going to go to taeyeon konsert 
which was i think around 
um saya have like a good konsert tuah sebab setiap masa when saya try to buy concert tiket right 
ya but okay lah saya think itu quite worth itu lah sebab even though i travel quite far but for  one for one saya really managed to save a lot of wang lah 
ya then saya favorite tempat to go to i fikir 
itu should be  dosirakCity in Illinois, United States 
itu like  bibimbap tempat right ya then kita went one masa then kita really wanted to go again 
saya hope that kita managed to jio kami other kawan to go also ya cause itu really good like saya didnt expect  makanan there to be so nice and then itu makes saya feel so healthy also lah itu like anda can customize what anda want and then also get mereka sup and like minuman and then mereka also played k pop muzik lah so ya saya really hope that 
itu wont be just kedua-duanya of kami in  masa hadapan ya 
one is working full masa kerja  other okay kedua-duanya working full masa kerja lah then  other one is sleeping around 
sleeping around 
what are anda fikiran on um kami kawan having a lot of kawan with manfaat ya 
severe right ya 
ya but okay lor saya guess semua have mereka own cara to like mengatasi 
but i dont recommend ini cara lor sebab itu really quite unhealthy lah and then anda might like 
have like kesihatan penyakit anda know 
ya and then im so sad okay not really sad lah saya cant believe that kami klik im  only satu who single 
single and ready to mingle anda know 
is itu really good to have a teman lelaki 
orang around saya are like asking saya why am i single lah saya also dont know why itu concerns mereka so 
seeing seseorang that i know on itu lah 
then saya also believe that 
if saya also believe that 
wah okay not bad 
but anda semua never really talk kanan 
orh okay 
is itu like recommended kawan or sesuatu itu why dia know 
on there right 
 perasaan is very nice to touch ya 
then anda also accompany dia to shave dia kepala kanan 
so not to worry dia will still be as handsome as anda want dia to be 
yes okay so 
 single hidup or  hubungan hidup 
mana-mana like masa hadapan rancangan with dia right anda dont see  masa hadapan with dia right 
then if anda have one perkara that anda want to change about dia right what will be that one perkara 
mm so anda got to accept dia 
for who dia is right but then also quite tiring mah sebab setiap masa anda have to like 
but then before um 
before anda semua like 
dia wasnt like ini kanan in primary sekolah 
sebab like not close lah tanduk 
then but then during primary sekolah do anda like notis dia 
like was dia like  
mm okay then 
ya shesCity in Illinois, United States not  jenis to like just tarikh sesiapa sahaja kanan 
okay which is itu is itu very different from anda right 
kita should be in  hubungan kita should be equal kanan so ya 
saya know of orang who are desperately like finding for seseorang like really can not stay single one leh mereka must go and find seseorang even though mereka dont really like  orang 
ini hari ini , 
yup do anda have mana-mana like um 
ya as mostly like saya realize jurong east right mereka love to gather at jurong timur so setiap masa tanduk 
really have to like keep a cari on off mereka leh when youre at jurong timur 
negative pengalaman okay i think anda should start ini anda should start 
oh saya kebaikan okay 
i think itu very sensitive kandungan , 
i dont i think a lot of perkara that makes kami angry kanan and semua  ketidakadilan 
is that kita face is , really has to do with diskriminasi and itu has to do with semua jenis of diskriminasi like sexual diskriminasi 
um perkauman , uh ini is what semua very big important perkara that were facing in both  dunia and in a local konteks , um 
i think perkauman is in singapura 
not as bad as other negara , but 
 cara that kita facing is through micro pencerobohan kanan , and micro pencerobohan is when , mereka tell anda that mereka say sesuatu and then mereka dont think that itu 
offensive because itu kelakar 
and because itu kelakar itu shouldnt be a big urus niaga , but a lot of masa itu always minoriti that have to deal with ini , whereas when kita do itu to mereka itu not funny , so i think itu 
one of  masalah but two is also  fakta that 
where kita live , uh kita are considered minoriti right so certain 
perkara , kita may not 
 upper tangan , and i think that  malay komuniti in , 
singapura , uh is one of like  biggest uh komuniti which are lower pendapatan anda know 
and i think itu problematic and i think because anda are malays anda cans understand why a lot of masa malays are very content with what mereka have , but also because kita have saudara 
itu are like that kita also know that mereka are suffering in terma of financial bermaksud , 
and a lot of masa mereka dont know itu maklumat is available kanan , and a lot of ini , 
maklumat mereka dont understand so mereka dont know that mereka are actually , 
eligible for financial bantuan or subsidi or biasiswa or bursari , mereka dont look out for ini peluang 
and saya think one maybe were not doing enough to target mereka demographic , or two ada padanya just sesuatu wrong that were not that were doing itu and kita should address that and i think , itu 
one of  ketidakadilan that kita are facing in  minoriti because kita can say itu because were bahagian of itu , what about anda 
tidak anda know whats  strange perkara because saya saw one iklan and i honestly dont know if ini is legal , itu says that , um chinese preferred to speak with chinese warganegara 
like saya honest 
itu was a iklan saya saw on uh indeed and i was like 
firstly 
why do kita have to speak chinese to uh chinese warganegara and i pemikiran kita only , like uh hiring orang bujang until anda have  kuota to uh to get foreign pekerja right and foreign pekerja are only supposed to be a supplement not anda main paksa 
so i uh i thought itu was weird and saya also a 
setuju with anda that ive been seeing a lot of um , chinese preferred not chinese preferred uh chinese pembesar suara preferred , but and saya also see japanese pembesar suara preferred , but japanese saya get itu because uh  
syarikat is a japanese syarikat and mereka deal with japanese klien so itu really is based on  , on  syarikat needs right , but i dont think semua syarikat need chinese pembesar suara 
and onto itu 
ive actually did a magang with uh kami ayah former syarikat , and when i went to  syarikat saya was very surprised because saya came from a 
mendominasi english bercakap sekolah , and i thought kerja for like  tenaga kerja would be sesuatu that would echo  same perkara , but when i went to dia syarikat mereka dont speak english eh 
ya mereka spoke predominately uh chinese malay 
so i found that very interesting sebab saya told saya sendiri like wow saya probably can not work in ini industri or saya apparently can not work in ini tenaga kerja because , how am i going to communicate and to saya itu was also like a very unprofessional 
uh adegan 
and then when kami ayah told kami was like oh because uh most of saya rakan sekerja are not singaporean 
so mereka dont generally speak english as a first bahasa so kita have to , seek other lorong to communicate with mereka why do anda think um , thats  kes and why are syarikat tolerating that 
tidak but like 
really , tidak but like eh saya dont see other singaporean chinese anda know thats  menarik , 
probably lah like ralat , because like kami ayah is singaporean right so dia was mereka bos so i ask dia like why 
ya 
and honestly i dont know if a lot of  perkara that ini syarikat are doing are actually legal anda know because when i ask mereka like uh 
especially saya rakan sekerja like , is ini legal and mereka said tidak itu not legal but like kita can not do apa sahaja because if anda complain were gon na lose kami pekerjaan 
anda know so when saya think about ini im also like whoaCity in Illinois, United States if ini foreign pekerja are easy to exploit in singapura what does itu mean itu sakit be safe in lain negara when saya kerja for anda know like ini is 
i eh i understand i think is just a different budaya kanan like i think , kita are at a titik where like saya dont want to get exploited i tekaan in kami penjanaan , 
kita dont want to be exploited kita want fair upah kita want uh kesamarataan and i think itu one of  ketidakadilan which actually is ketidaksamaan 
local konteks perkauman lah , tidak saya think  one perkara that kita need to address is i dont muka perkauman because of  warna of saya kulit kanan , but if saya kawan were lebih gelap saya mean saya kawan are lebih gelap , mereka would face perkauman , because a lot of orang mistake saya for chinese 
itu true and mereka , always assume that im cina and then sometimes right when mereka speak chinese to saya , i will just like balas like mm and see how far itu can go 
and itu goes quite far , itu goes quite far , anda know , 
ya saya think tidak because  perkara is orang dont assume im malay kanan and with 
ya but not only just in singapura anda know even in germany like saya cause most of saya kawan are , ya most of saya kawan are minoriti mereka are syrian korean and indonesian and mereka 
almost setiap masa kita go out mereka will get racial penghinaan but i never faced 
mana-mana of itu and , mereka would always because err saya teman lelaki dia speaks german kanan , mereka would never like muka dia and speak german mereka would speak german to saya 
ya , but i dont speak german and then mereka will speak french after and then theyll go to english then mereka like okay so ini orang maybe from  u k or , 
saya think that like 
because of itu im also very thankful why saya jangan muka itu lah but at  same masa saya also feel like saya jangan , im not a orang where saya can talk about , ketidakadilan or perkauman because saya personally dont muka itu on itu jenis , but when itu comes to resume right where anda can not where itu buta 
once mereka see anda nama theres  jenis of perkauman saya muka 
ya 
tidak but itu could be like but itu could be a good and a bad 
perkara right because one anda industri tidak have a lot of malays , so itu could be like a good perkara , where mereka need a lot of uh orang of anda etnik , to talk to malaysian or indonesian klien or , kerja in like islamic perbankan for contoh anda know ini could be sesuatu itu also good if itu kami i mean itu a double edged pedang lah 
mm 
mm 
ya i min and ini is very shocking kanan that itu happening in singapura 
mm and saya think ini is especially , tidak but thats  perkara right a lot of ini perkara that happen in singapura as like diskriminasi and ketidaksamaan itu very hidden , itu not sesuatu that anda can see like when anda go out anda cant see itu , because kita live in sedemikian a berbilang , 
racial uh masyarakat right where a lot of ini masalah are much complex than 
like  u s for contoh , where anda actually see polis killing 
uh black orang anda know , but anda dont see that in singapura because  um  jenis of perkauman is kita see itu actually a little bit more complex 
tidak i think itu because like for kami right kita feel like oh because kita are already facing itu itu 
very normal kita just move on and let go to  next satu itu mean if ini syarikat can reject saya based on  warna of saya kulit itu probably not a good syarikat to work with lah kanan , anda also see itu as a red bendera 
bukti but how did anda get  bukti anda know 
mm , anda know saya syarikat kita actually , uh ini is what i didengar from saya , 
uh and dia said that like other pengurus from other cabang mereka dont want to hire , uh malay orang because whenever mereka hire malay orang mereka always dont last a minggu or mereka dont last two minggu and semuanya , and then i told dia 
itu um because dia hired saya im a malay kanan and actually saya cabang fondly 
sewa malay orang , 
and saya told dia itu is actually malay itu not that malay orang dont last , 
uh saya dont think itu a risiko perkara saya told dia that a lot of masa in other cabang itu actually really abuse of kuasa and buli 
that mereka dont want to stay , anda know because itu seperti , if 
why should i tolerate semua of ini perkara saya said itu has tiada apa-apa to do with perlumbaan semuanya is about  berfungsi persekitaran , and if  berfungsi persekitaran is bad i jangan see why sesiapa sahaja would stay , and saya told dia because anda are a good pengurus anda orang are staying , if theyre leaving itu not because 
anda are an inadequate pengurus is because  bayar is just not good and orang have keluarga , and then dia said ya dia understands and  h r jabatan even had to step in , and told  pengurus that anda 
anda can not , um , tolak , 
based on perlumbaan anymore , because were not getting enough orang anda know and itu should be more open minded but  fakta that a lot of ini 
tidak ini is not uh so  h r jabatan interviews mereka and then mereka send  pemohon to , err to  cabang pengurus for temu ramah so  ,  cabang pengurus already met mereka in orang 
mm , tidak but like at  same masa kanan saya dont think itu just about like calling up for temu ramah itu also problematic saya also feel like , itu  um 
at  temu ramah pentas anda know what if mereka dont like what mereka see not based on how anda temu ramah went anda know , mereka could also 
be lain sebab of like oh because anda are of a certain 
same warna , and saya know anda orang and im saying anda orang , uh are not orang 
who can last im not going to hire anda based on itu but anda know , a lot of  masa because kita are human kita can not separate  two but i think kita should learn to separate  two like anda etnik and anda , and who anda are as a orang , and i think like a lot of syarikat like tambang for , 
jangan do a good kerja at itu anda know 
okay , so  perkara is like ive been in debat komuniti baiklah and  debat komuniti saya think itu pretty liberal and 
there are like ekuiti pelanggaran means if anda make like a jenaka like itu , anda could get banned from  litar 
easily so i think i live in a very eh when saya was in a debat komuniti itu was a very safe komuniti 
in itu akal that kita could not like what anda can say could get anda 
into masalah anda know , but like at  same 
masa even though  ekuiti pelanggaran have protected kami from like racial uh casual perkauman and then ini perkauman because um debat on  , 
international aras , uh has a lot of perkauman uh especially among white hakim where 
mereka dont give good skor to asian orang or orang who dont , 
anda know or  skin warna , or because kita are from a certain institusi like anda institutional modal and anda cultural modal like really matters a lot , in a debat litar and i think itu why  asian litar with mendaki along ini ekuiti pelanggaran to protect semua and itu just echoing from what weve mendaki 
internationally , but i think in saya debat komuniti what kita surely do um badly is uh , 
seksisme , and sexual penyalahgunaan saya think itu really trials in  komuniti where a lot of orang especially if youve been in  komuniti for a really long masa anda could take easily kelebihan of a newbieCity in Illinois, United States , and i jangan think ada padanya enough perlindungan , uh in a debat komuniti 
before itu saya think were doing a better kerja than kita did five tahun , but i think a lot of masa um uh at least five tahun , 
where mereka didnt want to involve  pihak berkuasa but i think now , that with involving  pihak berkuasa is a good perkara but saya also think that itu also  mangsa who 
who have had , like penyalahguna that happened to mereka in  masa lalu mereka dont have mana-mana , 
kesan right , like semua ini 
pelaku at d hari and mereka tipu still living like a good hidup like anda can see itu right now , and i think itu also echoes about how university tawaran with a lot of ini isu i know youre in universiti how does anda universiti urus niaga with isu like ini 
tidak saya think because of sekolah is pretty young anda know right and i think 
because theres tidak autoriti ya theres tidak disciplinary ya saya 
telan because alkohol was involved anda know , and when anda mix alcohol with like kanak-kanak itu not gon na end well ya okay 
okay so three two one im gon na clap three two one 
okay so how darwin 
ya , 
right ini is actually like a very good peluang sia like uh kerja from rumah , right oh saya god terima kasih to saya lah eh , saya found ini kerja for anda 
oh sebab jem sebab , why quit  kereta 
oh serious ah how come saya didnt know that 
oh ya ya i forgot now what pentas are anda in 
saya got motor practical ah saya failed  first satu 
then i failed like three masa 
ya then after itu saya 
oh like saya cant even do apa sahaja about itu sebab i fail lah so i have to retake so i have to 
pay  pelajaran again itu why 
saya have to pay one thousand two hundred dolar in total itu what noriman said lah 
anda didnt know kita have already been talking for five minit 
maybe right anda should slow down a bit anda know 
like , ya anda are talking too fast , 
ya exactly like just now 
anda know err about  
know  if anda didnt know what to say right ada padanya actually ini like senarai that mereka give anda like mereka will tell anda like , what to say like what to ask  other orang 
anda actually looking now okay , since like uh weve been doing ini like a podcast gaya come ah ask saya beberapa soalan 
okay sakit tunggu 
ya see lah see ah , i think one of  first soalan is err if anda had three keinginan what would itu be 
do anda think mereka actually understand kami like when kita talk in malay are mereka like beberapa , beberapa malay 
like , seseorang who is a malay like actually or seseorang who can speak malay like , review semua ini and understand what kita talking about 
ya for one jam 
hopefully uh i mean im actually thankful that ada padanya such an peluang 
warga asing so mereka what oh mereka  barisan hadapan 
oh 
uh ya kan mereka see honesty sia 
saya pemasaan now nine forty ya ah okay lah save that 
saya still dont understand how mereka gon na do itu like  clap perkara im still quite confused actually lah 
mm so like just in kes anda know 
anda know find kerja and three minggu im positive for three minggu then anda have anda f y p 
for anda page eh was , 
dia saya dad jangan want dia to go gudang sebab dia hasnt tidak want dia to go there lah i ask dia like just take retail lah instead 
saya kakak 
ah itu like , dia just shesCity in Illinois, United States after o aras ya after o aras already 
ya saya said 
lumpuh ah 
about 
pekan red , what pekan 
itu is much more err not itu much more harder like much more berfikir to do because itu a lot more peranan like among kami is 
ralat anda just come 
Datuk Bandar lah then like , also same perkara like 
there  pekan will like , discuss on who is  
ya itu quite cool itu why but itu a quite old permainan ah 
not say im good at  permainan lah but like i understand how 
orang play  permainan so like 
itu is actually quite hard to master  permainan also 
but itu not trending anymore 
ya sesuatu like itu lah but anda have to , survive ah basically mereka tugas is to survive ya lah like among kami 
ya not one impostor like 
like mafia mafia like got anda three orang together 
did anda watch ini ralat youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States 
itu called saya forgot what is mereka called itu 
i jangan know what mereka called itu but mereka also play beberapa permainan similar to itu 
anda know that mereka didnt want to play properly mereka dont know how to say how to like bohong and semuanya

oh like stomp like itu ah 
oh i think saya know beras gusi , tunggu beras gum semua perbincangan about semua  daging lembu and semuanya 
so all dia just talk about semua  youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States daging lembu and semuanya like itu ah 
oh so 
but  perkara is like beras gusi kanan dia was once  raja of youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States anda know like at a titik of masa in saya pendapat lah later anda remember like ,  daging lembu  daging lembu between beras gusi and 
eh tidak  k s saya and  sidemen and semuanya remember that whoaCity in Illinois, United States 
ya that ya bro that is twenty seventeen bro itu was trending itu why semua of kami were talking about itu 
so grateful that was alive for itu chey , 
now a good perkara what like saya think about itu right itu like actually itu much more lebih sukar to do itu much more harder than a podcast and talk for like 
jam and jam 
tidak itu seperti got ini oh ya true mereka have a ya uh 
four dua puluh minit jer eh four minit twenty saat 
purposely ah beritahu anda semua for  jenaka ah but then setiap single , but then dia stop ralat dia stop

eh did i tonton err  keajaiban eh  penghujung permainan with anda tidak kanan 
ya lah okay lah saya can not say interesting lah but like 
i jangan know why 
huh  perkara i jangan know why i tonton itu because , itu was i think itu was  second hari

saya was like what  neraka manusia 
semua orang got together 
apa  lulus gred ya c six ah saya got c six saya was so oh saya tuhan i pass malay 
then b four b three 
ya then saya was like c ah saya got c five 
saya think im speaking too fast do anda think im speaking too fast , 
ya saya teman wanita tonton saya teman wanita is  satu who actually introduce saya to semua ini 
then dia ask saya to watch ini one lah but dia spoil for saya already so like saya can like 
ya serangan on titans ya so i watch itu lah 
ya actually i also quite confused lah 
ah anda dont watch what how anda know 
now musim five lah 
oh k lah 
if  orang listening havent tonton ini tunjuk spoiler amaran 
aaron becomes a titan ya 
topeng penunggang 
oh 
have anda like tried to rewatch anda zaman kanak-kanak rancangan like saya tried to rewatch kuasa renjer i can not handle itu cause like too cringey 
anda feel nostalgia lah but itu too cringey to watch manusia , once in a while anda can watch itu lah but like itu too cringey 
standard populasi what standard 
oh kompilasi 
eh i dont tonton topeng penunggang manusia 
well i think  one more anime siri saya think christian also watch ini itu called syaitan slayer ya 
mereka say itu one of  best if im not wrong 
i tidak mempunyai selesai watching syaitan slayer saya teman wanita want saya watch  cereka so i watch  cereka first , then i finish  siri 
 cereka is like teruskan straight from  siri 
not say finale ah but like kesinambungan 
sebab saya think 
cause  siri 
eh empat puluh minit then 
so technically anda are watching 
a two jam episod anda know what i mean 
what do anda mean doesnt rasa like one jam as compared to cereka 
oh saya get what anda mean 
ya ya ya cause 
saya know right technically siri is like a very long cereka if anda think about itu if compile semuanya together 
if anda wan na tonton anda should watch itu like itu not bad lah syaitan slayer 
oh ming chen tonton meh anime 
ya permaisuri gambit 
eh not bad sia 
one nine one tahun 
loki quite cool though , like interesting anda know like a new dimensi of loki 
loki from lain dimensi 
ya lah mereka were  one to killed  aksara technically  aksara is dead 
technically 
technically if anda think about itu right if mereka open a multiverse right dimensi semua ini mereka wont die lah  aksara wont mati 
and  perkara is suddenly like  other aksara from  other alam semesta can come here come back anda know 
entah bagaimana or beberapa cara mereka will come back one hari 
itu maybe thats why mereka want to do with  cereka mereka want to do sesuatu like  komik 
itu also make a lot of wang so 
oh ya 
mm 
kita can actually do that i think actually kita supposed to do itu kanan now kita just talking among diri kita sendiri itu actually  same perkara what 
so technically itu like a zum panggilan just anda and saya talking 
right now lah saya got three minggu of percutian 
ini minggu ah whens anda last minggu of f y p 
oh i tidak know that 
f y p semua  cara sia 
yo masa lepasan by 
fast bro 
six tahun 
then wah kita can kita cant bincang about kami private hidup but 
watching seram filem with kawan and semuanya but watching alone 
eh najis ya 
oh okay 
are anda gon na buy  new p s five 
oh ya true true 
like what are  permainan anda actually play 
jangan say first orang penembak lah 
oh so anda like mm anda will buy a p c but anda wouldnt buy a p c because , anda want to play permainan is like a casual kerja 
ah saya see 
ah if anda ever want to buy p c buy a 
like , like ralat jangan buy pre bina like anda buy  bahagian diri anda okay i mean like 
dont beli anda should make diri anda 
but i got but like 
there are kedai where mereka anda need anda choose  bahagian 
then mereka will build itu for anda 
then is also a better pilihan 
exactly like that  
like anda pangkal p s four and anda pangkal x box one itu doesnt kerja like itu unplayable 
ya 
i dont tonton tiktok lah but like saya saw that on twitter a lot of orang complaining 
then but mereka say like  best is like p s five ah or seems like  next gen konsol lah of kursus im not surprised lah 
technically depends lah but i think what saya think is perkakasan masalah because  p s four 
anda know got  footlocker one  wah  
okay lah true 
but also like partially 
ya covid sembilan belas also 
then like saya watch beberapa saya watch beberapa like video mereka say like 
 footlocker should have like actually do like an online kerja instead and like not 
ya fahami also lah so that kanan now i jangan fikir ada padanya actually mana-mana actual penyelesaian to ini 
uh best raffle lah ah actually ya that is  best lah 
kotak are shoes lah obviously , behind dia bilik tidur 
saya jangan have gambar but i got see gambar before lah ya 
im not that shoe orang anda know im not a high cebisan is that what anda guys call diri anda 
uh kasut fanatic im not that manusia 
oh and 
jeti 
took beberapa masa to like clean  pantai or sesuatu lah but 
maybe mereka cleaned that up ah 
yo but itu was so clean saya was quite amazed like wooCity in Illinois, United States 
iman in kemanusiaan anda know 
is itu esok hari ini ah hari ini lah ya hari ini 
that there got beberapa restoran mereka dont allow orang to sit mereka dont allow keluarga to sit together ya can not 
then anda split ah three ah tidak pilihan lah 
ya for saya lah but i hope like mereka do sesuatu like eh okay lah eight orang not bad lah 
but then i just harapan anda know  
yo but actually duh wah okay so , anda got apa sahaja anda want to say before kita end sir darwin 
there are like thirty saat left 
ah hopefully ah inshaallah amin 
okay lah but itu 
and i mean itu is has been like 
bahagian two debat tajuk two 
okay so uh 
saya pusing , 
does  modern dunia tempat too much kebergantungan on teknologi saya disagree 
because 
only nineteen titik one peratus of  dunia is like first dunia first , which first dunia which means like , 
yang orang who heavily rely on teknologi so  rehat of  dunia which is  like lapan puluh peratus , have very little to even tidak capaian or teknologi at semua or at least like  latest teknologi , 
majoriti of  dunia still leave with tidak teknologi , mesin are operated um , manually , and sumber are limited ya , uh and talking about  teknologi 
almost semua in  dunia will , will definitely like can not live without teknologi , 
and need itu wherever mereka go like for saya kes saya need , i need teknologi di mana sahaja saya go but , 
most orang in other negara semua yang um yang with little teknologi mereka get by , and even cara before teknologi happened semua orang got by so ya 
when itu comes to like teknologi that never existed in kami daily hidup before bayangkan that kita dont know apa sahaja about  existing teknologi , or like or not yet or itu wont exist at semua , 
human hidup can possibly live without itu and live mereka hidup like a thousand tahun back , 
then when there was tidak masalah , so without teknologi 
uh existing kami hidup would be like  old hari of kami great datuk dan nenek 
like for existed for kejadian , when orang go out of pekan if itu far away mereka will wake up early in  pagi , or berjalan or maybe ride basikal , and  udara will be fresh and 
actually there is ini new teknologi that creates uh itu , itu was created for kerja rumah where anda dont need to move anda badan , and 
and saya think , itu will make anda lazy one perkara and 
why do kita rely so much on teknologi kanan 
so like ya 
okay next titik is um 
oh okay 
oh okay so uh moving on , like kita dont need teknologi 
because itu i think itu a cara of hidup like for contoh rural kawasan of chinaCity in Virginia, United States tanaman uh from ladang are harvested , manually with 
using tenaga manusia so there are a lot of petani i mean , ini is  growing technological jurang between rich orang and  poor orang , 
so um modern dunia can other mean 
of , substituting teknologi with manpower manusia increasingly recognises uh masalah , kami kebergantungan of teknologi pose and taking langkah to alleviate ini masalah by reducing kami dependensi 
mm teknologi permeates setiap aspek of kami hidup and itu was also jejak of teknologi that made 
has made hidup , in  past lebih baik over masa so itu first itu important to understand  most 
budaya surrounding teknologi , so 
um ambil , uh 
from uh okay tunggu ah so like 
teknologi 
 
of teknologi has infiltrated setiap aspek of kami hidup , 
for contoh changing how kita work how kita learn how kita shop 
and itu uh inevitable that kami peranti are peranti such as telefon bimbit komputer riba and , semuanya else began to reflect on kami civic penerokaan and kami keinginan to connect , with lain and contribute to  
dunia around 
around um  dunia around kami 
like  internet and related alat already play crucial peranan in such as , data pemetaan visualisasi crowd sourcing and more , um and mereka lower transaksi kos for kumpulan maklumat and tindakan , like kita always 
have come together to engage in  komuniti , and  potensi of  internet is that kita are able to do itu more efficiently , 
and mereka shave masa uh kumpulan ahli dont have to be in  same bilik at  same masa 
uh to meet and mereka coordinate aktiviti over hari and bulan , and ahli can chime in at mereka kemudahan whether itu uh in  pagi in  malam or whatever masa 
komunikasi like spreading perkataan is now spreading  perkataan only takes one klik , and kita and thats semua that thats semua kita do nowadays , if kita want to kongsi sesuatu 
if anda had three keinginan what would anda wish for 
must be like  anda know err 
 miss alam semesta 
mendaki around berjalan around explore semua  pemandangan 
if  , udara tiket is free then can go anywhere lah 
then , bulan madu still go new zealandCity in Illinois, United States 
then , 
after new zealandCity in Illinois, United States go jepun 
ralat 
saya jangan have friend in jepun 

then itu okay lor singapore japanese makanan overpriced anyway 
okay lah , is franchise mah ultimately so franchise makanan menghisap lah so 
eat  unagi 
saya want to eat semua  , very exotic and authentic and sesuatu that anda can only eat in jepun 
saya got a lot of tenaga and like and i feel that saya can and i jangan have mana-mana like 
penyakit lah 
ah and i feel like saya bentuk okay 
and saya want to play more saya want to play saya want to like , err buat more 
but i keep losing like so fast tidak peluang for saya to do apa sahaja , 
okay lah saya pasukan got one pakcik lah probably like in dia enam puluh plus ah 
ah saya got main before with other pakcik fifty plus sixty plus one ah 
saya will just go main lor 
ralat but maybe by then i will be able to have a gaya ah then i can adapt mah 
then saya can still play with  anak muda casually 
anda always sleep everyday 
oh good idea , 
if manusia no longer needed to work to survive 
ya as manusia 
in terma of what like makanan on  jadual tempat perlindungan keselamatan semua ini mah so ini so one hari if like 
for saya ah okay 
ya thats one of mereka lah 
but i mean to be jujur  main permainan bahagian ah 
and so nevermind so when ralat 
survival 
or maybe err 
 perkara mereka wanted to do maybe in kami current ralat masyarakat , needed a lot of sumber 
itu why then ralat mereka go mereka compromise 
and go into sesuatu else 
so if anda ask saya ah itu masa i think , like if kos and masa is not an isu right what would i want to do i would like to go 
im personally more of a pengembaraan jenis lah then 
ralat if keadaan permit 
tidak different 
itu one is probably to perfect anda teknik lah for skydiving lah but thats not  perkara lah 
so for saya 
saya want to travel around 
so which i think i would like to anda know bring 
is a very good tunjuk 
um sorot 
so kita always fight for sumber among diri kita sendiri so when one hari ah ini sumber ah is so called langka one ah become no longer become abundant and limited already right bermaksud ah 
anda basic keperluan are realised 
so  next perlu ah of manusia ah is curiosity manusia 
um tidak i mohon to differ because 
what saya think is that 
err why orang have greed 
in a 
kami nenek moyang nenek moyang  very first homosapiens 
mereka semua mereka also know that err increasingly mereka know itu instinctively mereka know that sumber are scarce 
in mereka d n a and then through teori of evolusi 
have anda seen a domesticated kucing 
when itu has semua  keperluan fulfilled ah 
mana-mana haiwan lah 
saya , saying setiap single perkara is hey when anda ibu bapa want to work twenty four jam then anda got two kanak-kanak anda will split itu twelve jam to masing-masing kid what okay what 
 human wants 
and  sebab why  manusia wants ah 
kita semua know through ekonomi ah ekonomi lah so human wants are basically unlimited 
so let say now  sumber are unlimited as well 
so  next ah 
ada padanya ini ralat 
segitiga of keperluan 
so for different orang are different 
ya that usually is self err pemenuhan or diri err realisasi 
so for manusia as a whole ah 
so far that 
even if without basic keperluan right let say anda have semuanya already what would anda want to do 
like anda asked saya lah if  keseluruhan now i tidak perlu wang tidak perlu apa sahaja 
itu semua about rasa ingin tahu explore anda want to explore 
karma 
um probably served with simple makanan , 
manis and sour babi 
basically semua saya favorite makanan ah , 
maybe itu saya karma 
ya , 
are semua  nice makanan ah 
bunyi like a very 
err tidak before uni was army so tentera was heavily influenced by clubbing at itu titik in masa so itu like r b 
saya go clubbing then , 
ralat ya lor 
per minggu tidak lah maybe two minggu once or one bulan once lor 
ya saya need to pay to go in ah  pintu masuk yuran then after itu perlu to get minuman there 
jangan know leh but most of masa 
so sesuatu berat so when saya go there ah i dont drink bir 
tentera lor last masa seven hundred , 
then tidak wang tidak 
itu was like dua puluh plus only 
take back is about seven ralat seven hundred like itu 
um itu why saya say lor saya didnt really go much clubbing 
oh tidak eh that masa uh there is a few masa where saya was like very mabuk 
semua hard minuman keras lah 
then um  satu that i think  first masa saya pemadaman 
not blackout lah like really can not remember what happened there after kanan was  masa where um im gon na o r d 
then saya ah saya o c ah a malay lelaki lah but hes a regular kapten so 
sakit , i buy anda i treat anda a tequila 
must finish anda know , 
 clubbing thats  most hot kelab at itu titik of masa lah , then , 
mereka will do  bir periuk kita got kita will do tequila tembakan 
then err ya lah saya got i panggilan err beberapa of saya own kawan come also lah ya then after itu ralat 
after beberapa masa ah wah saya think by  masa kita hit  
then after itu just go dance lantai tarian tarian , saya also dont what saya can only very remember a little bit perkara only 
and be bothered , 
oh okay anda talking about like 
anda talking about when anda start working itu jenis of kelab ah tidak tidak okay when  at saya 
ah 
melarikan diri mekanisme , 
but okay lah saya ya then after itu , lah then after itu 
after itu saya ralat saya bunkmate ya send saya rumah 
then ah ya lah so  next perkara saya know saya was ah saya was very sleepy saya was leaning on  dinding like itu 
itu one different already anda then yang that one anda mentioned yang jenis of tempat ah is more like networking already 
socializing literally socializing 
so like networking lah in short 
tidak when saya say  gadis go there 
like not hook up lah like mereka just want to have menyeronokkan 
so  lelaki want to have menyeronokkan with  gadis , unless like a gay pub then itu will be lelaki want to have fun with lelaki 
gay palang ah never leh 
sebab saya think throughout saya army hidup right would at  kelawar there go lah saya think saya got told anda before right a pasangan of masa ini beberapa lelaki ah or lelaki ah will 
then dia grabbed saya butt im like what  neraka , ya because mereka are leaving bagaimanapun itu why mereka do  anda know ya tidak pilihan lor saya mean ive been taken kelebihan of at  penghujung of malam then okay lor 
but lesbian im pretty sure lesbian tidak tekan on saya lah 
orh saya think anda will be surprised 
mm 
ralat last masa ah 
ah okay there are different tahap  satu anda go is definitely is  matang 
penonton or matang kerumunan 
so ah ralat 
ralat singapura worst m r t 
crowding that anda can think of in singapura m r t sesuatu like itu 
a little bit squeezier like itu and a bit squeezier 
ralat get  peluang again because saya im never gon na be eighteen again to play bola keranjang for beberapa famous 
debat tajuk three 
okay so i felt that 
learning outside of bilik darjah is a very subjective tajuk 
yes learning outside of bilik darjah is fun and exploring for pelajar 
but is itu beneficial for pelajar 
itu masa consuming for a jalan perjalanan 
and pembaziran of tenaga manusia to ensure that tidak pelajar wander off 
or run around and mereka 
actually even be keselamatan isu for kanak-kanak that are under thirteen tahun old 
if an kecederaan were to happen 
jarak from sekolah can mean less sokongan if medical bantuan is needed 
as for  guru mereka need to plan fully in pendahuluan 
and taking semuanya into pertimbangan 
and less capaian to sumber itu might even actually takes up 
to a minggu rancang for a two jam perjalanan perjalanan 
in saya own perspektif 
there are more manfaat to learn in kelas compared to learning outside 
as anda have stated uh  anda can 
have like  five deria through luaran 
and why tidak boleh kita do itu indoor 
saya believe that tangan on pengalaman can still be 
diajar in kelas instead of going out 
so like there are actually more manfaat to be learning in kelas compared to learning outside 
first of semua itu enhances  pelajar critical berfikir kemahiran 
teaching in  bilik darjah give  pelajar peluang to engage in 
live perbincangan 
in which theyre forced to use mereka critical berfikir kemahiran to formulate pendapat or argumen 
so i feel that 
a pelajar who are outside 
mereka minda would actually wander off and instead of focusing on what  guru are actually teaching 
and bilik darjah mengajar 
pelajar how to develop organisational kemahiran 
beginning with  Asas such as arriving to sekolah on masa 
in a live bilik darjah pelajar are held accountable 
for being prepared to do  sekolah kerja 
which includes having done mereka kerja rumah  malam before 
being ready for pop kuiz 
turning in tugasan by mereka due tarikh and being prepared for in kelas perbincangan 
in kesan pelajar learn how to organise mereka masa 
prioritise mereka tugasan 
and get mereka kerja rumah done 
saya believe being 
getting organized and barang 
will not be 
easily learnt di luar rumah because 
theyre more free 
mereka do not care about whether mereka are getting mereka kerja rumah done or not 
so classroom mengajar inculcates 
persembahan kemahiran 
when itu comes to presenting mereka idea confidently in hadapan of mereka rakan 
developing pasukan semangat and teaches mereka to get along with yang from different budaya background 
such pengalaman are valuable in shaping pelajar 
komunikasi and listening kemahiran as well as growing and maturing emotionally , 
so for pelajar uh 
a bilik darjah persekitaran is very important because 
mereka were to do a debat 
mereka wont do itu outdoors because 
itu not a 
suitable persekitaran for mereka because there are a lot of gangguan luaran 
so semua ini can only be done dalam rumah 
and 
i jangan think sesiapa sahaja would want to do a persembahan luaran as well 
because mereka are 
penonton will not be focusing on mereka 
and rather focus on  latar belakang 
okay uh so i dont see ada padanya why not to be bringing animal to kelas 
uh ive seen saya guru bawa Tikus bring frog into kelas 
for sains 
and ive actually brought 
a hamster for tunjuk and tell during kelas as well , so 
semua ini jenis of pengalaman 
saya feel that itu can still be done 
in sekolah but also 
saya also agree to anda titik that 
uh for contoh seni anda need to be outdoor 
to see a legit tekstur of a daun 
but at  same masa anda can actually bring itu into kelas 
itu not sesuatu that 
itu have to be done luaran , being able to do luaran is a manfaat because 
itu gives kami 
itu gives  pengguna 
a more 
kebebasan of berfikir 
and itu a very subjective jirim 
because uh for contoh if anda are talking about 
matematik sains i jangan think that 
semua ini subjek are able to be brought outdoor 
is a guru able to teach maths luaran saya dont think so i think  pelajar would be more focused 
on  persekitaran compared to  subjek that  guru is teaching 
but for seni 
ya saya can agree that 
uh  pelajar 
have to be outdoor because 
itu enhances mereka akal 
sekolah actually do provide learning outside of bilik darjah 
persekitaran but 
itu can not be on a 
weekly or a monthly asas but more of a 
once in a semasa jenis of perkara so that  pelajar will be able to 
santai diri mereka sendiri and not be so tense up in kelas 
okay so 
back to ini tajuk of going luaran 
itu a pembaziran of sumber that  sekolah can actually be 
better put in uh 
for contoh if let say anda have to go to a ladang and 
 kemasukan yuran of going into a ladang might cost dua puluh to thirty pax per pax so 
semua ini jenis of wang can actually be placed into better melengkapkan in kelas 
and also like 
if anda are talking about  touching akal of maybe a arnab 
or a kuda semua ini jenis of 
touching akal can actually be put into manekin 
there are actually like 
pelajar can be able to touch and if anda were to really compare 
a two jam in kelas 
and a two jam on a perjalanan 
a two jam on a perjalanan can maybe probably 
at most a one jam 
useful pengetahuan 
and lain jam is probably wasted on trying to gather semua  pelajar trying to bring mereka 
together to get mereka makan tengah hari and semua yang unnecessities pembaziran of masa so i feel that a two jam in bilik darjah is actually more 
bermanfaat for  pelajar because 
mereka get more pengetahuan of  haiwan 
and if anda are talking about haiwan are 
for contoh if anda are talking about dinosaur 
pelajar able to touch dinosaur 
even if mereka go to a muzium 
mereka are only able to see how big 
or how 
 fosil of itu looks like 
but 
if anda are talking about how  kelihatan of 
a perkara semuanya can be taught through kelas kita dont have to see  
physical perkara but 
semua ini jenis of perkara can be seen through 
atas talian 
okay so itu not just a pembaziran of sumber but also a pembaziran of tenaga manusia so if anda are talking about kanak-kanak that kita have to bring mereka outside of bilik darjah 
persekitaran uh 
especially for kanak-kanak that are under thirteen tahun old anda know anda should know that kanak-kanak are actually quite 
and mereka are more prone to wandering off and running around 
and ini might actually be a keselamatan isu 
so if let say kita were to go to 
okay being to going to a ladang 
might be somewhere off  grid and is actually not 
as safe as maybe being to a muzium 
because a jarak from  sekolah can means less sokongan if medical bantuan is needed 
if a kanak-kanak were to fall down 
and mereka were to get a potong and have to be sent to hospital 
itu might actually have 
more , needed more masa for mereka compared to being in  sekolah 
and also uh anda stated about  positive pengalaman 
of a kanak-kanak 
being outside 
so what are actually  positive pengalaman that  kanak-kanak are actually gaining 
are mereka gaining more fun 
on just been outside having menyeronokkan with mereka kawan or actually mereka will feel that 
positive pengalaman to be outside 
gaining more pengetahuan 
as a anak saya have been outdoor and learnt but i know that 
is more of not learning is more of just going out there to enjoy semua  masa with saya kawan and just running around and not doing apa sahaja else 
one two three 
bahagian three negative pengalaman mm okay so maybe lets mula with  , negative pengalaman maybe start with sesuatu uh small first uh what makes anda stressed 
uh personally what makes saya tekanan is uh ada padanya a lot of perkara that make saya tekanan , for contoh one perkara that makes saya stress  most will be uh i rasa is peperiksaan and  keseriusan of , peperiksaan 
on singapores pendidikan theres too much , uh penekanan on itu and if saya screw up saya mendidik uh saya uh if saya screw up saya peperiksaan ill affect saya pendidikan if i affect saya pendidikan itu will affect saya masa hadapan 
and ini like a snowball kesan so , itu makes saya really stressed that saya when saya think about itu that i really have to study really hard , and  pendidikan sistem in singapura is such that is bell lengkung , 
so if saya am not able to appear on atas of lengkung then 
there goes saya gred withdraw saya uh a masa hadapan might be affected and semuanya , so itu makes saya , really uh tekanan for contoh i remember one insiden very vividly was saya last semester during , 
last semester during  peperiksaan when saya had back to back peperiksaan and saya wasnt able to uh have enough masa to actually study for saya , 
second Kertaspaper size and saya still remember how stress saya felt especially when saya was in  peperiksaan dewan , and saya minda blank out and i really can not think about apa sahaja i really tried very hard to 
paksa sesuatu out or like think about where did i learn ini how can i actually answer ini soalan , so , itu makes saya really uh tekanan from ini insiden and , hopefully uh saya jangan have to experience itu again ah what about anda 
uh personally saya also feel that thats one of  perkara that made saya stress lah , like uh not 
not being able to live up to jangkaan not being able to actually have perkara go saya cara thats what thats uh that will make saya , feel really , stressed and worried because uh i spend so much masa in 
to itu i wouldnt want itu to go  uh go  other cara uh saya want itu to turn out well so i feel that itu really one perkara that will make saya stress lah mm , 
so maybe kita move on or whats  biggest perkara holding anda back from anda matlamat , uh personally i feel that uh one perkara that is holding saya back for saya matlamat right would be , uh occasional penundaan 
for contoh oh one of saya matlamat is to , actually be able to do well study hard do well in  peperiksaan and also pick up new kemahiran skill set and uh 
and ya to grow saya portfolio and sambung semula but one perkara that tahan is holding saya back most of  masa kanan is like penundaan , feel that uh right now i have 
saya feel that right now i jangan have  mood to actually do ini , right now uh im just tired uh or i do itu later or anytime later , but 
more often than not i realized that i keep delaying at itu actually snowball and i actually dont have itu much masa to do itu later so i feel that thats one perkara that just holding saya back from achieving what i really want to achieve ya 
ya thats what i feel in  past when saya when im tanpa sasaran saya have tiada apa-apa to work Ke arah to then if ada padanya tiada apa-apa to works Ke arah to then 
ada padanya tiada apa-apa holding saya back  only perkara holding saya back is that saya have tiada apa-apa to works to work , work Ke arah to , itu uh itu cukup tanpa sasaran living hidup just like itu pembaziran masa setiap hari , so thats definitely itu , uh ya anda definitely shared a very uh 
very uh important and valid titik that uh if anda dont have apa sahaja kerja Ke arah then thats  biggest perkara that actually holding anda back thats what saya feel also like ya saya agree with anda 
mm ya i agree with anda i feel that lain perkara is that uh hold itu thats actually holding saya back is titik is ini matlamat is not  matlamat that i want 
like anda know like maybe i what if ini is not  matlamat that saya , ini is not  ini matlamat bukan at itu of mana-mana like a manfaat or guna at semua 
itu just one perkara saya feel like maybe ini why am saya wasting saya masa doing ini when itu may not be  actual matlamat that i want like youre unable to identify  real matlamat that anda actually anda want in hidup 
mm ya saya feel that itu maybe one of  perkara , 
ya okay 
so maybe uh can move on to describe a masa when perkara turn out not meeting anda jangkaan 
hmm for saya sendiri 
when perkara dont turn jumpa 
when perkara dont meet saya jangkaan uh i dont really have one yet maybe ill think about itu do anda have apa sahaja to kongsi first 
now that anda mention itu ive i ya saya feel  same perkara , so one perkara that dont jumpa when perkara dont one masa when perkara dont turn out saya jumpa saya jangkaan was , i remember also uh in secondary sekolah and saya was planning 
peristiwa so like anda when anda plan peristiwa kita put in kami usaha kita hope that  peristiwa will turn out well but , but when i see  that  peserta didnt really enjoy itu 
and itu isih of tunjuk saya that uh itu jenis of tidak jumpa saya jangkaan uh and , for  jumlah of usaha that i put in and itu didnt actually turn out  cara that saya want saya feel very like 
rasa really is like , uh id say uh maybe  kanan perkataan to describe itu itll be like sien ah like really 
really like uh 
really did not worth and or anda really dont know what went wrong which bahagian went wrong why is itu not uh mesyuarat jangkaan why is why are orang like not enjoying itu so thats one of  perkara that dont meet saya , when masa  when thats one of  masa when perkara dont meet saya jangkaan 
lain masa saya would say would be uh would be exam sometimes exam 
for jumlah of like , study that saya do for jumlah of like uh usaha that i put into during  amalan Kertaspaper size okay do like a lot of amalan Kertaspaper size but then when saya uh stepped into peperiksaan dewan 
 guru will just boom kami with a different Kertaspaper size and  soalan tanya will be much harder than what saya expected uh ive never experienced itu before then how am i supposed to do ini Kertaspaper size kanan 
and perkara , dont turn dont really turn out  cara that anda wanted itu so like uh 
when anda in  peperiksaan dewan anda just dont know what was going on anda feel that ini lihat foreign to anda never learn before and itu not that anda never put in usaha anda put in usaha to amalan put usaha to study put usaha to revise but itu just didnt pusing out  cara that anda want so itu brings back bring saya back to  titik that 
why do i feel tekanan is because of such uh perkara stressed that when perkara dont meet saya jangkaan when perkara dont go saya cara what will happen ada padanya a lot of like subsequent uh akibatnya there is a lot of snowball kesan selepas itu which , which actually kesan uh 
how 
uh how i actually move on in hidup how will i be able to like uh pengaruh orang around saya how will i affect orang around saya so thats one of  perkara that dont really meet saya jangkaan , ya 
hmm so maybe kita move on to uh have anda gone through mana-mana kerugian in anda hidup personally for saya i tidak mempunyai saya have not really undergo mana-mana kerugian 
in saya hidup yet feel that uh ya but i did i did see kawan that have went through such perkara in hidup and itu like really a cukup uh sad and ya and thats what i feel lah 
mm ya definitely lost are really quite uh sedih and 
really quite but i would say that itu still like unavoidable in hidup and anda have and itu itu definitely have to , happens at beberapa titik of masa so maybe , uh ill feel that uh gatal be how anda cope with itu and 
what did anda learn from itu uh recently i read an artikel about uh how an overseas budak lelaki actually uh bunuh diri after dia see that uh dia stok akaun uh have a very huge defisit but actually itu was just an itu was an ralat on  stok akaun sisi , and so itu shows that 
hidup is like really uh rapuh and anda really dont know what will happen and how many perkara can actually affect emosi , emosi will actually 
kesan uh anda hidup ya 
hmm saya feel that ya saya agree with anda but definitely yang like slowly like coming soon yang jenis of kerugian is still 
still quite hard to deal with lah let say anda see uh anda see itu coming slowly but anda when itu actually happened anda still miss  masa that uh anda spend with  orang , anda still uh really very uh reflect back about 
how have what uh how hows  hubungan like as , how is itu how are anda thankful to  orang and barang like itu ya i rasa that , even though tidak jirim how slow itu can come or how sudden itu hits  kerugian is still quite uh significant lah saya feel 
ya mm okay so lets see hmm describe a masa when anda felt trapped or helpless uh saya feel that ini 
ini brings saya back to  previous two soalan that saya answered uh when perkara dont turn out saya cara , and when i feel stress because when i feel when saya felt , when saya feel tidak berdaya 
gatal leads saya to itu will bring saya to uh itu will make saya feel tekanan was stressed that saya can not do apa sahaja to actually uh to help with  keadaan lah so one perkara is like as what saya mentioned lor in 
peperiksaan when anda in  peperiksaan dewan , anda minda kosong then anda can not , anda feel helpless because anda dont know what how anda can do to actually improve  keadaan now ya so like maybe anda want kongsi more if anda have 
wah anda guru is quite harsh ah id say , hmm okay so uh bangunan on ini soalan maybe anda can describe a masa where anda feel that tiada apa-apa anda do is good enough 
do anda have mana-mana of such majlis 
hmm ya i agree with anda when will definitely still try sesuatu but theres definitely beberapa majlis of masa when kita feel that , whatever kita do 
itu not up to jangkaan is not good enough ini brings kami to  titik on when perkara dont turn out to be meet kami jangkaan so like what saya mentioned early ya studied really hard put in so much usaha and masa pengorbanan saya masa main and semuanya 
but itu still not good enough so itu really a soalan to want to wonder what bahagian went wrong why is itu not good enough what can kita do to make itu good enough ya gatal 
when , itu like when anda put in so much usaha and perkara dont turn out anda cara , and perkara is not good enough itu really sets anda back really make anda uh think really hard 
why is why does itu seems like  dunia is going against anda yeah thats what saya feel 
oh 
uh okay let saya think about ini , 
mm uh okay after anda shared ini ive , ive recalled 
one of  saddest perkara one of  saddest adegan that saya witnessed was anda know recent semua  uh rusuhan in hongkongCity in Illinois, United States and barang like itu is i rasa that 
many orang will actually affected innocent hidup will affected and itu really quite sad to see how  dunia is actually would uh transforming Ke arah 
ya so , itu itu really jenis of uh sad to see like why are orang not able to live harmoniously peacefully why perkara , cant be settled peacefully ya so thats one of  sad adegan that ive have ever witnessed and i rasa and i hope that itu really uh be able to resolve well and 
perkara will turn out for  better lah saya feel 
remember how itu was like secondary sekolah in before kita moved on 
tidak but i remember secondary sekolah itu used to be how many of kami 
four to five ah since when got eight one 
charlene was bahagian meh 
okay technically anda , anda mean where dia follow kami like around ah , 
okay anda know what itu is really creepy saya can not itu was really creepy 
itu does then there is 
xin yi charlene saya anda rachel 
seven what where got eight 
itu not eight 
tidak then right what had what happened actually why did charlene suddenly , leave ah 
just left because of  ahemCity in Illinois, United States , 
oh najis , okay halus saya have a very bad ingatan 
mmhmm 
then sec two kita separated , actually i really can not remember why dia left anda know 
jing 
dia didnt really left but dia left 
sian sia then like , then is who ah meredith 
saya want to  bincang but dia dont want bincang saya want to meet but dia dont want to meet 
itu one is because meredith dapat got along well with  budak lelaki then rachel was like i jangan know 
uh ya 
like maaf not saya , mereka , 
then saya was because saya was done with dia najis first of all , kita are two different dunia apart , then after itu like 
ya but very jantung breaking sia like five tahun like just , just because seseorang else came in 
and then anda entire really just hancur on  di dalam and anda dont even know whether itu was dia 
sebab mereka think tiada apa-apa mah 
kawan , secondary sekolah still okay still can fight back because like itu such a small kohort anda can like find what i t e leh walao i down there one orang down there can not anda want to find also can not find 
but anda whats lain perkara saya remember most about bel dia gila tak terhingga never ending hancur , 
kawan dia had tiga belas in one tahun thats like more than one per bulan , 
is like two hari ago oh saya like ini orang three hari later eh anda still like itu one ah tidak i change already 
ingat kita said mereka will , mereka will break up before  penghujung of dua puluh nineteen , kita were wrong about itu 
but saya know shesCity in Illinois, United States still using  akaun and saya know  kepala   profil pic is still mereka 
itu just dia right but meanwhile miliknya is like full of dia so itu either turning one sided , 
ya but then again is there really mana-mana perbezaan though 
ouch 
eh dia was committed for like one of dia hancur , like one 
a pasangan of bulan like one two bulan , 
what happened then , 
anda see i told anda werent dumb youre just lazy , ive been telling anda that for  past four tahun youre not dumb youre just lazy 
bunyi like saya though , 
rakan tekanan 
sebab got home tekanan got sekolah tekanan got peer tekanan 
tidak but i feel like kanan saya t e , and sec five have one perkara in common mereka semua showed kami right whom kita should trust really meredith is like for saya saya ready for anda isabel 
i mean itu not like anda were very close to isabel bagaimanapun , 
oh saya god bel invited imaginary keadaan 
over gadis 
for now 
orang asing bahaya oh saya Astaga then 
f n was like neraka with dia saya swear 
did i beritahu anda that dia forgot to bring dia brokoli for  penghujung of tahun peperiksaan sebab dia forgot to bring dia sayur 
saya was like eh saya thought anda making vegetable i lupa to bring , take casually takes saya brokoli , tidak saya sebab saya only had to use separuh then i gave dia  other separuh 
mutiara tahan on a sesi bantuan dia cut im like huh shesCity in Illinois, United States like youre almost done already what im like ya but saya still need to plate eh shesCity in Illinois, United States like never minda bantuan dia potong first so i , cut 
itu why saya cher is really close one mata give dia  skor one if not dia , if not is immediate gagal 
ya 
ya anda make usaha 
oh right  kerja kursus bahagian 
like dorcasCity in Virginia, United States is not  hannah and alexandra jenis of like studious but dia is good 
then mereka can not shut up then mereka will blame  entire kelas 
uh ya 
uh ya kanan 
because why anda more matang than mereka what walao 
lelaki always let saya down for four tahun 
tidak im serious itu is scientifically proven that lelaki otak develop four tahun slower than gadis 
wow 
then after itu right then in secondary sekolah saya think like  worse tahun kita had was what sec three 
where like kita started getting cramped for n aras then a lot of drama also remember francine saat three and four 
itu is lah but like to  rehat of kami itu was like because bel kanan like after kita got kami peperiksaan keputusan back anda know dia always was like dia will hide behind  dinding then dia will talk to meredith about eh mutiara dia gred not bad then everytime dia went to like bincang najis and semua 
then dia blames lain for getting gred better than dia 
tidak but anda dont regret being like tahan like tahaning dia najis for like itu one tahun meh 
eh then , like then after itu right dia so theres ini younger kakak that one is tobys kucing 
woof , 
tidak then after that  , i think  worst was what  drama between francine shirleen and rachel because mereka found dia youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States akaun remember 
honestly would anda 
itu why itu orh okay lor 
itu a buangan of masa actually basically now that saya think about like back in like semua yang like secondary sekolah hari right i just think like how stupid itu actually is anda know 
youll have a very menyeronokkan like secondary sekolah like 
right and then when anda create  drama itu always like very like how say 
but meanwhile do anda realise if anda create drama anda are only like being  manipulator of isih 
tidak ah not exactly ah but sometimes i just feel like also sian but honestly like i find i really find itu a buangan though like secondary sekolah pusing to shit 
because  orang there were nice mereka were like friendly and semua but itu just because certain perkara certain orang that made kami go ee like yucks 
koir really 
rindu kong was shes very easy to talk to 
ya but then i mean at least anda have orang then meanwhile rachel like what also last masa 
like kumpulan kanan 
like so itu just like a whole new dunia 
orh that one err orang luar can always see perkara clearer than  orang dalam right 
itu good lah saya tuhan , adam 
anda know i jenis of i knew i tidak know that dia wanted to use kelene as a lantunan semula after saya i had zero , saya had zero like pengetahuan of ini eh actually happen ah

anda know anda got what i mean like ya anda expected to get ini but like anda shouldnt have worried so much because like anda okay anda doesnt get good gred but anda did fine kanan and like youre fine tidak jirim and youre fine tidak jirim what anda get 
itu kinda that jenis of mentaliti ya 
ya 
mm 
mm 
mmhmm 
ya okay 
ya 
mm 
ya 
mmhmm ya okay i get what anda mean 
uh good soalan ha saya cant fikir of a specific one 
okay saya think there was once where saya was quite upset sebab like saya ulang tahun fell on like ini um ini perkara where anda have to stay back for like until like nine p m in sekolah lah 
then uh so i didnt really get to like uh spend saya ulang tahun with like orang that i love ah sebab itu ended at nine in sekolah 
then like saya kawan made  usaha to like make saya hari more comfortable in itu akal and then like on that  next hari which was like a hujung minggu like uh one of saya kawan took saya out 
to like ini tempat that i really wanted to go for very long masa but i tidak want to cause itu was pretty expensive like ini kafe and ya lah saya think that was very like  fakta that uh saya kawan took  , like in sekolah like mereka made an usaha to like 
make itu hari better for saya because that mereka knew that saya was having a bad hari because ive a lot of extra perkara outside like itu i dont think itu was like a perkara itu was more of like itu attitude that mereka had Ke arah saya 
that like saya felt was like  best hadir mereka could give saya because at itu keadaan like saya mood itu hari was terrible and  fakta that mereka tried to make itu better was good lah ya itu saya 
ya yes , 
anda better say  berpakaian , 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mmhmm ya but  berpakaian , 

yup 
ya itu kinda true 
okay 
mm saya think i dont know if i told anda a lot of masa but saya look up to saya abang lah im gon na say ini as softly sebab hes in  hes in  other , bilik so i dont want to say so , 
like okay lah sebab like as much as like dia pencapaian put tekanan on saya itu sebab like youre asian ibu bapa like oh if anda sibling does ini then like anda have  , jangkaan to live up to itu piawai 
but like i feel like even though saya had that tekanan itu was more of like dia was very supportive of saya and saya own like 
like laluan that i wan na go sebab kita are kedua-duanya in very different like hes in komputer sains kanan and im studying like in f a s so is like itu totally different then like uh dia hes always like dia always sets ini like matlamat like dia 
dia only wants  best for dirinya and like itu what i think like dia wouldnt like , like anda know how orang like okay if anda dont achieve ini matlamat then mereka will have ini lower matlamat i jangan know about anda but ive met a lot of orang with itu mindset that like okay saya cant achieve ini so like im gon na set ini low palang 
but dia palang is always up there and like tidak jirim what happens dia palang is set there and itu doesnt like itu doesnt lepas for sesiapa sahaja or apa sahaja or keadaan and i think itu a very good like set minda to like 
have lah in a akal but be itu like in anda personal hidup or like anda kerjaya or anda academic hidup 
and i think like dia high piawai for dirinya but like being still being like a keluarga orang or like a good kawan to dia kumpulan of kawan like itu still like a very is perkara is sesuatu i look up to lah like i really like 
like if itu wasnt for dia lah i wouldnt 
i wouldnt like be  orang i am lah like klise , ya how about anda 
mm 
mm 
mm , 
mm 
mm , 
what super good looking okay 
bahagian two debat tajuk two 
okay um saya tekaan sakit rebutt ya so um saya berdiri is that a dadah should not be developed to allow manusia to live forever , so i think  first masalah that will arise is overpopulation , 
like would earth really be able to handle a populasi of orang with unlimited jangka hayat itu not about just hidup longer is about living selamanya 
so imagine like even if just 
like a small nombor of orang maybe like one peratus of  bumi 
putuskan to take ini dadah thats already a lot of orang out of  current seven titik eight billion orang in  dunia so there will be a huge peningkatan in permintaan for sumber like makanan air and fosil bahan api 
and currently like even though kita dont even have ini dadah kanan and according to  di seluruh dunia dana setiap tahun bumi overshoot hari gets earlier and earlier than  previous satu 
earth overshoot hari is basically like when  penggunaan of kami sumber on ini planet overshoot 
uh tunggu that kami planet is able to generate itu , so in two ribu and sembilan belas on july twenty nine which is like  earliest one ever calculated in 
sejarah like perbandingan if anda wan na compare in one nine seven one ini happened in december dua puluh one 
so as anda can see  peningkatan in populasi from one nine seven one to two zero one nine has already been so huge and itu has caused sedemikian a big masalah with like iklim ubah and , overpopulation , so i feel like if kita develop ini dadah right were putting diri kita sendiri further into hutang while also threatening  masa hadapan 
like even recently semua  global konflik are also increasingly filled by  keinginan for minyak and natural sumber , kita are already short so short of such item right 
why would anda want orang to live forever and then consume even more sumber 
ya for contoh theres a kebuntuan in crimea rusia and ukraine kanan , 
and kita have seen how  , which is an , tenaga perbadanan in rusia mereka repeatedly , raise  minyak harga for ukraine and try to um like fight jenayah by military bermaksud so theres already a lot of devastating kesan of a kekurangan of sumber on bumi 
and i feel like gatal only get worse if itu ini dadah is developed 
ya and secondly anda said anda titik about um 
orang being able to chase mereka tabiat hobi or like doing whatever mereka havent done in a longer hidup , yeah i disagree with itu because i feel like cinta hidup forever doesnt equate to happy or healthy or longer hidup 
just because anda will live forever doesnt mean that anda will have more masa to do whatever anda want i feel like manusia are not sociable so even when anda have more masa right , anda will still want to keep doing sesuatu and sesuatu like itu never ending senarai anda know like , when anda have a lot of wang anda still want more and more ada padanya tidak penghujung to itu so 
i dont see a titik in hidup forever because when anda do itu , like i mean after semua even anda live forever anda still need to work or else how anda gon na get wang kanan unless a lot of orang donate to anda or sesuatu ya so if anda have to keep working when youre old , and like when anda live longer doesnt min that anda are going to be healthier 
like anda can even see like kami sembilan puluh tahun old grandmas mereka are like so old and frail semua mereka can do is just like duduk there or like lying in katil in rumah anda know right , imagine anda live to like one thousand tahun old how lemah are anda going to be how anda gon na work how anda gon na support diri anda like 
even anda have a huge like keluarga or sesuatu 
then what are anda going to do with anda hidup just sit there  whole hari and tonton t v right , anda cant even chase semua that dreams that anda wanted to when anda are younger just because of anda physical keadaan , ya and even now when orang are living a lot older than mereka are in  last masa kanan 
like ada padanya ini geriatric penyelidikan who from  universiti of glasgow , and dia already proved that even though more orang are living longer compared to thirty tahun ago now 
mereka are still living in poor kesihatan for a larger bahagian of mereka hidup maybe from like tujuh puluh to sembilan puluh as compared to like 
um twenty nine to thirty or sesuatu anda know when mereka died earlier last masa ya and also if orang live forever right 
i feel like there will be a kekurangan of pekerjaan sebab theres ini technician how are orang gon na rise up mereka jajaran if ada padanya always ini orang like old orang over there like let say anda are still able to work anda know like young orang can not 
um kemajuan and find pekerjaan if there are so many other orang working already , like ada padanya already ini masalah so i feel like itu will get worse in  masa hadapan if such as dadah is um reinforced ya is made , and also lain titik is that 
i feel like if anda have virtually endless hari like selamanya is a really long masa to think about and youll put a huge psychological ketegangan on kami cause like i feel like hidup just wouldnt be special anymore anda wont have an insentif to make hidup kiraan everyday because whats  titik right anda gon na live forever anyway orang are gon na be so bored with mereka masa like 
mereka wont know what to do so i feel like uh there will be a lot of peningkatan in isu in mental kesihatan and maybe prolonged ketidakbahagiaan and kegelisahan , include including suicide kadar cause 
if anda can live forever then how are anda going to die just kill diri anda , like i dont know ya and orang will be a lot less motivated to do apa sahaja special , since mereka always have esok to do itu so i feel like orang have a very diminished akal of tujuan and , kekurangan of pemacu to live basically 
especially after mereka get to a certain titik maybe in  mula anda like relish  thrill of itu like oh wow im so old but after a semasa saya feel like mereka will get boring sebab anda wont have apa sahaja to do ya 
anda can argue against ini first 
ya but as in yang who take itu mereka will face  masalah that saya say what 
what about  overpopulation and i feel like anda are making a lot of andaian with anda argumen as well like youre assuming that there will be other teknologi or that anda know when anda split mereka dadah then anda can live for like five or ten tahun 
but anda dont really know how true is that as well anda can not just assume from ini pernyataan that just because ini dadah is developed that 
other teknologi is developed to make other orang live a 
when mereka tipu older mereka can stay live like relatively healthy hidup and are mobile anda know 
ya but saya also feel like ini is like ini doing penyelidikan for ini is so superfluous anda know kita already have so many other perkara better perkara that anda could penyelidikan on like 
barah kita still havent really found a penyembuhan for itu anda know 
i feel like more wang can be pumped into better penyelidikan than , developing ini dadah to for orang mereka live forever , saya also feel like because ini dadah will be very difficult to develop because 
uh forever is like ya like saya said itu a very long masa to have such a powerful dadah 
so i think um if ini dadah is actually made there will be a lot of 
like there will be a have a heavy harga tag to itu due to  kesukaran in making itu , and maybe like  kebaruan surrounding  dadah as well 
so actually if anda compare between like  first and third dunia kanan 
ada padanya already a hidup jangkaan perbezaan of about tiga puluh tahun which is pretty long ya so i feel like there are a lot of masalah of ill kesihatan in underdeveloped bangsa and actually itu also related to how  developed bangsa use mereka political financial and scientific kuasa like 
i feel like kita could be doing better penyelidikan to help improve  current keadaan of kami keadaan and like orang living on earth instead of 
developing such an unnecessary and superfluous perkara just so that 
anda know a few small peratusan can take ini dadah and then maybe live forever which kita try to first like 
fix  global ketidaksamaan that already exist and put more penyelidikan and wang into perkara that a lot of orang are currently struggling with kanan now , but ada padanya still tidak absolute penyembuhan for itu 
ya 
anda can argue , 
saya said ini is a buangan of wang , because anda could put  wang to better guna 
okay but then what about  wang inside here though tidak akan itu be can itu be use for a better tujuan like itu need wang to develop ini dadah kanan 
then how is itu not mutually exclusive  wang that anda put into ini dadah should be put into other dadah instead 
ya but as in  sedang membangun ini dadah doesnt solve mana-mana masalah what 
kanan 
so like apa  titik of developing ini dadah anda know theres tidak like huge manfaat that outweighs like why kita should actually develop ini dadah 
ya but i disagree because itu not really just saya personal pandangan on hidup is like 
i feel like is not very personal that um not uh like not being able to live forever will be such a huge masalah in anda hidup anda know i just , i dont understand how orang will see itu itu cara because 
i dont know i feel like there are a lot of other masalah now like for contoh in yemen ada padanya like  kelaparan krisis anda know maybe like more wang can be put into itu into like seeing what  apa  isu there and how kita can maybe help  orang there instead of like developing ini dadah so that orang in like rich first dunia negara can live forever 
like do anda see that perbandingan i feel like ada padanya tidak perlu to develop such a dadah just because is like not really essential in kami hidup anda dont really need itu and i jangan see how seseorang would say itu a perlu like makanan and air is a perlu but living forever is not a perlu ya so i dont think anda can really see itu itu cara 
okay saya know where anda perbincangan is leading , say sesuatu sebab , if anda may say that itu gon na be very cheap in  masa hadapan then maybe a lot of orang will take itu right then itu will be , lead to  masalah of overpopulation which i already mentioned earlier , and bumi can not just hold so many orang 
ya , 
okay but i feel like kanan 
ya but for contoh if kita ya so if kita actually developed ini dadah and orang do are able to live like in other negara not negara sorry other planet 
but then like i feel like if ini is never ending right 
and for contoh anda say  dadah because murah so a lot orang will take itu then theres a lot of manusia living forever , so like ultimately will still make guna of semua  planet on  bumi 
or like at least yang that are livable in sebab saya think beberapa just tidak jirim how much  r d and penyelidikan anda do i just think itu not possible to live on like  matahari anda know cause  suhu are just so hot there , ya so i think as in i feel like in ini cara then kita just abusing  sumber that are given to kami on bumi already cause 
mm instead of just like trying to improve what kita have and  keadaan that kita have were abusing even more and like coming out of ini dadah so that orang can live forever and maybe on other planet and maybe like anda know destroy other planet , like how kita are ruining bumi 
ya lah but like what saya said even if like itu just one peratus out of seven titik eight berbilion is already a lot and seven titik eight berbilion is like  current populasi assuming ini dadah is developed like 
a lot of tahun later i think  populasi may have been higher by then already ya so anda even if ada padanya just a very small peratusan of orang taking itu like itu will still be a lot of orang 
itu will , ya i feel like gatal still contribute to  masalah a lot 
how are anda 
itu why i think itu like nearly like what two three bulan already since kita last saw masing-masing other also right 
ya saya think that was  last one itu where saya last saw anda kakak anda that was really a long masa back manusia 
ya how is dia now though

i jangan know what itu like dia if anda if like anda dont entertain dia right itu itu itu like automatically dia will come and chase after anda then kena pemukulan and semua that anda know shamini already kena so many lebam anda know 
ya 
like cubit dia anda know beat dia up then saya was like oh saya kebaikan dia never even do apa sahaja eh then saya like oh saya tuhan then but so far luckily i im still save lah like dia still nice to saya ya so itu good 
itu why i think itu like oh ya saya think technically mereka are like sepupu ah 
true itu like one is  female versi one is  male versi 
oh ya actually i agree 
oh okay what at least not so bad saya think abi is just mischievous lah itu not really villain jenis of perkara 
wah not bad ah 
oh saya tuhan i only i only can see dia like a little small bayi like so innocent like never really do apa sahaja i jangan know apa sahaja jenis of muka 
oh okay 
oh saya kebaikan 
okay lah so itu is like anda are like used to itu already lah anda can take up semua  
ya  kesakitan oh saya god poor perkara sia 
oh okay not so bad saya for saya i itu like saya felt like saya had semua ini jenis of pemukulan semua like probably a few tahun back ah i think now okay saya retired already 
ya itu a budak lelaki 
i think now should be i think wait berarak saya think dia gave kelahiran around berarak or april so anda only like few bulan only 
ya 
betul then yuthi oh saya kebaikan anda know yuthi is very rough kanan 
but okay lah to dia little abang dia very nice 
i mean mereka have to get ini lah at masa if not tidak disiplin already 
itu actually  tidak itu ah ya two gadis  mini one trishika and ya one more 
ya so yang two gadis then janani vinayan oh saya kebaikan 
itu a lot 
tidak  weird perkara is that semua of mereka are out umur itu only kita and anda semua are like around  same technically  same penjanaan jurang 
correct okay lah 
oh ya eh ini tahun dia thirty ah 
okay 
oh najis oh saya tuhan anda two more tahun to thirty 
eh anda still look like enam belas eh 
oh saya , 
actually i uh itu true lah anda look like youngest anda know anda look younger than karthik 
itu okay just take itu as a good perkara 
ya itu happens lah 
but okay lah just take itu in a good cara youll find itu good that anda can at least still get pelajar diskaun 
ya true 
sometimes anda can see  faedah of itu 
ya have anda been out though like after 
okay lah not so bad 
ya dia was highly suggesting itu dia says itu really good and actually not bad eh itu was very nice also 
ya saya think milik mereka is like a bit of different gaya of briyani itu not like really spicy jenis of apa sahaja like itu itu a more lebih ringan ya 
oh hidrida briyani uh a bit more dry kanan that one 
oh okay saya ya saya did there was one restoran in tekka that sisi lah saya went with a few kawan of tambang that or i think one tahun back ah kita went actually not bad was very nice very tasty saya think mereka beras sendiri got so much more flavour 
saya think so ya itu was behind  arked and then near  saya think yang like warga asing and semua ada padanya one tempat mereka will eat right near there but itu at  bucu 
ya correct 
but  golden batu anda talking about is like before  pengubahsuaian right  old satu 
tidak saya think that means  pengubahsuaian done already ah but ya saya tekaan because i went to  golden batu one  sebelum and after one ya saya think  one anda are talking about should be  before one or sesuatu 
oh then mereka just run around ah oh saya kebaikan 
like tidur like itu 
oh saya kebaikan  one saya think when saya went to watch a cereka at golden batu was i went with shamini lah kita went like in  tengah of  malam around like dua belas am plus ini was after  pengubahsuaian so kita went to watch ini err malay seram cereka was called  doll 
im not sure whether anda heard about itu now in netflix lah anda can go and watch itu then kita went in  tengah of  malam dua belas oclock there was tiada siapa so itu just saya and dia in  entire teater and one more malay pasangan mereka were seated at  kembali 
sial scary is like saya wanted to get out already anda know because itu was like itu ah saya for saya personally i can not uh malay seram filem like saya worst takut like when itu comes to ghost filem so itu was like in  tengah of  malam and saya think if im not wrong itu was near  hungry hantu bulan as well 
ya precisely so itu was really like out of semua  bulan anda decided to go itu hari because dia badly wanted to watch a seram cereka and saya was like  kambing hitam then kita went to watch  cereka lah but wah scary lah  pengalaman but not bad at itu masa when saya went was because just newly after pengubahsuaian so itu was jenis of okay jenis of new and semua 
should be before because after itu was like really like saya think good tempat duduk already 
oh okay but okay lah now not bad if anda go anda can consider going 
ya thats  perkara lah but come out kita can not complain lah singapura technically itu near for semuanya 
betul saya used to go there when saya was younger so for semua  tamil filem automatic yishun because saya refuse to go  rex i dont like ah that one 
ya thank thankfully now at least mereka putting in like a m k hub and like opening up in more theatre already so not so bad lah 
wah oh saya kebaikan seriously eh but fun lah 
oh saya tuhan itu like a mini berkelah in  teater not bad 
oh that one after  second separuh a filem is itu 
ya that bahagian was draggy lah but i think mereka just wanted to show like anda know theres a realiti in setiap filem aspek so probably mereka just wanted to bring itu in lah 
eh but actually dia acted well eh for  short filem itu was like very realistic 
ya anda can consider watching itu tonight , anda confirm wont penyesalan itu 
anda know whose anak or not  tidak bhagyaraj anak um 
apa dia nama shanthanu is itu 
i didnt tonton that cereka saya dont know 
ya ya so shes  so called heroin in  muzik filem video 
i uh i dont know i im not exactly sure is itu dia  koreografer but saya know dia had a bahagian in itu like dia came for  audio pelancaran semuanya 
ya saya also i wasnt too sure lah then after itu i see like dia and  isteri also posting a lot of like about  master pelancaran and barang like itu then saya was like okay maybe not bad saya think dia had a bahagian to play also lah but ini muzik filem video dia tarian for wah dia really does damn good eh 
tidak there was lain video that lain lelaki did  koreografi saya think dia followed but dia dance really well like saya think dia mereka semua learnt itu like , online so like saya think  koreografer sent dia beberapa video or sesuatu like itu then dia just like ralat follow and then dia dance lah and then itu came out like exact replika itu was like so good 
oh ya betul but ini one saya think anda can watch because um itu was a original lagu also and then  penyanyi was uh karthik 
karthik is  famous one ah from last masa dia always sing what lagu dia sang ah oh saya tuhan 
ah saya think so itu fellow  clean dicukur lelaki 
ya 
saya tidak tidak tidak not that one 
tidak not that one is  different ini lelaki oh saya tuhan dia sing dia sang semua  klasik , dia sang a lot for surya filem 
ya but ini one sahkan anda see  muka anda know one saya just cant remember what lagu dia sang 
why anda happy 
oh so anda wanted to go but didnt get  tiket 
ya itu always lags a lot then err in  penghujung saya just like okay whatever itu just not going to be saya hari 
ah ya should be 
konsert dewan is itu 
ya itu why i mean if anda lost  if anda take  wrong eskalator anda gon na head up on lain aras 
oh ya betul 
anda how many masa went there ah saya actually work there how many masa also i still get lost 
ya because like itu masa semua in  konvensyen dewan sometime mereka have , like yang bahagian masa pekerjaan and semua itu then sometime saya used to do lah but saya still get lost eventually 
yup 
ya 
oh okay itu interesting 
oh okay saya havent really like um exactly like pendekatan mana-mana perjalanan agensi for ini jenis of stuff lah usually kita just do semuanya off atas talian kita never really physically go jumpa and semua so i dont really know what happens down there 
oh eh tunggu then speaking of itu masa which negara anda went ah was snowing or sesuatu right 
what tempat was that switzerland 
mula with l 
oh like anda first hari sendiri anda semua just tembak oh saya kebaikan 
oh okay nice 
oh wow okay 
oh saya tuhan so thats how anda whole perjalanan went ah then how long were how long was anda like anda entire , perjalanan ah 
but bukan that so wasted like bukan itu too short for like finishing up five tempat 
but itu systematic lah like anda know like mereka really plan semuanya for anda so anda just follow 
is that considered expensive for itu 
itu quite expensive ah 
but at least i think if anda semua planned anda kewangan well and semua itu to go for along with , i think should be okay lah ya 
oh okay but saya think based on  negara anda went and semua itu like so far when anda plan  kewangan i think itu was quite good kanan seperti is not overly expensive or apa sahaja like itu 
ya beberapa orang speaking mereka french bahasa 
okay nice itu good 
saya think for saya is okay because like when saya was in polytechnic kanan saya took like basic french and basic Sepanyol so i did i had err written a written uji and semua that and as long as oral lah so like 
at itu titik in masa like even kami guru semua were saying that if let say anda get a peluang to go like err anda know like Perancis or spain or anda know i dont know anda get a teman lelaki there or whatever anda find anda future rakan there itu a good kemahiran to have and then err dia jenis of seperti was like um how to say like pushing itu kami lah to take up like other bahasa and semua itu so thats  masa i learnt lah then uh ever since saya have always wanted to go to like Perancis or spain but so far i didnt really get  peluang to and now is definitely not possible so hopefully by next within  next two tahun err i urus to go 
actually ya itu should be  cara lah right now like instead of just going back to  same tempat rather like use  masa to go and anda know check out a new negara or sesuatu like itu 
yang famous mercu tanda right 
oh okay eh at least anda get to see semua ini in orang eh saya only see ini in rantaian kunci eh im more pathetic anda know 
but i think itu halus because like since anda are already there youd rather just spend  wang and might as well just go and see semua ini perkara lah like kita can not think too much of  wang also 
what do anda mean like ralat fully see  artefak like what do anda mean i dont get itu 
oh saya kebaikan then anda got so much more to see 
oh okay now i understand 
is itu just walk right like setiap painting one kedua 
oh wow 
for a momen saya thought anda just going to say saya just three sixty turn around semuanya then i went to go see  other oh saya kebaikan anda actually did that 
actually i did itu once anda know err okay and recently okay not recently lah i think was back in dua puluh lapan belas or sesuatu like itu so err there was ini perjalanan saya made with ralat a few saudara of tambang so from saya keluarga was just saya 
ya so i went to err new delhi so itu was saya very first masa and then i think saya was there for about seven hari six malam if im not wrong ya and i went on nyahsetujuundo-type masa so itu like super sejuk 
ya itu was like  actually  best pemasaan to go then kita literally setiap single hari kita went to go and see new perkara and since anda are talking about muzium kanan 
uh there was one hari lah kita allocated like about separuh a hari just for muzium initially was nice like anda know when anda walk through anda see  muzium semua one by one saya was literally seeing setiap cebisan of karya seni anda know after hit about empat puluh five minit ah and then anda are just like why am i seeing  same perkara again oh saya tuhan 
ya then wah after itu saya got damn boring already but anda know just to go to  muzium sendiri because anda know delhi itu like a super huge negara semuanya must err go by kereta anda cant just take  bas or apa sahaja like itu 
ya so like  melancong to there really was taking forever and then to come back lain ambil lain forever walao 
ralat saya dont know like  keselamatan 
ya itu was a totally like one itu was like a jalan perjalanan anda know then ya kita had to cross by so many keselamatan then mereka are like stop garis for kami to like get down and semua that so kita took separuh a hari to reach there then taj mahal saya went  perkara is i expected too much for itu but in  penghujung saya went there saya was like okay saya was excited for like maybe like one jam then after that itu was like itu got jenis of bored lah anda wouldnt anda cant really stay there for too long honestly 
oh is itu like yang like um what do anda call itu ah sweater jenis ah 
oh  sweater  best 
oh saya tuhan 
aiyo so cute 
like anda know anda got watch ralat jodhaaCity in Illinois, United States palang akpaper size then mereka shot  filem at semua  fort kawasan  diraja benteng and barang saya went there also 
itu better than taj mahal 
honestly itu was better taj mahal like because saya watched  cereka lah before i went and semuanya so i could like i jenis of saya can feel lah like once anda are there actually can feel like sesuatu different than  taj mahal one was like very normal 
betul and mereka wouldnt let anda take mana-mana gambar inside also pictures or videos inside anda only can take like outer permukaan so technically what were doing is just taking  outer permukaan like anda cant do apa sahaja inside ya 
oh okay itu nice 
i mean  perkara mereka use is still a bit like um traditional jenis lah like very ya betul fahami 
oh actually itu not so bad itu actually nice like itu i mean i dont think saya can do itu for like forever but if anda ask saya to be there for beberapa like few hari ah ya like to just experience say like saya wouldnt minda lah itu cukup actually 
mm saya actually want to go back to  north sisi if saya can lah because so far north sisi delhi only i went for south sisi saya already went to like chennai ooty coimbatore 
oh ya kerala tidak mempunyai go yet have to go there also 
anda semua went to  
anda guys went to  um air bot rumah kanan 
so do anda did anda semua manage to catch 
oh saya tuhan 
oh okay eh wah not bad ah 
eh but actually nice lah ini jenis of perkara is like anda know on  spot anda can just take whatever anda want and then just ask mereka to do itu for anda 
is itu that bad 
anda scared right 
oh saya god eh but okay lah one perkara mereka makanan is damn tasty anda tidak jirim what wherever anda go itu keras to get itu jenis of makanan 
ya but now of kursus anda definitely must be much more careful already like small perkara also ah can not lah 
oh anda have to put before anda go 
then anda still can eat 
oh saya god eh actually even if saya was in anda kedudukan saya will be like tidak cara tidak saya rather kelaparan 
oh saya god itu okay 
ya then 
oh saya god eh anda luckily escape sia 
oh saya tuhan is 
wah saya tell anda 
tidak anda know why or not because sometimes when anda use mereka rambut air kanan anda realise that anda rambut will become like ralat 
ah easily very dry ya for saya itu was like itu because initially  first few hari i think first two hari i did bathe in uh normal , uh normal air is just for muka saya use  mineral one lah saya started noticing that itu got super kering and then  tekstur was so bad ya 
ruam oh saya why ah 
oh okay 
ya so itu just a normal full badan urut 
saya felt itu was better 
oh saya god itu so gross 
itu like anda need to go for yang kereta wash jenis of deep pembersihan 
like ask mereka to put anda in  laundry perkara and then full dalam pembersihan 
oh okay saya think itu like beberapa jenis of sauna kanan like to i think itu like to open up anda liang or sesuatu like itu in anda badan 
itu so scary oh saya tuhan what if itu like yang final destinasi ah like sesuatu happen ah oh saya kebaikan 
oh saya god eh saya wouldnt go sia ini jenis of perkara saya damn scared and i always like tend to overthink like shit what happens if like  mesin like short litar or what 
oh okay 
wah itu very good but i think anyway for itu cold air perkara anda were saying right because anda say anda before that anda went for  sauna so itu should be like anda know theyre opening up anda liang then usually mereka put ask anda to go for  cold pancuran and semuanya close up and tightens up anda badan 
ya i mean uh bo pian lah ini jenis of perkara what to do 
uh that helps a lot actually itu helps a lot 
i think itu manja or sesuatu like itu so anda have to use like a uh mesin in  pagi like oh six am saya wake up  whole jubin is like so cold and then ill go to  pancuran know ill be  first one to shower and somehow i jangan know why im so unlucky everytime  first one to shower come out cold air 
and then is like anda know anda tidak pakaian and semuanya so  pancuran hits anda like oh najis saya was freezing like neraka 
ya saya think itu  penjana ya betul 
ya correct then anda didnt know 
oh let saya guess anda were trying to wash anda kaki and then  air hit anda 
ya sometimes im very forgetful and itu happens also to saya at masa 
oh saya god itu so bad anda rumah one itu not like itu kanan 
ya actually mine also ours was is considered old also but then because kita change semua  paip semuanya 
err quite a few tahun back lah then mereka automatically give  satu with  big pancuran kepala and semuanya 
betul 
ya 
oh okay not so bad lah 
oh itu weird 
okay then that makes akal 
oh okay 
ya i remember that 
ya actually at malam especially 
oh saya tuhan 
itu why i think mereka didnt fikir of itu also lah but a lot of rumah now like that anda know 
correct lor itu why must be extra careful 
when anda are looking for anda new rumah also please be careful 
oh okay then mm 
better to be safe than maaf 
ya true lah 
ya actually tidak lah saya also dont really like ini jenis of perkara im going to find really a proper safe persekitaran ya

dia singapore warganegara but dia gave up  kewarganegaraan because dia kerja semua was like permanently there and semua so ya

okay then thats itu ya terima kasih 
debat tajuk three 
okay so  soalan is does modern teknologi satisfy kami wants rather than kami keperluan and saya berdiri is tidak modern teknologi memuaskan satisfies kami keperluan rather than kami wants 
so i believe that modern teknologi is sesuatu that is needed rather than a mewah 
so i would like to illustrate saya titik in terma of modern medical teknologi so i mentioned earlier that kita have modern medical teknologi like which helps in pembangunan of perkara like vaksin and vaksin are definitely a perlu Kini 
as anda can see kita have evolving virus like covid sembilan belas and so on so definitely vaksin is a perlu and to develop vaksin kita need modern medical teknologi and then at  same masa kita also have perkara like uh 
prostetik three d printing to create like three d organ and then semua ini perkara are brought about by kami modern teknologi 
and semua ini perkara like prostetik three d organs mereka are definitely a perlu to pesakit who are deprived of mereka hidup fungsi anda cant say that itu is a mahu for mereka because then anda will be saying that itu a mewah for mereka to wish to go back to mereka normal hidup fungsi so i believe is definitely a perlu 
so that orang who are deprived of normal hidup fungsi mereka can go on with mereka usual hidup and then kita also have perkara like um x sinar c t imbasan and semua ini is definitely a perlu when kami doktor wants to identify penyakit 
and so on and then uh next 
if kita deviate away from  modern medical teknologi titik then kita have perkara like komunikasi and teknologi is definitely a perlu where kita want to communicate with a kawan or a loved satu who is like 
far away in lain negara and so on because anda cant possibly expect kami to communicate using perkara like huruf and so on jadi for kami to communicate with seseorang who is far away modern teknologi is definitely a perlu kita need platform like skype zum 
through  komputer riba to keep in sentuh with seseorang who is far away 
so definitely itu a perlu and then in ini umur saya would like to say that modern teknologi is a perlu for pendidikan so ini is especially true for uni pelajar where semua pelajaran bahan are online so 
i jangan think that sesiapa sahaja can say that itu is a mahu or itu is a mewah because what if for contoh now i tell saya kawan to okay anda dont get a komputer riba anda just anda know go through anda four or three tahun of uni using pen and Kertaspaper size 
itu will be impossible because setiap uni pelajar would own a komputer riba or at least a tablet or beberapa isih 
sebab itu is definitely needed for mereka to get through mereka pendidikan 
so definitely itu a perlu and then last 
titik is that uh 
um saya believe that modern teknologi is a perlu in  working dunia hari ini because kita will need to communicate with klien and then kita also need modern teknologi for  storan of data so yup 
i conclude that modern teknologi is itu definitely satisfy kami keperluan rather than wants because a lot of kami daily hidup fungsi nowadays itu depends on modern teknologi so itu in ini umur and masa itu is no longer a mahu but a perlu 
okay tunggu tunggu so anda are saying that modern teknologi is not itu memuaskan kami okay anda are saying that modern teknologi is not really a perlu for orang like need so i think kami sebab and kesan is different here so what im saying that 
okay anda are saying that more uh 
okay anda sebab and kesan is for perlu for orang like nick modern teknologi is more of a mahu rather than a perlu since Gelaran can adapt but saya titik and saya sebab and kesan is different from anda so saya titik is that 
modern teknologi is a perlu because itu should always be there to allow orang who are deprived of normal hidup fungsi to itu should always be there to allow ini orang a peluang to go back to mereka normal hidup 
regardless of whether anda are born with itu regardless of whether anda can adapt to itu or not itu is a perlu to be there itu needs to be there so that for sesiapa sahaja who wants to regain mereka normal hidup fungsi mereka can do itu mereka have  harapan mereka have  peluang to do itu so 
saya think kami um how do i put itu kami sebab and kesan is different here so youre starting titik is that uh orang like nick for orang like nick itu is a mahu is not need 
but saya titik is that itu is a perlu because itu must be there for sesiapa sahaja who wants to lead a healthy gaya hidup to lead a normal gaya hidup so 
ya okay never mind , i dont know if like 
kita are on  same halaman but ya that itu saya titik itu itu is a perlu because itu is important itu as important as kami saya would say as important as kami hidup 
given  jumlah of perkara that modern medical teknologi can do nowadays so itu not just  perkara about anda know normal hidup fungsi itu also concerns kami hidup so i mentioned earlier kita have perkara like three d organ and i think i read somewhere that um 
okay im not sure but three d organ basically what were talking here is not kami anggota badan but kami organ which is definitely needed for kami to continue living anda know and not dead so definitely itu a perlu for saya 
so and back to  titik about anda mentioned  anggota badan whether anda can adapt or not i dont think  titik here is whether anda can adapt or not 
itu should whether anda adapt or not itu should be there 
to allow sesiapa sahaja who wants to go back to mereka hidup fungsi to have  peluang to do so 
okay anda mentioned  perkara about plastik pembedahan and orang wanting to look uh Lebih cantik and perkara like itu kanan but okay if kita look if anda look at itu from a different titik of paparan 
maybe kita can say that im saying maybe ah maybe anda can say itu is a perlu because itu allows mereka to live mereka hidup confidently and mereka feel fulfilled with mereka hidup so then if anda look at itu ini cara if  orang is happy with itu then 
can itu cant itu be seen as a perlu for mereka if 
mereka want to anda know um go on with mereka hidup confidently if mereka want to feel even more fulfilled 
or even for mereka kerja because anda mentioned  perkara about idola and perkara like itu kanan so for mereka mereka kelihatan is definitely mereka definitely need to look good looking good is a keperluan to mereka so maybe to mereka uh perhaps kita can say that 
plastik modern teknologi like plastik pembedahan 
can possibly be a perlu to mereka because mereka pekerjaan actually depends 
on how good mereka look so at  penghujung of  hari itu can become a perlu anda know if mereka want to get in  high gaji and barang like ini if mereka want to become more popular and perkara like itu because uh 
i think kita have to agree that in  hiburan industri looks is one of  most important perkara along with anda bakat so 
actually theres okay ini might be a bias but there okay if anda are let say if anda are mereka are saying that looks is  most important perkara in  whole industri but ini might 
be a bias so maybe i just say a few contoh so kita can have idola who are very talented or let say mereka work very hard but then if anda are not good looking when anda go up to  pentas tidak satu is going to turn mereka perhatian to anda so 
at  penghujung of  hari anda kelihatan is still  most important itu what orang notice first when mereka see anda 
itu forms a false kesan of whether like anda want to support ini orang or not whether anda want to continue watching  t v program or not so i would say that itu is a perlu for orang whose hidup mereka mata pencaharian bergantung on mereka 
penampilan so 
uh maybe i tekaan itu depends on  konteks so itu is a perlu for maybe orang who 
become disfigured mereka in through kemalangan through like api and so on and mereka want to go back to mereka normal hidup 
and also a perlu possibly a perlu for selebriti whose mata pencarian depends a lot on mereka penampilan but ini may be a bias but i feel that Kini looks is actually  most important perkara kita can have orang who are super good at singing but mereka are not popular because 
mereka tipu mereka dont have  karisma mereka dont have  penampilan to draw orang in to continue supporting mereka so i feel that looks is definitely important and definitely a keperluan to mereka so but itu might be a bias but thats what saya feel  konteks is generally nowadays 
okay so 
mm 
itu depends on  konteks okay but uh okay so a lot of perkara like kita mentioned earlier like  modern teknologi like plastik pembedahan komputer semua ini depends a lot on konteks but 
but do anda agree that modern teknologi in terma of modern medical teknologi itu is a perlu or does itu still depend on  konteks 
bahagian three negative pengalaman in hidup 
so 
so far do anda have mana-mana negative pengalaman , in anda hidup ya of kursus lah semua have mereka negative , pengalaman ah 
ya being 
like not appreciated also lah that one also like 
human make silap what 
ya but  perkara i dont like , about anda mm is like when orang promise anda sesuatu then anda know 
mereka never fulfil itu 
same goes if kita promise kami kanak-kanak sesuatu kita have to fulfill 
if not mereka will feel like anda know oh mummy is not keeping to dia janji 
so itu makes also mereka demoralised so same goes to working hidup also lah 
ya itu work thats hidup of a working itu working , 
working hidup lah anda know anda cant go away from politik 
okay lah whatever is just think positively also lah okay anyway lets uh , kongsi kami pengalaman kami unfortunate pengalaman ah peristiwa that happened to kami when kita were overseas , sesuatu that kita cant forget , 
ya actually , 
everytime when sesuatu happen right to anda 
sesuatu bad lah berlaku to anda hidup ah , then usually sesuatu bad again and itu , other perkara will still go wrong anda know 
like for kami right first i think kita were kita when kita were in paris ah 
 m r t stesen saya tell anda 
itu ya train stesen , kita thought that singapura usually anda know peak tempoh wah itu so bad anda know but i tell anda 
saya think orang bujang if mereka were to go to mereka kereta api stesen paris train stesen mereka would appreciate singapura more which kita are actually , 
itu so packed like sardin 
and then what happen ah oh actually kita i , kita i nearly lost saya mum ah 
because kita thought that dia didnt follow kami from behind where kita exit  
 kereta api kita go out from  kereta api 
ya i tell anda 
ya but eventually lucky perkara is actually dia came out with kami but itu just that kita turned right dia turned left , 
okay that one is one perkara lah happen so after itu 
ya thats  perkara 
tidak that i mean ini perkara happened is uh ini perkara already bad perkara already happened , so after itu straight away is in just  same hari and then perkara happen so , 
uh 
sames ya lah same 
ya 
then kita , get to realise itu paris has lot of pickpocket , 
mereka really pro ah 
packed sardine tempat , 
but really eh not semua can do itu ah mereka are really mereka must be very pro about itu to really do itu 
because anda poket anda seluar poket is quite deep also right as anda when anda check ah 
hmm mm 
and kita saw itu kita saw mereka everywhere ah i mean kita saw  pickpocket , 
of going there , ya 
itu really when uh an , 
unfortunate peristiwa that really happened during kami , 
perjalanan ah mm 
so far lah ini is  only that 
really kita can not , 
lupa kita can not forget 
ya 
maybe too many perkara happening 
ya that one is hmm most important 
from there anda realise itu singapura is  most safest negara lah 
ya a lot of perkara to be done ah 
ya 
orh saya see ya itu semua oh tidak itu in london 
ya hello mm hello can hear ah 
kay la so because of itu anda know , semuanya menjadi , negative kita become negative also and then anda know kita go for percutian out of , i mean kita become angry most of kami become angry because of  keadaan 
so far what other negative perkara ah uh basically mm 
ya so what else can i say about negative perkara maybe about saya sendiri lah ah negative perkara what ah 
saya have ini like so call , 
o c d thingy , 
but itu only applies when 
when itu comes to makanan 
know where saya can not see makanan 
anda have to itu just a saya tabiat lah if saya kanak-kanak or saya suami or sesiapa sahaja in saya keluarga , which is of kursus berlaku in saya rumah ah 
must clean  mereka  jadual after 
eating sebab saya cant lihat 
makanan 
anda know 
makanan zarah or what left on table sebab is because ya 
mana-mana sweet perkara lah sebab is itu semua because of i jangan want semut to , 
ya 
correct lah but  not good bahagian is like orang will think that oh saya tuhan 
ini , ini gadis ini wanita ah so 
ya 
lah on but on  positive sisi also have lah because anda know why positive sisi as anda rumah will be clean semua  masa 

ya but that perkara mereka can make saya disgusting anda know like ini can disgust saya 
so basically for diri anda what can disgust anda for saya is  semut bahagian lah i dont want manis 
perkara to be on  jadual everywhere 
to prevent  semut from what about anda do anda have apa sahaja that disgust anda 
orh hes not ah mm 
mm anda should itu so good itu good contoh actually 
tidak dia should show good contoh by anda 
ya itu actually a worrying lah ini covid thingy right but important is  kerajaan should do a 
uh ya mmhmm so for so far 
kebimbangan and kegelisahan 
so actually because of ini covid perkara also kita are also worried lah and , kita do have beberapa Kebimbangan 
where kita are thinking will itu happen for long will itu gon na be like ini for long 
how long more 
hopefully theres tidak second gelombang ah 
i mean for singapura so far still in kawalan lah so far 
ya but  perkara is tidak but  perkara is actually  best is singapore not to accept mana-mana foreign 
not warga asing lah foreign pengembara 
ya sometime ini perkara also can be , uh detected later bahagian 
adhere to  peraturan lah mm mmhmm 
mm just rerun of kawan and big bang teori 
mm not yet why is itu good what is itu about 
bunyi like a good tunjuk leh 
maybe i give itu a tembak 
what else do anda think about often black 
okay terima kasih 
uh by  cara uh what do anda think saya should prepare now while waiting for a full masa kerja 
okay saya tekaan sakit prepared that where do i find ini jenis of sampel 
okay sure then if i prepare temu ramah pakaian what do i perlu to wear blazer and tali leher 
maybe ill try find 
ya lah hopefully sesuatu will turn up lah after  after semua  aplikasi 
okay lah okay i take nota oh ya by  cara then that masa uh besides from orphan black that masa saya saw anda watching one tunjuk at netflix uh what were anda watching 
like oren is  new black 
is itu a u s tunjuk 
wang pusaka next musim coming up by  cara musim five 
oh ya kingdom  zombie korean siri 
interesting 
maybe later i see uh who are  pelakon 
not particular but saya know beberapa of mereka 
tidak akan say favourite but i think itu not bad but overall itu overrated 
i mean ini is just saya pendapat saya think that is  most overrated uh hot najis on netflix orang are comparing ini to breaking bad like seriously 
idea like  idea of  pusaka is pretty good saya will give mereka but  few episod were quite intriguing and thats what got saya hooked but itu went menurun after few episod  menulis is just i dont know lazy  aksara pembangunan was good but for a few episod after itu itu just like pengisi selepas itu 
setiap aksara in  tunjuk is absolutely stupid even  profesor right why would anda tell angel where anda hangar is 
like itu was absolutely unnecessary and could have made mereka operasi like better and smoother 
in fakta setiap tindakan by  profesor was quite 
silly why go to  sekerap halaman and risiko being seen by potential saksi then could have sent  serb to burn  kereta for anda why even go bincang to  pemeriksa at  kafe in  first tempat itu just asking for masalah and raquel finally puts semuanya together because dia saw a brown helai of rambut on  profesor sut like really like so many other red bendera and  brown helai of rambut was what gave dia away like really like among semua  perkara like itu was  most easiest petunjuk 
i mean ini is just lazy writing to saya but seriously  drama and shit if semua  tebusan that could have been solved if mereka offered semua one million euro from 
mereka to go in kembali for cooperating but then  polis keselamatan pengawal also locked up in  ruang bawah tanah mereka could just let mereka go in  permulaan 
mereka couldve saved oslo and avoided  letupan but semuanya is just so messy like  only tebusan that elevated was  duta s anak perempuan anyway i mean ini tunjuk is overrated and stupid saya can see why orang compare itu to breaking bad mereka have such bad rasa but why need professional pengkritik to  hakim of what cereka tunjuk are good or not i mean ya itu saya itu just saya ah two sen of itu 
i mean itu ended already right or is itu still on 
i tidak think about itu didnt cross saya minda but 
usually where should i buy i mean if itu a good potong jualan like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or 
okay maybe i check that out ah but are anda buying apa sahaja 
oh serious ah are anda buying 
oh ya then uh alesya , belated birthday perayaan are anda getting dia apa sahaja 
ya but azam bukan dia too young to ride already 
okay lah if anda buying make sure anda check semuanya first before anda purchase ah 
if anda gave dia  anda going to get dia into joined to persaingan or what oh 
actually ive been thinking about itu but im not too sure should i further saya kajian 
but then now masa are hard what if i dont get yang jenis of kerja 
saya will think about itu lah i mean itu not that cheap itu not expensive but right now i barely will have full masa kerja but 
what anda say is quite true lah darjah is important ill think about itu lah 
but then i jangan know asking saya kawan mereka say beberapa of mereka 
just uh rather just take darjah then find a kerja but Kini degree uh sorry darjah pemegang that just siswazah also can not fine kerja so i jangan think theres a perbezaan between diploma pemegang and darjah 
i mean right now masa are really bad so actually quite impossible to get 
a permanent full masa kerja to saya ya 
ya like less than ten 
and majoriti of mereka are just doing full masa then only a minoriti are doing like bahagian masa darjah while working full masa and beberapa of mereka only one or two because of mereka are in  uniform kumpulan there are in uh in there mereka get  ikatan and barang like itu 
ya i mean like for contoh saya kawan kerja at gulungan royce mereka get sponsored lah 
like ya first at first paid for dia diploma then after dia long istilah kontrak and barang like itu dia wanted to further kajian then because of dia good kelakuan and semuanya mereka 
able to land dia a darjah also mereka willing to pay for anda darjah then dia continue dia ikatan with  syarikat ah saya mean 
uh usually been there for at least five tahun ya dia salary bom went up a lot but i mean considering dia uh when dia joined  syarikat dia only got higher nitec then after itu when anda join dia continue with  ikatan then mereka continue dia kajian with uh a bahagian masa diploma then dia manage to get then dia keep increasing so at  same masa also dia kedudukan also went up not too high but above purata 
uh dia is under penyelenggaraan sisi and technician uh if im not wrong uh under  enjin sisi 
bangunan and anda know testing and barang like itu from what saya know lah 
as much as saya would but saya diploma bukan under kejuruteraan tambang is under i t so itu cukup off i mean considering most of mereka 
im not too sure if mereka need mana-mana i t pakar or whatever because 
 syarikat is quite well known so im pasti in a cara mereka got 
anda know like sumber to who to hire as ever that i mean considering dirinya 
already duduk at  syarikat quite long so i think  orang there are quite anda know long istilah perkhidmatan saya think 
but i jangan know lah saya mean 
lain kawan of tambang dia signed on as uh penjara warden ya uh dia is dia tandatangan on for saya think five tahun five or ten tahun  ikatan then 
uh  manfaat anda get a rumah nearby dia tempat kerja uh at just besides changi penjara so 
in a cara beneficial for dia lah dont need to stress about anda know buying b t o membida and barang like itu so everythings in tempat ah for dia 
if im not wrong ah 
oh uh dia was saya rakan sekelas in poli so kita kedua-duanya have diploma ya hes a lelaki 
ya and if im not wrong last saya saw dia dia rank up again 
if im not wrong ya but what i didengar is that 
mereka can anda know mereka can rent uh not sure if mereka can rent  tempat or what because saya heard beberapa mereka uh mereka do beberapa pelaburan makna mereka stay at  kuarters but then mereka buy b t o flat but then uh mereka rent out so itu either mereka rent out mereka kuarters or mereka rented  h d b mereka bought if im not wrong lah 
ya if im not if im not wrong five or ten tahun ah that one im not too sure but i think dia is sticking to diploma only kita call 
ya itu seems like itu i mean itu depends i tekaan sebab even now like anda know  jenama decathlon ya saya kawan dia works there then uh dia told saya about  manfaat uh when dia just join full masa mereka even uh give anda uh manfaat like continuing anda kajian to pay for itu and stuff like itu ya even uh 
lain kawan of tambang uh dia works at pengembaraan h q if im not wrong itu in cas of yang anda know rock climbing aktiviti at  new khatib rumah t n s ya dia told saya about itu 
mereka also provide err anda to anda know encourage anda to further anda kajian but 
if anda have only higher nitec then anda ask anda to , mereka will encourage anda and itu depends on anda kelakuan lah but and semua ya 
err pengembaraan h q tidak itu is itu not jenama itu more of like a syarikat in cas of uh kecergasan and wellness sesuatu like itu like anda know  new ya itu not retail ya dia is going to continue next tahun ya because dia just join  syarikat eh not degree diploma maaf if im not wrong dia told saya that ralat 
 syarikat will pay until dia finish dia kajian ya but then itu not like a ikatan but itu sesuatu like a ikatan that means dia have to stay under  syarikat until anda get a diploma sesuatu like itu if im not wrong in a cara i mean itu not that i dont want but ya itu  penghujung of tahun so itu quite hard for saya to get a kerja 
ya i mean itu penghujung of  tahun so hardly syarikat are hiring usually mereka hire like anda know  bermula of  tahun so ya im not 
okay saya mean ya lah just help saya out if saya need 
fourth nyahsetujuundo-type dia 
uh fourth nyahsetujuundo-type ha 
ya dia replied after anda told saya anda send to dia already i already texted dia saying that i send saya sambung semula and dia replied saying that dia will get back to saya by next minggu so ya itu by via whatsapp 
uh dia told saya err what dia experienced before is that sometimes itu takes a semasa for mereka to get back ya because uh dia worked under itu syarikat when dia was intern and also when dia graduated oh dia also has degree by  cara 
uh kimia sains makna saya think ralat 
in terma of kimia ya uh right now shes just like saya waiting for but ya dia still searching for anda but  only cons is that 
 only kejatuhan about dia is that dia graduated earlier ini tahun so itu been quite a semasa lah ya because dia was look dia wants to work in  makmal but then most of mereka offer dia like jurong pulau that jenis of perkara that kongsi more of like 
uh exposed to outside bahan kimia dia rather do lab pengujian and barang like itu but then right now i think itu quite ketat for mereka to hire new orang because of covid and barang 
dia graduated from n t u if im not wrong 
saya basikal what anda mean 
mm saya rancang is i send  penutup set to spray to change to be  only warna in singapura and after itu 
ah that one saya settled already so next is to 
to not say overhaul saya enjin but 
in a cara to mereka call itu up spec makna to make itu faster so right now itu still under testing itu already done by ada padanya beberapa a bit of loose penghujung to need to figure out whats  masalah and barang 
ya in a cara 
ya kedua-duanya actually 
ya in a cara dia told saya to test pemacu first then at  same masa 
uh tested but then havent tested like full on  jalan like really try to get top kelajuan and barang like itu 
ya saya rancang to use itu i hope to get semuanya done before penghujung of nyahsetujuundo-type because saya really want to use itu basikal 
a s a p and  same masa to use itu on new tahun countdown dont know if there will be a new tahun countdown also 
tidak like to see bunga api and barang but at  same masa able to take foto with saya basikal and with  bunga api at  latar belakang but dont even know if ada padanya a 
im not too sure i tidak looking forward to itu because when i penyelidikan atas talian itu was not much an pilihan so at same masa 
with  ketegasan of covid going on and stuff so pretty much and ive seen beberapa orang who went for staycation oh saya tuhan  baris gilir saya cant even take itu i cant even be patient when queueing up to enter  pusat membeli-belah doing  safe masukan what else with saya going to staycation i think ill go bonkers with itu 
ya  sarapan mereka waited so long and mereka have to queue outside  hotel so anda tell saya anda think saya will want to wait 
saya saw itu on tiktok 
seseorang did like a ulasan like 
anda know is ini hotel worth itu but then ya so mereka showed majoriti of itu is at  bad sisi of itu because theres so much orang mereka check in from two p m itu became 
up to four p m so 
just to check itu sendiri is really orang queuing until outside of  hotel already so thats how bad itu is i cant ingat saya forgot if im not wrong was itu konkrit 
or sesuatu like itu 
dia kerja is basically ah what saya know is related to dia kursus so for dia dia has  upper tangan tambang is more on rangkaian and penghala and semuanya like coding programming semuanya itu basically like how youre using anda telefon right now ah ya saya do itu jenis of kerja behind  adegan 
i think should be kontrak kakitangan ya very beneficial 
um maybe lah i tekaan see how 
saya mean first pilihan would be 
p u b second s m r t then third maybe i want to try back saya old intern syarikat ya 
im not too sure but i can maybe ask  h r sebab saya still have dia kenalan so maybe saya can ask dia about itu ya i fikir should be  same lah but im not too sure if  syarikat is still going on or not because theyre small uh m n c syarikat so 
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because mereka are just basically sub com so ya okay then 
sesuatu to do with like 
tempat letak kereta and barang like itu like shes  overview like  mata of itu behind semua  kamera sesuatu like not really i wouldnt want to sit behind a komputer for like eight jam and barang 
ya saya tekaan saya mean for now might as well just take whatever itu open up for saya lah 
oh ya saya wouldnt mind saya semua saya kawan kerja just behind kami rumah and dia says just like five minit away from kami ya i mean 
uh jurutera but ya lah saya mean tidak akan uh tidak akan know if  syarikat needs i t or what but from  lihat of itu for dia sisi under jurutera 
dia working jadualkan is quite okay ada padanya work hidup imbangan there dia starts kerja at six forty five penghujung at two forty five ya so basically technically anda got  whole hari to yourself in  penghujung 
considering dia working there dia told saya that dia can everyday can 
uh if anda want to o t anda can so ya when i didengar dia 
itu just lain few more jam so okay what 
im not too sure considering shesCity in Illinois, United States quite picky and dia always like to take dia abang and kakak mainan so 
ya but i jangan know i mean if want to talk about pakaian dia ibu always buy for dia lot and lot of pakaian i saya sendiri also dont know what else to get dia 
oh ya by  cara that anda basikal 
what anda gon na do with itu are anda gon na change  penutup ditetapkan or are anda just gon na leave itu like itu 
x one r 
ya saya thought itu under anda nama 
uh there are demo too young because 
alamak 
oh itu masa dia ask saya err dia asked saya that uh how much saya earned when saya do foodpanda and ambil and barang like itu 
because dia scheduled somehow 
so i told dia like roughly lah how much saya earn then dia was shocked i earn sometimes i earned as uh much more than dia monthly but i told dia lah 
saya told dia ah that masa saya hit about uh four ribu plus 
and dia said dia was shocked ah saya bayar 
was higher than dia then tell dia lah but i kerja until i want to die like itu 
orang always think doing penghantaran easy but itu not necessary so like ya saya was telling dia  pros and cons beberapa of  venue are very slow then have to anda know  cuaca in singapura is always unpredictable kadang-kadang itu rains sometimes itu hot sometimes itu kedua-duanya 
saya told dia lah to think twice but i told dia itu okay to do for bahagian masa for side pendapatan but i tell dia lah 
dia used for itu okay for anda to use to go back and kehabisan for from kerja 
if anda want to use for penghantaran 
im not too sure lah because hes riding a penggerai so anda know with back penghantaran and kakitangan in  tinggi of  basikal 
anda know and ya at  same masa scrambler  pilih up is very strong so im takut if dia and yang like sup or apa sahaja might spill or what 
then i told dia lah 
up to twenty one dolar when saya do penghantaran because like anda know per tertib is less than one jam so 
and i told dia ah i itu not everyday is sunday so dia has to be patient with itu lah 
ya im also confused because 
before dia rides 
extra four hundred which is owned by kami ayah dia already ride d r z so dia sold itu off then after itu kami ayah kasihan dia and give dia one of dia basikal 
but then now dia suddenly want to buy dia own basikal so im quite confused 
then dia was shocked lah saya say tidak lah because dia didnt pemikiran dia would do anda would do itu jenis of kerja i mean im shocked lah dia judge but whatever lah i mean 
i mean anda just want to try only what then and then i told dia lah 
like itu semua up to individual lah i mean semua 
saya tell dia what semua anda three younger adik beradik semua got do penghantaran only anda never do 
too many orang tertib online so 
ya was itu beberapa bubble teh kedai 
uh saya told dia uh 
when  video but mereka can remember anda muka if orang take itu closely to anda muka lah 
uh was that even though itu hujan and barang now roo 
rooCity in Minnesota, United States is so good because mereka give without teragak-agak mereka know itu been raining mereka add more additional wang like anda know per docket uh add lain three dolar or four dolar ya mereka add lain extra surcaj for anda know for penunggang so to saya itu reasonable lah because 
while mereka ride in  hujan 
mereka know itu is worth itu because  jumlah mereka add on is 
oh okay lah maybe i see about itu 
but okay lah i mean i wouldnt complain already lah i mean as long as  pasaran is good already lah because panda right now sometimes  sistem cock up mereka send from one penghujung to lain penghujung and then  docket mereka say 
uh now uh based on jarak but  jarak still omong kosong and  docket is still crack so i dont get what panda is doing a lot of orang are complaining but at mereka same masa 
kita ya but itu not that kita have a pilihan because even if mengadu also and of ini after itu to change  harga 
ya because saya saw that masa when saya sent to hougang pusat membeli-belah 
biasa clothes  laksana like mereka are c i d but actually mereka are just grab penguat kuasa i dont get 
why and while saya one of saya kawan who is a good gadis who do grab for menyeronokkan then i uh dia ride but dia put under but err basikal ya dia did same like anda but 
saya told dia lah ah mereka theres cons doing that because if anda get catched and stuff like itu semalam that anda might get banned and stuff then dia said anda tell saya lah whats  logik behind ini ambil enforcers oh i mean im working what but at  same masa itu doesnt make akal because anda catch saya anda ban saya from kerja but then anda never tell saya that 
when saya was applying for itu like at  h q and barang so 
itu like to saya itu like anda in a cara anda con orang anda know like just not wearing a baju 
anda can get banned and at  same masa if 
anda are not using  beg anda can get somehow like demerit titik or sesuatu like itu so to dia dia say lah like 
oh is itu like itu masa came up on selat masa  one fourteen tahun old fifteen kanak-kanak panggilan using ambil aplikasi saying 
but itu unfair what i mean anda already delivered until anda take from  kedai and then mereka complain so grab is basically pelanggan perkhidmatan friendly and not rider friendly ah wah that menghisap 
ya okay 
bahagian one kewangan , 
okay , 
okay um so uh amirah sakit first um 
tanya anda if anda have mana-mana penjimatan akaun and if anda do why not anda just kongsi with saya 
oh 
tunggu so um is ini beberapa jenis of a joint akaun or what 
or itu just like solely for anda 
oh and then anda said that anda can only use anda can not use itu unless itu kecemasan so anda telling saya that semua  wang that anda have collected , since anda were young anda have not been using itu ah 
oh okay , 
saya only have like tidak saya only have debit kad saya dont think im sedia to have i jangan think saya have that , saya have a stable pendapatan to have a kredit kad , so  debit kad that saya use um 
saya have three uh one o c b c one is  d b s  ,  ghairah card  one saya think um saya think most orang bujang have then one more is  youtrip , i dont know if  youtrip is considered as  debit kad lah saya think itu is lah , ah anda ever heard of youtrip 
i think i oh anda never heard ah okay saya think i shared to anda before  purple warna , then anda can like use itu in multiple negara 
did i beritahu anda that 
ya so that is  three kad that im using lah basically 
so 
ah ya do anda have 
anda own debit akaun ya debit 
mm uh , 
i think kita ever had ini perbualan before 
then i think i if im not wrong saya jawab was tidak ya saya jawab was tidak i think  sebab why because 
saya own personal , ah saya dont im not a kipas of joint akaun because 
i saya own personal perbelanjaan right im not i dont like when doesnt jirim if itu saya pasangan or saya keluarga ahli or sesiapa sahaja lah who im having a joint akaun with , 
um mereka can see  transaksi mereka can see what im perbelanjaan on 
so i think itu one of  um what anda call itu  one of  
uh cons of having for saya lah cons of having a joint akaun because mereka can see anda transaksi akaun and semua anda perbelanjaan 
are semua lutsinar , so i dont uh i dont like itu idea what about anda 
so anda telling saya that anda just mentioned that if a newly 
married pasangan itu not encouraged or advisable to open up a joint akaun betul 
so im assuming that if let say anda are newly married or anda just got married anda do not plan to have a joint akaun with anda pasangan 
oh okay fahami 
mm , 
okay for saya i 
but so right now right jangan mind saya asking do anda actually have a joint akaun with anda maybe anda ibu or anda keluarga ahli oh anda do have who are anda have a joint akaun with who 
ah okay ya 
same ah actually saya also have a joint akaun with saya ibu but  most like , i think  frustrating bahagian is that i tidak dapat take  wang then im like oh , anda see theres a lot but saya just can not take itu 
mm okay um , 
so when anda get married anda have a anak , 
so what do anda think like  umur where a anak should have dia or dia own a t m kad 
like anda know  mereka own bank akaun 
what do anda think is like  ideal umur 
mm ya of kursus lah mm mm , 
for saya um i jangan have 
an ideal umur for a anak should be given a t m kad saya dont think umur really determine if a anak is suitable , to have an a t m kad saya think itu more 
of mereka , uh how mereka 
keputusan membuat are like anda know if theyre responsible keputusan pembuat then 
uh saya do consider itu lah and then also , kita are coming at  umur of uh at  umur uh kita are coming in ini digital era , where semuanya is where orang are not using tunai Kini orang are more towards  anda know  q r code  paynow  paylah semua ini , uh alternatif for anda to 
to make transaksi that doesnt require tunai so i think itu good to introduce , um a anak 
i jangan think at sedemikian a young umur lah i think uh maybe in secondary sekolah to introduce mereka in ini kewangan um ini kewangan tajuk like 
anda know uh teaching mereka about  asas of , um anda know kredit debit uh transaksi how  kad is being used how q r kod is being used i mean nowadays kanak-kanak at  umur of , 
what uh 
seven primary sekolah already have a telefon 
so 
um to educate a anak on 
 cara kita use uh on  cara kita make transaksi also is quite important lah so 
sakit say if , if mereka are a responsible keputusan pembuat 
and uh i fikir and saya also believe that saya anak is uh anda know itu masa for anda to 
learn how to make uh to have a bank akaun so 
saya just 
i mean tidak saya just allow mereka lah to give  to have a bank akaun so i hope anda get what im trying to say because saya 
ya 
anda do right , okay so uh 
between cashback titik and batu right what jenis of kredit kad should orang be using 
mm , 
oh okay saya see , i think saya also agree with anda lah when anda mention about  batu i think itu more for  
uh 
orang who travel frequently lah anda know because personally i dont travel frequently so having a , having a kredit kad that has  ini batu perkara saya dont think itu cukup reasonable for saya to have one lah but i think for kami kedua-duanya right kita are young right um and for i am quite 
uh 
uh saya want perkara uh how to say ah , uh 
like for kami kedua-duanya right saya think kita prefer cashback saya dont know if anda do anda prefer cashback 
ya 
ya saya forgot cashback also i think in  akal where , because itu tunai anda know itu wang anda know itu not like titik anda have to collect saya have to collect kumpulkan and then i can like anda know , so i im not a kipas of itu ah ya saya want tunai oops semua tunai itu what i want 
tidak lah i mean im too young to have a pinjaman from  bank lah itu , 
i mean i dont take pelajar pinjaman also 
because um being paid by mendaki lah i think kita kedua-duanya also paid by mendaki , so kita literally go to sekolah for free kanan saya mean saya go to sekolah for free 
so um , but saya keluarga ahli saya ibu anda know um when anda want to buy a rumah anda have to 
take bank pinjaman semua ini jenis of perkara 
anda know ya so i 
so getting a pinjaman for saya personally i feel like itu going to be like , a bebanan in anda bahu , in a long masa lah anda know in ten or twenty tahun masa anda have do anda , itu like 
malay orang call itu hutang lah hutang yes anda are in hutang ya because when i borrow kawan , when saya borrow wang from saya kawan right and i dont pay mereka back right , i have ini akal of like um ,  perasaan of like oh saya tuhan , dont know how to say lah , like anda are in hutang and then anda 
i jangan know lah but saya i believe anda understand where im coming from 
mm 
ya but i jangan have mana-mana pengalaman in getting pinjaman saya dont think anda have also pengalaman in getting pinjaman do anda 
mmhmm mm , 
tunggu maaf let saya stop right there anda 
did anda just say anda didnt know anda going to pay back 
oh kita know okay 
ow okay fahami 
having a pelajar pinjaman lah basically 
ya because like 
for saya right saya think saya have a few orang coming up to saya and say like 
oh saya think anda should go to a universiti oh saya think anda should go to , i think  minimum to survive in singapura is university 
then im like , okay if anda talk if anda talking universiti kita talking about dua puluh to thirty k of pelajar pinjaman and saya have to pay itu for , and even if after saya graduated universiti saya still have to 
saya im not going to earn that much and i can like , immediately pay saya pelajar pinjaman anda know , then im thinking okay lah if anda say then anda give saya  wang lah ill go to i go to universiti and study right now 
so i jangan in a cara i feel like im not obligated to go to uh take a darjah , uh saya um 
because mainly  biggest faktor is because of  pelajar pinjaman because saya have a um uh saya have a kakak dia , dia took a pelajar pinjaman saya think if im not wrong itu about dua puluh k and uh i jangan know if because dia was , dia felt obligated to do itu or because um 
uh rakan tekanan or apa sahaja i jangan tahu and end up dia had to pay for like uh not so sure how long dia take to pay semua that dua puluh k , uh dia ended up not using itu actually 
so itu was really sesuatu that i didnt want to experience what dia experienced 
ya so i feel like um saya think so no terima kasih anda lah for pelajar pinjaman i 
fikir there are cara where saya can actually survive in singapura without a darjah , anda know i mean in fakta there are beberapa other orang who earn more than a degree pemegang 
anda know well anda get what im coming from so i think ya i think itu anda saying that because , uh orang are coming up to anda and tell anda that also right 
ya so ya , 
um 
honestly i dont even know what itu is and i jangan know and i dont understand why anda had to ask saya that anda know that , anda do , 
if anda know  jawab to itu soalan please answer itu because saya have tidak idea what  soalan is about 
hidden fail ah 
i jangan saya really dont 
saya but 
terima kasih anda for thinking like saya know lah actually i jangan 
ya terima kasih anda for itu terima kasih anda for thinking itu im pintar when actually im not ya terima kasih ah 
tidak saya dont anda have to understand that even when saya learn 
perakaunan in sekolah tiada apa-apa goes into saya kepala ya 
ya tidak min saya studied accounting min can , i can answer a lot of kewangan soalan 
mm 
oh okay ya so sorry okay let saya ask beberapa 
soalan , that anda know lah okay that anda and i know , um 
um tahan on ah 
sebab saya want to ask a soalan that anda and i can answer so in what is charged do anda have a e akaun pasangan where do anda 
pilih mm 
and then , uh 
okay um if anda have a soalan 
saya thought anda will got to see 
okay saya just ask lah just ask a random soalan lah itu doesnt jirim if anda know anda dont know let just try kami best okay in ini one minit and ten saat , um so what is anda pengalaman of purchasing insurans produk insurans produk from bank 
i mean anda have mana-mana pengalaman just kongsi  perincian lah 
oh saya see 
saya dont uh insurans from  bank tidak because insurans saya ibu is  one whos paying lah so , uh when i get a full masa kerja 
ill be continuing what dia already bought for saya of 
 insurans organisasi so 
ya 
but bercakap of insurans kanan anda know yang insurans  a saya a prudential great eastern 
um saya have beberapa uh insurans orang coming up to saya and to sell saya  insurans lah and frankly bercakap saya was actually quite attracted to itu lah , because of  cara mereka speak lah i jangan know if mereka tipu just well trained to speak 
but saya just remember saya was uh two tahun ago saya was eighteen then dia was like , like doing semua  matematik and telling saya  masa hadapan of oh okay should i stop 
i think kita can 
oh 
okay can i continue saya cerita , okay 
okay so um , uh just continue where saya left off , so two tahun ago um 
when insurans ini insurans orang come up to saya anda know doing semua  matematik and 
katakan , oh ini one for anda masa hadapan anda itu very good to save anda wang , um hundred dolar setiap bulan then when anda get older anda can like use  wang semua that jenis of perkara lah , then im then saya was like kami 
saya told dia oh aiya saya think about itu can i have to ask saya ibu then dia was like , oh anda have to ask anda dia give saya whoa dia give saya ini one lihat and ini nada lah saya dont know what jenis of 
okay but apa sahaja itu is dia started like oh anda have to ask anda ibu ah youre eighteen already anda know anda can make anda own keputusan then im like , ah ya because in  malay komuniti right ini jenis of keputusan must ask  ibu bapa one 
so dia was like oh really ah then im like ya so im like okay and then just walk away and anda know insurans kanan mereka tend to give anda  free hadiah right , when saya walk away i dont like eh apa saya free hadiah anda know but i tidak do that lah anda know like , save saya beberapa face lah 
okay mmhmm okay mm , 
prudential ya 
ya ya so wait so what , 
tahan on tunggu let saya stop anda right there so anda telling saya that anda say anda dont know how anda came to  kopi kacang is that what anda telling saya 
oh itu like anda fell for  ejaan lah like itu , 
okay fahami oh , mm mm , 
oh secondary sekolah saya thought anda were like anda still in poli anda know 
secondary sekolah ya lah of kursus lah secondary sekolah 
kita were so naive what 
ya anda are very anda are very naive orang 
ya okay , 
bahagian two positive pengalaman , 
uh i mean ya for saya is same lor like uh saya enjoy perjalanan and actually last masa , long masa ago , 
saya thought i actually i didnt really like um 
saya didnt really think much about perjalanan lah until i went overseas for six bulan and then , 
uh ya once anda see 
once anda experience  kecantikan and  kebebasan in um 
beberapa of ini other tempat maybe because when saya was younger yang , tempat i went to was always on a with a jelajah kumpulan and then semuanya is structured uh anda are rushing from tempat to tempat and then , itu is not really yang uh jenis of glamorous negara but , 
um ya when anda spend uh maybe six bulan in a tempat with four musim with uh nice , scenery nice alam semula jadi uh 
um , less tekanan , 
ya saya mean , i mean 
kumpulan last masa because  masalah with um doing anda own is anda dont know , what to do mah like um ya but then so last masa  internet tidak that uh popular or tidak that prevalen so 
itu is very hard to find , or gelintar for maklumat anda cant buku tiket online anda cant buku hotel online but Kini , semuanya 
can be found online semuanya can be plan even before anda fly so , i think that makes perkara easier also and then definitely when anda plan anda own perjalanan anda 
have a akal of uh anda can rentak diri anda ya in fakta i think sometimes because i jangan rancang actually i 
im just following around on  perjalanan so maybe thats one of  sebab um i dont enjoy that perjalanan maybe ya , ya like saya mean for contoh 
more like saya dont 
i dont know like sometimes when anda plan  perjalanan then anda because anda read before anda go so , then anda have a akal of before anda go anda are wondering like how is going to be like anda have a akal of uh maybe antisipasi but then , uh 
if anda dont plan then anda are just going and um , itu just anda go there and then anda see and then ah itu itu ya and then anda also dont have a akal of um like what anda are seeing also ya 
ya ya ya 
ya ah ya 
i mean i agree so thats why when saya previously when saya plan perjalanan i always plan with seseorang else so that uh ada padanya seseorang to ya not just spread  kerja but also seseorang to like um make sure anda dont make mana-mana kesilapan especially when youre connecting from one tempat to lain and perkara like itu 
uh so uh itu always one orang do one orang semak ya so 
like i mean previously when saya was planning saya thats how saya did itu lah ya then also more also to spread  kerja lah because itu very ya itu is a lot of kerja also , ya 
ya i mean ask  perkara about 
itu masa during um 
like when perjalanan on tukar with kawan uh kawan is more uh a bit more have to take a bit more penjagaan lor because um ya beberapa orang mereka travel murah but beberapa orang can not stand murah then beberapa orang mereka want to shop but beberapa orang want to um 
go into alam semula jadi like hiking and perkara like itu so , then is very important to choose uh which kumpulan of kawan anda go with ya so i think saya was lucky lah saya managed to find 
a few kumpulan that have  same minat and also  same uh tabiat also so ya then thats when anda have fun lah and then uh anda feel that akal of 
kemerdekaan saya think ya because singapore a lot of masa anda are kita stay kita stay with kami ibu bapa until i jangan know when anda get married ya so that itu anda first rasa of kebebasan and then , for once , anda are out of  sangkar anda dont want to go back into  sangkar anymore 
ya and ya and if ya 
in fakta singapura then feels like a sangkar after itu ya so , 
ya 
ya i mean singapura will still have mereka um 
kehijauan or uh alam semula jadi taman also lah but then  masalah comes with  ,  haba lor ya i mean like when anda anda can walk for four jam in uh lain negara ya anda feel , 
physically tired but anda are not like sweating and sticky and semuanya ya but singapore i think anda , anda cant walk for more than two jam before anda are tired of itu ya 
also i think  haba is also lain masalah ya 
i min of kursus after youve seen yang overseas anda dont think much of yang anda can get here lah but , ya i ya but of kursus if anda 
for a , short mendaki to get away from anda kerja then i 
fikir ada padanya still tempat like 
i jangan know macritchie bukit timah bukit and then  satu in uh bukit batok  did  tambang quarry  satu that is disused ya , so i think there are beberapa , there are still beberapa tempat here but , 
itu just doesnt wow anda like how beberapa of yang tempat overseas mereka can wow anda ya 
so ya itu itu a different jenis of pengalaman lah ya 
in a cara maybe but i tekaan if anda , 
if anda are going with uh orang anda enjoy having around then maybe itu doesnt really matter that much ya 
ya , 
ya i get what anda mean i get what anda mean ya so i mean ya saya 
saya think itu also , plays a bahagian as well but ultimately like um 
i dont know like sometimes if let say anda are hiking , uh with anda 
keluarga or with anda kawan um 
if let say anda are climbing to  onto  atas of a gunung lah if anda do itu together then 
anda still feel that akal of achievement lah but of kursus uh is still can not beat like if anda climb to  atas of bukit timah bukit and then anda take a kereta api menunggang up to beberapa gunung in uh switzerland that  paparan is different lah  udara is also different 
lah ya , ya ya so , 
i mean anda cant really compare lah i mean anda make do with what anda have in singapura kanan so ya 
ya i mean i itu what because of mereka tujuan saya actually went once to coney pulau but that uh itu was disappointing lah , 
ya itu is just very near like um just punggol and then anda just cross anda just anda can just literally walk across to itu pulau 
ah , i didnt see mana-mana lembu but saya , ya itu is itu just a 
cebisan of tanah with , pokok and uh , ya saya 
uh is connected by a jambatan saya think is a , a manusia made ya is a concrete jambatan mereka built a concrete jambatan connecting  daratan to  pulau , ya 
and i dont even remember whether im saya have been to pulau ubin before so maybe that might be sesuatu more interesting but , uh ya saya havent been to ya i jangan think i been to pulau ubin also ya 
ya 
ya , 
ya maybe i tekaan ya 
oh okay , okay 
oh wah 
itu sad uh but then anyway 
ya like i sebutan lor uh mm 
ya 
ya but i mean i think  yang homestay anda really get in like saya uh tempat like taiwan or i uh australia also i think 
ya saya think  keadaan is very different from yang anda get in pulau ubin lah so , so i think kita semua are sit ya saya think so i jangan know about anda lah but then like uh kita are bandar kanak-kanak lah so born 
and bred in  bandar ah so , i think a bit hard to adapt to ,  syarat on ubin saya dont know i havent been to ubin before ya , 
uh taiwan once yes uh itu 
uh itu is quite commercialise so is almost like a snip small little resort uh , ya uh 
oh tidak not really uh anda are near  ladang but anda are not on  ladang so ya itu is not uh really uh very 
uh lowdown jenis of keadaan ya 
ya saya think itu a bit almost a bit like a resort already ya called commercialised 
so ya lor 
but i mean given a , given a pilihan saya would want to go back to like 
uh eropah that jenis of tempat again lah ya if saya have  peluang ya and  wang ya , 
uh ya for  alam semula jadi for  
kehijauan for  itu itu just a different rentak of hidup ah when anda go there , anda just feel relax i think partially because of  cuaca also but ya anda just feel more santai over there like 
ya saya do saya can not pin down a particular sebab but um 
when saya went to spain and itu was very hot and itu didnt feel really like a percutian lah 
ya , ya 
ya saya think so also 
ya saya think so but i never thought of going to africa lah i mean havent even been , uh i mean there are already so many 
tempat to see in uh  northern 
bahagian of  dunia also , 
i jangan think 
saya never say never but i dont think like uh ini hidup saya might ever step kaki on afrika lah 
ya , 
ya ya 
ya uh definitely ya but also i havent langkah kaki in  american benua also so , i think most orang mereka start by going to  u s or kanada right so uh from there then mereka slowly explore other tempat ya , 
uh but then itu comes down to  masa and  wang again lah ya 
so ya 
ya saya think mereka always say right uh 
anda 
when anda are young anda have masa but anda dont have wang eh uh middle umur anda have anda dont have wang and anda dont anda dont have masa but anda have a little wang but then at old umur anda have masa but then  soalan is whether anda have  wang or not ya 
ya ya 
so , i feel old anyway so , 
so maybe kita should ask cheryl to uh intro kami more tinjauan if there are tinjauan next masa 
ya , 
ya 
bahagian three negative pengalaman 
babe what happened just now 
what happen right okay okay okay mm ya oh tidak , oh tidak okay okay highlighted ini ya mmhmm okay worried ya okay working mmhmm , ya mm mmhmm okay true ya , because like ralat 
ya saya anak is what eighteen tahun old kanan 
then err uh 
um saya mean dia went through  uh dia primary sekolah tahun dia secondary sekolah tahun also dia went through ini fasa , where 
um , anda know mereka gang up ralat 
menjengkelkan to mereka itu just annoying one lain but 
mereka dont realise that anda know mereka are humiliating  other anak 
ya so i mean i went through wah six tahun of anda know being called out to  
sekolah ralat saya anak spend four tahun of dia secondary sekolah hidup ralat 
always receiving ralat 
uh anda know caning from , 
 disiplin master 
even though anda know even though kita as ibu bapa kita , yeah 
actually i mean as ibu also kita feel hurt because itu like kita have educated mereka 
ralat anda know shared with mereka examples kita have err constantly advise mereka know anda know whats  kanan 
uh 
 right cara to treat lain but 
especially when mereka tipu in a kumpulan ah mereka want to show off or 
ya peer tekanan lah rakan tekanan 
true ya saya mean ya 
i think itu also uh itu hurts 
uh when anda know when orang say like oh anda dont know how to teach anda anak 
anda know anda kanak-kanak must err 
be uh growing up ini cara because anda know anda come from rosak 
keluarga , but uh 
uh yeah itu very hurtful because , anda know kita were not  jenis who anda know err wash kami tangan off 
but when itu comes to mereka upbringing mereka pendidikan betul 
actually to saya  istilah broken keluarga would anda know would probably err sut more to yang who 
uh ya not 
tidak proper keluarga sokongan uh tidak satu bothers anda know but um that doesnt mean like anda know divorced uh kanak-kanak with divorced ibu bapa are 
must 
must be actually come from broken keluarga i think that istilah , anda know orang tend to use itu use that istilah loosely to 
to 
to semua uh anda know itu separates or that cerai and that ya 
sometimes ini kanak-kanak also , anda know anda wonder whether mereka act out because i jangan know kekurangan of perhatian or not but 
um ya saya think 
 stres in saya hidup is mostly because of thinking about  kanak-kanak lah 
fikir is  penjanaan now 
challenging than during kami masa even though kita rebel during kami 
masa saya still think , 
because of  kemajuan of teknologi and then  pengaruh of uh anda know 
err social media and  outside dunia 
 kanak-kanak Kini tend to 
ya laksana differently than how kita were last masa 
so saya kebimbangan now saya stres now is actually revolving around 
 kanak-kanak and mereka masa hadapan 
saya think is  silent rawatan 
which is very hurtful to saya more than , because mereka dont talk back 
mereka only give silent rawatan 
uh and when mereka dont 
bincang to anda for hari then anda feel like even though mereka are  yang at sesar but , mereka dont bincang to anda , 
so ya that jenis of 
depresi saya lah like , uh ya okay ya like anda know err saya anak , anda know anda 
ralat know hes under panduan program kanan 
uh as saya mentioned anda know right saya anak is on  panduan program 
for one tahun so kita still have lain what 
to go through ini program 
and i hope 
itu after ini 
anda know uh dia would 
buck up lah hopefully theres tidak , mm mmhmm mm , itu is itu sad 
anda know  perkara itu sedih that ralat 
anda know bullying has never ended anda know like uh itu is sesuatu that 
is ongoing itu sesuatu that 
ya ya 
uh especially now with semua ini uh what  cabaran on social media , 
like semua ini uh like anda know sometimes when mereka do certain stunt itu very worrying like , 
what if anda anak follows anda know what if anda anak , i mean thankfully kita dont really anda know hear that much insiden on ini 
tiktok cabaran or sesuatu in singapura betul 
uh ya true , true , ya so like anda know 
i mean im not saying ralat , semuanya in  barat is anda know negative but 
um 
itu just different upbringing different budaya lah ya 
were anda close to dia 
oh is ini anda ibu or paternal nenek 
okay mmhmm okay 
oh anda paternal sisi youre  only cucu 
oh at itu titik in masa okay okay okay mmhmm alright right okay , oh at rumah kanan mmhmm right 
oh im sure semua cried 
mmhmm ya true , but uh 
uh saya mean for saya because ralat 
saya anak perempuan dirinya went through ralat bunuh diri fikiran because of persahabatan 
so , but i mean thankfully uh 
dia overcame itu err 
itu took a semasa for dia to overcome itu and actually 
and beberapa more , 
ralat ya uh saya encouraged dia that anda know itu okay if ralat 
because dia felt ralat , dia felt 
ketidakadilan lah um like 
itu wasnt dia sesar anda know uh itu was like 
anda know how 
kawan can badmouth one lain or can anda know add 
add bahan api to  api ralat 
uh ya so shesCity in Illinois, United States like 
caught in between and then uh dia was pointed out as  
 satu who cause , 
ya itu err and then anda know dia thought uh , yang that were close to dia will click really anda know truly sincere 
uh dia totally i think itu was a really hard masa beberapa more itu was  uh prasyarat 
for tunggu was that prelims tidak that was in when dia was uh in sec three , so like uh 
ya because ralat uh dia was in crescent gadis so  kerja  sekolah load 
 kerja rumah load was err 
too much for dia to bear and then dia was struggling and then dia was err 
uh  naib presiden for  netball pasukan like anda know theres a lot of perkara on dia plat , and then dia had ini isu so dia had suicidal fikiran dia so how i found out was 
dia actually i think dia like probably wrote a huruf or sesuatu 
and then err dia uh dia bentuk guru actually managed to 
to anda know get err not 
huruf like get  maklumat out from dia also beberapa entah bagaimana lah 
so then uh mereka so dia shared with saya  guru shared with saya and 
then err 
ya dia had tidak minat in , oh because dia had tidak minat in sekolah , 
like dia wasnt really focusing in kelas , 
and 
ya so 
ya and then err 
dia wouldnt open up so itu took sebentar for dia to open up before dia , dia uh confided in saya what was  sebab 
why and then err , 
saya told dia is not healthy for dia to just err build a dinding 
uh to  to  kesakitan anda know 
dia must anda know face itu 
uh 
dia must not uh 
blok out lah blok out dia perasaan or anda know 
like ralat never is 
because to dia is like oh itu okay tiada siapa wants to talk to saya itu halus , im just going to anda know turn up to sekolah and then if orang dont bincang to saya orang want to talk to saya then orang want to talk to saya but , 
tidak saya tell dia itu not healthy anda must uh , uh ya 
true ya 
mmhmm 
mm 
ya because at itu titik in masa , saya was also anda know very err , 
really err saya couldnt really think properly because one  , saya anak perempuan is experiencing suicidal fikiran kemurungan with persahabatan and semua itu very affected because shesCity in Illinois, United States not  jenis who anda think would be affected but somehow deep down dia was ya and then saya anak 
hes involved in bullying so anda know two different ya two ya so , aiyo 
mm 
ya saya think i agree what xing said because uh i think kita can not predict what 
uh kesihatan 
uh what kemalangan will happen to kami so anda might fall sick one hari and if anda dont have a kesihatan insurans to cover itu then anda have to bear  kos lah which is 
quite high so for saya own saudara for contoh beberapa of mereka just fall sick uh without mana-mana medical sejarah then ini mereka realize that mereka okay mereka have like barah so if mereka dont have a kesihatan insurans for itu then 
anda have to take semua  uji semua  operasi which are very costly 
and ya but good perkara for mereka is that mereka have kesihatan insurans so mereka can claim so no isu for itu but  perkara about insurans is that  menuntut proses is always very tedious anda have to always 
uh provide a lot of dokumen a lot of uh 
resit yeah 
but uh 
for insurans for orang of kami umur saya think because as of now kita are pelajar right so uh kita are not very financial mampu of buying uh 
sah 
insurans so uh kami insurans are usually bought by kami ibu bapa since young 
so right saya maybe itu for xing also but for kami own insurans saya think were not financially capable of itu because setiap bulan anda have to fork out a certain jumlah of wang kanan and kita are currently not earning also so maybe itu for  near masa hadapan when kita start working as uh full masa yup 
 second soalan yup 
mm 
mm 
ya uh for saya saya insuran uh is covered by saya ibu bapa as well 
uh from what saya know saya think mereka only bought  
kemalangan insurans so if saya , if im hospitalised then ill be covered so i apa sahaja apart from that , i dont think im covered 
and so i im not financially capable of getting saya own insurans yet so zero peratus of saya pendapatan goes to insurans 
and uh ya im only covered for hospitalised barang xing are anda there 
okay saya completed  second soalan so lets go to  third one do kita get insurans from a single insurans penyedia or do anda pick up and choose from multiple syarikat 
mm for saya saya mak 
uh 
dia buys insurans from ini particular , agent since like when kita were born twenty plus tahun ago and shesCity in Illinois, United States always been sticking to itu particular insurans ejen 
uh but for saya kes saya think im open to trying out different tawaran that mereka offer so beberapa insurans ejen might offer better 
polisi ya so i think itu good to try and listen and see what mereka can offer 
mmhmm 
um 
um 
ya saya think what i look for in an insurans ejen would be seseorang that saya can yeah bincang to comfortably also because sakit be sharing a lot of saya personal barang with mereka kanan and also i dont want mereka to be too pushy 
because itu like  , everyones very annoyed with mereka being so pushy and hard menjual right ya so seseorang that 
itu very sincere genuine really want to help anda with anda masa hadapan insurans perancangan and ya like what xing said like what xing yi said 
um seseorang that uh can continue 
anda insurans when mereka grow older as kita kedua-duanya grow older so but there are kedua-duanya pros and cons to itu uh if theyre younger ejen mereka might not be so experienced ya and if theyre older mereka might retire by  masa anda grow old 
ya so thats sesuatu to consider 
um ya saya think 
quite similar also um sakit ask mereka uh how much is itu and what am i getting out of itu and 
after knowing what im getting out of itu then maybe saya can proceed to a few more ejen and bandingkan 
compare mereka and see whats  what can i get best out of yang 
mm 
okay 
mm 
mm 
ya saya think most importantly would be how much uh mereka are earning 
although sensitive but i think itu what kita need to know if im if i uh kerja as an insurans ejen and what mereka would want to get out of itu yeah so what are mereka looking for 
in a insurans ya 
um 
tidak 
buy istilah when invest  rehat do anda mix insurans and pelaburan or do anda keep mereka apart 
i think itu for saya saya would keep mereka apart 
because 
i jangan know but i mean itu just tidak 
kerja for saya to mix insurans and pelaburan 
ya pelaburan is like lain jirim insurans is lain so what do anda think xing , 
mm mmhmm mm 
ya saya think itu just keutamaan 
um 
i think saya would prefer whole hidup insurans because saya think personally i dont like to be too i dont like perkara to be too tedious so i think if uh im saya settled on ini polisi ini insurans saya think saya will just stick to itu 
ya because i think in  masa hadapan well be working will be very busy , 
i dont think anda have a lot of masa to go and talk to many different ejen 
ya so thats just for saya lah i think saya would just prefer a whole hidup insurans yup 
uh tidak but kita can not kita can choose not to 
ya , do anda think c p f insurans liputan is enough for anda insurans liputan what are anda fikiran 
pelindung tua or medisave 
um 
uh from saya saudara experience saya know that mereka have kedua-duanya uh 
simpan and insurans so after mereka operasi even after deducting simpan mereka still have to claim from insurans so 
ya , c p f alone c p f insurans alone is not enough um 
and last soalan 
ya same ive never didengar of itu ya but i think uh saya would go 
to a professional ejen because saya think mereka are there for sebab mereka attend  kursus to help orang like kami for a sebab kanan to assist kami so saya would go mereka go to mereka for uh mana-mana , uh soalan that saya have in minda 
ya uh for saya what i would tell saya sendiri five tahun ago is to start saving early 
ya because saya only realised that saving wang is so important now that im in saya dua puluhan but i think saving up 
young is a good tabiat ya anda dont when anda earn bahagian masa salary anda dont spend semua of itu anda keep beberapa in anda penjimatan and itu will help anda along  cara 
and next soalan how do anda manage anda tunai aliran and 
how much of anda pendapatan is allocated to penjimatan perbelanjaan and insurans for tambang um when saya get saya monthly bayar saya would 
keep uh more than eighty peratus of itu in saya penjimatan account because saya dont think saya have i jangan have itu much that many perkara to buy yeah itu just occasional atas talian membeli-belah 
ya and anda can get cheap tawaran somewhere yeah and itu important to save up and i get  kepuasan when saya save up mm when anda see anda bank akaun slowly growing 
ya ya from three digit to four to five ya 
ya saya think fifty peratus is good enough 
mm 
ya 
mm 
and to earn extra pendapatan saya think 
if anda are a pelajar anda can just go and get a bahagian masa kerja 
get one that is flexible so anda can uh kerja while youre schooling itu what works for saya when saya was in uni saya 
dapat saya got a bahagian masa kerja itu uh 
flexible so i can work and sekolah at  same masa 
okay , 
bahagian two positive pengalaman 
what were beberapa memorable momen probably anda younger hari 
true 
mm same ah primary sekolah 
and then like primary sekolah kawan who still laughed until hari ini 
then 
okay lah not semua lah but then like most of mereka 
and just 
nice kenangan with kawan 
hanging out 
i mean i think primary sekolah bukan really about studying , actually 
perbelanjaan masa with one lain getting to know more about one lain 
ya lah saya think is , really nice ya 
true 
and then um setiap masa kita facebook message masing-masing other 
ya and then kita anda know facebook then got  like orang post gambar then got a lot of 
like 
small aksara then anda tag who is who 
i think itu really cute , 
ya now that i think of itu ya 
as compared , really 
saya mimpi okay ini one is 
not like kerjaya bijak but saya mimpi is like 
to be like to travel around  dunia and promoting saya budaya ya and then learn about mereka budaya also 
sebab saya im really interested lah in 
 seni and budaya around  dunia 
so ya itu saya mimpi to travel 
what about anda 
ya okay lah 
ya , actually true lah 
but then in tertib to like to get itu , 
apa  mimpi saya feel like saya want to like 
incorporate kedua-duanya mimpi and kerjaya together 
but i am not sure ada padanya such pekerjaan for itu 
so ya , what about anda 
mm saya never 
mm ya 
okay ah 
maybe anda can invest on a small stor 
and then sell anda barang 
wow can why not 
okay , so what do anda love about hidup 
what do anda love about hidup 
ini is a very deep soalan uh , 
one perkara saya love about hidup is 
i think itu like 
how anda wake up setiap hari and ada padanya sesuatu that is in for anda know 
like anda dont know what itu is but then 
ada padanya just sesuatu for anda ah 
like 
ya just anda wake up anda dont know apa going to happen 
but then anda dont know apa 
good or bad itu going to happen to anda but then is like a misteri which is like quite interesting what 
ya anda dont know apa going to happen 
ya itu why saya cinta 
okay one of  few perkara that i iove about hidup 
ya 
oh maybe , uh , 
uh saya got wiwi saya kucing 
um in dua puluh lapan belas saya think ya 
at first saya thought i wasnt ya hari raya haji saya think dua puluh nineteen yes , at first saya thought tidak akan like penjagaan about ini kucing lah like not saya tanggungjawab 
but then as 
hari minggu bulan go by , i feel like itu like a sumber of kebahagiaan at rumah ah 
like anda know after anda go home after a tiring hari at kerja or sekolah uh then anda come rumah to anda 
kucing then and  kucing welcomes anda think just like , cute what 
then anda eh anda got two three kucing 
ya when 
tidur only ah 
mm , 
wow wiwi is not like itu 
ya 
comel lah 
so what is anda favourite zaman kanak-kanak makanan or snek mmhmm 
nice 
ya quite sweet lah but 
eh not bad 
thats how anda eat itu 
can not eat together , 
 best ya 
favourite zaman kanak-kanak makanan or snek 
i jangan know eh 
okay maybe one of itu is  anda know  coklat and then anda like kupas like itu like anda must open itu 
like ubat like itu 
okay anda know  coklat like telur 
then anda like macam panadol like itu anda must break  
itu not that nice actually but then i like itu because of  pengalaman , like saya like to pretend im eating ubat then i do itu 
saya just like for  pengalaman 
ya true 
to  ubah 
ya itu not like coklat , 
okay not ini soalan what was anda best ulang tahun hadir and why 
oh wow ya 
oh 
mm wah bagus 
mm kejutan ah 
best ulang tahun hadir saya have tidak idea 
i think i dont know maybe 
setiap tahun is  best 
actually i dont know lah okay maybe ini tahun is not  best like saya would say 
but ini tahun is 
because of  litar pemutus ya 
so i can not celebrate outside what 
so like orang just 
send makanan penghantaran then anda send anda 
um 
anda what is itu called kecantikan pengisar eh tidak bulu mata ya 
so ini tahun ulang tahun is a bit special because semuanya is just being sent to saya 
an interesting lah because of litar pemutus 
so ya 
ya ya cause itu was during ramadan also 
so kita break fast together and luckily i already quit saya kerja because if not i can not celebrate 
okay , what is a kemahiran or an keupayaan 
what is  nicest 
perkara seseorang nicest perkara ah 
saya think um one of  nicest perkara is that 
seseorang told saya i think i carry saya sendiri very well especially last tahun for s y f 
sebab saya was  presiden like and then itu was during 
a level tahun 
and then i was like 
having masalah trying to like mengatasi between 
c a then saya a aras subjects then keluarga stuff 
and then ya seseorang told saya i carry saya sendiri very well lah even though i got a lot of like masalah 
saya still 
especially during c a ah saya did i jangan like even if i am like not in  mood whatever saya still 
jangan tunjuk itu lah i tekaan ya , what about anda 
oh 
ya true 
peranan model 
mm wow bagus 
soon ah soon 
i jangan know when but soon 
so is that okay is dancing a kemahiran or an keupayaan that anda are secretly proud of having or is there lain 
kemahiran or keupayaan 
what dancing uh ya 
but anda can draw also what 
oh okay understood 
oh okay lah not bad lah 
nice 
um saya jangan know 
if i want say tarian like , 
itu not really like sesuatu that im bangga of ah oh but maybe  keupayaan to lead 
ya sebab saya have never seen saya sendiri as seseorang who would lead 
sesuatu 
but then like given  peluang to lead saya sekolah tarian kumpulan 
i think itu 
saya think not bad lah for seseorang who doesnt have pengalaman 
hello testing 
okay ya anyway , 
okay ya , what were anda saying just now 
true 
lol ya 
okay now so describe anda perfect hari 
for saya i think just 
not doing apa sahaja ah like tiada apa-apa too stressed about 
like just relax sejuk 
just really enjoy anda masa 
ya 
bahagian 
bahagian two debat tajuk two 
get anda titik of paparan ralat 
ya mereka do err if watching filem err filem sometimes mereka a aksara is err morally black and white and ralat 
morally grey not black and white maaf , err kelabu so anda really question 
err what mereka are doing is right or wrong and 
whether anda will do itu if anda are in mereka kasut , ya saya agree ralat 
err but there theres  
other sisi of  syiling that saya also want to bring a titik to ini ralat 
okay first  frasa ralat can fantasy buku and filem offer apa sahaja more than an melarikan diri from realiti , um 
ada padanya a perkataan for ini ralat itu called khayal 
ralat , so okay 
ya while therere ya saya do recognise there are manfaat of 
ralat watching siri and learning a lot from itu while 
err ini saya can acknowledge err  other titik saya would like to err titik out is , 
 unrealistic , jangkaan that orang have when mereka watch filem and err fantasi buku err ini is especially so for romantic drama and i jangan know about maybe fantasy buku but more to  , err romantic filem , so err have anda ever thought of 
when anda were a kanak-kanak anda see pasangan in filem and then err anda develop ini ralat , 
very err isolated paparan of how a hubungan should be like so i mean do anda agree that a , semua hubungan are err depicted err truly as  cara err filem are depicted i mean i dont think so i dont think err real hidup hubungan are err 
err exactly how filem portray itu to be so i think ini sets up a very dangerous ralat 
jangkaan for kanak-kanak or even pasangan err 
how a hubungan should function , and err i even have a penyelidikan kajian on ini so 
ralat just hold on ah  penyelidikan kajian err ya ralat 
according to digital biasiswa 
ralat 
ini , have mentioned that 
ralat 
err a childs romantic saya quote a kanak-kanak romantic imaginasi become resource sumber used later in hidup to satisfy pengalaman and bentuk pemahaman of  kanak-kanak personal hubungan as a hasil of mereka , 
ubikuuiti jisim media gambaran can become , penonton priming model for romantic urus niaga with lain , so 
what does ini mean itu sets up a very err itu sets up a preseden that 
err a hubungan should err mereka hubungan should be  cara err mediasCity in Minnesota, United States and drama gambaranColor itu to be and apa sahaja else that ralat 
goes away from itu err penggambaran itu mereka will probably think that  hubungan is wrong and i think ini is very err berbahaya for a hubungan and for belia ah in general 
ya so what do anda think about ini 
mm 
 cara im berfikir ralat 
anda soalan is err 
tunggu can anda explain itu again ya saya need to 
okay 
ralat okay so first of semua um a cereka based on realiti ralat , if itu based on realiti i jangan think 
sama ada one not a lot of orang will watch itu or nombor two 
maybe ralat itu has to be sensationalised in a cara to be appealing 
to err to  penonton 
so because , realiti is often more disappointing lah and saya would think a lot of orang watch filem 
just so mereka can 
indulge in err fantasi lah so , 
ralat saya will never think that 
ralat filem based on realiti is a , 
is a 
is a good perkara lah so 
because ada padanya always a happy ending and then when i think of happy ending tidak  not setiap cerita has a happy ending 
so , i im a bit of doubtful lah of ini err naratif of filem basing on realiti saya mean itu maybe there is beberapa filem err 
itu are based on realiti and then mereka stay true to actual cerita of ralat what theyre based on , but 
so far i havent seen mana-mana so im very sceptical of ralat 
err portraying real ralat , ralat 
cerita ah i would like to see and then make itu an entertaining cara i think itu a 
ralat 
itu sesuatu that mereka have to give up lah  cereka itu a ralat teka-teki because ralat if anda want to stay true to  naratif of err  cerita that anda want to base anda filem on , err eh anda have to sacrifice hiburan so itu either hiburan or realiti so which , which one do anda want to choose 
ya 
err if itu 
yang t v siri or filem that are based 
mereka always says ralat based on based true cerita ill be 
sakit raise saya alis a little bit lah because , itu like mereka have to sensationalise itu in a little bit lah at least i jangan know how much mereka sensationalise but i think mereka do have to sensationalise and make 
itu a bit more entertaining than itu actually is in tertib to , anda know attract  penonton that mereka want to attract so , ralat , i mean 
ya im a bit sceptical lah when mereka say that so unless saya really delve into  ,  cerita that theyre based on 
saya would ya not be 
maybe itu menghiburkan but itu probably not that true lah so 
okay 
ralat so  video is about err mereka kelihatan is itu 
so ini is a cereka or a tutorial 
err if itu saya jangan know if itu a tutorial saya think itu real because ralat 
because mm anda want to let say a tutorial on how to cook telur anda want i mean anda want  telur to be cooked uh if anda want anda penonton to 
cook  telur and not screw itu up so i would think tutorial should be real , ah then again i jangan pertimbangkan tutorial a filem because ralat , 
when a filem saya will think of a narrative with a pengenalan badan kesimpulan semua of yang titik , and mereka mereka are i think theyre completely different ah , tutorial and 
filem , so err ya tutorial are a lot if not  realest perkara lah that anda will see compared 
to a filem ya mm 
mm okay um gimik to be confident ralat 
tidak saya think ini is more realiti but then again i still stand by  titik that ini is not a filem 
i mean maybe filem in  past few tahun err filem  perkataan filem has err  makna of itu has err expanded to not just a narrative jenis of a video , 
so i jangan know but to saya a filem must have a , a pelakon mereka must have a , like a narrative ah for saya so err but 
i mean if a tutorial , ralat tawaran realiti to how to be confident err even if ive a 
gone through a lot and lost a lot of ralat 
how ive bounced back from ralat saya perjuangan ya i think itu good lah if anda are truthful 
and be real with diri anda ah but i dont itu realiti i will like to portray and 
instead of  filem which is err 
a bit more different lah compared to  tutorial 
yup 
saya mean when saya think when i mean  tajuk is semua about seni lah so err seni anda think of kreativiti sesuatu that is err not tangible not real ralat 
ya so in itu akal um not closely related to  tajuk so , because i think fantasy buku and filem together mereka have a genre that mereka are closely related with ah which is err 
beberapa fantasy aspek and beberapa are fiksyen 
ralat aspek to 
itu as compared to a , tutorial 
ralat , actual ralat nasihat that is err more applicable 
to a pelihat ya 
err tidak i give more kredit to fantasy buku compared to filem but itu still um itu doesnt offer much lah to compared to an melarikan diri 
ralat saya mean , err compared 
fantasi buku mereka do err 
tawaran a lot of keterangan in itu akal but 
in terma of how mereka want to because anda need because anda dont have visual for  as 
compared to a filem so anda need to compensate with ralat describing 
 perincian so itu err  pembaca can visualise what is going on if not , itu not err easy to err to see err apa happening ah in  cerita so err fantasi buku err ya saya still 
saya dont really think about itu after itu afterwards saya just sama ada go back to sleep or i just go about minding saya own hari lah after , reading a fantasy buku 
ralat tiada apa-apa more lah other than  keterangan of  
aksara yup 
positive pengalaman 
um 
okay do anda like to travel , 
um if anda wish 
if anda like to travel to ang mo kio why not 
like travelling in general lah like seeing different perkara if anda think travelling to for contoh ang mo kio , boon lapis is sesuatu different 
taman penyambung ah oh what is itu 
taman 
oh okay 
anda mean walk in ini 
crazy hot singapura cuaca , 
saya think theres a bit ridiculous kanan 
ah okay 
mm okay may maybe at dua belas 
orh okay okay 
or as in malam berbasikal lah saya think malam berbasikal is okay lah because anda go with kawan , 
anda chit chat anda just stay chill i min just take itu as an interaksi sesi lah still not that bad lah , but if anda are talking about one orang walking at dua belas p m , in  bright sunny hari mmi fikir theres a bit 
perjalanan around singapura 
mm okay lah i mean now 
ya mereka are trying to promote singapura , yeah so i thought yeah because now anda know theres  
covid keadaan mah , 
anda if even if anda want to travel to like for contoh indonesia 
also not possible what 
even if , ya i mean itu 
ya saya mean itu if anda even if anda want  kerajaan allows anda 
 indonesian kerajaan also wont let anda go in ah 
ah so thats  masalah lah because , semua  because of  pandemic keadaan lah 
ya anda can 
teruskan to think of itu as nice gambar lah , because i dont think anda can travel anytime soon ah 
oh okay 
oh scotland ah saya think maybe anda need twenty tahun ah , considering that anda spend like less than five hundred dolar , i seriously think anda need a very long masa 
even in ekonomi kelas 
ya lah okay anda itu a free melancong perjalanan lah but of kursus anda go there anda need to stay right 
unless anda tell saya anda go there okay i uh kerja at  asrama sila give saya a bilik , then maybe thats possible lah 
because saya think beberapa , beberapa pelajar do itu ah , 
anda just buy a tiket perjalanan over there and then oh okay find a kerja like a random kerja , like for contoh um 
ya mereka call itu  working percutian lah 
like uh okay saya help  petani to wheat dia medan so in kembali dia give saya three makanan 
then a bumbung over saya kepala 
then in saya free masa saya go and travel around  kawasan luar bandar 
or even beberapa uh okay saya become a 
asrama pengurus 
so at malam saya get a bilik for saya sendiri lah 
ah then during saya off hari i can roam around explore  bandar , go cafe hop ya orang bujang like cafe hopping right , ah so anda just 
ah anda ya lain aras lah 
go overseas hop ah so anda just sit down at  bucu drink kopi 
ya saya mean 
backpacking anda really try to experience ya anda try to experience what 
 penduduk setempat 
pengalaman , 
because anda dont go to so called  touristy tempat ya , whereby oh okay uh saya have a kunci rantaian for anda , fuck three for ten dolar yang jenis , 
so yeah mereka tipu trying um 
yang jenis where mereka try to scam anda ah 
or mereka just tell anda oh 
ya oh sorry hari ini is a buddhas ulang tahun  kuil is closed 
saya bring anda to lain kuil 
ah yang jenis lah 
di mana mereka will just try to scam anda ah 
ya 
ya saya mean mereka also want to , ya mereka also dont want to target anda ah , 
been 
ya lah mereka also can not get apa sahaja out of anda , ya 
um ya um 
rawak walking uh okay so kita drove around  kebun anggur 
so okay in Perancis ya ah tidak tidak in vietnam in Perancis , so 
oh saya vietnam ransel ah so 
ah that one okay so in a cara that one 
okay lah saya would say itu a very lonely perjalanan lah because anda have tidak satu to talk to ah , so at  penghujung of  hari when youre having anda makan malam anda try to , 
bincang to mana-mana orang anda can find lah so i bincang to ini , random pakcik lah hes a kaukasia , 
and dia is also there i think for dia okay not hes also there i min hes also there for percutian but dia has a kerja 
so dia has been there for eight bulan , 
so throughout ini eight bulan dia uh 
ajar english saya mean  usual lah what can ang moh do right just teach english lor , ah so for itu actually is quite lucrative 
tidak lah i mean anda see yang ang moh bums 
not tiada apa-apa much mereka can do ah anda know just teach english lah thats  most useful perkara mereka can do what , okay so ini lelaki actually is 
not that gelandangan that saya thought dia was lah so dia teaches english then in dia free masa dia 
dia try to do sedekah kerja lah 
ya 
ah ya because okay uh okay so how 
okay or rather right how i talk to dia right is because dia was walking into  kedai with a potong in dia tangan , 
so dia got a gusi ah so i was like eh what happen to anda 
ah ya like like itu lah as in , 
ya maybe dia got a broken tulang or sesuatu lah 
ya so dia just say that oh uh semalam i had a motor kemalangan 
so seseorang cuba to rob dia by , snatching dia beg lah 
so dia got pulled like for a few meter 
ah so 
yeah totally i mean 
tidak dia was on  dia was on  motosikal and dia is beg was sling onto dia 
so yang thief cuba to snatch dia beg away lah 
so dia wouldnt let go and end up dia got dragged for a jarak lah 
so thats how dia got  gusi lah 
but anyway ya , 
okay lah saya mean 
okay so dia 
okay saya sebutan that dia did sedekah kerja right so dia go to yang penduduk kampung , try to build rumah buy mereka pakaian 
i jangan know what kampung lah because itu semua yang funny nama that i dont saya can not remember lah , 
ya semua yang 
ya semua yang funny long nama ah and 
beberapa funny bunyi one lah so , but okay lah itu itu like how orang overhear cuba to oh okay kita have beberapa 
missionary perjalanan , kita ,

ya so dia just dia just buy barang like 
makanan 
pakaian so on so forth then bring over lah , then apa sahaja mereka need bantuan or maybe uh saya want to

mereka viewed Kekristenan as a ancaman to  paganCity in Texas, United States and  national tertib 
beberapa but  sebab okay mereka built ya after Kristal because of kursus lah because before Kristal there wasnt Kekristenan what not in  bentuk theres judaisme but tidak Kekristenan 
before Kristal ya 
so ya so like itu only after like around lapan puluh hundred plus with Kekristenan already grew then itu reached  but dia was persecuted until 
because itu masa roman entire was shifting itu berat from shifting itu fokus from  barat to  timur so like ya so itu shifted so itu modal to constantinople 
itu istanbul hari ini ah 
so  sebab why internet because rome although was  spiritual jantung of roman empayar kanan 
if cause a lot of institusi there what a lot of kuil 
were semua  pagan kuil so like kristian 
periferal of rome so but dia created ini whole new empayar new modal where semua  gereja katedral were in  kanan 
ya mm , ya if anda read if anda like kitaran of sejarah not doesnt even need take hundred tahun a thirty tahun of sejarah ulangi sendiri already 
itu just a one bab 
ya 
and shit apa  perkataan for itu rejects masyarakat at a masa ya because 
as in beberapa orang beberapa like when mereka as in not skilled enough penulis when mereka write love adegan right very huh hmm ya maaf 
dia described  makanan right damn sick like what how dia cook bahan what cara to cook itu then after anda cook itu what how itu looks like how itu eaten like so itu like itu dokumen  makanan semua  masa like even now orang can recreate  resipi like there are beberapa restoran 
mereka really mereka say like 
can really take  resipi from what dia write inside and use 
wow , special tum is itu 
now as in like now why oh is like podcast ah give kami five bintang ulasan , wah 
anda say sejarah ulangan in bulatan saya said 
pemisahan long enough will become reunited 
united for long enough will become separated okay let say give anda contoh anda see now anda have a , kecenderungan Ke arah right being , like semua  fasisme coming back right like uh  whole pilihan raya of truf brexit 
itu semua  meningkat of  far right wing mah 
ya then ini cermin 
ya but is  keadaan 
selepas itu now anda see again setiap semua ini are dismantling again globalisasi is going back to like ya going back to pengasingan nasionalisme tidak manusia not ian ong , wah najis wah dia wait long lah saya think dia fifty huh wah najis itu damn cool eh as in like fifty n u s orang in sejarah goes to u n right wah saya think n u s bangga already 
okay but then anda know now recruitment 
like  batasan of u n from itu from  u n piagam , tidak u n piagam was created in nineteen empat puluh six what like after perang two

itu not like seram cereka jenis of 
how young 
maybe sixteen tahun old kanak-kanak belum matang kanak-kanak will find itu fun funny or maybe like menyeronokkan okay there are beberapa cereka pengkritik who thought itu was a very good cereka and itu was a very exciting cereka ya but for saya i thought itu was very disturbing oh ya mengganggu is  perkataan mengganggu because itu  whole cereka is very dark not  kelawar manusia gelap but 
itu very disturbing 
mereka praise itu for bringing up isu of mental kesihatan but what i think 
mereka did was to legalise was to like galakkan not encourage but 
like so like as because ya because itu what joker did thats what joker did 
saya set ini on api then like berjalan around , at first dia turned out dia was very miserable because dia had mental kesihatan isu and semua else just hated dia but selepas itu 
saya think  cereka isih of 
can take ini cereka and say that 
ya 
wow keajaiban kipas 
saya tekaan definitely ah saya think ya

ya same but anda have two c as only leh how 
oh then anda will like 
tidak sukan oh ya anda can not 
oh ya tiroid 

ya 
opposite can open but oh 
eh tidak false kod switching 
kidding 
prompt one sengkang four 
bahagian one debat tajuk one 
saya have to disagree with what anda say 
although i understand mereka use what anda have mentioned 
sesuatu may be nice to anda but sesuatu may not be nice to lain orang however anda could interpret ini in a very different perspektif 
so nilai in seni has various makna 
anda could have two different warna or gaya 
which appear completely different 
in terma of like mereka lihat 
but mereka have exactly  same nilai 
in ini cara nilai can be interpreted as sesuatu else like if anda think from lain perspektif an art cebisan may not express emosi or be valuable to orang a but itu may be valuable 
and sentimental to orang b 
so ini tidak mean that 
itu cebisan of seni 
is less of a nilai 
to one orang however itu means that ini particular seni cebisan , is equally valuable in baris with mana-mana other seni cebisan 
so maybe ini orang dont like ini cebisan of seni but lain orang will like  exact same cebisan of seni 
ini cebisan of seni still has itu own nilai 
okay saya have to disagree with what anda say 
like what anda say anda mentioned that most asian negara thinks that grafiti is a tandatangan of pemberontakan however kita are actually drifting away from ini jenis of traditional set minda 
not only that kita also have to understand itu seni and budaya has a lebih lebar and more measurable impak on kami ekonomi kesihatan and kesejahteraan as well as masyarakat and pendidikan 
itu is important that kita recognise ini impak that seni in general has equal nilai 
and itu is also used as a strategic , uh , national sumber 
so art actually influenced  masyarakat by changing pendapat 
tanam nilai 
translating pengalaman across masa 
and also penyelidikan has shown that seni affects  fundamental akal of diri 
painting arca muzik kesusasteraan and semua  other seni that anda can name 
are often considered 
like a masyarakat collective ingatan 
itu preserve what is pangkal in  historical rekod 
itu felt like itu exists at itu particular masa so is able to convey with  penerima 
so although different orang may experience different perasaan and instill different nilai an seni is still valuable and of equal nilai in dia own cara in communicating to  penerima 
oleh itu theres tidak cara anda could say that one cebisan of seni is more , superior over lain cebisan 
to add on saya titik saya will just like to say that , penyelidik has also been interested in  hubungan between seni and human otak , so ini is from a penyelidikan from newcastle universiti in  tahun dua puluh tiga belas , mereka actually found viewing contemporary visual seni had , 
positive kesan on personal hidup or of nursing rumah terikat penatua 
so itu means that 
whatever that mereka show mereka itu has a positive impak on mereka otak 
so ini goes to show itu setiap cebisan of seni is able to impact setiap individual tanpa mengira of how itu looks or how itu feels to different individu 
oleh itu saya believe that  seni cebisan sendiri has preserved 
an equal nilai masing-masing seni cebisan 
okay saya understand where anda are coming from kita are trying to say that , uh if two orang were to see ini cebisan of seni beberapa seseorang may like itu and lain orang may not like itu , however if anda think from lain perspektif fikir of diri anda as  seni cebisan 
so beberapa orang may like anda and beberapa orang may not like anda however ini doesnt min that yang orang that do not however ini does not mean that if one parti do not like anda  lain wouldnt like anda 
so i believe that  seni cebisan sendiri has still 
inside and i believe that itu is of equal nilai 
because anda can not say that oh ini seni cebisan is better than lain seni cebisan 
ini might just be anda own prospek uh persepsi but might not be 
what is coming of lain orang 
saya beg to defer what anda have said like what anda have mention anda actually say that sains pelajar may not like or may not nilai art as much as a seni pelajar however ini is not true like what anda have mentioned earlier seni can be in different borang like itu could be seni in tarian seni in muzik or playing itu uh musical instrumen , so ini tidak min that yang pelajar who choose like uh seni strim 
tidak go into uh 
like if mereka like kemanusiaan and seni did itu doesnt mean that mereka wouldnt join c as luar of mereka kurikulum like tarian , as well as koir and semua ini 
so anda could not say that mereka nilai art differently just because mereka are in a sains strim 
because i believe that mereka actually have like silang 
mereka actually err 
mereka are mereka actually like yang science pelajar mereka might actually join art c a semasa yang seni pelajar saya actually join c as itu is outside of seni 
so i believe that seni is of a equal nilai because tidak jirim who views that cebisan of seni  seni sendiri is sesuatu that is of a nilai 
okay saya will just like to sum up  debat by saying that 
saya believe that seni is of an equal nilai because setiap cebisan of seni impak setiap individu in different cara 
valuable 
regardless of how itu looks or  gaya or  warna 

okay so basically um saya would say that 
if anda , say that anda know saya hidup itu saya pilihan um itu doesnt really make akal because um if let say i live saya hidup freely by doing apa sahaja and semuanya saya could 
apa  titik of  undang-undang 
gadis is itu means that anda know i could just go out lets just put ini pandemik as an contoh okay , so in ini pandemic uh anda know kita were in closed pintu okay and uh kita 
uh at kita anda know kita could not um go out at a certain masa without anda menyelubungi as well as tidak anda couldnt meet orang and semua so if let say i live by  petikan saya hidup saya pilihan 
sakit have continued going out during  litar pemutus if ive met several of saya kawan and kita would have done perkara which were not supposed to do anda know youre not supposed to do during 
 um litar pemutus , so let saya just ask anda again 
do anda think that anda could live anda own hidup with anda own pilihan ini is actually a very vague ayat okay 
because in saya titik of paparan i jangan think itu ya itu is anda hidup but anda do not have  pilihan 
anda do semuanya and apa sahaja okay anda cant for to a certain aspek ya anda can maybe anda know anda can saya anda is anda pilihan when itu comes to anda know taking up kursus and in anda belajar as bijak like a but in  majoriti of  masa anda can not 
say that itu anda live and anda can not live  cara anda want to live know itu is not that let saya just give anda lain contoh lets just say anda 
anda know commit  jenayah and then anda go to a mahkamah and apparently anda living by 
let just say if  dunia is live by saya hidup saya pilihan whats  titik of having even at kewajipan jalan okay so mereka would just take  whole idea of having a legal undang-undang sistem out of  gambar 
so basically i feel that anda know anda having a anda know having a proper undang-undang sistem having a proper kehakiman 
would actually anda know uh give orang a better cara of living rather than anda just living freely with anda own pilihan and anda know anda would just be anda would i mean anda might think at  mula anda would are on trek of doing what anda prefer 
but as hari go by as tahun go by anda would definitely get off trek because anda would feel and anda could do apa sahaja and semuanya anda can do and whats  titik of agama because as anda can see muslim uh anda know there are beberapa agama whereby mereka cant do certain barang and 
anda know anda would just do itu and anda would be a anda know against anda own agama so uh haren saya will leave itu to anda 
um ya saya so im 
im going to talk in uh okay saya understand anda pandangan and im going to talk in itu pembangkang titik of pandangan and saya would like to um uh anda know scrutinise beberapa of  titik uh pandangan which anda actually brought up 
especially  last few because saya found itu really uh surprising okay ah saya would say that  kami kerajaan is trying mereka sangat best , who actual 
stop perkara like anda know geng and uh illegal perhimpunan and and perkara like itu so 
saya feel that uh anda know anda having anda own pilihan and ah saya feel that anda jenis anda anda actually supporting  negative sisi of uh singapores anak muda 
and anda are actually encouraging belia to join geng for beberapa sebab and saya that i dont think itu uh very much of uh being like a singaporean saya dont think youre anda know youre being very , uh like anda know straightforward about itu because uh kami kerajaan has done so much and i 
okay and uh let saya just okay im going offtrack here talking about  kerajaan now but let saya just uh anda know tell anda straightforward anda know 
seseorang lives dia hidup with dia own pilihan okay 
itu means okay there are banyak of restricted kawasan in singapura and as anda know anak muda kita of very very 
youre orang who loved to , lets just say there is a pembinaan laman over there and then beberapa orang and beberapa lelaki be like oh ya let go and do beberapa taman jelajah 
okay so what happens if mereka have itu mentaliti what do anda think would happen to  anak muda of singapura mereka might be just swinging cringe and semua having mereka good masa there but is risking mereka hidup 
ini is  main sebab why mister praim haren anda are not allowed to do perkara with anda own pilihan 
and theres a sebab why sekatan um anda know sekatan and undang-undang is actually stated clearly in setiap single negara everywhere anda go 
because kita do not want  negara to just be a kepala off on itu own because if a , if a negara or keadaan or whatever itu doesnt have 
uh itu own peraturan itu a berdetik masa bom let saya tell anda that itu a berdetik masa bom 
okay so having peraturan in tempat and anda know orang should know that itu itu hidup , living mereka hidup with mereka own pilihan is just a myth okay itu just like semua yang mythical cerita that will never ever happen because theres tidak perlu for a kerajaan that happens 
and then and then kita straightforward kita are having sesuatu called national perkhidmatan in singapura and anda know , ah hong kong and barang like itu 
pengaruh anda orang live by mereka own pilihan 
kami national perkhidmatan will be struggling because not much orang will be bahagian of itu and singapura is a very small negara anda know 
and if orang do not take bahagian in  national perkhidmatan kita are going to struggle in terma of pertahanan do anda understand okay now itu a open debat let bate to open debat saya would let anda to tell saya why do anda think anda are allowed to live anda hidup with anda own pilihan 
okay let saya just stop anda there haren okay let saya just stop anda there , ah to be honest i really think that anda do not know how masyarakat works basically because anda are feeling that anda know 
if uh semua orang has mereka own pilihan semua orang gets to live  cara mereka want to without following  anda know a sistem uh in a systematic cara 
i mean i feel that  negara would just flop and singapore would never has gandaan itu bebas if kita ever live like itu in  past okay let saya just put straight itu put that lurus to anda 
lain perkara is uh mister haren um , 
anda saying that anda know itu itu to fine to break peraturan and anda know anda 
anda are trying to say that anda know if anda have anda own pilihan to live hidup what i mean from wrong anda would anda know anda would have anda own pilihan and so youll be having more self kawalan is that kanan 
okay let saya stop anda there so what about dadah pemerdagangan orang 
is itu tidak tidak tidak anda know tidak is itu haren anda dont actually understand saya paparan but im talking about dadah pemerdagangan orang ini orang would like to make a quick buckCity in Illinois, United States in a short tempoh of masa 
and what do mereka influence kami orang bujang especially  low pendapatan keluarga mereka influence mereka 
in taking ini dadah despite  keadaan anda know ini low pendapatan keluarga mereka have very low pendapatan and mereka are from broken keluarga , and what else do mereka have mereka dont have makanan so mereka result in taking dadah because itu murah 
itu uh anda know anda can get itu anywhere if let just say in anda own hidup but anda are destroying keluarga and youre destroying kami younger penjanaan in singapura 
are anda able if let just say anda are bahagian of  kerajaan and then anda put ini laluan out are anda able to take itu bebanan 
of anda destroying keluarga if anda are itu really sad 
because i dont think anda know  makna of kemanusiaan and uh and saya think anda are actually going to meet  sebab why kemanusiaan pupus in  next hundred tahun also uh anda uh im done uh as itu saya titik anda can take itu over haren 
anda can not live anda hidup in anda own pilihan because tiada of  pengalaman anda gave saya actually supported  paparan i i i felt that itu was blatantly anda know uh supporting 
negative laluan okay let saya just tell anda one perkara anda can not live anda hidup with anda own pilihan because anda will be put in a very wrong laluan terima kasih anda

mereka are comparing in sekolah then setiap masa mereka come back ah mereka pick up semua  wrong perkara 
then mereka come back ah then mereka kongsi semua  wrong perkara with  younger yang itu why i simpan memberitahu 
anda go to sekolah anda learn how to respect and 
be responsible then

cultivate  betul values what 
yeah lor mereka heard 
mereka heard orang staying in landed or mereka want kondo got swimming kolam right then mereka ask 
can kita move to a tempat with swimming kolam 
because mereka enjoy swimming so much 
eh tidak lor at least in  masa lalu kita compare kami keputusan and gred and kita can compare eh im nombor what in kelas so anda need to 
err so anda need to study harder to become  top sepuluh in kelas et cetera now anda think mereka care because theres tidak penggredan also 
aiya itu about being contented with what anda have mah but  perkara is i tell anda living piawai so high nowadays itu very competitive leh anda see semua  ibu bapa keep sending tuisyen 
semua orang go tuisyen then after itu wah from anda beri to anda right otak left otak apa sahaja penanaman 
wah anda see  kanak-kanak nowadays apart from 
balet 
biola piano mereka still need to go and learn taekwondo swimming 
but itu so different Kini lor anda like now 
setiap hari after sekolah mereka go after sekolah penjagaan so in  after sekolah penjagaan mereka would already have finish semua mereka kerja rumah plus nowadays itu pembelajaran through main 
anda dont play komputer permainan how anda know how to do coding 
pengekodan is very important kemahiran nowadays anda know , 
itu why but  perkara is aiya ibu bapa also very difficult leh anda know if otherwise anda dont expose mereka to semua ini right then next masa 
programming mereka can do perkara ah 
ya but actually anda know what , saya also use pokemongo as  because mereka are playing mah so i tell mereka eh anda see  gadis over there anda want to be  orang who study now and then next masa anda make a stronger and more powerful pokemon or anda want to be  satu who is stupidly catching  pokemon now , 
already try to set a pemasa what thats why dia ipad can only watch until eight tiga puluh and then after that  
pokemon mereka anda can only play during hujung minggu mah and after mereka do mereka kerja rumah 
ya lah but itu also because of  c b tempoh lah  litar pemutus that masa because mereka are semua stuck at rumah what then can not do ini can not do itu so mereka only got what only got anda komputer t v and ipad to accompany mereka lor 
ah ya lah 
ya that masa with  
with  kedai semua closed kita can only download what so which is why kita also downloaded educational program then mereka were doing 
english and matematik on  telefon lor 
oh ya itu why mereka are now suffering with mereka sains lor not i think matematik is still okay because anda english asas and semuanya is there is okay so 
saya think mereka are doing desimal and pecahan now but itu  sains ah mereka can not 
mereka dont know how to use  betul 
terma so itu why mereka keep ralat 
getting mereka keep using mereka own perkataan lor 
but anda need to use  sains terma mah otherwise youll dapat potong tanda mah 
ya but  perkara is aiya mereka get so much gangguan anda see like one orang main then  other orang who is in  bilik studying will just keep 
err um but dia so noisy err then after itu saya also want to go out and play then ill 
if not ah saya tell anda 
 orang in  bilik belajar will be like go out take air go out go toilet go out then after itu see what semua orang else is doing 
tidak mood to study already what 
ya lah itu why aiyo so 
tidak anda lock dia in  bilik ah 
started drawing on  Kertaspaper size jangan know draw what also 
umpuk already  kerja is to study and revise for uji lor 
then mereka complain say so much perkara how to finish 
yeah mereka like to use mereka imaginasi nowadays what so dia will use mereka will write down mereka will draw and then say oh im doing minda pemetaan 
cause  sekolah teach mereka how to do mind pemetaan but 
but dia is spending more masa drawing that dia is spending more masa 
memorizing 
ya lah 
but itu for mereka sains how to 
then can already what 
itu a good kemahiran 
in  masa lalu kita dont even have itu jenis of 
kita dont even have itu jenis of dedahan lah where got orang teach anda mind mapping until anda are 
out in  masyarakat working 
then itu masa also kita actually bought a saiz simpan for mereka to do diri mereka sendiri lor 
aiya but nowadays kanak-kanak also lah like saya say 
a little bit menangis anda see , 
saya penjanaan is about although tahu anda penjanaan to curb on  rantau well i think mereka started mereka penjanaan are shall suffer a lot on how to survive like itu 
what ini satu also can not that one also can not ask mereka anda think next masa bos can scold mereka ah , 
now is in  era of love what semuanya also have to be loving 
oh ya 
true lah itu why anda see 
that jing xiang is crawling semua over semua orang 
 ibu come only then mereka semua say 
makan also can not 
tidur also can not 
main also can not 
semuanya has to be according to what dia wants 
yeah now anda do well in exam one mainan ulang tahun one mainan christmas one mainan then dont know what one mainan 
tidak lah but also because of that mereka are very self centered very selfish leh Kini kanak-kanak mereka just think of diri mereka sendiri only 
until seseorang else datang and take itu mainan out lor seseorang else take seseorang pick up  mainan ah then mereka will be like eh but itu mine then dia will start playing for five more minit 
then also end up crying aiya 
hais saya also dont know lah but 
itu also how 
i jangan know maybe Kini also 
ibu bapa has a bahagian to play datuk dan nenek also have a bahagian to play in  past datuk dan nenek anda think mereka will care so much meh mereka tipu are also busy working but now most of  datuk dan nenek retired and then got masa bantuan out with  kanak-kanak 
ya lah 
saya also dont know what to do i im already worrying 
in  past where got so much insurans kanan Kini apart from hidup insurans hospital insurans anda have to buy pendidikan insurans then 
pendidikan is super important mah 
haiya itu why i think now aiya kanak-kanak in singapura are super bernasib baik lah mereka semuanya also taken penjagaan of from anda 
semua  infrastruktur semua anda medical and semuanya taken penjagaan of already what thats why , kanak-kanak in singapura ah saya think need to bring mereka to a tanah ladang and stay and experience how hidup is like to and grow and pluck anda own sayur to eat 
ya lah 
haiya mereka are a kumpulan of sukan penjanaan ah 
saya did i brought mereka for volunteering kita went to distribute makanan what 
ya lah tidak lah itu more of not to get beberapa menderita lah itu for mereka to see and experience how other orang actually live lah 
otherwise mereka only think eh wah saya hidup is super good and there are bangsa hidup who are even better than saya but mereka never think of orang who can not afford ulang tahun parti 
bahagian two pengalaman 
uh 
what makes anda want to be alive 
saya think for saya itu cukup similar also of like itu like semua  kawan and keluarga ahli around anda and semua  interesting pengalaman that anda dont know what will happen esok and bubble teh 
like so many barang that anda can get to enjoy and experience makes anda want to like look forward to  next hari 
okay so like what is a kemahiran or keupayaan that anda are secretly proud of having 
hmm 
itu very good eh 
i think like what anda have is very cool lah which is like sesuatu that saya want to have uh so like uh kemahiran that im secretly proud of having itu like uh 
tidak but itu like saya feel itu is like sesuatu that im bangga of having cause itu like saya can have fun with itu like can go canoeing anytime but ya kita can go canoeing too 
itu from 
tidak itu for  gadis panduan badge theres ini like 
canoeing 
uh mod 
im not sure oops if dia has right then ya saya have to go do again 
okay , when did anda blush  most 
ya , 
oh , 
mm 
ya i get what anda mean so i also feel that sometimes too 
ya like ya 
like when anda dont know what to say , but ya like saya feel bad for accepting also i mean like saya mean not i feel bad like anda have sebab not to accept but mereka are too nice lah 
uh i think like when i blush  most um saya think itu when saya was embarrassed but there are a lot of masa that saya did that lah 
like 
saya tekaan embarrassing momen like got one masa when saya was 
going to pierce saya telinga and then like in a kedai 
like separuh jalan throughout  perkara saya was i suddenly i was like very scared , 
so like when saya was , piercing separuh jalan , 
like saya was okay saya was very embarrassed by itu but ya i fainted and then 
when saya woke up like , 
so saya ibu bapa was there and then  kedai pemilik was there and then mereka were semua surrounding saya and then saya was very blank out like  malu did hit saya at first saya was just like why am saya on  lantai 
i mean if i see  kedai pemilik saya will feel embarrassed because  kedai pemilik , recognizes saya i think , i think which is very bad but saya was very young tunggu 
okay saya dont know 
ya itu like quite stupid but okay , err what is anda favourite aktiviti to unwind and relax 
ya 
ho 
mmhmm 
uh ya , ya ah dalgona 
mm 
teruskan 
 same like saya also watch netflix but then i watch um k drama and 
ya im like recently watching kerajaan which is very scary itu  zombi 
itu very nice but i always cover  skrin with saya tangan , like semua  barang appears ya but i think  plot is very interesting but 
because saya , saya can bear with  cereka because i skip semua  very disgusting bahagian but if i watch itu if i like without covering itu right saya will have mimpi buruk i think 
ya itu very refreshing saya think itu like better than a lot of k drama 
like better than semua  conventional cerita 
netflix asal cerita very nice like 
and like mereka cerita plot are like , itu not like very normal how do anda say itu like not normal in a good cara 
ya 
ya 
ralat saya just listen to muzik and then i just surf semua youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States to watch a lot of mukbangs but i get hungry after itu , 
so itu not a good idea 
i think like mereka are certain mukbangs that ya , a s m r okay ah ya 
saya think anda need to watch like certain bangsa like account beberapa of mereka are like quite boring actually but there are like certain orang that mereka eat very interestingly and mereka made a lot of sound kesan or like mereka got scalded by hot makanan and then mereka just like react very funny 
like ya if anda watch itu right itu like there are beberapa korean mukbanger ya 
ya very interesting to watch anda can just go and penyelidikan on mereka 
but that a s m r saya think is just that one anda have to depend on anda keutamaan sebab itu differs on semua beberapa orang find itu super pelik 
okay 
mmhmm 
okay describe a masa when anda made a comeback that shut semua up wow itu very , 
itu sendiri is very grand eh like sesuatu that anda do especially , like struck semua then mereka are just like wow but uh 
mm 
but anda work hard 
ya 
tambang was also not like sesuatu that can shut semua up itu isih of like 
itu like mereka belittle saya but then i surprised mereka okay im talking about like saya keluarga ahli lah sebab um itu was a masa when , itu was a masa when saya like went to korea like just with saya kawan  two of kami 
but then like saya keluarga im like 
but saya keluarga ahli think that im very in seperti , uh dependent on mereka and like saya wont ever survive by saya sendiri outside in a dunia alone so itu like mereka didnt even expect saya that saya will ever think of going overseas or saya would go for a like 
and ya then when  pemikiran that i actually when mereka knew that saya actually booked semua  penerbangan and  hotel behind mereka belakang right mereka were just like wah youre for real going , just like ya 
i think itu more of like saya want to just break free from semua  very stressful ya like saya didnt purposely want to like 
anda know surprise mereka also ya 
mm older abang 
ralat , ya actually thats one of  sebab itu why im nampaknya to be very 
dependent 
hais 
ya 
mm 
ya kita can compare kami 
okay 
what is anda best kejutan 
ya 
saya think 
okay 
itu nice , 
i think itu also like a birthday kejutan like 
like itu was that surprising sebab uh saya kawan gave saya a big unicorn but then dia brought itu semua  cara to sekolah 
like , was in secondary sekolah and then ya itu like  unicorn is very huge so dia took itu on like public pengangkutan and then like 
dia pass itu to saya in sekolah and then dia was very embarrassed by itu but then itu like , im like very shook that anda can bring sesuatu so big to sekolah sebab like 
itu was like very funny but ya 
and like 
uh ya teruskan 
mmhmm thats a very pleasant kejutan and anda can stick beberapa pelekat on  belon 
okay so despite  ongoing global ketidakpastian what makes anda optimistic about  masa hadapan 
mm 
ya 
mm 
mmhmm 
ya like very common Kini like anda see semua yang pembersih and semuanya everywhere 
but i think like  perkara thats optimistic about future itu like semua helping masing-masing other out itu like semua  saya see semua  local kedai roti that mereka just make semua  tiny barang kemas for semua  hospital jururawat and doktor 
which is like sesuatu itu little but can like 
like tunjuk penghargaan towards mereka which is very nice and then  cara semua works together 
can really like bantuan to resolve ini covid nineteen lebih pantas 
ya 
ya semua doing mereka bahagian also just for itu to faster end itu 
mmhmm 
ya 
stop  butang kanan okay 
bahagian two positive pengalaman 
um uh  perkara is very simple is just uh when anda help orang anda just help without jangkaan just do  right perkara and uh tidak perlu to think too much about how orang behave or how orang whether orang will help anda or not anda know 
anda just do what anda feel is right 
and uh just do  right perkara ah  rehat anda know uh anda do good anda know good will happen to anda know that jenis of perkara 
and uh saya do remember that uh there was once that saya was driving and then i actually had a flat taip and actually anda know orang actually stop and uh datang and help saya to change  taip and semua itu so anda know there are still good orang out there ah itu just that anda know 
um itu semua about anda know persepsi and how anda look at perkara 
ya ya that was , 
ya  hotel high teh ah ya very , 
oh for saya saya  best kejutan hadiah saya ever gave was to saya isteri that masa tunang when saya actually gave dia a 
a cadangan uh wedding , uh wedding gelang anda see ya wedding gelang so itu was uh one of  best kejutan hadiah saya ever given to sesiapa sahaja 
alright one of  most uh special peristiwa 
that saya ever went with was , and uh in fakta 
itu was saya personal best hidangan that saya ever had in saya hidup was when saya ayah retired then i brought dia to marina bay pasir for uh one to one of  selebriti chef restoran for makan malam 
ah that was one pengalaman that anda know tidak saya nor dia will ever forget 
kita were like  only two India in  whole restoran and uh fine menjamu selera anda know really v saya p jenis of rawatan uh itu was very special 
ya so like ralat yeah what do anda say is very true because anda see  perkara 
nilai is what uh is important in hidup not just uh kejayaan or whatever anda determine as kejayaan or whether itu wang or kekayaan or kemasyhuran or mana-mana of yang jenis of perkara but itu more to 
 kenangan anda create with  yang anda love and uh yang are  
jenis of perkara that actually anda leave behind when itu anda masa to go 
anda know and yang are  perkara that orang will actually remember anda by and uh itu semua about  kenangan that anda create in anda hidup that 
create  kesan and leave  kesan uh whether anda are still around or not around and i feel uh itu  most important perkara in hidup 
ya like anda see now  whole dunia is going through ini uh covid keadaan and uh 
pos covid lock down and semua yang jenis of perkara 
on  bright sisi itu actually give uh orang  peluang to be a bit more appreciative Ke arah hidup uh a bit more appreciative Ke arah 
 perkara that mereka didnt maybe take too seriously or didnt tidak that appreciative because mereka tipu too busy running semua about worth chasing wang and semua ini jenis of perkara 
but terima kasih to ini uh covid keadaan 
anda know anda have a lot of masa to think about hidup think about perkara to think about anda masa hadapan think about  dunia anda know think about perkara which previously anda know maybe uh a lot of orang were a bit negligent and uh anda know taken for granted 
anda see  lain good perkara about when about anda know uh ini covid keadaan lock down 
uh a lot of orang have been given  peluang to actually learn sesuatu new learn beberapa new kemahiran 
uh itu can actually push mereka forward to actually assist mereka anda know to break away 
from  kitaran of maybe anda know kitaran of uh pekerjaan and employ pekerjaan and barang like itu so itu actually how anda look at itu that actually gives anda 
um an peluang to learn sesuatu new to anda know maybe have a ubah in kerjaya laluan or ubah in uh 
in uh in kerja or maybe learn beberapa new kemahiran to do sesuatu on anda own or barang like itu so 
in a cara anda know um kadang-kadang itu takes uh a difficult keadaan to get orang out of mereka keselesaan zon so i think uh ini covid have actually uh done and accomplished that uh 
during ini uh pos covid tempoh 
ya so like uh 
like during ini covid tempoh saya actually got  peluang to do a lot of uh studying and uh 
uh learn beberapa new barang which uh actually uh has uh helped saya to do beberapa good ikatan 
uh saya started uh getting more involved with uh 
pembelajaran of astrologi and barang like itu so itu was jenis of menarik at  same masa uh quite minda membingungkan at  same masa uh saya have ini new ditemui pengetahuan which saya can actually use to 
to help other orang in hidup anda know to guide mereka and to to to help mereka give mereka beberapa akal of arah 
ya saya think thats  most important perkara at  penghujung of  hari anda know uh whatever  good bad ugly anda know semua has to face itu anda know but itu more about how anda overcome itu and uh where do anda go from there anda know thats  most important soalan uh 
so like even like for contoh like now even though  kunci down is actually technically over but im still trying to stay at rumah and still keeping itu low profil at  momen sehingga ini whole isu is completely solved 
and uh once itu is solved then anda know i most probably will be planning to go for a short percutian anda know get out of  negara anda know go and have a little pecah 
ya 
ya so like for saya personally when uh like ever since saya started kerja sehingga hari ini i jangan have uh 
a what anda call a good mentor or a orang to guide anda in  cara to do perkara so uh semua for  masa lalu 
ten twelve tahun semuanya is more of uh 
saya own personal pertumbuhan saya personally try to learn and uh anda know get ketukan fall down wake up again but 
uh personally i always have ini uh never say die sikap and never giving up because saya know that when i achieve what im trying to achieve that itu will be worth itu in  penghujung so i always keep picking saya sendiri up and keep pushing saya sendiri forward and uh 
that i believe is saya greatest kekuatan which is uh help saya pertumbuhan over  past sepuluh to twelve tahun in a lot of cara which uh is uh difficult to explain 
ya ya ya ya 
so basically mm itu about itu lah 
so itu more like anda know itu tidak titik dwelling in  masa lalu and anda know blaming masing-masing other for  covid keadaan or blaming whoever or whatever but itu more important to look forward to see what needs to be done 
as uh more on a personal aras comparing to more of a national aras because 
uh for  national aras  kerajaan is 
doing what mereka need to do as a personal aras kita need to take tanggungjawab and do what kita have to do and semua has to work tangan in tangan to overcome ini uh keadaan so that semua can go back to living a normal hidup and uh 
uh anda know back to how perkara were prior to ini uh covid nineteen virus uh pandemik 
affecting singapura as well as  whole dunia 
so i think that is very important uh what kita need to learn from  pelajaran what anda know what alam semula jadi is teaching kami a pelajaran that kita need to learn and move forward so ya saya think itu about itu 
hai so long never see anda already , 
okay so , 
mm 
mm 
mm mm 
mm 
anda semua 
suited suis waited until like seseorang panggilan dia to 
anda maks ah , 
mm 
but i mean mereka tipu terikat to face ini jenis of , 
ya , ya 
mm 
ah , 
freelance is itu 
oh sejuk okay 
ah which syarikat 
mm mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
full masa pekerjaan and then as anda were saying regarding like not what anda want but more to survival ya 
ya take apa sahaja there is , mm mm 
ya itu true 
mm mm 
and to see but  
how to sit and epal 
mm hmm mm 
mm 
mm ya 
ya 
so kita have beberapa parti who are willing to talk about  minoriti right mm 
a ubah lah 
mm 
mm 
close minded lah 
but then like anda know i see social media semua then like semua  anak muda semua that one is like 
ah kekurangan 
anda started itu , 
tunggu so when anda work anda start at eight betul 
sepuluh minit for  whole shift 
uh ya 
youre not a pagi orang , 
mcgriddle oh ya oh anda like that 
ah itu not a , fixed menu ah 
i jangan know to make orang want itu lah , 
to saya personally i feel like itu too heavy eh for saya suka 
wrong with anda ah , 
oof tuhan damn stop itu girl kita hungry 
wow 
oh , eh ah 
looking be scared probably isnt itu 
did mereka like tidak suka anda , 
for saya i tend to like anda know get saya sendiri into like 
so like for saya drama is like really i dont really face drama ah 
ya like even okay  most ive ever had drama in saya hidup was 
 floorball is itu 
uh ya ah ah 
really i never hear sia 
oh okay 
mm 
mm 
mm mm mm 
ah oh ya 
a lot lah from kami masa there , 
saya dont remember sia , 
oh ah ya 
oh primary secondary or poly ah 
primary sekolah but then  perkara is like primary sekolah , saya was like really young so i tidak have mana-mana like 
anyway let saya , tell anda semua about saya sekolah hidup 
so for primary sekolah kanan saya was from ahmad ibrahim at yishun 
in ahmad ibrahim for just three tahun like primary one to primary three 
so itu was when saya had like 
which i dont really remember what how kita did cause itu was like really super long masa but i remember like tali skipping in hadapan of a lot of orang 
and then like 
i think saya did quite a good kedudukan at  
ah kita have like modern tarian kita have chinese i jangan know why but saya was put into  chinese tarian ya 
so ya primary sekolah was one of  most memorable yang one saya would say 
just like minat uh ya 
uh saya think i dont know ah i mean if like one orang do on dia own ah saya dont really enjoy itu 
saya jangan hargai , ya , 
outdoor pengembaraan kelab 
so from there saya gained a lot of pengalaman like i went batu climbing naga berperahu 
then after itu saya got batu climbing kayaking naga berperahu 
and ya in 
poli ah i mean t p organised itu 
but itu was secondary sekolah ralat but  gadis managed to got third saya think 
kayaking so itu not kami forte jenis of perkara ya then after itu , err then kita got 
so normally when kita did 
 gadis and saya kita have like yang were not very feminine also 
so were like ya so were okay 
so semuanya was like unproblematic but like 
err secondary sekolah saya didnt really enjoy because saya guru werent very , good 
guru ah saya would say ya theyre not very good at teaching and i dont see like kebaikan in mereka also only beberapa 
got into culinary , then after itu 
ini kursus  kopi bahagian is like only one bahagian ya 
and like then ya somehow , then after itu like although like kita did like dapur amalan and barang but 
tiada apa-apa much for saya lah ya 
mm actually i did ah but i feel like saya g p a , 
wow okay mm okay okay 
oh sejuk 
mm 
mm then anda should open a youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States saluran , 
why 
ya i feel like i mean im itu why saya say that can adapt to mana-mana like mana-mana tempat lah tanduk 
ya anda know jack of semua perdagangan , 
ya , 
mm 
mm ya 
ya exactly 
ya so , were caught up 
wow , 
saya think itu jenis of partly true though 
but one perkara id say is like on anda petikan is like err kapitalisme like how selebriti do very minimal 
mm 
ya ya 
mm 
mm ya 
bahagian two positive pengalaman 
okay maybe saya would say  recent pengalaman saya dining pengalaman on jumaat sendiri 
baris gilir ah since covid started kita actually have to queue for a very long masa before kita actually entered  restoran membeli-belah pusat membeli-belah whatever so 
so that hari ah itu was still a long baris gilir as usual so kita were 
ah kita will shop i mean ah kita went shopping then after itu saya and saya kawan gathered to go for makan malam and itu was a quite a long baris gilir but ah to say and kita were just like playing permainan and waiting in  baris gilir so when itu was kami pusing 
 pelayan mereka just came in and like took kami beg in because like one of saya kawan was carrying a very heavy beg because dia was moving from tempat to tempat so dia have to carry a lot of perkara so ah  pelayan just like took  beg and like alih mereka ah move kami to  sitting kawasan , 
and like mereka are really very friendly and welcoming and mereka actually provided semua i mean itu not a very high penghujung restoran is more of like a 
ralat like pelajar friendly restaurant so kita didnt really expect ini perkhidmatan from there so kita got complementary buns when kita actually entered 
and  cara ini ah serve kami mereka already very gentle with kami and because in a crowded malam like mostly orang are frustrated ada padanya a lot of ketegangan going around because ralat like mereka have to serve makanan on masa to um setiap pelanggan and barang but 
at  suasana itu was just very lively and jolly because semua of  pelayan and pelayan 
because kita have not really felt that in a very long masa because covid kita will just stuck at rumah and like kita have tidak human interaksi and that jenis of human interaksi when were out there dining was really very nice after a very tiring hari of membeli-belah and having kelas online and barang 
so i felt itu was really very good and mereka  kos of mereka makanan tidak really itu high per se because like ini jenis of perkhidmatan anda actually had um expect itu from a higher penghujung restoran 
like michelin bintang restoran five bintang restoran and barang but mereka were just a middle julat restoran so i really felt really happy and welcomed there that malam ya what about anda 
ya about itu kita were actually joking after kami hidangan were just like saya think mereka dont deserve ten peratus mereka deserve twenty peratus perkhidmatan cas because kita were really very pleased with mereka perkhidmatan itu hari cause setiap masa kita 
oh anda video is of okay setiap masa kita err go into restoran or mana-mana um saya know 
there was where mereka charge a ten peratus perkhidmatan cas and like extra seven peratus g s t kita just dragged to pay  wang because itu like anda dont see sometimes anda dont really see  titik of itu because theres not much of human interaksi there or say mereka will just like serve anda anda makanan and kita are done because anda just tertib in a tablet and like 
itu goes on but now like ini restoran even though kita were supposed to ah tertib from a tablet actually mereka came in and mereka like um told kami that oh  menu is semua on a tablet and how to tertib if anda really have mana-mana soalan just 
brazilian limun so i was like apa in itu and mereka were actually patient enough to uh entertain kami and tell kami whats up with itu and barang , 
and itu was really very like unlikely because there was a long baris gilir outside there was still a very long baris gilir outside and  whole restoran was packed so i didnt really expect ini perkhidmatan there so kita really thought  ten peratus was just not enough mereka need to get more and barang 
because  kualiti was really too good 
saya think was more of a pekerja percuma because kita dont really think much about itu because kita paid by kredit kad and i mean kita paid by debit kad so kita just paid and left 
for saya  suasana was a bit new is more of like a retro gaya and like a tomboyish um hiasan out there which really sut saya , 
and um  makanan was i mean makanan is makanan lah anda cant really like ah make itu so extravagant and barang anda just taste  same makanan so  makanan was just 
itu wasnt biasa-biasa saja itu wasnt that bad itu was good itu was a decent hidangan for  harga julat which was like ten sembilan puluh for a hidangan at a ralat restoran really a good urus niaga saya would say and there are a pelbagai of sisi hidangan that anda could choose from and minuman 
and mereka were really very affordable so itu really gave kami 
a akal that like kita can feel more comfortable and ordering more hidangan and sharing as a kumpulan and uh there was a lot of pelanggan around and itu wasnt very noisy like there was tidak loud muzik um pondering upon kami which makes kami converseCity in Illinois, United States with kami kawan very hard 
to be made ah compared to like beberapa other bas or restoran itu was really a quiet and peaceful tempat where kita could like carry out kami casual perbualan with kami kawan 
and itu actually made kami feel that kita felt itu was quite homelish ya thats what saya felt 
okay how do anda think covid has change anda pengalaman over perkhidmatan over  past few bulan a bit epal or mana-mana other syarikat anda would like to talk about 
okay for saya err i mean at first when kita first like singapura first face mereka first kunci turun and barang saya felt that semua was very unprepared mereka didnt really know what to do and err a lot of syarikat were going in kerugian to be honest i mean i wasnt talking about  very big syarikat 
but like a small syarikat and like ah a lot going ah under i mean mereka were facing krisis but saya felt after kita got used to itu like one bulan into itu two bulan into itu and after litar pemutus was like lifting fasa one fasa two fasa three saya mean fasa three is yet to come 
ralat mereka actually um got adapted to itu i feel so like tidak jirim what jenis of perkhidmatan anda provided in singapura kebanyakan of  syarikat were 
ready and mereka knew  langkah 
and mereka tried to ah satisfy mereka pelanggan first mereka put mereka pelanggan and ah before apa sahaja for masing-masing small syarikat or big syarikat tidak jirim what as what anda say about nike saya also went to nike Keluar at ah saya m  baris gilir was insane mereka menunggu jam was like two jam three jam long 
so err there was a pelanggan saya mean there was a 
jualan manusia standing at  kembali of  baris gilir and like trying to warn kami like are anda okay if anda standing for two jam queue three jam queue if not anda can just like go around membeli-belah and ah come back later because uh mereka actually give kami 
tip like for contoh oh ralat during makan malam jam  baris gilir will be shorter so youd like rather come back during itu masa so can now have a small pecah makan or sesuatu then anda come back later so that 
antrian are shorter and barang and i mean itu was true i mean mereka knew when  Keluar gets 
err less crowded and uh mereka actually kept kami updated setiap masa kita actually asked during  baris gilir and when kita entered i mean as anda said is a hundred masing-masing pelanggan that can enter  Keluar per masa because itu not a very big ruang so when kita entered 
even though perkhidmatan penyedia were really packed because theres a lot of ralat pelanggan trying on kasut asking for different saiz and err different saya mean there have a lot of different tuntutan for setiap pelanggan per se so of for itu semua were on mereka jari kaki like tidak satu 
was lagging or sitting down or like just chit ah chit berbual and just avoiding pelanggan and barang but mereka were semua there to like provide  perkhidmatan as  best keupayaan and also saya would say  pencegahan mereka did take like be itu tangan hygiene be itu temperature taking and be itu control pengurusan 
saya just feel that itu makes kami feel a bit more lebih selamat to be in ini persekitaran because covid pandemic really hit kami hard 
for quite beberapa masa now err comparing to other negara kita actually have move forward even though kita had a big nombor of kes compared to different negara similar mereka were bigger in populasi compared to kami 
even though itu hit kami very hard kita actually moved on progressively because of  langkah that were put in tempat for um pusat membeli-belah and semua  pelanggan perkhidmatan that provide itu was provided to kami 
and during covid sendiri there was beberapa perkhidmatan provided for contoh err anda starhub t v ah t v sambungan wifi sambungan mereka actually did allow ah 
beberapa of  ah mereka pekerja to actually come down to ah bangsa rumah to check on mereka wifi sambungan and barang 
and i felt that kita were not really left alone by  kerajaan like itu anda own masalah anda solve itu that wasnt  kes that was left around with covid because for saya during covid keadaan during with like during  kunci down saya had to shift rumah because saya was renovating saya rumah and itu was really very troublesome because , 
i mean uh separuh of saya um barang were in  storan jabatan 
under  ah gudang and barang , 
and itu really shook kami a lot because kita dont know if kita are gon na get kami peti sejuk kami normal peralatan for kami to like start kami daily hidup after kita move back shift back to saya rumah and actually uh singapore actually did a good kerja in  akal even though mereka shut down mereka actually 
were open to rayuan ah um for kami to put in tempat so that kita can um mereka can make um pertimbangan 
and allows certain err operasi to still carry out mereka perkhidmatan and barang and itu really helped 
kami to get back to kami rumah ralat during pengubahsuaian and mereka legit took  pencegahan of like not letting more than three err pekerja working at kami same rumah at a masa that was really err semua should be masked up even if anda are 
 pemilik of  rumah or youre coming in to help mereka fix mereka , 
uh air perkhidmatan mereka electronic peranti or apa sahaja itu just  keselamatan langkah were very ah penting in  main of kami covid pemulihan so i felt itu was  kunci to kami kejayaan 
like including  pelanggan penjagaan even though sebab orang bujang are usually more keen to mengeluh and like expressed mereka tidak suka by complaining about ini and itu but  cara um  , i mean  produk perkhidmatan  um , um perkhidmatan penyedia , 
did mereka kerja was really commendable because itu not very easy to pleased semua  dis ah satisfied pelanggan along  cara so i feel that ralat ini was really a big ubah to singapores perkhidmatan sektor because mereka were going down 
at  mula but mereka actually bounce back higher because mereka knew how to manage ah ini keadaan better than most of  negara that was facing itu because when mereka open back mereka perkhidmatan sektor face to face interaksi and stuff mereka covid keadaan actually spiked a bit more 
bahagian two debat tajuk two 
if itu not green  whole masa bundar is itu okay 
oh should be okay 
oh i think i speak too loud oh tidak okay , okay so debate tajuk two uh chinese dialek should be offered as a ibu lidah bahasa 
singapura is an immigrant bangsa with peneroka , coming from semua bahagian of asia , beberapa of kami nenek moyang come from different bahagian of chinaCity in Virginia, United States and bringing with mereka  different chinese varieti such as hokkien 
teochew kantonis and hakkaCity in Illinois, United States based on mereka own dialek kumpulan 
ini is  sebab why many of  older penjanaan converseCity in Illinois, United States in chinese dialek 
chinese dialek have been a bahagian of singapore budaya from  very start kami chinese nenek moyang who migrated from chinaCity in Virginia, United States initially communicated in dialek such as hokkien kantonis and teochew , in fakta 
many of kami datuk dan nenek still communicate through ini dialek and regard itu as an important bahagian of mereka hidup and budaya 
with  diminishing nombor of dialect pembesar suara in singapura itu is of utmost kepentingan that , such subjek are actually offered to pelajar in sekolah so as to preserve  bahasa and  budaya 
should tidak usaha , be made now to combat  keadaan kita will one hari arrive at uh keadaan where fewer and fewer pembesar suara of dialect wujud in kami negara and  bahasa would even become extinct 
eroding an important bahagian of kami budaya 
ini can be seen when uh in singapura  younger and  older generasi are starting to have komunikasi jurang and itu is , so , terrible to  titik that even dialect um pembesar suara penukaran penterjemah are needed 
to communicate between  younger and  older generasi and kita can see that ini penterjemah are usually of orang of  older penjanaan 
ini kerosakan could be irreversible and oleh itu itu is paramount that tindakan is taken now before kita go down ini slippery cerun of losing kami root and kami budaya and ya having a detrimental nada 
ya 
mm okay 
mm while saya can see where leona coming from so to summarise anda titik anda are basically saying that chinese dialek should not be offered as a ibu lidah bahasa because uh orang bujang can barely meet  minimum of kecekapan for english and mandarin 
ya however i think that ini polisi is flawed because uh i heard anda mention previously that mandarin should be  main bahasa in five tahun and ini is set by  kerajaan stating that dialek should not be used at semua is that kanan 
ya so um okay so if anda were to back cuba and kiraan five tahun uh i believe many of kami of kami of  kanak-kanak in singapura have mereka datuk dan nenek and ini penjanaan of datuk dan nenek are more especially  yang who 
typically speak dialek chinese dialek if itu would to be five tahun later uh  chinese dialect budaya and tradisi is still there and to suddenly change  chinese dialek to , eradicate chinese dialek and change itu to mandarin 
would be very inefficient and  masa bingkai of five tahun is too fast if itu too fast for ini older penjanaan of orang to adapt to 
ya , and saya would also like to add on itu many orang bujang , many pelajar in orang bujang are actually learning third bahasa such as japanese and spanish to improve mereka linguistic kebolehan and komunikasi when mereka go abroad 
ini can be ini program can be seen to be implemented in a primary sekolah or a secondary sekolah pendidikan where pelajar have actually  pilihan to take out a third bahasa of mereka keutamaan 
picking up a chinese dialek would have  same impak as  bahasa saya mentioned earlier as there are ratusan of ribuan of dialect pembesar suara abroad in negara such as hong kong taiwan and chinaCity in Virginia, United States 
and ini is imperative to international hubungan as chinaCity in Virginia, United States has a growing pengaruh on  asia pacific rantau due to itu growing ekonomi , um kita can say that chinaCity in Virginia, United States and  u s as 
almost on par with berkenaan to  uh g d p of mereka ekonomi and more especially with chinaCity in Virginia, United States where many cina in mereka negara still speak in mereka regional dialek and not just purely mandarin 
thus if singapura were to incorporate dialek as one of  ibu lidah bahasa for orang bujang , itu could significant greatly enhance komunikasi between rakan from singapura and chinaCity in Virginia, United States , which can actually in pusing 
build better hubungan mereka are actually beneficial to kami negara 
ya 
ya 
okay so um , i think for ini titik i really strongly disagree for  social fabric bahagian not that itu is not an isu saya acknowledge that itu is an isu that kita have to consider if kita would to offer chinese dialek as one of kami ibu lidah bahasa 
however if kita actually consistently fear that  social fabrik in singapura would tear due to ini uh faktor is very short sighted of kami to think ini cara because incorporating chinese dialek can offer singapore many economic 
manfaat 
ya with berkenaan to ini um saya think uh  kerajaan has to take lain langkah of ukuran to address ini social perkauman isu should chinese dialek be offered as a ibu lidah bahasa ya with however i dont think that itu should be a sebab why chinese dialek should not be offered as a ibu lidah bahasa 
ya which however i dont think that itu should be a sebab why chinese dialek should not be offered as a ibu lidah bahasa 
mm and although i agree that kita can still communicate with orang from chinaCity in Virginia, United States just using  bahasa of mandarin um saya believe that in a perniagaan perdagangan good hubungan has to be established , is uh 
a perniagaan hubungan can be established by building very good persahabatan or perniagaan rakan hubungan with  other rakan which can bring about economic manfaat also i would like to throw in a statistik here so um  singapores largest perdagangan rakan is china 
standing at u s d fifty one titik six billion dolar , so kita can see itu uh singapura has been actively uh having a good perdagangan hubungan with chinaCity in Virginia, United States 
and that uh kita can also see that kita can also infer that many uh there are many behind  adegan faktor of ini perdagangan hubungan with chinaCity in Virginia, United States uh such that uh maybe orang bujang have been flying over to china to conduct perniagaan and chinaCity in Virginia, United States has 
chinaCity in Virginia, United States orang have been flying over to singapore to conduct perniagaan as well and then uh naib versaCity in Illinois, United States so kita can see itu um uh many mesyuarat has been um established to meet masing-masing other for ini jenis of perniagaan peluang and i think that to build even better hubungan 
dialek can be incorporated because why itu would seem that uh orang bujang have  uh goes  extra batu and usaha to actually familiarise diri mereka sendiri with mereka perniagaan rakan which is a very important faktor to conduct a perniagaan hubungan with mereka 
mm 
saya agree that i agree that um 
anda have to actually meet  terdedah minimum of kecekapan for kedua-duanya bahasa of english and mandarin before even incorporating chinese dialek , so in ini uh kes right saya think more can be done to  pendidikan kurikulum of kedua-duanya bahasa such that um singaporean pelajar are actually better equipped 
with  main bahasa and can actually hold additional um chinese dialek to mereka modul yeah 
okay , 
but  perkara about kewangan definitely  first perkara comes up comes is wang and uh 
of kursus uh kewangan bijak uh how are kita going to manage itu 
manage  wang and steward  wang bijak so kewangan is actually is a very broad uh 
subject if anda should say uh ya so i think uh if anda would ask saya under kewangan like uh how would i actually invest saya wang uh to actually grow in  kewangan in saya uh in uh individu hidup 
uh kita can actually discuss on uh how and i want to hear anda pendapat on how anda would actually uh tumbuh in anda kewangan 
ya so 
so when saya have a stable salary let say uh im berfungsi and uh saya have uh jumlah of wang what saya will do is actually split  salary into four bahagian 
and  sakit uh ill take contoh let say itu about four k five k , okay then five k let say i split itu into four uh bahagian ill take , one suku of itu and uh invested into 
um 
stok or sifat 
uh that is itu are actually stable and healthy and  other three suku definitely i will use itu for personal tujuan and uh ah for hiburan tujuan also uh and also in berkenaan to itu uh 
saya think penjimatan are very important 
so i will actually uh take lain jumlah of wang and put itu into penjimatan like saya believe that p o s b has ini uh e penjimatan account 
where kita can actually uh urus from kami main akaun uh to  e penjimatan account directly uh in a , in a certain tarikh that kita give to mereka uh so thats how i actually ya thats how i actually i would do itu uh so i want to hear from anda how anda 
mm mm mm mm okay mm 
saya believe that over a longer tempoh of masa when kita have itu two peratus minat terkumpul then um , then  deposit that anda put in will grow anda see uh but 
talking about stok uh p o s b has uh d b s mereka have ini uh perkara called d b s because if im not wrong uh d b s because so i ive 
uh saya believe itu is lain alternative pilihan that kita can actually put kami wang into so there in uh in  masa of perlu in  masa hadapan kita can uh take itu wang out for certain tujuan like contoh uh kami bersara 
so uh in singapores context uh now as kita save 
uh let say kita are saving uh wang ah how would anda actually direct itu towards anda bersara rancang 
perbelanjaan and also  uh also going back to  first soalan where kita talk about uh how do anda accumulate kekayaan in eh for planning for bersara ya 
so i believe there are 
saya think there are , i believe there are two pilihan uh berkenaan to c p f when itu comes to c p f uh there are two pilihan where kita can actually draw wang monthly 
after kita are fifty five saya believe  umur is fifty five to draw  wang and also theres lain pilihan where anda can actually take  pukal jumlah 
and uh do what do anda need to do with  wang um 
so many orang what mereka encourage is for ini fifty five and above ini , uh dewasa to actually , draw  wang uh monthly but  perkara uh is that  jumlah that anda get monthly from  c p f 
uh can vary and also itu semua depends on  gaji that anda have earned uh ini semua ini past tahun and also um ,  jumlah is very little uh when itu comes to singapores context and  piawai of hidup here 
uh itu uh , i believe itu about 
uh one to three k if im not wrong one to two k itu what anda would get actually from monthly uh c p f uh ansuran but what whats anda pendapat on rather drawing itu monthly or would anda rather actually uh 
would anda rather actually uh anda know take  pukal jumlah when youre when anda reach umur fifty five 
mmhmm 
mm so that , so anda believe itu is more lebih selamat so that anda wont actually spend itu uh unwisely on like 
one tembak on like anda know certain perkara is itu like anda have  godaan to spend semua of mereka uh one tembak 
ya that thats uh itu one paparan but let say  individu is very , discipline  in mereka 
in mereka uh 
mereka tipu really disciplined in  cara mereka manage mereka wang  cara mereka steward mereka wang saya think mereka might uh ini individu might actually 
uh obtain for  pukal jumlah of wang 
uh but i tekaan itu varies itu and itu depends on masing-masing individu anda see um on what are mereka planning in  masa hadapan like contoh mereka might take  pukal jumlah of wang and mereka might use itu for like big tiket perbelanjaan like anda know mereka might just want to 
uh go with mereka isteri to like uh various um , various negara like travelling and semua that , um 
so itu saya believe that  pukal jumlah also anda know might help uh certain orang like 
beberapa individu mereka might have hutang like for  uh huge jumlah of hutang and  only sumber where mereka can actually settle  hutang would be uh ini c p f wang that mereka have accumulated over masa 
so i believe that even  pukal jumlah of wang mereka have mereka pros 
also like anda said theres  cons where anda know mentioned about perbelanjaan itu unwisely so uh coming to  second uh soalan if i uh what strategi would anda recommend to seseorang planning for mereka 
big tiket expenditures lets bincang about uh buying a rumah in singapura 
as a young dewasa like kedua-duanya of kami like uh what are  perjuangan that kita may face or what are  , 
financial perancangan kita need to do cara earlier so that anda know when  masa comes when kita get married kita are able to 
mampu uh were able to put in itu uh down pembayaran anda know so whats anda strategi for itu 
yes uh saya believe that when  when saya mentioned about  buying a kereta or rumah let say um 
sebab kita see many belia especially many young dewasa around uh above dua puluh five less than tiga puluh when mereka are at  umur of perkahwinan saya believe uh mereka tipu struggling 
uh sebab um , apparently mereka are not able to anda know get  desired rumah mereka want uh so uh saya 
believe that if itu individu had planned uh , uh started saving up 
with  little jumlah that mereka little jumlah of wang mereka get uh like just very small bahagian then i think eventually over  , next few tahun itu might actually help mereka uh , even if itu a very small peratusan because of  high piawai of hidup in singapura especially , 
so in other big tiket expenditures starting a keluarga yes like anda said that kita need to be financially stable , because when anda start a keluarga means uh anda want to have kanak-kanak and then uh when anda have a when anda want to have kanak-kanak 
uh where uh anda want to anda want to think whether anda can financially support mereka pendidikan as well 
so uh in itu paparan i believe there are financial uh saya mean uh starting a keluarga kita have to be financially stable ya so coming to kami next 
titik how do anda how do errhow should i d saya y or 
get a financial penasihat to plan saya kewangan what do anda think about anda know getting a external uh orang to actually help anda with anda kewangan 
so there is a isu of amanah there also anda see 
so when anda actually hire a financial penasihat theres a isu of amanah sebab like anda are actually , giving mereka  autoriti to actually handle anda wang , and if anda and if mereka actually do not know what theyre doing 
or anda know theyre just uh mereka tipu just starting out ini financial penasihat uh peranan then kita would be  guinea babi actually to lose kami a lot of wang so i agree with what anda actually say um 
moreover especially uh when kita know uh pengetahuan about uh how to put kami wang 
into  right tempat like stok pelaburan and uh even uh real estet is lain huge 
uh tajuk and  
and i think talking about stok once again uh before what before kita actually get into  stok pasaran as young dewasa uh ada padanya uh i believe that there is ini 
uh amalan mereka call itu Kertaspaper size perdagangan i dont know if anda have heard of ini uh istilah called Kertaspaper size perdagangan where actually anda take  data from  stok pasaran and then what anda do is uh anda transfer itu to an excel helaian and then anda create a algoritma or like a formula to actually 
uh bantuan anda with  perdagangan and then Kertaspaper size perdagangan in a akal where anda amalan anda perdagangan like with a certain jumlah of wang in itu excel helaian then uh when anda really have itu jumlah of wang youre actually ready to uh put itu into  stok pasaran 
but then again 
but then again when anda actually have  real wang 
and anda put itu into a stok pasaran uh what happens is emosi come in main because anda know if anda are seeing diri anda losing wang in itu stok pasaran ah , anda will anda know youll mula feeling anxious anda will start feeling nervous and uh full of takut 
so i think i believe that Kertaspaper size perdagangan is one cara that young dewasa actually could 
um , grow diri mereka sendiri into ini tabiat of Kertaspaper size perdagangan ya mm 
so that itu saya pendapat on also like uh when anda talk about financial penasihat stok and anda know so next soalan is what nasihat would anda know anda give to seseorang uh if mereka are in hutang 
like 
mm mm mm 
what nasihat would i give to seseorang to get dia dia or dia keluar of hutang saya believe uh in  konteks of young dewasa like um 
uh kredit kad like actually can get many orang into uh hutang in a akal where mereka have to pay a lot back to  kerajaan and uh 
saya would actually discourage young dewasa like if mereka tipu really 
uh mereka tangan are itchy mereka want to buy a lot of perkara and theyre very passionate about like uh hiburan and pakaian and semua that um saya believe that uh kredit kad might be an pilihan might be a really good pilihan is really tempting to get a kredit kad and anda know use itu when anda dont have wang 
to buy perkara that anda really can not afford but uh in  long istilah what happens is itu accumulates and itu accumulates into a huge jumlah that uh anda might not be able to pay off immediately so talking about 
hutang saya nasihat is uh definitely uh kita had anda have to restrict and start saving up 
wang if possible uh to actually offset that uh that debts especially in singapores context cause  pinjaman 
uh mereka give is and uh is a lot anda know but there are many orang are still struggling with hutang at  middle uh middle pendapatan and  low pendapatan so saya nasihat would be , penjimatan lah penjimatan and  lesser spendings would be  bantuan i will give mereka ya will be saya nasihat ya 
bahagian one financial related tajuk 
so danish do anda have mana-mana 
pengalaman with pelaburan related produk like have anda traded before 
for whatsoever saya know anda studying like kewangan kanan 
ralat 
im 
spend beberapa of saya free masa reading up on quite a bit of semua of ini so most i fahami just maybe 
like 
unit amanah and e t f 
a bit like 
 different kemahiran a bit foggy lah saya understand that 
e t f anda can sell itu anda can actually like perdagangan  e t f on  
like on  stok pasaran and semua itu jenis of barang kanan but unit amanah anda can not but itu still a 
pooled dana is itu 
ya 
ya lah basically unit amanah managed by a dana pengurus lah 
orh okay 
ya  rehat quite semua right lah quite easy to understand saya personally got 
buy beberapa saham here and there but  rehat 
never really as in  rehat saya know what mereka are lah but i never go and invest in mereka also 
anda do anda 
have mana-mana pengalaman with anda dont have mana-mana pengalaman at semua kanan like forex or what that masa anda were trading with beberapa 
saya know anda were doing beberapa uh demo akaun or sesuatu like itu for forex 
eh or eh tidak itu was u s stok pasaran kanan 
ah okay 
tidak 
not even if yeah anda are going to experience ah 
ya pengetahuan lor ya 
riskier a bit i would say komoditi and pilihan a bit 
more turun naik 
more fluctuating lah forex also a bit crazy 
ya uh mm , 
ya saya have i use 
ya d b s vickers to buy 
s g x listed stok ah yeah itu for anda leh 
mm tidak saya dont but i know about  stashaway orh piawai yang 
ya yang few ah 
quite trendy now but ya i never cuba before 
mm yeah itu a good cara to 
to speed lah just that mereka were saying like beberapa tough like anda dont have a lot of kawalan over what anda wang goes into and semua that 
ya so what about kripto im pasti anda dont do kripto lah ah since anda said anda have tidak pengalaman saya also dont kripto 
ya ah hmm 
ya 
c p f wang saya dont invest c p f wang but saya know about itu i personally think that ,  c p f pelaburan skema is quite good because , um 
when anda pull out from like  c p f wang for bersara and semua itu jenis of barang itu 
over  ,  many tahun like pertimbangkan kita are quite young lah if anda start investing itu 
early , ya i think itu , 
like itu a good cara to grow anda bersara jumlah so when anda pang kang is like anda have quite a bit of um wang to last , uh through anda bersara tempoh lah then uh 
but personally also i think  c p f 
minat kadar are quite good even if yang whod maaf 
uh saya cant remember exactly but for masing-masing akaun itu is quite alright one saya remember i think itu 
itu mungkin got i know one of mereka akaun is i think better than  inflasi kadar 
sesuatu like itu even got  ordinary akaun ah saya cant remember exactly which one lah now but , ya i had saya did consider like probably next masa when saya go out to work i would want to invest a bit ya 
i think can im not sure whats  like whats  what do anda call itu ah 
like are anda how flexible is itu and semua itu jenis of barang lah are anda allowed to choose anda exact instrumen or apa sahaja but saya know that 
as in i jangan know if anda are limited to like maybe singapore stok or sesuatu like itu also ah itu why saya not very sure but saya know that 
saya probably will lah next masa 
ya but saya know anda need to transfer beberapa wang over 
and invest  wang because only one of  akaun can invest if im not wrong 
ya itu why next masa orh 
tidak i dont i think itu more for yang 
like saya would say lah itu more for orang who have a benjolan jumlah 
then mereka want to just park itu there in a very safe tempat that confirm get beberapa kembali one 
ya 
um okay saya personally think investing is not similar to gambling at semua because , itu like a anda are taking like a calculated risiko whereas judi is just 
like itu tuah ah 
ya but then for investing itu like 
anda have 
a lot of cara to go and find out how well performing or like  possible persembahan of different err instrumen or whatsoever lah like stok or whatever anda like anda can at least read  berita and then make an informed keputusan about itu , and uh um 
if anda actually go and study trend and semua itu like a technical analisis anda actually be able to understand how like  permintaan and bekalan affects  harga mereka can make better keputusan orh so i dont feel itu like gambling but i feel that 
like maybe hari perdagangan is a bit riskier lah so if a lot of orang that go into itu , mereka dont actually , know as much about itu as what mereka think so i think itu a bit like gambling ya to be honest ya if anda dont know about itu thats not a calculated risiko anymore 
ya gila , 
ya , itu dare itu not smart already ah 
ya do anda think pilihan are worth looking at 
for new tunai strapped pelabur 
ya , oh 
so to stop kerugian is  masalah is  bigger kebimbangan lah 
oh okay , 
ya saya think leverage is 
useful especially like for tunai strapped pelabur loh but ya anda have to know anda have to be able to and anda still have to know anda produk well lah tidak jirim what like 
ya tidak leverage everythings at  penghujung of  hari itu still ya a lot of uh saya hear didengar of a lot of kawan who like mereka just invest , and dont know about stop kerugian semua ini jenis of perkara like how to put with  broker and how to indicate mereka stop kerugian and semua itu wah itu crazy one ya 
itu is itu a nisbah lah basically  broker oh 
tidak but leverage produk like most okay most broker mereka use leverage right anda can only leverage 
a certain jumlah based on how much anda put into  akaun 
so like ya itu not like a endless jumlah lah so let say i put like if for contoh ten k inside so saya leverage will move accordingly lah if compared to a lelaki who has only five k anda can not leverage much as saya lor ya itu just like ya so 
i think itu still alright lah ya quite alright 
mm , ya , oh 
saya got beberapa i got pengalaman in ini itu because i penyelidikan before i open broker basically , c d p or custodian akaun kanan is basically , ralat 
uh like anda broker is itu is when anda buy saham is itu under ini  is itu under c d p so means itu like tied to anda nama lah anda singpass and apa sahaja 
c d p is central depositori 
sesuatu ah ya itu basically tied to anda nama lah  saham whereas custodian akaun right itu tied to  broker 
so means to say like a lot of ya a lot of broker akaun is like 
itu definitely hari peniaga in a hari peniaga swing peniaga mereka always use custodian akaun because , mereka dont need to hold for like dividen and semua itu and mereka dont need pemilikan of  kongsi pasaran theyre just perdagangan based on , harga turun naik whereas c d p is 
okay so for contoh if like let say 
uh lelaki a and lelaki b kedua-duanya buy masing-masing beli from one jenis of akaun kanan , and mereka kedua-duanya by  same stok then mereka hold for mereka just didnt sell mereka just buy semalam mereka buy semalam then hari ini mereka pass away , ya so ini so  lelaki with  c d p akaun right  saham 
are actually under dia nama lah so hes why dia isteri or dia pasangan or dia uh kanak-kanak kanak-kanak can take over ya whereas  other lelaki itu belongs to  broker firma oh ya thats  
ya exactly ya , 
then  itu what ya , ini 
tidak ya anda can move on to  next soalan 
uh saya think anda will know more about ini than saya do lah but saya know itu 
itu a bit crazy because of 
semuanya that is happening in  u s semuanya is so overvalued teslaCity in Texas, United States in one minggu can go up to like what one titik eight right last minggu 
i think saya 
ya 
ya , last minggu was crazy then i didengar in itu few hari just drop semua  cara back down to one titik four again ya so itu a bit siao ah 
mm , ya 
ya saya think so too lah , 
mm , oh mm um 
mm saya dont really have a keutamaan kedua-duanya are managed by dana pengurus like actively managed instrumen 
saya only know one ya lah 
itu passive meh then whom 

oh ya saya only read i bermaksud 
i think i only remember saya saw sesuatu like itu around itu almost 
 same jenis just that e t f anda can sell itu to other orang orh like saya can buy and i can sell itu on  pasaran 
sesuatu like itu 
itu indeks dana ah 
ya ya kita are also not very sure kita move on orh , 
kita answer bahagian by bahagian loh and ya  stok pasaran is not  ekonomi what do anda think 
hmm ya saya think so also itu not itu maju looking lah basically stok pasaran is forward looking , is influenced by a lot of faktor and itu doesnt ya saya also thought itu was but actually 
anda think about itu is just a permainan of permintaan and bekalan lah changing a harga which gives a syarikat 
more modal to leverage on  perniagaan but itu doesnt min that  syarikat also performing well 
ya like anda can see s i a stok for contoh mereka , theyre doing well but then mereka just reported like what one billion dolar 
kerugian ya itu cukup gila also 
yeah lilit itu up 
positive pengalaman 
mm mmhmm 
masa are bad ah mm 
simpan saya going ah mm actually i have a kerja ah jangan know about anda ah 
saya see uh apart from ini , 
mm have a kerja like , that earns quite a substantial jumlah ini hari so i think im good on itu , and currently is  cuti i dont really have much uh , perkara on saya jadualkan so yes i cuba to earn a little bit of 
pendapatan ya , and uh being very thrifty uh ya so , okay being very thrifty , being very thrifty 
uh im uh ya uh im actually uh quite , 
um uh that thats a , thats a dark masa lalu in , that thats a dark uh dark momen in saya , in saya uh past ya and ah um 
recouped yang kerugian actually with saya current kerja ya but of kursus uh itu been traumatising then 
oh saya see mm 
tolakan itu , 

mm am i one of yang kawan 
am i one of yang kawan , 
saya see uh , 
uh saya agree on itu 
um so basically ini covid nineteen pandemic pasukan nearly most perniagaan to go shift mereka perkhidmatan 
online ya and uh cut down on uh mereka bata and mortar or mereka 
pejabat are being shut down and mereka force 
a lot of mereka pekerja to work from rumah uh and beberapa of ini syarikat actually realise itu uh is a lot more kos cekap mereka save a lot 
more on uh 
kemudahan and pejabat peralatan and actually mereka still able to get  kerja done and mereka still able to 
produced projek for most of ini syarikat but of kursus when itu comes to like uh retail kedai or maybe bread kedai or restoran 
ada padanya a mereka also are facing mereka own cabaran ah yes so uh on uh saya own personal pengalaman uh 
uh as im a pelajar right now itu doesnt really affect saya as much as pembelajaran can be easily migrated to uh online ya ya but if 
uh teknologi syarikat actually tech syarikat uh should be able to cope with ini krisis uh in ini hari 
mm , ini litar pemutus kunci , actually 
itu is to add on with  s i a pengalaman manusia uh to be honest um , 
if saya were to say i im ive not been crying at malam itu will be a bohong ah 
mm , 
will anda ask , anda ask 
mm saya try to um reach out and socially ya and uh saya try to find cara to connect back actually ya , to think itu uh in ini current umur and masa were sedemikian a connected a globally with kami internet and such but 
yet saya still quite i still feel quite disconnected so 
um ya , could kita just change topic theres tidak positive sisi to ini 
uh ya of kursus saya get to wake up late at masa , at masa uh beyond nine thirty ya and um saya get to capaian saya kerja uh immediately , atas talian 
uh ya 
um what about anda what are beberapa of anda positive pengalaman in ini um covid sembilan belas era 
oh really oh wow saya see , 
wow well could anda elaborate on what jenis of uh , produk or perkhidmatan anda manage to sell on ini laman , 
oh anda have tidak kemahiran 
mm booming because of  covid nineteen krisis semua orang is turning Ke arah elektronik ya 
wow 
anda are so anda are taking kelebihan of  uh keadaan to anda 
saya apologies seizing  peluang , 
what a dermawan 
oh saya 
oh saya , ive never didengar of ini sebelum or could anda uh elaborate more about ini 
itu really anda did mention ini um , itu must have slipped saya minda um was  

mm that bahagian is true yes but mm , i should really learn more about uh anda kemajuan Ke arah um haiwan peliharaan as well to saya itu just semua um  komuniti and  orang mm very touching of anda to do sedemikian a perkara mmhmm 
oh yang tau gay yes wow , 
well 
kita can safely say that im  one im  more thrifty one here already yes if only saya had  yang pendapatan uh from anda shopee or koruslaCity in Illinois, United States saya would invest in um 
in s p c a ya beberapa of  organisasi in singapura ya well 
to explain that one masa in secondary sekolah uh , saya was having a rough masa saya was 
going through akil baligh saya dont know about anda , but , 
anda know yang masa uh after p e sesi where anda will go to  loker bilik and steal other bangsa underwear for beberapa sebab , 
tidak anda will i ditangkap anda sniffing mereka and then , running off like , were anda being thrifty 
ya 
ow 
wow , ah 
oh im sorry manusia im sorry itu been 
so long ago saya , itu must have uh , blurred in saya ingatan or beberapa mm anda could be wiping anda peluh as well with yang uh embroidered sapu tangan , 
ya , 
okay , itu hari 
itu was a few minggu after anda sapu tangan insiden , actually i was just retrieving saya item in a nearby loker outside  , 
um , changing bilik actually , i dont know what anda saw , could have been uh lain one of kami rakan sekelas anda know , yes could anda have forgotten maybe mistaken itu for 
lain orang , 
mm could itu been that kita went to different secondary sekolah because , i dont believe kami prinsipal allowed uh mohawk rambut gaya so itu in kami sekolah 
well 
okay , that might be true , im obviously a pemberontak thats why maybe saya took a bit of uh tau gay back rumah anda know bending  peraturan and such 
oh 
oh saya see , well nice lelaki kemasan last , 
oh manusia , now youre making saya blush , 
mm ya yang hari , 
mm napping sesi oh 
mm if uh i recall um eight to two was kami kelas right apa ours was 
pelajaran masa kanan , onward um 
ah saya see , i see , so thats how dia 
uh maybe itu was for anda but , actually thats how anda got diri anda into uh n t u perniagaan could i see maybe saya should adopt such amalan in  masa hadapan 
wah thats a unique strategi ah wow 
ah could have done so much more well in saya hidup if saya did that 
mm  , 

um ya maybe 
saya understand why anda find sekolah so boring anda know because semua  gadis will just anda know flock around saya and just ignore anda , ya itu could have been uh , that negative pengalaman on anda sisi anda should save ini for  later perbincangan ya 

okay 
mm 
um baiklah okay in saya personal pendapat im actually quite envious of anda uh empathy Ke arah lain as well 
and anda lovingness uh of anda kawan and keluarga around anda like anda embroidered sapu tangan uh relating to anda nenek , thats a actually very sweet and saya should get one embroidered sapu tangan saya sendiri , mm 
mm , mm 
positive pengalaman 
um okay do anda want to start , yup um i think maybe 
beberapa memorable pengalaman with ya same 
would be just like um  masa anda have in sekolah 
and  interaksi anda have with  orang in sekolah , 
and um being carefree and not really having mana-mana perkara to worry about 
oh ya , ya 
saya think lain memorable pengalaman would be like  argumen , too 
in a cara sebab mereka were 
ya like itu was itu quite funny anda know looking back at itu 
yup , 
okay so um bincang about fond kenangan of a haiwan peliharaan that anda have or once had i think tiada of kami had haiwan peliharaan so 
tidak 
ya but like itu aid masing-masing other so , never minda 
oh ya so basically  ibu gave kelahiran to kanak-kanak 
eight ya eight kanak-kanak tidak itu was seven 
itu gave kelahiran to um like a few kanak-kanak like multiple kanak-kanak 
and then , 
 mum makan 
 bayi alive 
itu just devour mereka hidup right after giving kelahiran like uh 
oh ya itu was weird 
ya um okay um mm thats a good soalan , um 
yup saya think traveling 
definitely like travelling to setiap single negara 
in  entire dunia 
buying a rumah 
like buying rumah that saya want to buy 
and paying off  rumah so im not being in hutang 
by like tiga puluh five or sesuatu no by empat puluh 
ya that will be um 
ya like just not waste masa what 
at bila-bila masa 
yup , 
ya exactly 
um currently not much 
because anda know covid kita have to stay at rumah and , cant even go out freely and do apa sahaja so itu 
itu not  best , 
saya think not even like currently not much but like throughout  um nineteen tahun that ive been alive not much 
i mean like being hmm yup , yup 
mm ya itu is really hard 
ya like sembilan puluh nine peratus of itu 
ya was pretty boring 
and itu very rutin also 

yup definitely um 
ya i think just like  orang , 
and like just  rawak pengalaman and like  rawak funny momen and barang like itu anda dont even remember but itu happened 
but ya , um , yeah sebab ya , ya um 
describe an pengalaman where anda iman in manusia has renewed 
um saya think 
um saya think for saya um ini past tahun has been um 
saya iman in manusia has not been renewed itu has been  complete bertentangan 
just with semuanya happening and orang being , irresponsible and racist tend homofobik 
ya 
and like orang not wearing topeng in public 
and perkara that like ya 
true warna yeah and expose semua 
ya , yeah , 
ya then youll just know who to avoid 
ya i feel like most , orang are just not like decent human makhluk 
ya , cara worse ya mereka cara lebih teruk 
ya  palang is underground 
praising orang for  banned keperluan 
ya exactly 
um , what was anda favorite zaman kanak-kanak makanan or snek 
oh yeah saya like itu , 
is  red warna perkara kanan 
ya itu comes in a campurkan that has like cebisan and barang and then theres that perkara ya 
ya 
 only perkara saya makan and itu makes kami studied perkara 
itu taste crusty saya dont know saya just mm what 
oh tidak mereka are 
mmhmm , 
ya tiada apa-apa really sticks out , 
yup um saya think 
itu would be 
like  covid keadaan 
sebab anda initially i think itu was really scary and itu was really bad but now anda know what to do anda know anda just need to wear topeng , 
anda need to maintain kebersihan and 
just 
if anda stay at rumah jangan go out 
go to doctor get to swap mereka 
anda know that like oh that cara to manage itu so itu actually better than expected is not that bad 
at least in singapura itu isnt 
yup , um 
oh itu milik anda , 
oh is bad oh anda what um 
i think i cant titik pintas  nicest perkara 
off  atas of saya kepala but i think semua is , 
in tentera is pretty nice in general 
anda know theyre not too bad 
ya 
ya , um do anda want to go first , ya actually same 
ya tambang also same perkara , 
like just eat good makanan and ya 
so thats pretty bagus , 
yup with  pemimpin , 
tell bincang about a masa when anda experienced personel kumpulan 
ya saya can definitely relate to itu saya think , just being , being more um 
sedar of 
semuanya itu going on now , has um ini 
changed saya perspektif on a lot of perkara and saya pandangan on a lot of perkara 
yup , 
ya same like a lot of itu like sejajar semula for saya 
after becoming more aware sebab saya feel like maybe kita were jenis of like sheltered or like in a bubble slightly 
ya , yup , 
um saya think  basic barang like um bantuan and 
makanan 
and being in a negara where  pandemik is controlled well 
and whenever anda step outside itu not like oh am i going to catch covid then die 
because in other negara that is  realiti of keadaan like if mereka catch covid mereka dont even have capaian to kesihatan penjagaan and theres tidak katil in  hospital and mereka would 
ini high peluang of dying exactly yeah 
or even like from just stepping out of anda rumah 
sebab tidak one wears a topeng 
ya 
ya like bila-bila masa anda go somewhere anda need to scan in and stuff like itu 
ya 
ya super kawalan 

ya same 
ya anda dont mmhmm ah yup ya kita really are 
um what is  kemahiran or an keupayaan that anda are secretly proud of having 
ya same im not secretive about itu , 
ya 
theres tidak sebab to hide itu 
true um 
itu a great soalan , 
oh saya think oh okay ya anda go first 
oh saya think itu was itu last tahun 
ya was last tahun 
for saya ulang tahun um i bought saya sendiri airpod so that was nice 
i think itu  because usually um saya jangan have 
i mean i wouldnt i mean 
ive never bought saya sendiri sesuatu on saya ulang tahun before , 
so yup 
so itu was pretty nice , yeah ya 
ya true also 
ya itu nice 
oh when was that 
oh ya 
yup that was , um 
describe anda perfect hari 
oh um saya think saya perfect hari would be um waking up pretty late like maybe one p m 
at , 
ya so um okay not one saya think one uh a little bit too late maybe eleven tiga puluh , 
and then going for brunch 
so like early brunch or sesuatu and then 
but 
uh tidak actually tidak saya wouldnt go out i have to stay at rumah because , 
going out wont be  perfect hari so  makanan has to be delivered to saya rumah , 
and maybe like makanan laut 
like ketam and lobster anda know , 
and um eating itu and then 
ya makan that 
and um maybe like watching a cereka but like after i makan saya 
tidak need to wash  plat or basuh apa sahaja so i just makan and then 
ya , and um 
and then , um , 
ya probably yeah just being like malas out  whole hari or sesuatu , 
ya itu also true 
ya 
ya and like tidak telefon 
tidak telefon and tidak gambar 
ya 
ya definitely tidak gambar cause like once anda start taking gambar youll start taking like three other more and then  whole outing itu just mengambil gambar 
exactly yeah , true what is a datang , 
um saya think for saya im not a picky pemakan so i can eat mana-mana apa sahaja 
ya like apa sahaja that tastes good sakit eat itu 
mmhmm same , okay um , 
i think like um gen z is 
really different from  other generasi cause  other generasi are just 
okay not semua but like a lot of mereka are and maybe not in okay in singapura is not so bad but like in  dunia agenda , 
mereka tipu just , yeah , yeah 
ya exactly and i think semua like even  yang in like 
kami penjanaan or  younger orang or milenium or apa sahaja in general , who are 
quite conservative in mereka pandangan not that theres apa sahaja wrong with itu but who are like 
mereka like anda have an , peluang to , educate mereka because of 
social media and semuanya 
and a lot of mereka arent as degil and mereka tipu okay with being educated and like being called out so 
ya , ya and mereka like 
being like in membantu in a legit sistem mereka find keselesaan and that but i think for kami is like bertentangan like , a lot of orang in ini penjanaan mereka are against like kapitalisme and like perkara like itu so okay ended okay 
bahagian two positive pengalaman 
oh bahagian two positive pengalaman 
okay 
describe a masa when anda were helped by seseorang in anda masa of perlu 
anda wan na go first or i go first 
ah okay 
kita literally had to um 
bimbang about  next hari not even  next minggu or  next bulan kita have to constantly keep worrying about  next hari and then uh kita didnt know what to do and then um 
saya always had pride isu with um asking for bantuan anda know 
itu really hard to break out of kebanggaan isu anda know and then 
uh sometimes when i went to um before saya gave kelahiran saya went to um s o comcare for bantuan and then um , saya was jenis of uh 
i jenis of dapat like funny kelihatan from  social pekerja and then like 
itu jenis of like sakit saya kebanggaan so i stopped going because i thought like mungkin like 
saya was given like funny kelihatan because like 
saya couldnt receive like saya im not that eligible to receive bantuan 
and there are other orang in perlu so i stopped going and then um 
there was uh one hari uh saya f s c social pekerja came and then uh dia told kami to 
to go and get bantuan and then dia referred saya to um organisasi to get bantuan and i think itu was very helpful anda know 
dia didnt just like give saya like 
wang dia actually gave saya um uh organisasi to go to get bantuan and itu was because 
uh itu was because dia actually gave saya organisasi to get bantuan and saya anak is in sekolah now anda know and im already um uh looking for pekerjaan at  right tempat and im perasaan positive about itu 
ya so 
ya that was itu , 
ya saya social pekerja from uh keluarga perkhidmatan pusat 
because i im under umur and saya had , saya have one unwed anak kanan and then mereka um itu prosedur in singapura to have social pekerja to assess saya keadaan to see whether im kompeten 
im a kompeten ibu im in  right keadaan of minda to care for a anak uh and then uh menilai saya , financial keadaan and perkara like itu and itu is uh mereka will give saya um 
like pautan and will uh refer saya to ini organisasi that organisasi like contoh anak perempuan of esok mereka helped saya with um preparing for pekerjaan anda know and babes helps uh remaja mum 
so like mereka refer saya here and there and then like i feel like itu helped a lot really itu helped a lot so 
itu was during itu masa and then dia asked saya to go back to s o and get  financial bantuan because saya am not eligible for semua  covid geran and then dia said just go and get bantuan and 
saya was happy because saya actually got  bantuan i perlu and anda know 
so itu that was a good masa like itu was really a good masa because kita were really worrying , worrying about  next hari setiap hari and kita got  bantuan kita need 
so itu was a good masa 
perubahan setiap ubah is an pelarasan and pelarasan are 
painful and itu bagus of dia anda know 
even though 
even though anda have to go out on tarikh with a topeng , but itu very nice 
what was  best hidangan youve ever had

so ya itu 
saya think thats  best hadiah like semua have semua loves ini budak lelaki so much

can not wait 
special peristiwa ah 
saya think last was uh saya anak lelaki birthday parti 
ya saya couldnt tunggu because i love organising parti for dia , 
like saya always uh i think saya like  tekanan saya think im gila but saya like  tekanan , i like saya like  tekanan 
because saya always um saya always micromanage semuanya and saya always give saya sendiri like a small impossible bajet and saya always make itu work ya 
ya so im always looking forward to like can anda just imagine like having a parti for like uh and anda total perbelanjaan will be like what 
two to three Seratus like itu sounds impossible kanan but i give saya sendiri crazy belanjawan and im saya can already like

ya saya can have like tema but then like saya dont even spend that much saya put saya sendiri like through crazy tekanan but then like itu works , 
ya 
im crazy orang dont want tekanan but saya like  tekanan ,

ya saya think netflix parti is very smart lah 
like mereka connect orang together then when anda play itu will play on mereka penghujung also so anda dont have to kongsi screen suka on skype kanan 
ya then itu will lag , 
mm 
saya 
when saya want to relax saya like to just go to a nearby pusat membeli-belah alone 
and just walk around looking at perkara so like ya because im alone right so theres tidak satu talking to saya , then i can just go and run ralat and lihat at perkara that uh im interested 
in so recently im very , interested in a vakum cleaner , anda know  tanpa wayar one 
tidak lah dyson is too expensive because kita went to shalom s rumah so uh kita saw  tanpa wayar vakum cleaner so saya and amanda got very excited , so kita started searching 
tanpa wayar vakum cleaner ya

ya but saya also enjoy just walking around getting makanan that saya like by saya sendiri 
mm then just listening to lagu so i jangan have to talk to orang 
ya 
what about anda 
ya saya think anda just need to be alone at beberapa titik of masa and then , one cara lain cara is to just take a nap lor take a tidur siang to calm diri anda down ya 
then when anda wake up anda feel very refreshed just go and anda know freshen up 
take a joging ah 
okay 
hai xing are anda there 
last soalan for anda 
which is anda favourite negara 
to travel 
oh maaf english only okay 
mm 
semua  nice makanan kanan 
semua  saya like korea 
ya saya and saya kawan kita enjoy going to korea because , a kumpulan of gadis kita enjoy makeup kita enjoy  budaya , kita enjoy  k pop adegan 
ya so 
kita and kita make itu a titik to travel to korea setiap tahun 
but 
but uh sadly because of  isu kita have to cancel kami perjalanan but itu semua good because kita are planning for next one soon 
okay oh so like itu start already ah 
tekanan sia sepuluh saat , 
kita randomly , 
tunggu so ten saat that means what like what happens what if like anda talk for more than ten saat then i will be silent for more than ten saat what 
ah oh mereka will join  perbualan one ah oh okay 
oh why anda can not join n u s speaking program sebab mereka dont bincang like , sebab mereka dont talk singlish mah , itu why anda can not , 
eh anda kena ruam ah on anda anda kena ruam on anda ya wah , regangan until like itu , bench too much already 
eh i swear like i swear saya can beat  lelaki ah like 
 like  tujuh puluh k g ah but like dia not even i mean dia not even good bentuk ah so if saya do even if saya do seventy k g with like better bentuk saya win already ya 
saya see dia do 
tidak lah , actually dia heavier than saya hes seventy five dia seventy five kilo actually im also im now im tujuh puluh five kilo but then dia definitely more um kurus than saya ah but like i think 
like i oh i got see dia instagram again ah like saya once in a semasa saya go semak ah , then like saya see like dia do a tiga puluh kilo for six ah like 
tiga puluh kilo for six and  six rep like dia fail sia , i think i feel like saya feel like  tujuh puluh for one is like a fake eh , 
ya tidak itu not even like sebab saya see dia enam puluh for one then after that dia jump to seventy for one dia enam puluh , itu just 
 ,  bentuk progressively like became worse and worse itu not that dia dia kekuatan improve or whatever itu just itu sixty dia did a better bentuk and then seventy dia did a lebih teruk bentuk 
dia one tahun older than kami hor dia uni one tahun saya think 
ya but from  
what perkara lihat got what 
tidak like from  kelihatan of itu right i think i estimate a saya think dia like clean bentuk one will be probably like a fifty ah lima puluh for one 
saya think based on saya laser mata penglihatan 
hes a saya f b pro ah but then but ya lah dia tidak i love i love watching dia ah like dia , dia like yell at saya through  kamera like itu , 
ya , tidak ah saya like taking dia like latihan nasihat a bit lah like dia say like kereta api lebih sukar 
ya thats dia nasihat ah ya like basically train to failure lah ya sebab like 
ya like tarik like  perkara is like a lot of orang like tarik up right mereka say pull up anda need to like do weighted right 
but then like  if anda do itu  cara like dia does itu right like itu like sial hard eh like dia do cause dia do like very slow eksentrik dia say one ditetapkan kanan 
one ditetapkan should take anda forty saat eh so anda should have forty saat of thud 
kanan that thats damn thats a lot eh like saya tried itu just now ah like saya tarik up i did like sepuluh reps ah 
ya saya got pull up palang at rumah ya so like actually i dont really need to do weighted lah like basically im not strong enough ah for weighted 
eh , nevermind ah dia say im going to make  best keuntungan of saya hidup following dia nasihat , 
ya lah but anda 
financial perunding uh okay lah i mean i dont think saya will i mean itu not for saya ah but then if mereka want to go for itu i dont minda ah like itu not anda dont want 
straight up scam ah 
tidak but , financial , financial , financial perundingan is just insurans what tidak meh and 
 best 
eh 
okay lah but so that so anda think financial perundingan is a like teduh perniagaan lah 
i think i dont know ah as long as i dont know ah saya choose to like 
saya choose to trust in like kemanusiaan ah like saya dont think like saya guess like not semua of mereka is just out to like get anda wang ah of kursus like 
of kursus itu mereka main matlamat like nombor one matlamat is make wang for diri anda mah 
tiada apa-apa wrong with itu lah but then like as long as mereka believe mereka truly believe that mereka produk can also help anda then i think itu okay that mereka want to make wang for diri mereka sendiri 
right can not be cause itu mereka are selling mereka perkhidmatan mah mereka are selling mereka perkhidmatan 
tidak  like 
if im not wrong like for insurans kanan like mereka sell anda a produk right then mereka get fifty peratus of  komisen for  first tahun 
first tahun premium , then after itu is like itu will slowly dilute down lah until itu reach like one peratus then after itu mereka will earn i think for  next like five to ten tahun mereka will earn a bit 
ya saya mean , i mean itu ridiculous ah but then but itu like 
ya , 
ya but i mean like okay lah like i feel like maybe  insurans is a bit over  top saya mean  komisen is a bit over  top ah 
ya but itu thats also not mereka sesar ah like , itu  insurans syarikat ah itu  big lelaki itu  lelaki at  atas 
ya and then but then  perkara is like if dia if  lelaki say like okay like  big bos say like okay i want i dont want to give so much komisen already 
then reduce  harga then  ejen also complain that jenis of perkara ya 
but now but like i think now maybe like maybe itu like sebab of atas talian like now got a lot of like 
insurans aplikasinya semua that so like itu reduce semua  ejen yuran then mereka make itu semua mereka make semua  harga more competitive ah so maybe in  masa hadapan like seseorang create like a 
like a aplikasi or website to like just automate  whole proses then make insurans ejen , obsolete already ya 
ya hopefully like yang quan got sesuatu lah , yang quan cipta  , 
like i think yang quan got more like big like dia got more big rancangan ah for dirinya , ya , 
uh okay orh as in bagaimana saya teman wanita , in , in karantina , 
tiada apa-apa oh but ya but ya lor like okay lah like 
oh anda like i told anda dia got rejected lah from n t u so dia going back n u s lor 
ya but that thats semua ah 
uh 
beberapa find itu better ah i jangan know ah uh itu saya think itu worse orh 
uh saya think itu worse ah sebab like kita early pentas only mah early pentas hubungan so like naturally like see masing-masing other more lah 
maybe for orang that are like maybe orang like four five tahun in actually saya also dont know ah like , saya got tidak pengalaman with hubungan manusia 
im learning as saya go , i learn as saya go but im assuming im assuming like four five tahun down  jalan like 
anda anda kebergantungan on masing-masing other may become less orh then maybe itu lebih baik for mereka ah maybe mereka feel , but saya 
ya but i think like saya dont know eh like 
saya dont want to ever feel obligated to see dia or sesuatu like itu like anda know like saya dont want like when i see dia i jangan want itu to be feel like an kewajipan like if orang feel that cara then i think ada padanya sesuatu wrong eh 
i jangan know but maybe itu , maybe itu normal lah sebab like  ,  initial percikan will fade one mah then bo pian one 
eh must use dialek and chinese apa wrong with anda never use 
saya use bo pian already eh nabeh , 
oh can go perbankan also ah 
what financial penasihat 
financial penasihat actually i also dont know ah like 
like i assume theres a perbezaan but then like saya actually dont know apa sahaja like pelaburan jurubank , stok broker financial penasihat are semua like sound  same to saya but then obviously i know theres a perbezaan ah 
kita can not what do anda mean by kita can not cut masing-masing other off itu means kedua-duanya can not talk at  same masa 
kita never talk at  same masa what kita like kita itu like just got a bit of like 
ten saat , 
ya two plus tahun wah 
but then tidak but then like anda kept in kenalan with dia 
so now anda semua are like kawan 
anda semua got go out together 
ya rakit

oh 
uh saya just 
saya just want to retire early , 
saya want to enjoy , i want fat api 
saya dont want lean saya dont want lean api like boring sia , 
anda know eh anda know  greg doucette right dia like saya managed to like extrapolate dia salary ah 
sebab dia say like dia say orang will ask dia like before youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States how much did dia make but dia didnt really say ah 
dia say but dia say dia make around  same as when dia was a guru so dia was a high sekolah guru lah 
then i see like in kanada where dia live ah high sekolah guru earn around tiga puluh five ribu per tahun lah 
then dia say then after itu in a in lain video dia say now that dia started youtube right dia got ten masa  klien and dia charge three masa  harga 
so right from that saya extrapolated thirty five ribuan masa thirty ah itu nine hundred k itu one million dolar eh , 
from personal kejurulatihan , 
ya saya really think dia earn a lot of wang eh like saya got go dia laman sesawang ah to see like dia produk semua 
like dia atas talian , dia fifteen minit coaching panggilan is one Seratus and tujuh puluh five u s d eh fifteen minit eh 
fifteen minit coaching panggilan tiga puluh minit three hundred dolar 
tidak dia got sell um suplemen kejurulatihan also like enhanced coaching like how like what supplements to take itu jenis of perkara like what um roids to take ah 
dia got sell that jenis also 
saya i dont know whether dia monitor itu but dia like resam itu ah , even though hes not a doktor ah dia always say , dia always say im not a , im not a doktor , 
uh but like now actually like youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States like sial boring already sia i think i watch too many video already 
tidak recently i tonton gaming video , i resort saya watch like but like oh tidak like saya watch like gaming like berjalan through like anda know i g p 
i jangan know what i berdiri for but saya know g p berdiri for permainan main ah then dia do yang jenis of like 
like cerita baris permainan i dont know what itu called but like sesuatu like um anda got see before  until Subuh jenis of permainan 
itu like tidak lah itu doesnt have to be horror permainan ah but itu like cerita baris lah so like theres a itu like perjalanan gaya permainan 
oh ya but pewdiepie like saya think too a bit too hyper for saya like saya like a bit but as in ini lelaki is also hyper lah like hyper then interesting mah but pewdiepie a bit too like 
too random already beberapa more got a lot of like rawak edits one dia permainan , i prefer just  permainan ah , ya but then now i feel like 
like watching ah 
oh ya lah 
then saya also 
how saya know about api ah like orang tell saya one lor like sebab like saya got kawan that are i got kawan that from tentera that are like quite into like kewangan one so like mereka got bincang 
then like saya got attend  , saya got attend  seminar mah about bersara 
but  bersara seminar like so boring sia  lelaki is so dry then dia talk about dia all dia talk about is like saving wang insurans then how to like optimise anda c p f akaun that jenis of perkara 
but like itu like so 
who is that i jangan know dia nama but itu like saya kawan itu like from , from  beberapa lelaki from  pakatan ah anda know alliance 
ya semua inside itu kumpulan anda also ah , what 
ya lor but then that lelaki like boring sia then like got one ulasan very funny like 
like sebab  itu on facebook live then seseorang commented like saya think got one titik  bunyi gone ah  bunyi gone for like one minit then seseorang say  bunyi lost 
then , then a lot of orang say i think  lelaki also lost , then i laugh ah sebab  lelaki really like dia talk like i mean like obviously dia know what dia talking about ah but  cara dia present dirinya is like dia very 
ya like charismatic ah 
mm saya dont know why ah but then like saya swear  lelaki that i kerja for ah like even though i ive never like spoken to dia in saya hidup 
but just by dia kelihatan ah i think saya know that dia hes like beberapa like super dominant charismatic lelaki already 
like really , like  lelaki i jangan know if i got tidak  lelaki that saya worked for like in uh when saya did  , telemarketing 
then dia rich , like 
then ya then i see dia like sebab got like dia uh got dia kepala tembak also mah ya not bad looking ah like quite handsome one then i ya then right itu like cipta ini like alfa lelaki in saya kepala , 
ya dia earn like what twenty k a bulan from komisen 
then dia and hes only in dia 
fourth tahun of uni saya mean last final tahun of uni ah so ini tahun dia graduating 
up 
why not 
why not kita drop ship instead of go into insurans 
i feel like 
tidak ah huh really meh 
then kita go into  next saya jangan know eh like 
eh but semua orang lepas 
semua orang is drop shipping  same produk ah eh but then anda know like recently like saya come across uh a lot of 
a lot of um 
how to say ah okay like basically like saya see like beberapa cerita on instagram like maybe by a kawan or maybe by a influencer like using beberapa like produk ah beberapa kecantikan produk beberapa kesihatan produk 
then like saya see like saya trace back to where mereka buy itu where who mereka buy itu from then itu like beberapa influencer one like most of  masa 
and itu not yang like reputable one is like yang xiao mei influencer like maybe like tujuh belas sixteen tahun old that jenis 
easily , like very impressionable jenis kanan like mereka are  yang that are like selling  produk eh 
like , like mereka like buy kotak ya 
ya saya mean probably ah ya like beberapa like ya like magical ya 
ya that jenis orh 
oh tidak got uh 
ya then  satu that i saw kanan was um itu was a kolagen produk then basically what mereka pasaran itu to do right is itu can basically cure anda jerawat and make anda payudara bigger 
like anda eat one ah anda eat  produk kanan 
then like saya was like where like saya also want to sell leh where , where can i sell ini magical produk like dia selling like kotak and kotak of itu probably making like ratusan and ratusan of dolar ah 
like just from like ini one influencer kanan then i go on shopee so shopee got seseorang menjual itu 
itu called magik tunjuk kolagen ah 
so itu on shopee ah then saya was like 
ah then itu like on  , on  pembungkusan got ini korean lelaki one like itu like 
i jangan know where mereka get ini random korean lelaki lah but itu a korean lelaki like smiling in  , on  pembungkusan then saya was like , 
sahkan can find  pembekal one lah like just go on alibaba 
right then alibaba jangan have ah dont theres tidak such perkara as a magik tunjuk 
kolagen but then i mean like itu not a big jenama also itu beberapa like small keldai jenama like semua mereka have is beberapa random influencer um selling itu 
and then shopee have lazada have and facebook eh  facebook halaman right so like where mereka where do mereka come from one saya was thinking like where  fuck do mereka come from 
like mereka got a korean lelaki on  pembungkusan mereka have and mereka say itu made in  u s 
then i jangan know where  fuck itu come from one ah then , then i go on like 
ya then i go on alibaba right then i search kolagen sachet sebab basically like itu like ini like small little , ya itu in a sachet lah 
i gelintar kolagen sachet then like itu like ada padanya ini uh penjual kanan dia sell a blank sachet of kolagen then mereka say put anda jenama here 
 bentuk of  sachet is identical and  kandungan is also thirty m l like kedua-duanya thirty m l then itu like basically but anda have to buy a lot lah so itu like saya think anda buy itu for empat puluh sen per sachet then anda  minimum jumlah is hundred thousand sachets 
so anda have to basically invest empat puluh ribuan dolar ah but then mereka sell itu mereka sell itu for like 
twenty dolar per kotak and one kotak only has five sachets so mereka sell itu for like ten masa  kos 
ya and then put anda jenama here mereka say anda can like anda can link up with mereka and then basically like do semuanya ah like anda want to put  korean lelaki 
i jangan know , but itu , anda want put anda want to anda want to put u made in  u s 
then mereka can put whatever bahan cause like i swear like mereka say got acai got kolagen semua that maybe got collagen ah cause  alibaba one also got kolagen but mereka say got acai got semua ini berries multi vitamin 
ya saya know okay so thats  titik so like  perkara is right like uh so itu like why would 
if itu such a good produk kanan like can make anda payudara bigger can clear anda jerawat right and itu only five itu only twenty dolar per kotak lah right so 
in  akal if anda think about itu as a medical produk itu like quite cheap mah so like why wouldnt mereka sell itu at yang like 
farmasi right mereka can make a lot of wang mah why mereka sell itu through facebook through lazada through influencer 
then ya lah itu to 
itu to , itu to remove like diri anda from itu lah then i think right itu a fucking pyramid scheme ah like beberapa lelaki dia like pendekatan ini like impressionable influencer then hes like 
eh anda want to help saya push beberapa produk then anda keep ini jumlah of komisen kanan 
i swear itu a pyramid skema but then like who is dumb enough to participate in such a , such a like 
ya manusia saya told saya kawan saya told saya kawan about itu then hes like eh let do itu then i was like fuck , saya got etika i got moral manusia , 
i min , 
oh like saya dont 
saya actually i recently like , like very unproductive 
saya like  perkara is that right like saya run out of video to watch on like youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States and netflix kanan but i still like try saya best to find sesuatu to watch 
anda know what i mean like itu like saya really like tatal through semua  video saya like fuck oh ini is so boring but i still click on itu like 
ya like paksa saya sendiri to like tonton five minit then i go to  next video ,

bahagian two debat tajuk two 
um okay um i  proposisi believe that effective pertanian is possible without sains and do not need to rely completely on sains to start off saya would like to define effective pertanian 
as  keupayaan to grow and harvest sufficient tanaman successfully without giving too much usaha or masa 
i strongly believe that while sains seems to contribute menyusahkan and efficient cara , for effective pertanian there are other aspek that are required for effective pertanian which sains is not able to deal or provide 
firstly effective pertanian is possible without sains as tanaman do not require intensive scientific pengetahuan instead itu just an pendidikan of  kaedah used and not necessarily needed for keberkesanan 
agricultural aktiviti go cara back in sejarah before perindustrian where sains started to take off pertanian is fairly simple with tumbuhan only needing suitable cuaca syarat 
tumbuhan are still able to grow naturally without sains and petani would be able to harvest mereka for , penggunaan and hidup for kejadian myanmar was a largest pengeksport of beras in  nineteen tiga puluhan even hari ini myanmar 
still has a relatively uneducated populasi due to political ketidakstabilan yet most of mereka are able to carry out pertanian 
ini shows that itu does not require roket sains pengetahuan to carry out effective pertanian , farming based solely on pengalaman and nasihat from perkara which is sufficient and in kedalaman pengetahuan about tumbuhan anatomi for contoh is not needed for effective pertanian in penambahan 
one of  most essential syarat for best tanaman pertumbuhan like saya mentioned before would be  cuaca 
ini is a natural fenomena 
as mereka do not entirely solved  whole isu 
a natural fenomena that sains can not affect ini brings saya to saya titik that cuaca syarat require farming can not be dealt with by sains making sains an penambahan but not a keperluan thus 
to reiterate saya titik sains is merely an penambahan to effective pertanian and not a keperluan 
effective pertanian requires sufficient keratan tanaman to be harvested which can be achieved without scientific penemuan 
uh okay maaf um can i start now 
ciptaan of many mesin theyre able to make farming more effective 
sakit like to rebut ini by saying that while ini mesin can help to maximise hasil itu has batasan and a downside of potentially malfunctioning which in pusing destroy tanaman i will like to propose itu idea that 
sains do not always provide an effective pertanian as itu has itu batasan as well effective pertanian requires  guna of mesin to provide 
an easier cara to harvest tanaman 
however despite ini manfaat one batasan would be that ini mesin have a kemungkinan of malfunctioning and in pusing  tanaman may not be able to be harvested instead 
a second batasan would be  high kos and penyelenggaraan to fix ini mesin when mereka malfunctioned as mereka may instead make hidup lebih sukar for  petani as mereka have 
to go up semua  cara contact  penyelenggaraan pekerja and try to get ini um mesin 
fixed before mereka can use itu again 
for harvesting tanaman 
when ini sensor break down  traktor will immediately shut down and tanaman still in  tengah of being harvested are crushed and destroyed 
furthermore  penyelenggaraan of traktor is very costly and requires a long tempoh of masa having to send itu over to maintenance 
and , itu semua  cara back which is not very convenient 
as ini may be even worse for ladang that are in remote kawasan and uh even further away from ini penyelenggaraan kilang 
thus ini will result in a less effective pertanian when sains does not benefit  cara itu should and instead made itu to adverse kesan due to itu kekangan so effective pertanian is possible without sains as sains is not  most outstanding cara to rely on for effective pertanian 
um okay so saya titik uh is that effective pertanian should be possible without sains 
but not make itu effective or ineffective ini is because 
farming can already be efficient without sains as saya have proven in saya first titik that orang in early tahun have already succeeded 
and pertanian has come a long cara without many isu 
even with  
isu that farming faced is not likely to be semua solved by sains and sains has have also proven in saya second titik 
that itu has itu batasan in fakta 
kita should not put semua kami telur into one bakul and just rely on sains to solve semua  isu and improve pertanian as itu is not possible 
to make itu even more effective as well 
um due to  kerumitan of  dunia hari ini 
um saya feel that for sains anda can also like maximise anda best 
 proposisi have said like in terma of , genetically modified makanan but then i think itu will also pose a batasan as to  bahan kimia that are induced in ini makanan 
itu are itu will be soon uh be spread to other orang for penggunaan and 
ini may not be uh very healthy uh sumber of makanan because bahan kimia can 
um disepadukan to advanced kesan as well 
which will prove itu actually sains will have itu batasan when solving farming in terma of genetically modified makanan 
ibu jari up 
bahagian two positive pengalaman

saya was given ini perjalanan to travel to u k anda remember  u k perjalanan ya and ya that was really and itu was saya first masa flying 
and back in  nineteen lapan puluhan itu was ya itu 
saya flew by uh ini pesawat called aeroflot saya think now itu already defunct already

ya if saya have to go back 
saya said that if ada padanya one negara that i want to go back to would be cornwall i mean jangan anda dont kedua-duanya anda and saya weve travelled to itu tempat for so many tahun so many masa not so many tahun anda know and itu really  kawasan luar bandar  lindung nilai  kotej

ya so , itu is really sesuatu that 
uh very memorable saya also remembered that  first masa that i brought mak for dia perjalanan anda know  first masa that dia took  pesawat kita travelled semua  cara up to uh penang ya and then come down penang cameron lembut 
uh ipoh and then uh fraser bukit then up to k l and then kita flew back and dia never forget 
saya tell anda ya

ya ya 
ya itu why 
salji pit 
tidak nagano 
ya mm 
ya 
anda know ada padanya so many perkara ah that makes kami happy ah itu just that itu seems like kita are just keep talking about travelling anda know 
right even  ulang tahun present  biggest best hadir is also perjalanan 
ya itu still travel ya 
eventually itu still backs down to travel 
right ya mm 
shesCity in Illinois, United States so young only shes just in  early saya think twenty maybe twenty one ya 
eh im just looking at  soalan ah itu says here ah um , 
describe what one of  eh tunggu ah uh a masa when anda got appreciated for anda hard kerja back to perjalanan again 
anda know lah ya because saya still can not forget that anda know uh not say lupa i mean saya felt itu was such a sad perkara for saya being even though ini is a positive pengalaman that saya couldnt go to fukuoka ini tahun because for  perjalanan that saya got 
anda know because just now anda mentioned jepun right so i was thinking that anda know wah how nice if itu if i can add jepun 
tidak fukuoka to kami nagano tokyo osaka anda know and then 
ini will be lain pengalaman that saya can talk about anda know ya in fakta actually before saya could even go to fukuoka saya was already reading up 
semua about fukuoka what saya can do there that jenis of perkara anda know ya 
but 
never minda anda know instead of can not go i got thousand two so thats a happy perkara , 
ya wang ya mm 
mm what 
mm 
mm mm 
then anda never ask dia whether dia wants anda autograf or not 
ya i mean anda talk about unique pelengkap oddest , 
ya 
tidak more t c s lah 
media korp lah 
ya so i get recognised of kursus ya i get recognised on  jalan-jalan uh and then orang will ask saya excuse saya are anda a pelakon 
anda know i do small bahagian for  for delys 
uh maklumat saya uh  latest satu that saya did was for kin 
saya did for kin 
and i recently did one for jenayah tonton also but itu yet to be released  latest jenayah tonton is not released yet 
ya 
uh tidak uh ya mm 
so i have got quite i think if anda go into o c b c website anda can see one video there of saya ya so i do get recognised on  jalan-jalan and orang will walk up to saya and then itu makes anda feel really very good and itu so , even for a small peranan that i play um i main in tanglin saya play in uh cukup a lot lah 
so mereka do recognise saya and beberapa of  
saya rejected mereka , in fakta tidak in fakta ah 
tidak in fakta actually ini uh january ah there was supposed to be one uh pawagam tunjuk that was going to be released but because of  covid ah mereka did not release that tunjuk anda know and 
of kursus saya didnt do very much actually delys one  earliest that saya did was uh im not stupid which was for jack neo one 
ya so i played a guru so orang do recognise saya and uh even though mereka dont say mereka dont uh pujian saya or whatsoever but  fakta that when mereka look at saya and then mereka smile or mereka 
 nod mereka kepala 
semua  cara in penang anda know 
ya so mereka 
mm so dia was actually selling pirated d v d 
so when saya walked there then dia told saya dia said 
then im so impressed that 
anda know uh itu was a pujian to saya and itu means dia saw saya aksara dia saw how i acted and itu is a pujian to saya 
uh unlike like anda orang say anda yours is in  kelihatan lah but mine is because of what i portray anda know that mereka recognise 
so itu very good kanan anda feel good kanan 
ya 
ya but sometimes orang say 
mereka i dont look  same anda know when on skrin mereka think mereka must have a second lihat then mereka recognise saya 
because anda know saya lah itu why i look  same lah , 
ya youre right ya true mm 
mm 
mm 
ya

then saya know that mereka recognise saya but i just smile nicely smile sweetly and then i just walk past anda know , 
must create a tahan lama , kesan mah 
ya 
ya true 
mm ya and 
saya think delys did a good kerja dia has been so patient with kami

ya kita um 
actually kedua-duanya saya kedua-duanya of kami are very positive orang kita had so many perkara that happens in kami hidup ah but then uh kita always look at itu and thats okay never mind anda know be happy anda know ya

mm ya mostly netflix if like watch so many rancangan over  past 
like tag along so like 
ya really i tidak know 
did anda say oh i tidak see 
saya dont main with saya macbook i main on saya p c 
just one mm 
probably a rumah with like a ladang attached 
anda said one perkara but i tidak , 
mm 
with itu own private jet , 
tidak but like a rumah would be fine i mean itu one item 
ya saya mean a rumah will be nice like 
at least itu settled especially in singapura 
anda dont need to work anymore i mean like anda can work like small little pekerjaan 
ya basically that 
so but ya thats itu 
what should be free 
saya tekaan 
but like i tekaan thats how  
 dunia has come to ah like semua semua  kerajaan own semuanya and then anda have to pay mereka 
unless anda move to like beberapa 
like pulau 
build mereka own rumah that jenis maybe 
by ada padanya an pulau 
anda mean ada padanya ini one like rawak 
ya ive didengar of itu i have never been there though 
menarik kita go find out lah 
itu an pulau so itu means  lembu wandered in on itu own 
but itu such a weird perkara to happen in singapura 
i jangan know what is  jangka hayat of a lembu 
i min ada padanya still one that exists that like 
dia owns  tempat basically and then like uh 
mereka rented  rumah that kita were filming in from dia 
like give a bad nama to  tempat and barang 
sebab like previously sesuatu happened lah when mereka tried to like filem like a horror perkara there and like sesuatu happened 
mm ya itu is  perkara that confuse saya cause  auntie told kami like oh saya see anda lelaki are nice orang so itu should be fine 
like itu wont bahaya anda unless anda do apa sahaja to itu 
and like kita filem from 
like really late and then ah mereka wanted to start filming at like eight 
model or sesuatu 
so shes quite tall lah and then like um 
dia fitur were like pretty lah like 
like a model orang fitur 
mm that bahagian that was  one lah 
mm ya kita cut  rambut palsu 
then like ya at first itu was like jenis of worrying lah sebab dia kept complaining like 
or like uncomfortable and ini that 
like wandering around and shit 
saya think  ,  orang who stay there are quite like welcoming 
mereka were just wandering  tempat like 
but itu cukup interesting tempat ah sebab itu surrounded by h d b 
itu hut that looks like a kopitiam 
but itu wujud now ya 
 pokok are quite tall 
then like only behind  pokok then anda see  h d b so itu cukup sejuk 
 rumah are semua like one lantai lah 
like tidak elektrik and barang 
but then mereka i think mereka added in elektrik so like beberapa rumah have elektrik now 
oh lawati ya theres nyamuk though 
itu like  one perkara saya just didnt like about  tempat like especially at malam 
sebab kita were filming until like what seven a m 
so kita only saw  sekeliling by when kita were in  lori 
tidak sebab like i mean jenis of like paiseh ah sebab kita didnt like datang there to explore and then mereka only call saya down to do  s f x barang 
 auntie was very nice so shes  satu who came down and talk to kami 
like dia kept coming by and like saying like oh wah so cool and barang so itu was quite cute 
even though like youre kanan in  pusat of semuanya else 
but like itu quite nice ah itu cukup sejuk that malam 
yes guardian Malaikat 
ya  auntie lives alone now quite 
yes dia penjaga 
but ya quite interesting ah  tempat 
saya honestly dont know ah saya 
what else to do in singapura 
what else can kita explore 
ya saya think same ah if like saya had to like 
oh ya im not awake 
ya to wake up at seven and like seven to eight just to go mendaki is 
is  zoo even open 
mereka wear face perisai 
ya 
ya sia is itu even open i think itu is already lah if not how mereka make wang 
mereka need  wang to keep  haiwan there 
like  singa and gajah roam singapura 
pulau semakau thats  berdarah TPA tanah kanan 
i mean honestly tiada apa-apa much has changed so i jangan know really know why how anda want to keep going back to see haiwan in sangkar 
and jumping on perkara 
like  other masa i went saya saw  polar beruang 
itu one was depressing as neraka like  polar beruang fur was like just itu just looks depressed lah like  whole ya  beruang was skinny as neraka 
and then like saya mean mereka mereka are like naturally born for like 
cold iklim and barang and singapura is tiada apa-apa but that i tekaan itu really horrible lah to put polar beruang in there 
ya didnt lihat like old umur sia  beruang just look like itu was dying for tahun already 
itu was so skinny 
i jangan know apparently itu was born in singapura 
yishun has cold cuaca and move itu 
i feel like a polar beruang perlu ais 
poli ya secondary sekolah  last masa i went 
itu was lah sebab saya dont remember wearing for r c perkara in poli 
tidak itu was in secondary sekolah saya swear i think i dont think itu was in poli 
sebab itu was very long ago 
by  
uh five a m to two a m 
sec four lah so probably in sec four sebab saya dont remember going in poli 
tidak 
tidak itu was open 
mereka said mereka open in dua puluh dua belas 
twenty nine juneCity in Virginia, United States 
fifty million 
pelawat as of dua puluh lapan belas 
anda thought one hari 
itu cukup pretty lah  indoor taman is nice 
that i dont minda 
ya semua kami tiga puluh dolar 
sebab of taman by  teluk and changi lapangan terbang 
but legit lah like , 
basically  first perkara saya would ask 
for is a rumah like 
like not in singapura , somewhere cold 
and then mereka just make anda like seseorang who doesnt penjagaan about apa sahaja anymore , 
itu what genies can do 
saya would wish to be 
saya would wish to be richer than jeff bezos 
and then i take semua dia wang and give semua else 
but ya i just would wish for like unimaginable jumlah of wang saya think that would solve a lot of masalah 
 wang tidak exist 
and like by tunai is like hundred dolar bil not by dua puluh sen 
then like ya that jumlah of wang 
or maybe find  penyembuhan to setiap penyakit in  dunia 
ya 
can anda imagine having like  kuasa to 
solve setiap penyakit out there 
ya beberapa random white lelaki gon na make berbilion out of itu 
just be like unbothered 
ya previous 
mm wang is like separuh of kami isu 
true 
can anda imagine if anda had like three keinginan and then first harap was to wish for five hundred more of anda 
what with five hundred klon 
i jangan know then semua of anda got like three more keinginan 
so what  neraka 
wow 
but like would anda waste anda harap on itu 
covid has been putting so many perkara on tahan 
how hidup has changed in like what less than a tahun 
in nyahsetujuundo-type last tahun kita were semua like 
being crazy and having menyeronokkan and like 
not even thinking and then suddenly in february 
being in sekolah like kanan now 
not on zum kelas 
ya but hidup would be so different without having to scan anda 
just hide anda identiti semua  masa 
but like  safe masukan perkara is jenis of annoying 
so whats  perbezaan of like using that compared to anda i c right itu literally does tiada apa-apa different 
or like if itu actually has like mana-mana actual manfaat like 
i dont know like mereka actually know exactly where kita are itu jenis of perkara 
but like from what ive didengar theres tidak g p s in itu ah so like 
and mereka havent really spoken much about itu like 
on  berita and barang like itu just very hush like anda just come and collect itu itu 
i mean okay lah to be fair like  older generasi beberapa of mereka dont have telefon pintar 
so like for mereka to capaian like 
membeli-belah pusat membeli-belah and barang will be hard 
but like mereka have mereka i c and itu sesuatu i know like old orang wont lose 
like im pretty sure seseorang gon na drop itu 
lepas itu like right after anda get itu 
i mean if itu had if had g p s like data in itu like would anda mind 
agak messed up if  kerajaan is using itu to 
criminal barang 
kucing kafe 
saya just i can not imagine like 
itu cat deserves to be in a zoo 
safari at like kandang 
does anda makcik is anda makcik scared of kucing 
fur gets everywhere though 
and then ya saya would like batuk and then have masalah breathing 
itu when itu gets bad lah like dia i really can not breathe like saya will start coughing 
but i jangan know what is  sebab for itu i think itu 
bathe mereka right ya but like 
Bau busuk ya 
saya mean dapat scared lah like anda can dia muka dia doesnt want to be there 
like i think hes fine lah like sebab saya usually carry dia while saya bathe dia 
like hes in saya tangan 
anda mean like what like orang like make  virus or 
i dont know like why is itu more common now than like back then or like i mean like to saya itu been setiap few tahun confirm got like beberapa 
global pandemik what then like 
setiap tahun kita just come out with like better ubat and barang 
to like tempur itu so like 
i jangan think itu would wipe out  human perlumbaan like but i mean orang will die lah sahkan but like 
into iklim ubah 
saya think there comes a titik where anda have to like hentikan 
how advance do kita need to be 
seven hundred bahasa 
sebab like i feel like semuanya is fine as itu is 
like i mean if anda want to find like penawar and like 
wang ya saya think  next u s presiden should just remove wang 
there is not tidak wang 
but do anda hear about  that orchard menara perkara 
 pembunuhan perkara  lelaki got off with a amaran 
melarikan diri with tiada apa-apa 
pembunuh 
ya sia and then  gadis got like penajaan peluang and barang 
nonsensical sia like how 
bye 
tepuk is itu 
um kita have to read financial related tajuk 
okay um 
i shall start first ah okay uh saya have bought premier wanita from manulife because itu also covers female manfaat such as kehamilan komplikasi 
so what about anda do anda have mana-mana personal insurans 
mm okay saya see okay , 
so do anda have mana-mana endowment rancang would also 
orh also ah i see , 
okay um saya bought one a few tahun back ago itu was using uh c p f so i think that was  only masa when kita can use c p f to buy an 
endowmen , i bought a single premium endowmen at enam puluh , uh with saya c p f under manulife as well , so ini satu also covers terminal penyakit and total and permanent ketidakupayaan 
so i think thats  only masa when kita can buy endowment with c p f because after itu when saya bincang to saya kawan about uh membeli endowmen with c p f mereka said , 
rancang anda know thats a menyimpan rancang how can anda buy with c p f saya said ya 
saya went back to check ya is really from c p f im using 
c p f to buy when saya show mereka mereka were like , is itu possible so i think that was  only masa 
ya thats  only endowmen that saya have also 
so if let say anda dont have 
insurans maybe anda can consider istilah also because saya , um ive baca that istilah insurans mereka are 
a lot more lebih murah 
so maybe can consider itu 
kursus whole hidup insurans is will be better because itu does has tunai nilai , so when anda do surrender anda um polisi , anda have a tunai nilai to comes back and that wang can use for anda kanak-kanak or anda know for diri anda maybe in  masa hadapan , um when anda want to 
retired when anda want to buy 
rumah or whatever or anda dont need  insurans anymore , so saya also have a whole hidup insurans that , im keeping so if apa sahaja happened to saya of kursus there will be 
and if i dont need itu when im old saya can just tunai out and use  wang and do anda know go for percutian or 
just for saya bersara or whatever ya but if saya have bajet kekangan , saya will probably just go for istilah insurans which is much more cheaper but of kursus there is tidak tunai nilai at  penghujung of itu 
well for saya saya will buy tidak saya think that insurans and pelaburan can go together itu will 
probably be helpful because itu for when anda do have pelaburan anda will probably uh get more kembali 
mm saya think itu true , um that there is risiko saya have been hesitating to invest again because saya okay initially i did invest 
itu was true prudential so 
over three tahun i did make a bit of a quite a bit of untung uh about thirteen thousand so i think itu was pretty good so , saya have tunai out on itu and then recently because of  pasaran kanan is like , fluctuating up and down there then after , saya that 
when ada padanya fluctuation there is peluang okay when  pasaran goes down anda buy low 
then when itu goes up anda sell i was thinking eh itu true anda know anda buy low and anda sell high that is very true so i think if anda want to invest anda wang first of semua anda must really , um 
find a syarikat , whereby mereka will get seseorang to manage anda dana if there is tiada siapa who is managing anda dana then dont even consider itu if mereka had ada padanya orang who will manage anda dana for anda then i think ya go for itu because saya also uh im looking at itu , um saya will be also investing recently lah saya have a 
seseorang to , uh draw a rancang for saya and because  syarikat itu has orang who is willing to , really manage saya dana for saya so if apa sahaja wrong mereka will switch dana automatically and stuff so i dont have much to worry about so ya 
saya think pelaburan , is sesuatu that kita have to go for especially now  pasaran is really fluctuate up and down anda see right , so i think itu a good peluang 
okay 
mm so if anda dont have insurans kanan anda will also have c p f insurans liputan so 
what uh what do anda feel about  
 c p f um anda know yang skema that kita have there 
mm yes , 
saya feel  same as well , i think is not a lot but at least itu beberapa wang that is there 
 keluarga ahli can really uh guna for  short istilah lah 
yes mm ya mm , 
betul saya think there is sesuatu that anda should look into because , if anda dont have uh insurans and 
at  momen ini are  perkara that kita really should have 
ourself covered with ya 
so do anda 
itu um semua orang will have itu so i think is good 
are anda ever 
have are anda even of itu umur yet , 
okay , mm ya 
ya but , yes i think eldershield is really uh sesuatu that kita really have to look into lah because when kita umur ah kita condong to 
be at higher risiko so kita might be if kita have a jatuh and kita cant move anymore well be disabled and well wow itu will be really terrible , so  monthly pembayaran will be at least itu can help with  
whatever perbelanjaan that kita need during itu masa when kita are going for , fisioterapi and 
barang ya so i think is really good as well 
mm 
so about medisave as what anda titik of paparan about simpan saya think anda think is good to have simpan 
ya correct ya ah same saya , 
itu masa when saya gave kelahiran was like  bil i cover semuanya with simpan so itu like ah itu cukup itu , useful , if not saya have to fork out tunai is that oh when saya look at  bil itu like oh 
ya 
yes itu right , so is really helpful 
so if let say anda are interested to buy insurans would anda do itu by diri anda or do anda will actually approach an ejen to do itu 
mm , 
mm itu saya pemikiran as well , so if let say saya were to do itu saya sendiri i think itu will take itu will very masa memakan , there are so many syarikat so many polisi so what do i need i dont even know so im not in  best kedudukan to do ini so thats why saya think , kita should i will engage a insurans ejen then mereka will recommend saya what are  perkara i need what 
are  good produk 
and then mereka will probably have to help saya to compare 
uh  different polisi because saya know of uh a relatif dia , 
dia was in a syarikat who represent a lot of different insurans syarikat , so dia will , what dia will do is dia will gather maklumat from three different polisi than dia will give saya  best syor and then dia will just tell saya what  perbezaan and then which is  best satu dia will recommend saya , 
then after itu sakit just choose i think itu is better because ultimately  caj is still mine saya just let dia do dia kerja then after itu saya decide after knowing semua  maklumat ya so i think ejen are really very important because mereka are  satu who knows  best 
when saya buy an insurans 
oh okay  first satu is very important anda must um 
choose  ejen who serve anda okay because  ejen is very important because dia will be with anda throughout  whole perkara if let say hes seseorang that , anda feel itu is 
not thats seseorang anda really want to talk to or seseorang who anda feel itu is not very reliable or seseorang , who is just there for one masa after itu anda sign  polisi dia said oh bye , 
bye then anda dont see dia anymore saya think ini mengerikan so , i think  ejen dirinya is dirinya or dirinya is very important so anda first of semua anda need to choose seseorang 
a good ejen that anda want then after itu of kursus anda look at  premium , how whether is affordable then uh what are  liputan what jenis of penyakit is being covered , uh beberapa of mereka is like saya premier wanita itu covers  female penyakit 
and also itu uh penutup like  kehamilan komplikasi so i think itu why saya got for pergi for  premier wanita because mereka cover , female komplikasi uh female penyakit and then also  kehamilan , because anda know kita as wanita kita will give kelahiran 
if kita are married someday if kita are lucky kita will give kelahiran lah , so i feel that uh being covered 
for uh yang pregnancy komplikasi is very important because mereka have um yang uh spina bifida then mereka have  , uh kelahiran stil then mereka have  down syndrome semua ini covered so if let say there is apa sahaja there will be pembayaran 
uh lain perkara saya think is  also  polisi tempoh how long mereka will cover anda so ini are beberapa of  barang that anda will have to look into when anda want to buy , uh an insurans polisi lah ini are tambang 
thought lah mm 
do anda feel itu um as uh a good nasihat 
anda do itu ha 
itu is very true ya itu why  
ya itu why saya say  ejen  ejen dirinya or dirinya is very important , ya because saya , 
saya met an ejen dia was like , eh help saya lah ini is saya first urus niaga then saya was like , 
saya just because itu not sesuatu saya just buy itu oh kasihan for dia then after that saya feel eh why should i buy oh i dont need that anda knows ah okay mm then i just lapse itu so i think  ejen dirinya is very important because , 
ultimately dia must be seseorang 
who knows what i need and recommend sesuatu saya need so i will continue to buy from ,  perkara and not just give up separuh a tahun 
okay tidak kita are not young kanan 
so what do anda think ah beberapa of  insurans that kita should really buy 

mm 
okay lain perkara anda can mm , 
saya think one more uh insurans that anda can look for is  personal kemalangan insurans , because uh anda know , 
apa sahaja can happen so , 
uh when saya first know about uh personal kemalangan is through a kawan dia was telling saya , oh uh saya always got uh , accident saya will sprain saya buku lali over ini dia said setiap tahun saya tuntutan from saya personal kemalangan saya was like oh okay then after itu saya was 
then i started to talk to saya 
when itu was like oh itu very useful , 
and saya bought personal kemalangan for saya anak 
which is really 
really very useful because dia when dia was young dia really got 
dia once fell from  katil and then dia cut dia dahi and kita have to go and stitch itu so after that kita claim from there and then after that dia has uh 
a few other kemalangan which is kita claimed also from there so is like  tuntutan is just  hospital bil lah but at least anda dont have to pay for itu and itu already cover whatever that anda pay for  kemalangan so uh  rancang sendiri , so i think is essential for diri kita sendiri and also if let say kita have little yang at 
ini is sesuatu that kita have to consider lah personal kemalangan insurans 
mm so would anda buy mmhmm 
eh youre very lucky then , very careful ya , 
ya 
so would anda buy from just a single penyedia or would anda 
consider 
if anda want to buy insurans ah would anda want to go around kedai or anda just one syarikat will do 
mm ah anda have a good titik ah mm 
saya will buy from different syarikat okay because even though anda have a titik there one ejen is good , but ill , for saya what saya want is  rancang sendiri 
jenis of uh saya want to get  
 jenis of um  best rancang  best fitur semuanya , so i dont minda mana-mana syarikat 
itu is so long as mereka can offer saya  best urus niaga  best 
uh liputan then i will just go for itu ya so i think thats  perkara ya 
have anda ever own a kereta before 
or apa sahaja would anda do anda think anda want to get , 
ah , ya saya ill saya once oh uh ya 
well mm saya was on a kereta 
so i bought first parti insurans so i think saya would itu would okay if anda saya nasihat is if anda own a kereta and anda feel that youre memandu is of kursus sometimes is not up to kami lah is up to yang to other pemacu , but itu best if anda can afford buy first parti insurans 
because itu covers anda own sesar and other orang fault okay so  main perkara is anda own sesar if let say anda bang to uh seseorang else insurans will cover , 
semuanya penutup 
because if anda buy third parti 
itu means if anda bang seseorang 
anda have to pay for anda own sesar for itu 
okay so i think for 
for saya when saya bought  kereta saya bought first parti insurans which is very lucky because 
at itu masa saya ayah dia drove saya kereta , and , is not really partly dia sesar lah because  teksi 
two kereta in hadapan of dia suddenly stopped 
dia bang into  kereta in hadapan of dia 
so because of  first parti insurans 
semua  membaiki costs itu been covered so i jangan have to worry about itu and dia was safe as well lah so if anda have a kereta saya think anda should consider first parti insurans if anda have , if anda can afford if not then of kursus third parti lah 
sebab even though ive never used itu before ah but is a cebisan of minda , because like  okay ini is ive never use itu before but let saya kongsi an pengalaman with anda whereby seseorang saya know 
has ever use ini perjalanan insurans so dia was posted overseas to work 
so um and dia had a kemalangan at itu masa when dia was overseas 
because dia has ini perjalanan insurans mereka actually chartered a satah to bring dia back to singapore 
so itu was a private satah uh with uh doktor and jururawat to attend to dia while dia was on  satah then dia then came back to singapore so that satah alone itu was over 
sepuluh over ribu 
so if let say anda is itu ten over ribu or more than itu saya cant ingat but itu was very expensive so if let say , kita were to kita dont have ini insurans to cover then kita have to fork out ini jenis of wang to charter a satah , i dont think itu possible then dia will probably have to stay overseas to 
to semua  
whatever medical perkara is that dia have to so itu very important to buy travel insurans is very cheap uh itu just itu very cheap really so itu semua depends on what fitur anda want 
just for a few , um anda know hundred over dolar anda can have 
damai of minda itu so itu bernilai itu lah just buy 
okay and oh ya 
but having kanak-kanak right saya have a kanak-kanak kanan saya tell anda  premier wanita so i think that already cover 
saya perlu for 
for having kanak-kanak insurans bahagian 
ya okay ah by  cara if anda 
itu earn itu earlier i kongsi about insurans ejen right so if let say anda , are looking for a an insurans ejen what would anda look for 
mm mm mm , 
is true yes is because beberapa ejen mereka just want to make itu komisen right then mereka just push itu to anda , so i think what anda mentioned is really , uh very important 
but lihat for seseorang who is um trustworthy okay 
ya im working of kursus im in 
ya of kursus definitely 
so anda just slowly with ini mentaliti yes correct so anda slowly build up and then 
so like yang uh 
uh 
wah , most memorable hidangan ah 
uh 
oh wow 
what with anda 
wow saya would see anda ibu 
ya sebab like dia ran a restoran 
uh so 
hmm 
wow 
hmm 
wah 
saya have lived a hidup in  new abad 
i mean if anda look at itu 
wow impressive 
okay 
uji and 
okay hai im amir saya , and saya rakan salamah 
okay so first perbualan was how 
but i think itu  perfect masa ah 
saya mean when itu comes to like , muka topeng from what 
ya  langkah cool jenis i min is also to prevent like anda like at higher kelajuan like around anda are cycling down 
like anda will either Cederakan or just perkara going anda 
muka anda nose or anda mulut lah 
okay ya so saya was cycling because saya was doing bahagian masa 
ya but itu is okay not compared to there was a masa ah saya was like 
cycling down to woodlands just to meet saya teman wanita saya ex teman wanita lah 
anda imagine anda 
i mean itu better that anda chewing itu what like anda chew i dont even know what i rasa but 
i mean itu just 
after itu saya was okay ah so i think  rumah lalat was 
ya saya guess so i was fine 
yes im taking saya basikal lesen lah saya motorbike lesen like 
saya jangan 
deliver ten then anda will get insentif like maybe for makanan grabfood was ten dolar 
anda divide itu a extra five dolar sepuluh dolar then after anda deliver hundred than maybe extra 
i mean i kerja for kedua-duanya 
saya mean not ini is not advertisement lah but then 
mereka grab  deliveroo mereka sokongan is , like cara better lah 
itu not a tipping perkara ah like  budaya 
bro that one is i mean that one depends like i mean h d b anda can not 
itu one is , mereka give big tip is maybe 
sepuluh dolar 
 aplikasi like anda give anda ten dolar that will get  ten dolar because beberapa negara like for contoh in like happening in other tempat i think u s like  mereka 
like itu just 
ya saya got itu for six eh four hundred plus lah like because 
i mean long istilah ah and i think saya really gain back that four hundred ive 
ya 
sometimes anda see 
mereka yang like 
makanan penghantaran mereka like saya mean 
i think saya might feel fail seseorang from  c d c  saya was like on  jalan going simpang then theres a light then on saya kiri is  zebra crossing ah 
ah , 
there was tidak tiada apa-apa tidak satu else on  jalan was saya 
anda license ah anda 
so anda know how  ,  most dangerous perkara so now anda technically anda will go out ah as a penunggang motosikal gaya more kereta then anda will like maybe can put diri anda in other kasut ah 
but before itu defensive menunggang lah 
s d c 
tiga puluh six when itu comes to revision outside or  uji luar is sixty or so around fifty plus 
six or five 
saya think  basikal im looking for is ralat  one like saya kawan is riding i think c b r one five sifar or m t one five 
saya dont even know what 
yang jenama are like ah because saya think  satu that semua orang using that have been recommending saya fuel cekap is  c b r saya mean , somewhat fuel cekap is c b r one five sifar ah 
seven more tahun or seven or seven more tahun ah 
like saya need to decide first whether because like , if i were to do saya kerja 
saya just keep renting ah bergantung on like what bike saya want then 
like at  like a dead penghujung 
what was  soalan saya have to remember oh was itu sesuatu like okay what is  
ya ya 
pengangkut then i noticed  mere pemacu was saya one of saya rakan sepasukan 
um 
saya birthday present saya think honestly now 
so i think 
i mean i am okay , grand if itu just  orang that saya want 
ya lah i mean but like honestly 
like what anda say lah or whatever if  orang has done but then ya lah but 
like anda have to know what  orang like niat of , what a ulang tahun is lah for saya 
mereka have to know lah like itu not gon na be feasible lah for  rehat of mereka hidup if mereka wan na do sesuatu like often but then with dia sekali in seumur hidup anda let orang celebrate mereka dua puluh first birthday sesuatu grand then like okay lah whoever mereka close kawan planning gon na rancang like really 
so i think when itu comes to birthday itu like semua ultimately is do anda want to grand or not 
but i think when itu comes to like if saya were to choose a tempat to go out maybe not just birthday lah a percutian or sesuatu eh 
i think i will most probably do sesuatu 
like maybe like if 
like saya would think or maybe going to east west of like of  u s like a jalan perjalanan or just maybe just like go japan north to south itu what saya would do lah a jalan perjalanan 
further like lebih putih mereka are i min and when itu comes to nearer to  khatulistiwa anda gon na be much more lebih gelap lah itu saya think that one is like itu has been for so long already and just that now orang are more migrating more so itu a different more kulit 
okay ya so ya lah saya mean tunggu ini six hundred is a lot lah so 
okay , hai um 
okay now kita are on negative pengalaman okay um  satu that i want to kongsi probably is saya fear lah im actually afraid of tinggi so uh if anda ask saya 
try  penggelek coaster saya will think twice ya uh because when saya , tried once saya jantung nearly popped out so from uh ya so whenever saya go to high tempat i will try to 
uh close saya mata to forget what i see ya but ya i think ya along  cara i think im uh better now ya mm 
mm 
mm , ya scream ya correct ya 
ya 
ya , mm 
ya true ya 
ya 
mm 
mm mm mm ya , true saya also dont like semua ini uh perosak around ya especially flying yang ya 
ya correct okay 
so okay so uh mana-mana other fobia anda uh how , how do anda , overcome anda fobia 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm , mm 
mm 
mm 
mm mm 
mm mm 
mm 
for saya basically uh okay uh sesuatu that make saya angry is uh when saya was overseas i min uh , i mean queuing up at  restoran that um 
uh  kakitangan will serve  kaukasia first and then not kami even though kita are uh in  hadapan baris gilir so saya was thinking how come theres a , uh 
racial uh hina uh i mean  cina mereka will treat differently uh mereka will , caucasian first ya so 
maybe ini is one bahagian that uh which uh i think uh itu i dont like lah ya 
mm 
ya 
mm true ya 
mm 
ya true 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
ya 
ya 
wah 
itu very bad okay maybe ill kongsi uh maybe itu uh what disgusts saya ah so uh anda know when kita are in uh thailand especially bangkok anda see orang frying  serangga and eat itu 
so i , seeing itu is so , gross and disgusting right ya and then anda also have to try itu , ya , 

ya true , ya semuanya is fry right so disgusting , 
ya true , so bad kanan okay

ya mm , mm 
is there mana-mana other perkara anda want to kongsi 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm mm mm 
mm true ya hopefully uh ini pandemik will go off soon ah ya mm 
true 
mm mm 
ya 
mm true ya 
mm ya true ya so hopefully semuanya will be going back to normal soon ya mm 
ya true ya so but i think kita learn a lot kanan during ini few bulan ya 
mm 
covid tidak saya usually pray for perlindungan everywhere i go , ya 
mm tidak not really ya 
mm 
anda do mm 
mm 
mm 
but actually anda will try to um elak yang crowded tempat ah just quickly buy anda runcit and quickly come back lor ya 
mm mm mm 
ya 
mm 
mm ya because now itu like so many kes right komuniti still there ya 
mm ya true 
orh ya now itu getting crowded already ya true 
ya 
mm betul mm 
ya correct itu different lor from kita first started right ya everywhere is tidak social menjauhkan now , 
ya saya saw on  uh laman sesawang right beberapa orang even take out mereka topeng ya oh okay so nobody tell mereka , 
okay , baiklah 
ya 
negative pengalaman 
negative pengalaman hmm okay mm 
only what 
mm mmhmm 
tiada siapa was watching over dia 
kerumunan of orang there 
ah right 
oh dear mm saya yeah 
saya tekaan that  visual will probably haunt anda for a long masa 
and itu been tahun right 
saya try not to remember yang negative perkara um but there are certain 
that i wish ive not seen like for contoh a jalan kemalangan 
um anda know , whenever anda pass by um 
jalan um and then mereka have like ini kemalangan and then when anda see yang uh , 
mereka pull out  khemah and then anda know that itu going to be itu actually a cukup a fatal satu 
ive seen unfortunately yeah , um  mangsa a penunggang motosikal ah beberapa i jangan know how itu happened but 
badan itu was like semua um 
tangled into tali on  jalan 
not a pretty penglihatan and straight away anda probably be like i couldnt bantuan but imagine ah how dia keluarga would feel like um 
yeah so itu a very 
devastating ah feeling um ya for  keluarga 
um saya wish ini jenis of perkara itu could have been like averted avoided 
however kemalangan do happen and unfortunately 
tidak itu didnt penghujung baik 
ya 
betul sometimes anda read about itu uh on  berita and mereka were like young anak even and mereka and  pemikiran of 
berfikir or and attempting bunuh diri itu is quite 
unimaginable i mean at a young tender umur right what is itu that is like so penghujung of  dunia that mereka wanted to just 
end mereka hidup 
tanduk on akhbar 
beberapa i jangan know 
is still such a tender umur anda know for mereka to take hidup that serious 
hmm 
hmm okay hais , kay is there 
a masa where anda feel that 
whatever anda do is not good enough for orang 
ya would anda 
okay would anda 
still want to live up with mereka jangkaan 
sometimes ah is hard to do right , anda know anda dont want mereka to um 
to allow mereka ulasan or mereka pendapat to affect anda , but 
itu 
itu still does right in small cara 
then , 
saya know ya 
ya that jenis of perasaan 
correct yeah maybe mereka just 
itu semua about like being in  right klik of orang  right kumpulan of orang  right yang will appreciate anda 
many 
um again ini is one perkara kanan that anda read about itu anda know theres tiada apa-apa much , that 
bimbang does tiada apa-apa to anda but again ini is sesuatu that anda couldnt help 
uh anda worry about anda own kesihatan 
uh anda worry about apa  masa hadapan going to be anda worry for anda uh elderly ibu bapa 
um , itu uh tidak boleh 
bantuan lah but just bimbang for mereka anda know that ada padanya 
tiada apa-apa , beyond , uh anda kawalan that would help to lessen  bebanan but then 
itu still a daily bimbang 
what is itu yeah ibu bapa yeah 
what is itu that anda worry most uh about anda kanak-kanak 
okay ya 
kanan 
ya is a totally different uh keadaan right now right 
saya , i tekaan right now itu even much harder for graduan ah to find a kerja 
as itu is ah or normal keadaan ah is already a anjing makan anjing dunia 
perkara but then right now is even harder 
betul ya 
especially right now hor 
like uh pemberhentian 
um ini 
are very real lah ini are very real itu could happen to sesiapa sahaja bila-bila masa 
ever been bullied before when anda were young 
ya ya , 
ini perkara tidak goes away tanduk , from young and then to anda dewasa 
uh itu can happen to sesiapa sahaja 
oh okay yes 
ya 
betul 
um ya 
young , when saya was young ah saya used to be rather skinny 
quite different from what am i look like kanan now is like 
just  opposite ah like i get fatter so i used to be quite i used to be very skinny among  rakan and saya kawan and saya sepupu 
so mereka used to like call saya nama 
itu was  fasa of saya hidup ah that ive been live through itu 
uh whether be in sekolah or among saya sepupu and even 
under uh even within saya keluarga um 
mereka are like constantly there will be orang to remind saya like why jangan anda eat more um mereka call anda nama for being skinny 
but right now gone to adulthood ya itu a different jenis of uh buli that takes tempat ah 
like tempat kerja ya very different but at  penghujung of itu is still a bentuk of bullying 
what makes anda stressed ini hari 
hais betul 
to do keajaiban right miracle right ya 
oh 
tidak boleh bantuan itu lah anda tarikh akhir work tekanan 
uh keluarga tekanan 
setiap hari is just a different takat of tekanan 
um how to manage itu 
ya 
ya ah 
betul anda may not realise itu until seseorang just make a lepas a casual remark 
have anda been putting on berat what have anda been eating 
ya ada padanya always so much of um bangsa uh judgement pendapat not that anda ask mereka but mereka just come freely and then download itu on anda 
ignore lah tanduk 
apa  biggest ya 
ya saya was about to ask anda lain soalan 
im looking at itu ah whats  biggest perkara holding anda back 
apa sahaja that anda 
ya wang again , 
ya is ada padanya sesuatu that anda 
ya itu 
bahagian of everyday hidup orang get stressed and um 
then anda just have to learn how anda manage  tekanan 
ya and go to sleep with  kepala so heavy kanan 
k what else is ini 
maaf whats  soalan again 
mm probably is , well , like um 
probably anda see sesuatu itu sesuatu that anda know itu is wrongful of  orang to do itu 
yet anda keep quiet because anda dont want 
anda didnt want  episod to escalate to a 
drama episod 
just keep quiet 
and then anda just hope that semuanya will be blown away 
may not be necessary  right perkara to do 
uh morally probably itu wrong 
but because of um  strong akal that anda just want to avoid possible drama 
and then anda kept quiet 
and anda didnt want  orang kanan to 
benci anda for spilling  kacang 
so 
saya know , sometimes itu um 
is a dilema lah whether if anda want to 
whistleblow or just keep quiet 
ya i do a lot 
fobia of getting medical semak up 
fobia of um , semuanya um serangga , 
yeah , semuanya that im not familiar with ketakutan saya 
oh okay 
i hope i jangan have to deal with 
um , uh 
unfavourable peristiwa in hidup though saya know itu is inevitable 
um that bahagian of itu um saya 
saya almost shut saya sendiri off i hope that there wont be a hari that saya , soon or rather that soon itu ive to face lah 
ya but until then i jangan know what to do but for now i would just stay deluded over itu lah 
like 
growing old 
approaching kematian ya and mm possible menderita saya dont know 
so is inevitable lah in hidup 
but saya just dont know how to anda would learn to ever overcome appropriately uh when ini jenis of perkara right itu happens 
ya 
im pasti in certain titik of hidup when kita encounter 
right , um anda 
ya anda feel akal of putus asa anda probably like 
menangis for hari i dont know about bulan before anda eventually get over itu 
um but is never easy 
perkara like duka never easy 
mm and theres tidak sure cara of how orang can um sembuh from itu 
very difficult saya tekaan 
to masing-masing is individual 
but theres tidak sure cara how anda can emerge optimistically about itu 
ya 
okay done 
k describe a peristiwa that made anda very angry 
ever 
im pasti anda do so pissed kanan so pissed 
ya so pissed ya that jenis of feeling yeah suhu wah uh darah tekanan semua shot up so angry 
ya 
ya saya know that perasaan is 
terrible kanan 
i jangan know why orang behave  cara mereka do 
i jangan know why mereka will enjoy ah or get beberapa menyeronokkan just to shift  whole salahkan and not a shared one 
mm and so itu happened so rampantly and itu makes saya 
hairan are ini orang fully aware of what mereka are doing or what mereka are saying i jangan know 
but itu always feel almost very unfair that is like a one sided penganiayaan orh 
betul um 
maybe mereka dont want to maybe mereka minda is already set that anda are  satu who , takes  salahkan 
ya itu does 
a lot and ada padanya tiada apa-apa kita can do 
 dunia will be a better tempat 
ya tanduk 
tidak , 
tidak do a lot mah to just to be jenis 
to one and lain , 
okay 
oh so do anda have other cara or not 
other than overly excited 
maybe ya so basically 
jangan know lah depends ah 
ya 
understand lah fahami 
ya saya wish kanan anda , like for contoh anda can speak more english lah ya 
can , always move onto  next one lah 
ya okay shall kita move on to  next perbualan 
meaning if anda like for contoh anda never cook 
apa anda pengalaman like for contoh 
saya see i wish anda become  next gordon ramsay , 
to ini perbualan 
but like keep saying like ya 
because itu what dia likes ah then from there anda can hop to lain perbualan ah from what dia likes ah 
if itu  kes saya think  best cara is like for contoh anda just tell dia lor 
i mean tidak lah i think anda can tell dia anda like dia lah then if let say dia 
i mean four orang kumpulan then after itu two orang kumpulan lah ya ada padanya tiada apa-apa anda know 
so move on to  next one lor 
ya itu very sad 
oh okay 
maybe itu is a bentuk of flirting uh tanduk betul , have anda experience itu one in anda hidup before mah 
itu a human segera kelakuan 
okay but a very healthy cara lah mm 
fahami 
moving forward lah 
oh okay 
then lain cara is 
yes then i will have lesser penyesalan 
be very effective with anda referral pemasaran model lah ya 
oh najis okay 
ya then okay so basically right 
oh saya see 
ya hopefully lah so i wish anda semua  best lah that anda can chase after dia 
tidak orh fahami 
um fahami 
syarikat penerbangan and keramahan lah 
because tidak pelancongan coming in mah 
ya during  covid sendiri 
how about kita talk about agama lah 
how about anda shower 
fahami so i think mereka are yang 
bad ahli lah  jawatankuasa ah ya 
fahami 
or masjid or kuil 
which is a very good disiplin lah that 
oh itu very vague leh can anda like tell saya more 
because anda already come um 
so that semua orang can win together lah 
betul or not shower 
so  next tajuk kanan is because right currently right 
anda have been drinking kami pejabat , republic kelapa drink how do anda find ini kelapa drink 
next masa kita will sponsor more over here 
mm so anda must come back often 
ya also can 
then kita will host a lot of kelapa peristiwa ah 
fahami 
currently right pancuran 
then datang and buy makanan 
is more to chill with anda kawan lah maybe have a poker malam with anda kawan ya then like basically buy when i went to one kelab malam lah i min is more like a pub at dhoby ghautCity in Illinois, United States there lah so basically i went with saya kawan at harper hotel lah

oh i mean mana-mana im a jenis of lelaki apa sahaja goes ah anda know itu is lah just so happens ah 
that 
ya that is dia lah so ya but itu quite funny though 
if anda i mean anda know that dia was from kami j c kanan 
ya or i think sebab dia was like a tahun younger so 
weiCity in Illinois, United States saya tidak mempunyai told anda ini sia how would anda know eh true 
ya itu actually same 
ya kita met at a bas hentikan at ralat near saya , saya asrama there ah 
ya correct 
but dia same tahun saya think same tahun as anda err 
uh saya think dia wee kim wee ah 
 komunikasi ya 
tidak saya always thought dia was a sains jenis of pelajar ah like ambil kejuruteraan and barang 
correct ya saya also quite surprised 
anda know what i mean 
ya 
well itu only been a few bulan ah since  mula of  tahun 
ya lah as of now just chill lah just ya 
occasional barang 
ya dont want to get saya kepala too high 
ya later anda know saya 
ya 
before itu gets ya 
ya pretty i pretty sure saya already told 
a segelintir of orang only 
ya thats  perkara 
ya ive been wanting to 
have ini perbualan quite awhile lah 
i thought kita could have played permainan anda know during ini err holiday tempoh like how dia used to lah but 
ya saya tekaan ini busy jadualkan 
right saya mean 
how many jam 
and kita dont have itu jenis of masa ah 
so thats how itu is ah 
if not i would have updated anda about more of ini jenis of barang ah 
but itu okay ah ralat saya have ini masa now to anda know 
can i do itu i actually dont minda lah even though im not close to loofy 
saya would i wouldnt minda lah ya saya mean 
as a natural bass pemain saya 
i think saya can handle 
 tanggungjawab of a lead gitaris ah 
ya tidak be a masalah lah but when is ini ah 
quite serious ah dia was anda rakan sekelas kan j c 
mm true 
probably four oh 
so should i laksana like 
like how long how much in pendahuluan can i apply now can already leh 
ya but hows  slot like though 
sebab lebih dekat to god kan 
mm so that means  
oh okay oh so mereka 
mereka close off  kawasan ah 
because then again itu a 
to prevent  sebarkan of 
 air borne jangkitan ah 
ah okay 
 gentle ketuk lah at  buku jari 
situasi ya 
cadangan lah 
mm saya would say ive only been out a few masa for kerja and 
ya saya didnt get to hang out with saya kawan like 
on less than a segelintir of majlis 
ya itu why bro ive been meaning to , on itu ah 
oh ya saya did err  west ham lawan watford kanan 
oh saya hari so did anda manage to watch like a bit of itu or not at semua 
itu quite impressive ah that youve been a barat ham kipas for 
twenty tahun ah 
oh at mana-mana tekanan lah 
but ya lah i think penghujung of  hari 
jenaka is on dia lah sebab west ham 
tidak boleh kekal in  premier liga kanan after itu padanan 
ya itu true 
im quite happy sia for anda 
ya on other tangan 
as for taji right 
ya mm saya would say mereka are doing halus now 
but im just stress ah bro for  last two permainan ah 
ya correct 
sahkan qualify ah europa 
ya juara league dah 
ah ya lah so thats that lah 
quite sad lah sebab anda know 
kita have a lot of kualiti pemain like sean playtonCity in Virginia, United States ah 
ya that is expected of mereka lah 
but uh anda know , bola sepak just bola sepak lah 
betul ini ah tidak boleh be predicted lah 
but anda know how prouds to liverpool 
for securing that 
oh ya bercakap of liverpool right so how is uh anda good kami good kawan ah haviCity in Illinois, United States 
oh  usual springleaf or  prata tempat ah 
mm 
ya itu true 
wah so youll be meeting dia later ah 
ya just send dia saya ah , berkenaan ah 
ralat like dia to know that 
im always happy for dia lah 
sebab ini is like first masa in 
ah ya correct 
uh itu amazing 
ya now dia already ya sia dia already almost thirty already 
and ya so about masa ah 
how emotion emotional bola sepak gets ah 
ya true 
but oh telaga 
oh so what to go into full masa kajian is itu 
does dia say  keperluan for like what do anda call itu ah  yang that above twenty five tahun old 
one of  skema oh  
sesuatu to do with like matang pelajar or sesuatu eh 
oh james cook mm 
ah okay 
dia but dia ghairah nice lah 
ya 
ya saya was at ralat saya was at  n p c and ang mo kio over there ya 
ya correct 
anda know drive around  kawasan kejiranan 
mm do bulatan only ah 
ya but saya would say saya never 
had like a tutup kawan throughout  entire two tahun ah 
sebab tidak satu from saya saya skuad ah actually went to  same ya n p c as saya 
sebab mereka base anda based on anda 
maaf can anda repeat itu again ah 
ralat tidak dapat to hear clearly 
ya saya would say that central kawasan quite tame mah 
whether itu like ralat important or not ah itu a different perkara 
ya so thats how itu was ah 
ya but semua in semua 
okay lah n s hidup 
valuable lah ya 
mm 
ya correct 
but oh well itu 
itu was a good masa ah back in  hari 
ya 
i wish ralat 
i wish saya have rancangan after ini ah but sadly i jangan 
ralat anda know during  usual probably just go for a jalankan 
ya correct yes around 
ini err saya persekitaran lah 
betul ah 
saya usually go for a minimum ten k m ah 
anda know ten k m run ya 
i think i mean 
oh okay 
ya saya think if anda were to consistently do itu right itu doesnt seem like a very long jarak ya 
now i barely need a sip of air ah 
ya correct 
sebab if anda drink too much then later anda sistem 
itu hampered with already ah so anda need to stay clean ah 
ya but not to anda know , pamper itu until to make itu seem as if like anda have to go full 
ya correct 
anda more vulnerable to heatstroke lah 
ya cause  more anda run then like  more anda are without itu jumlah of air then sahkan 
to combat ini jenis barang 
bercakap of minum right so how have anda been 
youve been drinking anda know 
uh i tidak mempunyai been a kipas of anda know alcoholic minuman ah but ive been uh 
err a good a very good pengguna of like ralat jus 
ya like epal jus 
oren jus ah yes anda as anda saying 
uh saya would say at least 
two botol lah 
two botol err five hundred m l jenis ah 
of jus ya correct 
ya correct 
ah okay but where do anda get ini where what what jenama are anda jus 
saya think itu err thats  right cara to go ah to be honest 
then is  tekstur licin 
ya correct then i think i read somewhere that if anda blend  serat 
itu will be drinkable lah but 
mm true ya 
itu why saya would suggest 
beberapa buah-buahan like oren epal actually yang 
but as for 
uh yang jenis of barang that one maybe add a bit ah 
ya 
ya different 
ya anggur is just small smaller versi of limau gedang 
different saiz ya 
ya itu why  best is to 
drink kelapa ah 
mm 
bahagian two debat tajuk two 
hei 
orang bujang appreciate  rayuan of theatre tarian on muzik in kami masyarakat and saya completely agree with  um ini pernyataan , 
first itu kita have to understand itu masa are changing , while on  lepasan um orang bujang may have had  set minda that , 
theatre tarian on muzik ada padanya not ready to have a tempat  so standard tempat in kami masyarakat , 
predominantly because were young bangsa , there are much more aspek of hidup that , kita have to put ahead of kami to prioritise to , get ahead in hidup , i think right now as a negara kita have reached  titik where , 
kita are very comfortable in most aspek of kami hidup , and kita can start to , um fahami and appreciate  rayuan that , beberapa of  aspek that for contoh teater tarian or muzik very non , traditional borang anda know theyre not anda batang subjek theyre not , 
um very technical , mereka do stand a tempat in kami masyarakat 
and especially with now , as being a more global dunia uh global tempat to live in ada padanya a lot of liberalisasi in kami masyarakat , and also , and ada padanya also with a lot of western ideologi um 
coming into ours um into kami tanah , and also  more youthful belia Kini ,  jenis of dedahan that mereka have to 
um  internet peristiwa , and i think semua ini bantuan to proliferate  kebaikan of theatre tarian and muzik and oleh itu 
orang bujang do appreciate itu rayuan of seni and more so right kita do see that ini um penghargaan is a lot um stemming from a very young umur 
and a lot has to be given to  jenis of 
um usaha put up by  kerajaan anda know well beat through um geran for artis in mereka whatever medan of kerja mereka tipu doing , or is itu in sekolah  jenis of program that theyve initiated in sekolah , 
which im not say do have a high take up kadar , why would sesiapa sahaja , who has tidak penghargaan whatsoever for  rayuan of theatre tarian on muzik , 
mahu to study in greater perincian , as an entire subjek that has , much timbangan as anda , normal english gagal anda piawai stem subjek right , 
so in having said that if anda are willing to invest that much of masa to study sesuatu , itu clearly is a tandatangan that orang bujang are appreciative , of 
 rayuan that theatre tarian and muzik have in kami masyarakat 
okay so first perkara on  whole titik of , seni not being a keutamaan to orang bujang , firstly saya to establish itu just because itu is not a keutamaan , does not mean that mereka tipu not 
apresiatif of itu , i get itu that itu came as a pertikaian to  titik when saya said that , oh masa are changing last masa orang had more pressing isu to deal with kanan 
but even so now even if now mereka may have other , pressing isu to deal with , over theatre tarian on muzik , and just because mereka do not prioritise seni 
does um i mean um teater tarian on muzik does not mean that mereka do not appreciate itu , kita still see that , itu still exists as bahagian of mereka hidup itu does not necessarily need to be a keutamaan , in  whole idea of mereka 
being so caught up with mereka own , daily work mereka own , hectic gaya hidup that mereka , dont have masa to make , to mereka do not have  masa , um to uh mewah to appreciate  seni kanan , kita see that 
seni teater tarian on muzik  alam semula jadi of itu is just such that , anda dont have to make itu 
explicit usaha to go out to appreciate itu cebisan of seni is a very semula jadi formed itu is really just , bahagian of anda just like a perasaan when saya say that oh i love anda , itu doesnt mean that i need to make masa to love anda i , is really just how anda feel about itu itu rather an emosi that anda feel , 
and in itu akal kita see that orang bujang are , appreciative , of itu rayuan that itu brings and again like saya had mentioned , tidak satu would want to spend itu much of masa to pursue sesuatu right from  mula at , 
a tertiary aras to 
if mereka do not appreciate and , when kita talk about ini pelajar who going back to saya earlier tajuk saya already talk about ini pelajar who , choose to study a certain tajuk anda see that 
well kami seni is being exposed at a very young umur 
to kami  later bahagian of anda schooling umur especially towards  tertiary bahagian , is pelajar who are at  umur of sixteen seventeen lapan belas , that totally able to make mereka own pilihan , and is to choose to pursue elective program basically because  hargai  rayuan of , theatre tarian on muzik 
and  whole idea of , how seni may not appeal to semua because , itu a very 
foreign konsep is a very western konsep and while , at singapura kita are still a very conservative masyarakat 
kita at anda need to understand itu seni is not really sesuatu very radical not very liberal , if youre conservative halus but semua bermaksud there are theatre tarian and muzik in  conservative kawasan as well , like for contoh just now in  previous debat anda mentioned  whole idea of , 
 indian classical tarian , then sendiri is a very conservative bentuk of seni 
and if kita see itu and ini jenis of seni can um 
can um be performed within mereka own confined within mereka own conservative had , kita still see that ada padanya still bilik for orang to appreciate itu , and  whole idea of how , um orang may not be really uh appreciate seni borang there too offensive , 
perhaps im a very vulgar orang , if anda come and , um give saya a very a rap muzik with where many vulgar lirik , saya may appreciate that if im say , seseorang with  very crude mulut , and i hear semua um semua ini i think i wont hargai that 
right so itu really to masing-masing itu own ya so even very conservative masyarakat as to see that , um seni borang can still be appreciated 
okay so in  whole idea of , how if theres a Tindak balas then singaporeans dont hargai itu right , kita first need to understand itu teater tarian on muzik there just is very wide itu huge kanan , so ,  jenis of conservative seni borang itu is , 
i mean um , vulgar seni bentuk so youre saying itu could potentially brings Tindak balas , is really just a bahagian of seni kanan , anda have needed to look at  bigger gambar where on seni as a whole , semua has mereka own keutamaan and , 
there would definitely be certain kawasan in teater tarian uh rayuan that would um rayuan to ini orang bujang 
so to totally have a selimut and say that , oh just because theyre beberapa , borang of seni that um would go against  kepercayaan of a very conservative singaporean masyarakat then theres tidak rayuan for itu , so in saying so i think 
does not set wrong on  singaporean masyarakat and oleh itu , altogether orang bujang are not appreciative of itu , so one clear contoh saya can bring to anda is in  current konteks era into ini status quoCity in New York, United States were semua , 
huddled at rumah covid nineteen and semuanya , kita see how muzik brings orang together , kita see how um young sekolah budak lelaki in primary sekolah mereka come up , with very nice lagu , to express mereka fikiran on ini harapan pandemic keadaan , kita see how orang 
while in pengasingan at , hotel berdiri at mereka by mereka balkoni just listening to seseorang play  lagu of rumah 
right because itu really does connect semua orang , kita see how semua , um coming out to mereka tetingkap singing loudly together as a singaporean masyarakat may i penekanan , lagu that really unite mereka and kita see that ini is where , singaporeans appreciate  rayuan of , 
dipilih to take bahagian in , a very communal peristiwa mereka chose to , engage in a lagu together , 
anda know mereka stand in solidariti itu mereka see that , ini brings mereka together rather than just sitting , at mereka own keselesaan behind mereka telefon pintar typing sesuatu , mereka choose to engage in sesuatu that theyve hargai , and feel would connect better itu ready 
um placed to mereka jantung rentetan and ini is a clear penunjuk of how orang bujang do appreciate  rayuan of , theatre tarian on muzik in kami masyarakat 
yup done 
bahagian three debat tajuk three 
sorry  pemasa is not counting down 
um going green tidak make a good perniagaan akal because ini brings away  fokus of what is a good perniagaan , 
um being a good perniagaan being a good syarikat being a good , syarikat means , a profitable syarikat 
and kita semua look into nombor , and going green only drives up kos and , Ketidakcekapan , itu doesnt really bring in  keuntungan , as mereka so call a positive and um 
positive and complimentary titik brought up by  proposisi , mereka are mainly uh very qualitative and unsupported , um even though itu drives jualan in certain aspek 
but mereka only mention  jualan nombor without actually , uh top out  keuntungan , in actual fakta ini nombor in jualan has gone up yes orang do support mereka but itu doesnt , drive a very good perniagaan akal , because kos has gone up untung has gone down tremendously 
and , ini is detrimental to perniagaan for also like going green is detrimental to perniagaan for two related sebab , itu distracts from what perniagaan should be focused on which is being profitable , and also undermines  proper perniagaan akauntabiliti 
and as well that means to be accountable to itu own pemegang saham , so , just bear by on large like when orang buy and invest into stok and buy into a syarikat , um mereka look into is ini syarikat is going to thrive , uh in terma of nombor , so , going green only 
bawa back  syarikat by a few more langkah , and itu are maybe positive sebab to believe so , but mereka are not quantitative but qualitative sebab , that uh kita cant really measure 
for one perkara saya want to point out is that 
 sebab why kita are being here is because of inovasi , and because kita are moving forward , and moving forward kita tend to invent perkara that brought will bring kami kemudahan , take for kejadian plastik and plastik beg straws 
why were ini uh being invented in  first tempat is because itu brings a lot of kemudahan and itu helps to bring and improve kami kualiti of hidup as human 
and then um now kita have to go out of  aspek of going green , 
um itu doesnt make a big a good perniagaan akal even for , human perlumbaan sendiri as well as for  syarikat , and just to bring up  titik further uh why itu doesnt make a good perniagaan akal is that itu  kompas keupayaan to attain and then to retain sufficient , 
keuntungan to sustain sendiri and move forward , but is at ini proses is already not easy and just to quote beberapa nombor is that one in two perniagaan fail in setiap of  first five tahun , and then slowly after one , after ten tahun and one in less 
uh one in three , will not be able to survive in a ten tahun kitaran , so if saya have a syarikat that is so difficult to survive already put so much fokus in , trying to thrive , and focusing as a syarikat on keuntungan , 
uh bringing on an extra kos of being staying green and coming out ini extra r n d kos , will only have more detrimental kesan for  syarikat and , not being able to account to ,  pemegang saham as put in so much sumber and wang into  syarikat 
there is that even though there are a lot bigger syarikat has already gone through ini so called and proposed c s r to help address um going green isu to , respect semua pihak berkepentingan 
but sehingga now  nombor still doesnt show much akauntabiliti to itu main pemegang saham 
and even to  pelanggan sendiri 
so like just as lain contoh would be uh kami fast makanan restoran down in singapura k f c , and as well mcdonalds going green mereka , mereka proposed to remove semua plastic penutup uh from  cawan for takeaways , 
and even for having a hidangan that is like uh supposed to be a diet makanan but 
surprising enough after three bulan without , mana-mana uh bentuk of pengumuman 
 penutup got brought back because itu is not convenient itu is um  buat not , making mana-mana perniagaan akal because , mereka own penghantaran penunggang as well as many 
pelanggan came back complaining that mereka minum got spilled 
um mereka require lain bentuk of like penggantian cawan 
itu drives up even more kos for  syarikat sendiri 
anda may argue that uh kita could promote uh when as a restoran , mereka could promote uh bring anda own cawan , um anda know save  persekitaran and go green , and as a syarikat aspek but do anda actually know that actually drives in a lot of kebersihan faktor that has never been discussed 
for contoh um like during covid tempoh singapore kerajaan actually 
um encouraged orang to do more takeaways bring mereka own bekas , itu was being proposed initially and then slowly itu has been taken out , because mereka realize that actually contributes to a lot of , hygiene faktor , because uh there could be isu where um 
isi rumah or orang bringing mereka own bekas which had not been washed properly , and brought down to different restoran , and to take away makanan in  penghujung resulted in like makanan poisoning not because of  makanan produced by  restoran , but because of mereka own kecuaian 
and ini drives unnecessary kos and ketidaknyamanan for  perniagaan , so , um that being said ini is why um anda know 
uh perniagaan having a good perniagaan akal and , um is very important to a 
syarikat , was only being focused on keuntungan and as well , um pemegang saham akauntabiliti not so much into , going green and going through  c s r , uh program , and then 
uh back to ini c s r program were actually led up by a lot of , um anti perniagaan environmentalist who thrive to greenwash  general awam 
and as bunyi as hypocritical itu is 
is actually a bentuk as , other organisasi trying to drive new industri like coming out with c s r perunding and pakar , try to remind different various big organisasi that ini is important , but in fakta itu is not is just like , uh iklim ubah 
is sesuatu that is um fear be instilled within um different organisasi and different like aras of industri 
um , just to bring back a titik on ini perbicaraan and ralat barang yes samsung was like maybe named one of  worst 
um c s r syarikat that tidak , layak to go green , but however itu uh mereka are still putting continuous usaha , but dont anda think that ini is pretty much , critical in  akal that like , 
mereka are still building a lot of um , non eco friendly um t vs telefon bimbit elektronik kereta , um that doesnt really promote about going green 
but um mereka so called corporate imej and p r imej has improved because mereka decided to tumbuhan beberapa pokok in  hutan , that is not somewhere to counter right um anda know as a syarikat , and pretty much mereka have figured out that anda know going green tidak really make mana-mana good perniagaan akal at semua 
but only maintaining a hypocritical dimuka , makes perniagaan akal going green tidak 
and then um bring forward to  titik of mcdonalds and different pantas makanan and why , um anda know mereka stopped serving sos in paket , uh mainly because singapura has improved , as a masyarakat that kita are matured that kita are able to , anda know 
have  kita know how much sos kita want to take bila-bila masa kita need kita only take apa sahaja kita need 
and previously  sembilan puluhan and early two thousand ini was not introduced , because kita have a very 
worldly uh recognised semangat called kiasu , um because of itu and uh kita tend to overtake perkara that kita dont need , and , ini is still a sebab and kesan in kita can still see in fast makanan ubah of mcdonalds , in other um bandar in  in tenggara asia 
because mereka are not developed and not mature yet mereka get  same mentaliti , so um  kerajaan saya mean  restoran had to , use a per paket jenis of like a , sistem to limit 
 sos guna , and fundamentally ini is still driven by kos , not so much about um going green , and at  kembali of itu that drives um  ubah in um  fast makanan , uh sistem , and 
so going green really , um in different 
industri plays a different peranan , um anda cant expect like uh electrical tumbuhan saya mean uh electric tumbuhan to say that saya want go green but uh limiting  jumlah of tenaga im going to produce , uh itu not 
itu not , feasible , and kita could perhaps 
uh anda know go green by anda know if ada padanya more organisasi that go through r n d to bring down like to replace , um different , uh produk to replace um say plastik but 
kita have just awarded  three d pencetak as  latest and greatest , uh inovasi of  dua puluh first abad by bringing three d plastik mencetak into kami isi rumah , tidak akan that seems very hypocritical 
kita actually can now produce plastik from kami own rumah other than  kilang in chinaCity in Virginia, United States , and were here talking about uh syarikat should go green and make perniagaan akal , itu sesuatu not viable to saya 
ya id like to conclude  debat , 
um saya think uh saya also have a stanchart lompat start actually cause i think like itu quite common pengetahuan that uh mereka tipu mereka were actually giving  best minat kadar kanan 
two peratus per annum , but i think with kesan from july which is ini bulan seterusnya ah mereka nerved itu to one peratus already lah , 
then um other than itu saya actually have three other um penjimatan akaun , so  first satu is  sial uh , starting akaun which is  p o s b e penjimatan anda know when , when anda are kid then anda actually open itu akaun , so um 
itu is not a very ideal akaun im actually im not too sure why saya still keep itu lah but itu gives like zero titik zero five peratus only , 
then , 
ya i mean im just keeping like  terdedah minimum in there , i dont know why lah but ya im just keeping  akaun sebab itu always been there 
then um saya open d b s pengganda when saya started working so initially mereka kadar ah actually not bad then itu got overtaken by o c b c then i still stuck with itu lah but recently again ini just last minggu 
um mereka nerve mereka , uh minat kadar as well 
ya anda saw  artikel as well right ya , so now itu 
so now right um itu is like only i think one titik six peratus , for one transaksi and two peratus for two transaksi but for saya i only use one transaksi lah sebab saya only have mereka kredit kad saya jangan have , um like insurans with mereka i also dont melabur with mereka so 
itu not very worth itu but got to still stick with anda of kursus , 
itu is not cause tidak eh , tidak itu doesnt ya itu why 
recently also um ubah eh 
eh ya but i didnt really see what whats  minat kadar ah at u o b 
orh 
okay so anda are anda actually hit  maks 
oh okay wah mm 
mm 
okay saya need to check on itu , sebab 
like , 
i jangan know eh saya have never considered u o b ah sebab of  fakta that , mereka are so little a t m , 
d b s ya  baris gilir is like super long ya okay ah sakit go and check but i feel a bit 
ya is  three six five , ya itu that thats not comparable already lah saya like id rather tinggal at d b s if ya lor if im not jumping over to u o b 
ya then  last satu saya had was singlife tanduk did anda actually open kehidupan tunggal ah 
oh okay ya , 
okay 
 dolar kos purata is itu 
thingy , oh okay 
okay that one is under robo penasihat is itu 
but itu is itu like a uh a robo penasihat jenis of perkara like anda just actually put how much in a bulan then mereka will actually just anda know 
oh okay , mm , mm , 
oh okay ya that actually constitute to lain transaksi eh actually , ya cause itu under pelaburan mah 
mm , 
if itu two transaksi is two peratus orh 
so if anda are hitting maks at u o b then anda can stay at u o b lah anda can actually go mereka laman sesawang leh 
saya think there is um salary crediting mereka have um different , uh different tahap itu will be a different peratusan so  more salary is credited in u o b actually anda know different salary julat saya mean  different 
ya correct so 
anda can actually go mereka laman sesawang and check itu is damn straightforward like anda just have to key in like anda know whats anda salary kanan , and like how many boleh dipercayai anda have mereka automatically compute like how much peratus anda can get , so itu very easy anda dont have to own self lihat at a jadual and like angka itu out 
uh tidak perlu but kredit kad would count as one transaksi , and for mereka theres tidak minimum perbelanjaan so even if anda kredit kad anda just use itu like one dolar kanan is considered as one transaksi already 
can i think mereka have bah 
mana-mana d b s or p o s b kad itu considered one kredit kad one , like itu considered one kategori already 
mm 
can go and compare lor but i feel that if anda can actually hit maks at u o b tidak be that bad 
bah ya unless , have  minimum kanan 
but actually usually right saya mean 
one hack that i ive dipelajari , from saya rakan sekerja is right , whenever kita go out for pasukan makan tengah hari semua yang right mereka just offer to pay for mereka , 
ya but  difficult bahagian is anda have to like collect  wang back ya 
ya correct yups 
itu i think itu semua lor that saya have to kongsi for semua  penjimatan akaun that saya have , 
mm 
um actually semua along ive been using debit leh 
like 
okay for , for pengangkutan saya use debit sebab previously saya was actually using um bank of china kredit kad 
so i cant sunting into saya epal bayar , ya so whenever like uh im like using epal bayar yang jenis then itu wouldnt be itu ya itu will be under debit lor  standard bank akaun debit card then recently um saya just changed so 
ya 
ganjaran right , mm , 
anda kredit kad is what um what jenis of kad 
okay same lor same ya same 
ya saya agree , 
ya and saya feel that like , batu i mean usually orang go for batu right is let say if mereka really want to experience like perniagaan kelas or first kelas like  one masa in mereka hidup , which i think like i mean saya can live without itu lah , 
ya , and like anda said lor like 
anda theres actually a garis masa for anda to actually redeem  titik , and anda have to really spend a lot to even get  batu 
with , 
oh is itu , so thats via titik is anda use anda titik to buy  batu 
ya 
okay , 
okay saya get what anda mean okay but im really never penyelidikan in uh into ini kawasan sebab , itu ya itu not what i want like saya think 
ya like um saya rakan sekerja dia actually use dia batu lah to travel like perniagaan kelas that jenis , so wah is damn intense like dia will kongsi like dia whole excel carta how dia actually plan  batu 
like anda know uh let say if dia want to buy a big tiket item then dia will actually use what kad that jenis of barang wah i min , too much otak eh 
jenis of transaksi that anda want to do right ya saya think is too intense for saya is like just give saya beberapa rebate like im happy , 
mm like anda dont have to do apa sahaja lor basically like mereka will just auto kredit what anda dont have to do apa sahaja about itu 
but anda current 
tidak saya just want to know like anda current kad what jenis of cashback or what jenis of rebat there is 
same actually like 
saya dont even count whether itu betul 
ya saya will just take itu 
i mean i got semak lah , yang i definitely will check saya will check like what i spend on saya will check what i spend on , ya sebab saya also heard like itu like yang , ituniCity in Illinois, United States then like two dolar that jenis kanan ya 
oh okay ya so far alls good so far alls good , 
actually tanduk i saw saya saw a very interesting soalan , anda know mereka mereka ask right do anda think that uh pasangan should combine mereka kewangan and open a joint akaun what do anda think 
mm , 
mm 
okay , 
okay when oh 
oh ya is itu ya okay so anda are just waiting for when perkara are hundred peratus solidified , 
mm 
oh saya god itu so scary , 
wow ya , 
ya what do anda mean ini saya akaun , 

ya 
shag manusia is itu  teman lelaki not much wang , 
ah ya sia mm 
but like is there mana-mana perbezaan between like joint akaun and normal akaun 
oh anda havent penyelidikan yet 
mm , 
saya think so , i feel that is more ya itu more Ke arah like having common menyimpan goes in for kemudahan rather than actually i dont know lah i jangan know , i try to picture like how is itu like sebab like if let say anda want to make mana-mana perubahan to  akaun whatsoever itu sial troublesome eh itu like kedua-duanya parti have to be present 
ya but itu easier if anda semua are like 
like really getting perkara for a isi rumah lah like if anda are like buying perabot that jenis , then can just easily take out from there 
mm 
okay next 
 next soalan at what umur do anda think that a anak should be given an a t m kad 
wah as early as possible okay so if let say if ada padanya a keadaan where youre going to have a kanak-kanak when do anda think is a right pemasaan like primary 
sekolah secondary sekolah sec two 
how do anda derive at sec two 
so random itu like saat two 

okay fair enough saya was thinking sec one ah 
um similar to what anda said , but i feel that anda know like um primary sekolah sakit still consider mereka then too young i dont know lah im just extrapolating from saya own pengalaman like primary sekolah saya also dont really go out much like saya wang can spend on where , so itu only like when secondary sekolah starts that like 
like anda go out more that jenis of barang like youll have more perbelanjaan and itu when mereka will learn how to , manage mereka wang also lah so i was just thinking actually sec one would be okay mereka should be independent enough already itu like one pentas has passed anda pass p s l e , 
ya but i think kita are quite similar on ini tanduk secondary sekolah lor 
mm 
wah saya think ini is really up to anda own risiko appetite eh like anda know a lot of orang say oh anda have to anda got to have at least um six bulan worth of anda salary in anda bank anda know as like kecemasan dana , 
but itu also depends on how much youre melukis and also like how much anda keselesaan aras is , to have liquid dana what like let say if anda are not so um assured then anda have to have more in um kecemasan dana for like maybe like ten bulan or sesuatu , then  rehat anda can um invest itu or sesuatu lah 
so itu up to anda own but , i dont think anda should put like really whole perkara , in  bank is like rotting unless anda are really like sial freaking scared lah i jangan know , 
like i tekaan anda can afford to try to use a bahagian to invest a little 
like ya 
ya itu saya personal pendapat 
mm , 
anda wang just stuck there orh , ya anda are losing wang 
mm , mm 
mm 
i agree , mm i agree 
so , 
um saya think kedua-duanya of kami agree lah that 
itu ultimately itu still depends on um what keadaan anda are actually uh in seperti at  titik of anda hidup whether anda can actually , anda know um mampu to be , slightly riskier in itu 
or anda know or to be more conservative and itu also uh and one important perkara is also still diversification lah like tidak jirim how conservative anda are , itu would still be  best to anda know put anda wang in different bakul rather than semuanya solely in  bank 
going green makes good perniagaan akal 
alright should kita start 
well again i would like to emphasise itu uh toward , kita going Ke arah green there is a uh 
harga to pay for anda know uh in economically wise economical bijak uh of obviously anda have to pay almost double eh uh nama card a nama kad , a , simple perkara like a nama kad 
uh a kotak of solek might cause anda like ten dolar but if anda insist on using recycled Kertaspaper size itu going to cost anda like uh fifteen dolar 
and uh with  dua puluh fifth peratus peningkatan mm itu from  nama kad itu doesnt keadaan that itu whether itu a recycled Kertaspaper size or is not a kitar semula Kertaspaper size so uh for syarikat bijak kebimbangan ugh if anda are talking about 
uh to in tertib to go Ke arah green and anda need to uh milik anda perbelanjaan has itu will increase by lain fifty peratus more , then again theyll be looking at what isih of targeting pasaran orang that mereka had anda know , um does orang really , does doesnt mean that if anda dont give saya a recycled uh nama kad 
im not going to do perniagaan with anda tidak i jangan think itu , 
ya that was itu doesnt uh itu doesnt make akal ini cara 
uh there is a peratusan on uh going Ke arah green uh is definitely uh kita are talking about peningkatan in perbelanjaan between tiga puluh to forty peratus anda know look at  badan shop mereka mereka go Ke arah green 
by collecting back  uh botol but itu was not successful because how many green orang anda can find itu is of itu will actually make a perjalanan down and carry semua ini big heavy uh losyen botol or shower botol with anda when anda go to work or anda go shopping and then anda know giving back to mereka if kita if i dont get mana-mana 
ah perps from giving anda back a botol anda know , uh 
also uh itu that there are a lot of very laid back negara like uh yang uh penduduk kampung uh in malaysia in chinaCity in Virginia, United States um mereka will never bother to 
to go Ke arah green because in  first placed in india provinsi mereka do not even have uh , um uh um 
um saya would say a kempen like itu anda know so itu is uh , if anda are selling to orang like mereka anda know and whether anda dont anda know that itu by going green anda got to increase anda perbelanjaan or anda kos of barang by almost separuh 
and at  penghujung of  hari tiada siapa knows about itu tiada siapa bothers about itu um that tidak make akal for from a perniagaan uh titik of paparan 
ya back to anda john 
there isnt a pasaran for ini orang so , uh going green tidak necessary make a good perniagaan akal for certain kawasan 
well uh ini is a uh 
from saya own statistic di mana where kita purchase , err uh biodegradable , uh plastik or kertas uh recycled kertas versus uh bukan biodegradable uh barang bukan recyclable barang 
uh kami meningkat is by lain tiga puluh to forty peratus but for  nama kad sendiri  nama kad is definitely a fifty peratus peningkatan and uh saya got a lot of petikan for nama kad so uh averagely is about fifty peratus 
ya anda can challenge saya if anda have mana-mana other nombor that anda like to kongsi with saya 
uh to going uh ya itu 
uh ya in a cara and saya will i would like to add on also uh going Ke arah green is not semua about buying recyclable uh plastik and then uh at  penghujung of hari anda still throw into  sampah bin and then itu actually go into a menuntut semula tanah or anda know just 
bakar itu in  , burn itu or just burn itu off , that will also produce uh karbon dioksida into  udara , uh itu green is going green is a such a big proses di mana , when anda come when anda talk about from 
from  ladang to  garpu to  jadual and semua  cara to uh disposing itu off there is a siri of uh protokol that anda need to follow so for singapura to be frank uh if anda are using a green produk itu end up itu will still end up in  insinerator and burn itu off uh of kursus mereka do sorting 
mereka melt  plastik but  actual cara to 
to uh to 
melt  plastik is not to burn off is to melt itu off okay  actual cara to do a recycled Kertaspaper size is actually to have a huge cebisan of tanah with  correct suhu uh what kita call commercial 
to break down  kertas into err uh baja and go right into  bumi a lot of orang who are who would not understand 
itu ,  ,  reput and  perbezaan between reput and biodegradable , biodegradable kita need certain bahan kimia to add in tertib to for  bahan to be breakdown and that involving kimia as well so 
so anda get saya titik when anda when anda want to spend maybe lain tiga puluh peratus more to buy a safe 
ralat uh 
a biodegraded uh a , compostable uh kotak anda know , because anda want to contribute back to  bumi uh at  penghujung of hari when saya finished sakit still throw into  sampah bin and itu will still end up into  insinerator to burn itu off 
and saya only , but i only contribute uh Ke arah green by 
buying ini produk from a natural sumber anda know but when itu come to  penghujung produk  cara kita break down and kita burn itu off is not going to recycle back again 
and semua so uh a lot of orang will come to a titik whereby mereka argue kita use ini anda know why should i spend more wang lain tiga puluh or forty peratus more to get ini green produk but at  penghujung of  hari i know that itu doesnt really contribute much back to  bumi so if kita , a lot of orang will have ini konsep and how is perniagaan going 
to , err make good wang if mereka going to 
uh 
come up with produk like itu and then itu not selling because uh im talking about singapura pasaran right now uh there isnt a tanah for kami to decompose uh to break down bahan so itu doesnt make 
much perniagaan akal to uh go Ke arah green and then itu start losing bahagian of anda perniagaan to anda pesaing whereby uh mereka are not actually going towards itu green kawasan and mereka tipu still selling well with a cheaper harga to  pengguna back to anda john 
ya 
mmhmm 
uh maaf saya , sorry shirley itu been log off saya , submit already should i , resend again do saya do  same 
uh what mereka call uh langkah 
itu tersangkut itu gone i submit already because saya saw itu stop so i submit again already so i have to 
saya have to 
ini halaman can anda see oh maaf ya 
ya saya think itu , 
itu actually stopped so i saw itu stopped so i faster serah first because itu stopped recording already 
ya 
saya jangan have to log re daftar masuk again 
okay so sorry okay uh sorry a bit lost uh , where do anda stop where do anda , john where do anda stop itu 
mm okay 
mm 
mm 
sure um okay , as saya mentioned anda know going , Ke arah green is a huge harga to pay when kita look about well talk about solar panel uh solar panel has been introduced like maybe but thirty tahun ago and saya have uh 
saya only came across uh saya was in a pembinaan baris and saya only in saya ini thirty tahun of uh working hidup i only came across two good kelas bungalow itu are willing to install solar panel on atas of  bumbung 
uh during yang hari and  r o i kembali was thirteen tahun im telling anda that itu that itu that is  fakta , so when kita talk about green r o is of kursus  nombor one itu when itu come into perniagaan akal and how much  kerajaan here can subsidise 
or to to do uh 
ya to subsidise anda know in tertib for um for kami to start to kick off anda know  first five tahun to let mereka know how important uh hijau is semua about anda know doing  correct kempen during  correct penjenamaan uh getting  betul , correct uh what mereka call strong uh 
pernyataan uh into semua ini orang 
so , going green itu not Ke arah uh itu not about itu minoriti of pengguna that is willing to pay for  top high harga and then anda can start uh putting anda can start putting  syarikat at risiko to manufacture or start membeli anda know green barang to 
to uh serve ini uh bahagian of  small pengguna , small pengguna in  pasaran eh if youre asking saya singapura is never itu is till now itu is still not ready anda know because kita have a lot of uh old orang anda know which mereka never believe in , going Ke arah green uh 
mereka will say eh let talk about uh air anda know when  kerajaan have to increase  air harga in tertib for  orang to realise that anda know uh saving air is bahagian of uh going green and then mereka refused to install  potong of like a 
uh saya dont know what mereka call itu minimise  air terjun jenis of  tekanan mereka anda know to to reduce ah air aliran and because semua ini are uh kekalkan of tenaga and anda know and tenaga is also uh were talking about contributing back to Ke arah green as well 
uh kita talk about kereta anda know uh 
hybrid kereta and  kerajaan have not subsidise enough anda know itu if anda could like anda know sesiapa sahaja who buy a hybrid kereta will not have to pay a c o e saya tell anda there will be tan of orang buying hybrid kereta but why hari ini orang feel that hybrid kereta itu not that important 
anda know compare to fuel because mereka want  kemudahan because there isnt much enough stesen to charge anda know there isnt uh  orang 
orang are , afraid of uh running out of uh 
there charging stesen for  hybrid kereta so uh 
sakit i conclude saya pernyataan as saying that uh itu kita are not ready uh maybe in lain ten tahun masa kita might be ready but right now under perniagaan akal saya think uh tiada siapa will risk mereka r o uh risk mereka perniagaan in uh in terma of r o saya to go Ke arah green terima kasih anda 
saya think 
saya think maybe makanan 
but like ini

ya can not lah then itu like 
saya wouldnt be surprised leh 
itu like quite fun lah anda see what how semua perkara then after itu 
one masa i think kita were saying sesuatu like ralat

then after itu 
then 
ya then 
im serious 
then kita went to dia rumah was like 
why anda katil beside got  ear sudu there then dia was like i dig setiap hari ah very nice what  perasaan

anda can taste semua  , err individual bahan but then like together itu but itu doesnt mesh well 
ya then after that anda throw in a bit of garam but itu just masin so itu like

oo 
okay can kita end off here 
okay so do kita just stop okay kita stop first 
uh yup ah , orh uh financial related 
topik

kita talk among dia ah 
oh okay , 
kay okay covid masa is itu orh 
so for anda saving ah , 
oh so uh anda done 
orh okay ah then ah 
for saya ah saya tabiat of menyimpan is 
once i get saya gaji like for one bulan 
ill keep 
like forty peratus for 
uh perbelanjaan on cloth semua  perkara i need ah not need ah  perkara i want 
then  other peratus  enam puluh peratus 
sakit put itu in saya bank save itu uh make pasti saya wont sentuh itu ah 
like okay ah like what anda say uh during  covid masa 
like 
very hard not very hard ah um 
more difficult to 
pembelian barang outside ah so mostly itu atas talian 
ya okay done ah trend ah like trendy barang like ya orh anda done ah oh okay , uh for saya 
saya sakit probably say ya 
save up more jangan follow 
like what other orang , perkara ah what other orang buys dont ikuti 
might be trendy but 
but like if itu doesnt pique like anda minat 
like 
just a trend ah like follow orang by barang if anda like follow mereka buy as well 
i feel like itu not worth itu lah ya i feel like if anda 
financial nasihat 
mula investing ya 
when youre younger ya mula investing learn more about uh  financial sistem ah 
ya done ah ya , ya 
okay saya think that one kita skip ah , kita got where got kita married siol 
okay ah in uh pos covid dunia 
what changes anda are making to anda perbelanjaan saving tabiat uh 
okay ah during , uh during litar pemutus uh ya 
pusat membeli-belah not open , 
then from there saya started saving 
like 
kita dont go out as much as kita used to ah going to  pusat membeli-belah 
see uh oh 
like how to say 
ill go to a retail stor lihat pakaian jenama 
like tidak like itu so kita 
didnt spend as much like for filem arcades kita didnt spend  wang on itu 
then i feel kita saved 
then after  litar pemutus 
like fasa one fasa two kita get used to itu 
ya done ah orh ya so are kita done okay uh 
okay for saya i do not understand api what 
if anda talking about kemerdekaan when young 
i feel like if anda , 
mula working when anda are young ah like seventeen enam belas or lapan belas 
um , how to say ah anda get used to itu 
anda get used to getting lot of wang like not lot of wang , anda get used to getting anda own 
salary anda own wang 
anda spend itu however anda like but itu anda own tanggungjawab 
but since itu anda tanggungjawab anda feel 
like once anda start working anda get used to itu and anda feel , 
more embarrassed asking ibu bapa for wang 
ya saya from like from there i think itu will start , 
anda are becoming more kemerdekaan ah 
ya done ah see tidak i feel like 
c p f saving ah how anda manage 
okay ah for kami uh bahagian pemasa 
if anda get c p f most wont be happy sebab 
kita , like kita dont earn as much as full pemasa 
ya then like anda hesitate to find kerja that has , c p f sumbangan 
sebab 
itu takes twenty peratus of kami bayar 
but i feel like if anda start young ah 
for c p f sumbangan like anda start working anda contribute to anda c p f 
i feel like itu might help in  masa hadapan ah who knows 
uh for 
maximise anda c p f ya who knows anda can maximise anda c p f penjimatan ah for bersara 
ya okay ah saya mean 
not only kami c p f contributed twenty peratus but um 
syarikat uh , sumbangan as well i think seventeen or eighteen peratus ah 
contributed ya itu might help ah 
ya , 
saya skip ah for ini soalan saya langkau 
ya im not too sure ah , nah oh anda done orh maaf pakaian ah orh okay ah for saya , 
tunggu wheres  soalan 
spending too much on okay ah for anak muda ah 
uh like how to say 
kami umur kami , kami penjanaan , 
spendings a lot on 
rokok ya

really make anda lose anda wang ah 
sebab , ya one pek already is 
very expensive ah considered 
ya and like , once anda get 
how to say anda get addicted 
then like one minggu what three four pek or more 
then like , 
just like itu what forty dolar gone one minggu 
keperluan and jangan ah keperluan and want 
keperluan and want ya 
social media ah once anda see sesuatu itu like 
appealing ya 
anda just want to buy itu 
ya 
yes ya keperluan and want ah 
anda are done ah oo , 
okay ah for saya 
full ya , uh full pemasa can work on  weekdays hujung minggu i mean hujung minggu uh doing ambil but for uh for kedua-duanya parti ah bahagian pemasa and full pemasa 
mereka can start an 
perniagaan , atas talian perniagaan ah like koruslaCity in Illinois, United States

jual from there create uh 
how to say , 
a good atas talian perniagaan like a popular one or from maybe from instagram

for sure anda wont touch itu lah 
ya itu semua lah for saya , done ah ya yup ugh 
individual ah 
ya okay ah for now kita might not think ah itu itu bernilai itu but in  masa hadapan might be ah ya okay ah 
prompt three of four 
okay so um pembelajaran is best outside of bilik darjah so learning outside  bilik darjah provides a real dunia konteks , and expose pelajar to a julat of different pembelajaran 
so err in jumlah itu up , kanak-kanak tend to learn better when mereka are outside of bilik darjah so ada padanya actually um a laporkan published by  oxford 
uh found pembelajaran of luar of bilik darjah contributed significantly to raising piawai and improving pelajar , uh personal and social 
itu and emotional pembangunan so itu uh itu a more ya so ini is why i think learning is actually best out of bilik darjah 
okay ya saya agree masa and err logistik and kos might be one of  faktor why ralat pembelajaran is not really  best out of bilik darjah but 
right now um for contoh let just take singapura as an contoh  kelahiran kadar for singapura is actually relatively low ralat if anda have ever noticed that there is actually a lot of sekolah that is actually merging um there are actually guru who are actually going to be out of kerja soon because of  kekurangan of 
err pelajar in itu particular sekolah itu why kita have a gabung so what if kita were to do ini 
ralat 
kita were to take itu  learning out of bilik darjah and then kita have um  pelajar nisbah will be probably if let say a kelas of dua puluh well have probably two to three ralat two to three guru im pretty pasti that not semua if anda are having a 
err learning outside of bilik darjah ia be probably sufficient guru because let just take like a normal err primary sekolah subject theres four subjek so anda require four guru so having four guru to actually take penjagaan of err dua puluh pelajar for ini whole entire , uh outside of bilik darjah 
is actually more than enough because  pelajar nisbah will be one out of five one to five so err saya am pretty sure since mereka are actually very trained to , uh ajar pelajar there are actually err more than 
there are actually more than enough uh pengalaman to actually look after a kumpulan of five so itu will be isih of like a mini projek whereby mereka go out and then mereka have to interact , and uh itu ini is ini covers  bahagian of logistik and um 
ya covers  bahagian of logistik so for kos faktor begitu juga 
if youre gon na do itu in a sekolah anda have to upgrade anda sistem like uh buku teks anda have to err cetak a lot of helaian kerja anda have to print a lot of buku teks anda have to , err therell be elektrik et cetera 
um 
komputer makmal anda have to upgrade anda saya t makmal and semua so ini are also additional kos ya um  kos might  kos incur for learning outside of bilik darjah might be a bit high but 
if itu really manfaat  kanak-kanak in masa hadapan for mereka future pertumbuhan why not im pretty sure that  um  sekolah or  pendidikan ralat pendidik will actually agree with saya that having to put like for contoh uh maybe  kos is 
a few ribuan more 
for mereka semua of  semua  kanak-kanak in  masa hadapan why not 
so um ada padanya actually also a penyelidikan tunjuk showing that  kanak-kanak are actually healthier and happier ralat mereka actually do better in sekolah 
ralat when mereka are learning outside of bilik darjah 
so pendidikan is , actually an important ralat penentu for future kesihatan so 
saya would say that pendidikan is not really just about  four dindingkan err i mean itu not within  four dindingkan and then just about pelajaran and semua but having beberapa luaran 
persekitaran itu isih of galakkan kemahiran like for contoh berunding kemahiran , masalah menyelesaikan kemahiran where , which is actually err very important for anak pembangunan 
and right now with teknologi ralat teknologi is has been improving and kanak-kanak accessing to teknologi has been 
semua  cara up , ralat saya would say that learning can be learning from like for contoh bilik darjah can be from anywhere but if anda are learning outside of bilik darjah anda are learning of a different kemahiran set 
so uh itu why saya think that kita should uh kanak-kanak ini hari or sesiapa sahaja pembelajaran is actually best outside of bilik darjah because kita are able to visualise better kita are abide able to apply uh  ditetapkan of masalah that kita face 
in peperiksaan or in  masa hadapan 
yup so thats saya titik 
okay uh okay saya will just sum itu up semuanya why saya think learning outside of bilik darjah is better err okay learning outside of bilik darjah is actually a very broad istilah so err in terma of like outdoor main like anda p e pelajaran like environmental , err pendidikan Pengembaraan err pengembaraan , aktiviti et cetera 
so one of  key uh sebab why saya think learning outside of bilik darjah is good is because itu isih of uh improve academic pencapaian 
itu isih of also provide a jambatan to higher tertib learning itu also develop social kemahiran so when youre outside  bilik darjah anda interact with anda kawan more because anda only have like 
like anda kawan or anda anda got buddy or anda guru to be there to like anda know not get lost or apa sahaja like itu , so 
also itu also develop kemahiran and kemerdekaan 
so ini is actually one of  faktor why saya think learning off a bilik darjah learning outside of bilik darjah is actually uh good 
okay tahan on , 
so if anda see anda pelajar uh if anda see anda kawan everyday in kelas 
itu very hard to form a persahabatan because anda , like anda guru will always be like teaching through buku teks and semua so when anda are outside of bilik darjah anda actually itu actually helps to err build persahabatan 
so which is i think right now most err orang are actually very socially awkward ini might be  sebab why ralat 
because mereka tipu hardly interact with masing-masing other , so with uh learning outside of bilik darjah ini might aid mereka as well 
okay um so 
lain perkara would be direct pengalaman luaran is actually more motivating and has actually more impact and kredibiliti why because for contoh ralat like what youve mentioned anda said english matematik and chinese , 
err subjek are actually not beneficial if were to learn outside bilik darjah but then 
when anda were very young 
im pretty sure that like for saya likewise when im being taught like a b cs epal ralat bottle bola or like kucing im being showed gambar 
so why not bring itu to  real outside dunia where anda just walk lepasan like okay hei ini is a pepohon ini is a burung that jenis of perkara so kanak-kanak are actually able to like oh okay tell ini is how a bird looks like ini is how a tree kelihatan like et cetera 
for matematik maybe uh anda are talking about like yang one two three yang very basic one ya itu is actually very basic itu very itu actually very easy to be taught outside 
maybe what um learning outside best pembelajaran is best outside of bilik darjah bermaksud really is like ralat taking beberapa masa off instead of everyday penyejukan in  bilik darjah learning semuanya 
gatal be better to actually learn itu outside for certain uh subjek maybe not for semua but certain subjek , err like for contoh saya would say chinese or like maybe kemoterapi fizik is actually learn best to learn outside of bilik darjah , like for contoh kimia lets just take kimia for contoh , um 
right now kita are also not uh sitting in  bilik darjah setiap hari flipping through kami buku teks to just read what are  bahan kimia uh struktur and semua , kita actually have to go to  kimia makmal and then kita have to test semua  bahan out so i think ini is err what mereka meant from learning outside 
because 
if anda are just gon na refer to for contoh buku teks and whatever that anda are lecturer is talking about anda guru are talking about itu might not um make akal at semua and ada padanya actually kajian showing that err most orang are actually very visual ralat mereka 
mereka are semua very visual ralat orang so mereka take perkara better when mereka see itu not when mereka are listening to itu 
yup so with itu itu actually uh a cara for mereka to 
develop mereka otak err otak kemahiran also err kreativiti and also isih of like ralat 
to 
itu more like a sediakan a cabaran and  peluang for mereka to take also 
so err lastly saya would say that , uh itu also improves  young bangsa attitude because when youre out there anda have to take penjagaan of masing-masing other itu 
itu a very good persekitaran for mereka in masa hadapan 
yup so thats saya titik yup 
okay , 
bahagian three negative pengalaman 
oh manusia to , answer negatif apa ini 
oh , okay 
saya read somewhere ive baca somewhere that 
in hidup to um to 
itu  greatest tandatangan of matang is learning that anda ibu bapa are human too um ya and like saya and also like anda know when mereka grow older like telling mereka what mereka did right and what mereka didnt do 
itu isih of perkara and like i think for  longest masa saya did not have an pemahaman that saya ibu bapa are human too anda know 
like so i , i expected a lot saya think and also i put a lot of perkara i 
saya tekaan 
find kepunyaan there so i like saya just i 
i isih of like jarak saya sendiri i 
very hateful for many tahun anda know , and saya 
i cringe honestly um like because beberapa of saya kebimbangan mereka were valid 
valid anda know like itu not to say that i didnt pengalaman apa sahaja that was bad that tidak justified for semua  kebencian saya had but , then again at  same masa 
anda know i would want to say that 
like saya understand 
anda know because ibu bapa dont always get itu right 
and i mean itu sometimes itu not mereka sesar because mereka dont , mereka actually dont understand 
anda know , 
so actually kita are  first anak 
itu so sweet though 
ya saya datuk dan nenek fast furious a bit itu was a bit , itu was a shit masa like honestly , junior kolej was a terrible masa i was very close to saya datuk 
datuk dan nenek like on saya mum side especially because uh like saya would go over many like for like at least once a minggu saya will be dropped there and mereka would just take penjagaan of saya for like a hari or like even when saya was in tadika i went there setiap single hari anda know so like mereka were very instrumental 
then mereka passed away one after lain so saya datuk died in uh 
j one j c one uh juneCity in Virginia, United States 
and saya nenek died in j c two august so right saya maternal nenek died like two bulan before a aras 
because shes  only doktor in  rumah kanan and 
and also in general dia is called upon to take penjagaan of 
keluarga perkara so there was a lot of penekanan on nia anda need to keep itu together like saya know anda are taking anda a aras saya know youre in anda youre in anda first tahun and itu hard but anda need 
kita are busy with anda datuk dan nenek and 
to be honest that wasnt a great perkara for saya ibu bapa to do 
there is tidak masa for anda know anda know like anda need to keep anda najis together anda need to find anda own cara to cope with itu anda know 
ya , 
ya saya tekaan so 
youre still working right ya 
ya itu like keeps getting longer everytime saya talk to anda 
so youre almost at  penghujung oh saya Astaga wow 
okay let see what have kita not 
describe a momen when anda felt that anda were treated unfairly i tekaan anda 
ini is so sad what dreams of milik anda die 
saya tekaan anda had a mimpi 
saya had a mimpi too but like saya always was 
fully called kognizant that like itu was not a perkara , like saya wanted to do teater like professionally but like 
not so much as died as like thinking about itu practically i dont actually want itu like 
ya mm , 
i ya saya 
like  cara i see itu like thats a fantasi because saya 
jangan actually want itu , i want  saya want to do itu as a hobi but 
do saya want  financial ketidakstabilan do i want having to audition for setiap single perkara saya want to ever enter do i want itu to be completely okay for orang to judge like oh shesCity in Illinois, United States too tall shesCity in Illinois, United States too indian therefore not appropriate for ini peranan like tidak so i mean practically i dont actually want to do 
teater anda know itu just ya so i dont actually have mimpi that slowly die 
what keeps saya awake at malam insomnia 
ya 
im kesal with saya ibu bapa and everyones upset with saya like 
like how could ini happen to saya itu not fair , tiada siapa understands saya oh saya tuhan 
with 
so ya if apa sahaja keeps saya awake at malam itu probably that 
mm ya positif right ya saya , 
i jangan know to be honest i think until maybe ini tahun saya 
i wasnt very happy saya would 
do many uh mental kesihatan krisis p m mm 
that , saya was not satisfied at semua especially through in junior kolej like yang with keganasan 
terrible tahun ive been quite happy ini tahun ya mm ya worth itu because anda are ya saya 
one hundred peratus would get that tattoo youre worth itu because anda are ill write itu on saya dinding , ya good , 
and is shared 
hello how are anda 
why are anda stressed 
mm 
mm 
mm 
haha itu true 
saya also have a uji coming up on hari khamis so i need to study for itu 
ya itu a cukup a stressful subjek 
itu is a menyeronokkan fakta 
so with ya im also quite busy for  next few minggu 
mm 
okay then i shall tell anda about saya projek so  saya projek tajuk is called 
cecair aliran optimal cecair aliran in geometrical parameter so basically 
to have  optimum aliran 
saya need to modify  geometri of  
so  saluran ya  kapal or like paip 
so which kawasan to look into i penyelidikan saya chose ini perkara called err mikro needle tampalan 
so micro 
is  itu has been used in cosmetic so far but itu also used for dadah penghantaran in medical industri 
so ini is an alternative kaedah called micro suntikan  saiz of  jarum is ten to  kuasa of negative six 
resapan of  ubat lah so travel through  kulit 
ah sentuh  kesakitan pusat in anda kulit unlike  normal suntikan so 
doing  mikro suntikan 
instead of  sisi so 
saya kes now i chose okay mikro ketagihan is categorised into various kategori 
so ada padanya like hollow mikro pemimpin ada padanya like solid mikro pemimpin ada padanya quoting micro pemimpin 
 sharp penembusan bahagian 
and then anda put in anda kulit and then  salutan will dissolved in anda kulit so theres not much cecair aliran there 
in between masing-masing jarum where  cecair can flow through from  takungan at  atas 
is so uh 
ya saya kerja now is to 
see how to make itu , make itu optimum 
so a particular hari what i have researched is uh saya 
ralat ini mikro needle tampalan 
 jarum should be 
uh 
should be ada padanya a okay ada padanya already a ongoing penyelidikan 
such that  jarum will be shaped like a ular fang 
 real ular fang bentuk so basically 
so  takungan aliran through  alur 
and 
okay  alur is exposed but then how itu stays in  alur is through permukaan ketegangan and capillary paksa 
ya 
guna permukaan ketegangan to travel through  mikro needle into anda kulit 
penambahbaikan lah whether itu optimum kanan now 
ralat basically need give weekly kemaskini to saya nyahcas lah saya profesor 
so thats a short ringkasan of saya f y p 
which patches  
exercising or cosmetic or what 
uh im not too sure if ada padanya itu is  same 
but if itu used to deliver a certain lepas into anda kulit then 
highly likely itu using  same teknologi 
ya 
but i think itu using  same teknologi is either that but itu definitely  same kaedah of 
delivering a dadah transdermal which means through  kulit 
so what do i get leh saya think itu  same as what im doing just that im focusing on medical dadah penghantaran 
um jenis of so itu maybe used there also 
ya so itu about saya f y p 
ya so 
have anda are anda doing a tembak esok 
i watched like  first musim 
motivasi leh 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
ya saya also had a tembak semalam 
so 
itu a deepavali muzik video so i mean as dia say got t l s kanan anda also when  last masa 
so 
ya 
ya so uh saya go with tempoh eleven hari where mereka a lot of sekatan in tempat 
semalam already in sekolah saya will shoot 
in n t u then after itu ralat 
around err nine 
thirty nine empat puluh five p m 
beberapa campuran of rakan lah but 
saya only know like  two parti mereka use there 
which i dont really know  nama but saya know  tune of  
err perkara so 
ya saya dont know  lagu nama so i cant bantuan anda there 
ya thats a very short acting lah so basically with a video for like 
three four saat 
ya but saya had mostly helped out  behind  adegan 
rather then different 
so 
obses when saya was growing up primary sekolah secondary sekolah ah saya always listen to eminem 
last masa ya , 
ya so 
tamil parti 
how about anda 
what 
mm 
mm 
i mean bercakap of itu now i just remembered 
so last masa saya when saya was young  saya rumah used to play michael jackson muzik 
v c d i mean theyre v c d set itu was v c d 
then kita used to play itu 
so i used to listen to itu 
maybe saya bapa saya think not if not wrong 
so kita used to play semua ini michael jackson muzik and then ill listen to itu so i think i tekaan 
itu saya kegemaran lagu too 
like ada padanya a whole album like  bad kecantikan dagu 
 ya baik is lain one  boogeymanCity in Virginia, United States also 
ah ya 
ah ya that so 
saya used to listen to semua itu and then  eminem one is like more of like 
primary six secondary sekolah era 
so i used to have an m p three that masa just load semua  lagu inside and i used to listen to eminem on ulangi 
mm 
once ah saya kawan ask saya to rap with dia for tamil kelas kursus 
and then 
uh  rapping bahagian of  hari minggu one 
 tema lagu and then uh 
then one hari saya guru tanya sesiapa sahaja got mana-mana bakat then saya kawan like 
so ya saya went to sing in hadapan of  whole kelas was stunned 
not because dia was good itu was a 
exactly so where tamil netflix 
ya so netflix now eighty two eighty three also 
ya 
yes itu semua on netflix 
i mean ya lah that cereka saya watched actually i watched  first 
two filem in teater 
then  third one err  third tonton saya watch in teater betul 
i rewatch ah for menyeronokkan 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm 
is a teknik to evade ini jenis of a 
mencuri of uh senapang in  tentera 
saya was very secured ralat 
so what saya do in a hutan is i removed saya tali pinggang gesper and wrap itu around  
 pistol skop 
and then i put  pistol inside saya baju 
so if mereka are taking  pistol mereka will have to take saya with  pistol 
and itu worked 
ya selamat 
ralat 
in certain keadaan ya like if saya was 
when saya was in  tentera saya was a light tidur 
saya think im 
moderate lah not really a very heavy selipar saya will still wake up 
so moderate lah think ada padanya sesuatu called moderate kanan 
mm 
mm 
ya so how did itu pusing out 
wow 
ya sometimes i wish saya stay in dewan also so i can 
do semua ini 
and jangan have to travel 
ya like i mean saya can stay awake 
jangan have to travel without sekatan 
as in 
then by  masa i come back will be around 
eleven p m dua belas p m so 
tough to stay awake saya rumah 
tidak as in saya caught itu ini minggu 
because i everytime saya go sekolah come back late 
so is like why not anda know 
can not be so late lah 
err two a m three a m 
because saya rumah under pengubahsuaian right so 
until saya rumah ubah suai selesai 
saya have ini 
um uncalled undefined 
saya have saya own bilik so i think i got more kebebasan 
so i shall ask anda a soalan 
what is anda favourite makanan 
favourite makanan in  
 western kategori 
eh by domba potong anda with min from swensens right 
saya see , 
i min for saya is also 
same as milik anda then 
ralat so anda teh parti lah and then  pasta actually quite nice so 
saya favourite pasta from there i think 
saya think so 
but pastamania wah that masa kita went i dont really liked itu 
ya same 
saya choose that 
for burger 
is like mcdonalds mac pedas 
and like itu 
i mean favourite general burger is mcdonalds but 
yang like limited 
because mereka not so convenient one saya cant really compare itu because 
so anda poor 
i tidak mempunyai tried shake gubuk is at permata kanan 
mm saya mean milkshake a lot of tempat also must try like  fat papasCity in Illinois, United States 
semuanya 
wow mcdonaldCity in Illinois, United States milkshake 
ya then how about 
 sundaeCity in Virginia, United States ais krim and mereka mcflurry which one  best ais krim 
ah ya hershey oh  mereka came back 
like  other masa itu came out itu was actually quite nice 
ya but actually i tidak boleh 
exactly but uh anda know kita are on a diet 
only plain air tidak soft drink tidak gula drinks tidak fast makanan 
yes because anda are studying late 
yes what modules do anda take again 
ya 
saya cant remember 
ya do anda know one of saya modul 
tidak itu not what im taking ini semester 
tidak saya wasnt 
ya 
but magang is next semester only right bagaimana internship going 
ini covid 
ya 
which is  same as saya 
mm 
mm menarik 
err saya magang 
how i got in was because okay saya magang was i were applied for keselamatan intern 
so i use saya because saya was in  r s a f during tentera right so r s a f 
ralat focuses on a lot of keselamatan 
so for two whole tahun ive been reading about keselamatan following t o 
ah technical dolar s o p semuanya 
saya 
told semuanya about r s a f semuanya that saya was keselamatan here keselamatan there 
and im actually interested in keselamatan and 
saya think thats how are mereka got impress so i got  magang at  tetra pak 
but tambang was six bulan lah tambang was  whole 
 whole semester 
ya so for one whole semester saya was just working 
eight hundred lapan puluh per bulan if im not wrong 
so ya 
ralat 
yes mixed beras is around 
lapan puluh sen 
itu was actually very cheap because m n c syarikat 
itu  kemajuan 
ya so 
so  only benarkan 
err semua  cara from here to there and 
ya and 
mereka only allow kami to do itu for one jam 
 gim so itu not really that senang ya 
mm 
ya wait actually  salmon burger saya tried itu oh tidak  one saya tried was hokkaido burger 
 hokkaidoCity in Minnesota, United States burger saya didnt really like itu like is one of  first burger in a long while i didnt really eat selesai 
ya saya know itu a ikan saya know is a fish 
i wasted like 
separuh  burger because saya really couldnt makan 
then err 
how about  kentang minionCity in Illinois, United States kentang 
mm ya saya tried itu 
itu was basically  kentang soaked in minyak 
itu burst like  mulut then saya was like oh saya tuhan 
ya are mereka im not a big kipas of itu 
other then that tiada apa-apa much from mcdonalds 
whos menilai anda 
ya itu true 
why anda never tried 
why anda never go for  like kari baldi from k f c 
i mean if anda think about itu anda still have  beras and itu a warisan as compared to like fried ayam burger nugget isnt itu 
mm why though 
so anda measure anda karbohidrat 
correct itu true 
most of  perkara kita eat got karbohidrat inside like setiap hari 
ya that masa anda brought  fried beras semua oh saya tuhan 
ya about six dolar 
tidak shouldnt makan so much beras 
mereka spam  kentang goreng inside 
ya so 
ya itu why i didnt really finished that also i think i wasted like three suku of itu beras 
ya manja 
okay lah that daging was nice lah 
 daging was only  daging was nice at beras was a kekacauan 
but  fried beras must have beberapa rasa 
 rasa like anda are thats why saya couldnt really anda finish 
ya so 
what lain 
ya so 
of kursus definitely 
and then do saya cecair dinamik 
saya make saya model kajian for modul and do saya f y p barang 
anda will have to do anda tugasan as well two three five nine kanan 
okay where is anda kajian already 
why do anda like  bangku so much 
mm 
so for saya 
so i actually can study on saya katil 
do tutorial and uji kertas to prepare for peperiksaan 
there will be a lot of perbincangan talking involved so 
saya used to do itu last masa 
studying 
maybe im not i grown out of itu maybe 
last masa saya used to study in sekolah a lot 
 following sam covid 
 exam tempoh got affected most of  peperiksaan been happen 
there was not much sebab 
more cekap for saya 
so thats saya berdiri then but if saya have a dewan 
saya most probably anda study in dewan 
in  bilik ya in  bilik so 
itu what saya would do lah but i think anda are total bertentangan of saya 
for saya is same lah 
ah 
itu a bit hard for saya to control saya so recently  menghantui of buta one 
so 
one jam one and half jam saya will watch one episod of playboy 
so ya i think now  siri is finish saya got tidak gangguan so 
now itu kembali to normal of studying and semua 
then saya used to watch kek boss a lot 
uh  chef were carrying  kek down  tangga 
then after that  bos saya forgot dia nama whats dia nama bardCity in Illinois, United States 
a few jam as compared to  previous kek like 
three hari two hari 
there are many penonton pointed out right there is like purposely mereka purposely drop kek 
like ya beberapa of  perkara is staged but then  kek are real lah saya think  main fokus  kek 
ya 
tidak gordon ramsay saya used to watch ah dapur mimpi buruk 
so 
 dapur nightmares  one hari mereka will visit  rawak hotel 
and then try to improve itu 
but ya 
anda can hear saya right 
k lah bincang omong kosong lah 
jangan guna kelakuan 
jangan later mereka know who kita are semua ini nonsense jangan be stupid im just glad that kita just talk just talking random barang when itu merakam 
so itu fine um anyway uh 
anda suggest a tempat lah 
tidak like sah like where anda want to eat 
anyway ten peratus of  merakam is what sixty minit so six minit must be tamil 
okay lah saya think should be able to ah kita already talk two minit in tamil already 
as in  , okay  tamil bahagian kita dont need to force itu to be as in kita dont force itu kita just speak normally then if  tamil comes in then is okay 
but then why ah why do ini orang so i think mereka are digital perkhidmatan syarikat 
then mereka 
mereka are outsourcing itu for a saya 
mmso mereka are using ini for a saya to train so i can 
choose an iklan for less for specific orang 
saya see very interesting so very interesting 
although im a bit scared that considering itu a chinese syarikat 
ya tidak identifiable maklumat then should be fine 
actually now also like anda never mention nama or apa sahaja so thats when 
mereka i dont tahu who is err 
 syarikat , oh saya tuhan anda damn stupid anda know anda dont know what anda are talking about jangan know what anda are not supposed to say 
actually anda should bring itu lelaki here lah and then make dia sing 
why anda holding  plastik beg 
ya 
itu one semua i dont want to say 
okay then 
interesting 
but i dont know like i mean i never heard that cereka before 
actually anda want watch cereka hari ini or not 
there is tidak good filem out also 
ya 
what anda saying anda cant even speak tamil properly lah i im not even joking 
do anda even speak tamil at rumah 
interesting but i jangan know lah i feel like anda tamil is quite bad 
exactly i dont even know what anda do manusia anda sedemikian a sad hidup 
tekan f tuan 
then what do anda do sir explain anda hidup to saya 
then watch youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States tamil videos lah ada padanya so many tamil prank rancangan 
anda should sir 
kita only talk for nine minit tuan 
itu right 
but i jangan know i feel like is itu even recording properly or not 
later mereka say oh anda never record properly anda do again , 
mereka can find seseorang else 
tidak lah but anda should work what like penindasan  perkara then yours is running right 
tambang tidak tambang saya open saya skrin again 
but i jangan fahami if anda talk 
saya suara would be recorded on anda mikrofon kanan 
as in but if i talk anda itu will be recorded in anda mikrofon like kanan now 
very interesting tuan saya wonder saya want to read  perkara later  bentuk to see what mereka what were mereka actually doing already 
tidak lah but  perkara is in singapura anda cant do apa sahaja illegal lah so 
ada padanya g d p r also 
so anda cant screw around with  
itu why saya know itu why mereka never check err identiti 
kita shouldve just given a fake nama ah 
when 
eh anda never oh saya tuhan sedemikian a sad kewujudan 
anda need to start manusia 
anda see how useful tamil is now 
is helping kami get paid 
tidak membaca is useless 
anda need to sama ada tonton cereka or start singing tamil at rumah 
anda ibu bapa dont speak tamil to masing-masing other meh 
oh interesting okay lah enough personal perincian lah 
anda dont want  a saya to know about anda whole hidup 
kita should talk about random perkara like 
very interesting 
who is  lelaki anda message when anda came here was itu ini lelaki 
but must be declared like itu sebab dia say see anda at two p m 
why anda keeping so quiet can anda talk nonsense or not 
honestly like kita just should start singing tamil lagu but anda dont know apa sahaja what 
ya lah thats  kebenaran anda want name one tamil lagu anda know 
other okay other itu not a betul lagu 
oh 
saya tidak boleh saya still remember  hari kami good kawan um 
kita played kita were going together 
in  kereta then hes like dia played  new lagu from cobra  cereka 
itu true 
but then anda wont be on a bot what 
dumb keldai how would anda be on a bot on a frozen tasik 
anda know theres ini saluran on youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States called whale bros vel bros 
mereka i think one of mereka is maybe sixteen or seventeen tahun old  other lelaki like maybe dua belas or eleven maybe around itu jenis of umur then two of mereka mereka vlog mereka hidup in kanada but  whole throughout  whole vlog kanan mereka only speak tamil 
and theres a lot of sri lanka as in most of  tamil kedai in kanada are sri lankan what so anda can see ya saya know mereka live in scarborough saya not even joking eh tunggu is itu scarborough 
tidak saya think mereka live in scarborough 
ya ontarioCity in Illinois, United States right tidak 
but ya lah mereka live in a tamil very high tamil populasi which is probably scarborough lah and itu literally like anda go down then  semua  kedai so like semua tamil kedai got tamil bahan makanan got  
but ya mereka kita should start a vlog like itu tuan what do anda think is  peluang of starting a vlog like itu 
nobodys only for tamil orang 
as in most of  most of mereka penonton are from india or like n r saya living uh like different tempat and then mereka just like ralat 
perkara like itu 
kita can talk ya lah kita can talk about kita can talk to  other tamil lah then  same penonton that mereka have lah but itu just instead of mereka doing kanada kita do to singapore 
uh mereka okay mereka talk about cuaca okay cuaca here is pretty much a constant 
ya mereka never show temple actually itu cukup 
saya think have what if scarborough is so many tamil orang confirm have Ubah 
so many tempat is itu even in  
err what is itu 
there are that  north new jersi that sisi semua is mostly south India i think 
but then like 
tidak is tamil orang like perkara 
beberapa tidak actually tidak i jangan think so theres very few tamil orang in 
in amerika 
most of mereka are like selatan like telugu 
or 
or malu ya exactly different orang and then kita change tamil 
let  a i jangan know about google 
very portable 
so anda were saying that  a saya is  same as a bayi 
tidak lah but a saya like is isnt itu like mereka take  keseluruhan 
tinjauan data set then mereka proceed through  mesin then  mesin learnt one by one like semua ini is ini 
like anda already pre intermine  certain data set then 
anda feed more data itu unknown like for contoh anda already say that okay ini perkataan means ini then anda have a ditetapkan of itu then anda feed itu to  mesin 
then  mesin will see oh okay ini is ini is ini then after that anda feed a data ditetapkan that is unclassified then mereka will look through  to find  persamaan and then 
volum based ya lah itu why lah mereka give a initial data ditetapkan even itu is probably huge already then  
other data set are probably even bigger 
apa  one kita doing now 
i jangan know how many orang mereka got what depends on how many orang mereka got 
okay 
tidak but  perkara is that  kehadiran senarai itu just for sesiapa sahaja that comes into ini pejabat 
so how many orang are on  senarai 
ya lah i mean itu quite hard to get enough orang what 
tidak but anda think about if twelve orang came ada padanya twelve jam of recording 
tidak six jam of recording 
tidak but can not be a reading perkara what itu has to be a perbualan 
okay what tidak mempunyai kita tried yet 
tidak but i dont know and as in are anda okay are anda down for k b q 
tidak dia just said itu not a dinner perkara saya mean if 
if okay tidak okay anda ignore dia for a semasa anda just say are anda down to eat korean barbeku ya or tidak thats semua saya want to know 
makan tengah hari 
who is going to be four five orang kita also dont know sesiapa sahaja like four five orang as in jangan perlu to mention nama lah but 
wont come lah 
saya already say dont sebutan nama lah why anda so stupid 
ralat probably thirty bucks per orang 
so twenty masa ya so thirty masa three is ninety divide by tolak tiga puluh is sixty what enam puluh is twenty bucks only which is quite cheap kawan for makan malam masa 
ya saya know kita can go seoul taman is non halal wait 
oh right ya okay fine 
err what was i saying tidak ya okay tidak anda know mana-mana sushi tempat or not 
actually honestly i thought itll be damn slow but itu already close to separuh an jam already , 
im quite amazed by how fast itu is 
saya dont minda okay kawan saya honestly i think kita can go to genki in ada padanya a genki in marina persegi theres a genki in err marina persegi 
sushi tei is what is itu conveyor belt or what 
i think itu in ada padanya two outlet theres one in takaCity in Illinois, United States and theres one in uh 
saya think need lah just panggilan or sesuatu lah 
why anda dont want guna anda telefon oh ya exactly tidak sebab saya cant guna saya telefon anda can i just type good sushi restoran 
i dont i dont know anda just type penghantar best penghantar tali pinggang sushi in singapura 
tidak 
tidak 
okay jenis largest penghantar tali pinggang sushi rantaian 
ya correct thats  one ya betul 
err roger nvaine memeriksa on

oh ah but then why genki is tertib by plat 
okay then kita can check sushiro menu lah 
shaw pusat is err ya lah orchard lah there 
i feel like anda know  kami malaysian minda ah feel like talking like mereka

ralat mereka got 
ketam mereka got

what did anda think saya said 
kim ah chinaCity in Virginia, United States kim jong un tuan 
anda cant see over  kotak ah 
outside rightno okay so i think i went there but  lelaki never change  bilah for  cukur anda know  bilah to do  final potong 
bilah is  traditional tukang gunting rambut lah 
ya saya know but  umur like other tempat mereka dont use  mereka dont use blade what like , semua  
mereka cant guna bilah is dangerous mereka are not trained to use bilah but  traditional tukang gunting rambut mereka will but then uh because saya was a kanak-kanak what saya was not i mean not i was not really a kanak-kanak lah saya was like maybe 
like twelve tahun old thirteen tahun old then saya was watching itu because theres tiada apa-apa else to do in  tukang gunting rambut kedai anda just sitting there doing tiada apa-apa so obviously anda watch what mereka doing right 
tidak lah anda wont get Bantuan lah tidak but then theres ya anda can get um hepatitis 
and ten rupee is like tiada apa-apa sepuluh rupees is like what ten not even ten sen 
sepuluh rupee is tidak lah lima puluh rupee is one dolar anda know 
tidak less than twenty sen 
which is quite good lah for 
can anda imagine getting a twenty sen cukur 
because itu twenty eight sen per kilowatt jam 
saya did that before when saya was in okay nevermind let not go there 
mereka probably have given anda a set data to understand tamil already but then what i think mereka are trying to do is mereka are trying to because kita  cara kita talk here is different from orang in america orang everywhere what in  dunia singapura orang talk differently so what mereka trying to do is mereka trying  aksen switching 
ya so no mereka  normal tamil dataset mereka can just get mereka can just make itu read from , from a buku ya exactly either from a buku or mereka can get transkripsi or mereka can just read itu anda like feed itu like a berita orang reading  berita or like 
beberapa apa sahaja lah can be apa sahaja oh because saya think 
okay lah kita got like sepuluh minit left tidak fifteen minit left 
itu quite fast and anda talk forty five minit to accompany would are mamalia bullshit itu okay 
ralat anda know mark sunny for unnecessary semak 
saya dont want orang to come after saya 
ya  borang on anda sisi will serve to go rumah 
if anda stay in inside too long 
but itu nonsense lah anda want go inside 
but easily kematian one tidak tahu either that or maybe beberapa penyembuhan or birding kawasan if itu cant really can not hear properly then anda watch mana-mana correct easy  haram yati semua as pemimpin kita just how saya pajakan and how senior is 
 berbilang on marmar 
 sisa 
anda need a good penjaja makanan onto so old sekolah kategori 
one peraturan is like a 
how did anda were hes like 
okay jangan need to go on and semua itu jenis of tajuk kita can change  tajuk to tumble in  suhu of  komuniti konsensus about

how anda work anda get  merakam to

okay lah let say or maybe anda connected to  komputer tidak but i dont want saya telefon to be quieter to anybodys komputer 
oh tidak but dia but hes using anda android saya cant

anda come straight then ill just need anda there then anda just go down to  next kad 
then kita shall play 
know itu okay then tidak then kita organize a makan malam with similar makna 
and were almost dancer fifty seven already 
but i think kita have to talk kita will just talk a bit more like one as long as anda have too many then kita talk then anda 
so  other matang with terminal and general coming riding  camino guaranteed mereka dont coming in at three p m kita go up 
milik anda is fifty seven also right 
orh so itu merakam lah sahkan 
okay itu very sleepy 
then where eleven parallel tiada siapa perumahan saya mean what for anda 
oppo is a chinese syarikat already ya 
okay very interesting then why anda want saya to huawei 
ya 
if kita talk till betul 
itu has to be why anda can not be just like penapis tidak penapis  musim bunga  raw data can not be 
also theres thirty saat left lah 
but anda dont want to stop ini one lah 
tidak saya will pause saya 
anda can just penyunting  last bit of doesnt jirim 
but i jangan know whether 
bahagian one financial related tajuk 
right now kita are talking about beberapa of  pelaburan produk 
saya think uh for saya , uh maybe i start first 
ya , 
okay uh saham i think i play with itu err 
saya think dekad back ya ralat but im very careful with itu 
so uh so i only bahagian wang whereby saya can sacrifice okay , and saya can dont see come back to saya yeah so i saya do itu and err saya , i untung more than saya lost 
so uh ya and with  untung im very happy , kita are actually paid for saya jelajah 
so uh bon ive not touch uh unit trust ya saya still have err i think tidak mempunyai had been running for at least twenty tahun already so ive not been checking on mereka actually but err 
uh ah 
yearly mereka actually sent saya um , 
um yang uh pernyataan 
um saya know that saya have been uh , profiting from that also saya have not tunai out apa sahaja uh just let itu roll 
ya 
so  rehat um , 
um tidak not played 
ya but ill be interested with r e saya t 
uh if got a peluang to know itu uh more 
how about anda remy hmm mm , mm err oh and then 
itu actually uh cincin a loceng because saya actually tried uh a foreign , mata wang before and uh is quite uh 
uh risiko taking saya would say , ya because 
is like uh saya have to um 
when i buy saya have to decide within  minggu whether saya want to throw itu out or anda know , uh when saya when when  saham actually , for  foreign mata wang actually goes up  kadar , so uh 
pretty challenging , that one is like really anda have to uh to have a cari lah but that masa i remember saya have a very good uh , orang ralat from uh piawai chartered  kakitangan there , who actually helped saya to monitor most of  masa so dia will just give saya a panggilan 
uh to highlight to saya whether anda know uh im actually profiting ini jumlah , uh am i comfortable to um throw itu out that 
so ya um saya think in pelaburan gatal be very good to have a parti like itu , anda know a trusted orang out there who can actually , anda can rely on uh 
because kita cant be , twenty four jam looking at  
at  kadar and itu uh ya is hurting i dont like itu jenis of kerja also , 
ya itu a pengabaian bank , 
uh hes i think hes not just a broker but anda know uh 
penasihat 
ya but i think uh kita build beberapa jenis of uh 
kawan hubungan through itu and then dia is being very helpful throughout  whole proses 
oh so now hes still in ini baris 
ah oh hmm oh , yes itu right ya , 
but unfortunately dia already left , standard chartered 
ya , ah , 
saya id cinta to ya 
mm ralat 
err im not too comfortable still 
not too sure whether , dia sisi 
dia sisi  pelaburan syarikat of or saya 
exactly ya leaked out ya ya mm tidak um 
i think itu only when d b s lah im not too sure whether itu one is considered 
when saya go into a d b s bank 
ralat and saya was uh asking not really robot but itu over  skrin 
so mereka have lain kakitangan saya jangan think 
itu is like a , uh um 
a baik ralat 
covered two bilik and then uh 
im  only one inside  bilik and that theres a skrin in hadapan of saya 
and then after itu um itu will actually ask saya what do i want to do with d b s so i will anda know sama ada open akaun or whatever then , then and then itu mesin will actually uh assign uh  right perkara for saya to do 
ya 
then if let say saya need to have a soalan mereka actually uh bounced up uh 
uh a , a d b s kakitangan 
from  other penghujung ya 
if saya do not need to talk to  mana-mana kakitangan then  mesin actually helps saya to ya carry on with  , uh transaksi that saya need 
then err as for , pelaburan in c p f wang uh saya think that one was quite a good perkara for saya because , uh when saya park saya wang with pelaburan uh using c p f 
i jangan see  cubit anda know saya still can not get  wang out so itu ada padanya tidak cubit , uh and uh um sometimes i totally forgotten that saya 
as pelaburan with using c p f wang , and when  pernyataan comes out i see eh wow itu earning itu pemprofilan so 
ya saya like ini jenis of perkara , ya , 
ya although  wang is uh not like anda know uh in six angka anda know as much as may maybe anda play in stok but i think itu good enough anda know stable and then itu berkembang , uh setiap tahun anda know that jenis 
ya , ya 
exactly ya high five 
ya so uh ya itu a good perkara lah because uh saya think 
ini jenis of perkara uh 
saya am comfortable to bahagian 
with  wang ya , 
so if i put a five k there anda know i dont expect ini five k to even come back to saya  principal tidak come back to saya , then i main ya , rather than anda know uh 
anda put a five k there ini is  semua  five k that anda have and then if itu doesnt come back anda know anda are in a perjuangan , put diri anda into anda know deep najis saya think that itu not sesuatu that is uh 
uh , uh 
in kami kedudukan that kita want to do lah especially when kita have keluarga 
ya mm ya because , 
semua ini dana are hard earned wang still 
so i think kita have to be responsible anda know even if anda want to put mereka in uh , apa sahaja anda know even unit amanah which is uh very low risiko 
uh saya think is a tanggungjawab lah that kita have 
to bear mm , mm hmm yup itu right ya , 
do anda have mana-mana uh fikiran on singapura menyimpan bon 
oh okay , 
ralat saya know 
saya 
saya do not know much about itu but i know itu err there was a masa that uh orang were kawan around saya were asking saya saya should try ini 
ya because  kembali are good 
investing ya mm , yeah ya , 
uh tidak , 
i think kita have a common kawan but i dont fikir kita can kongsi mereka nama but kita have a kita have common kawan who are already in such pelaburan mereka have been err uh sending saya a lot of uh very good uh readup 
ya 
ya but kita are supposed to meet , kita are planning to meet i think uh after chinese new tahun were planning to meet but too bad , anda know perkara will be 
ya 
so well um , well kelembapan for a bit first lah until 
because saya know mereka do have uh pelaburan even in overseas 
ya in uh real estet so anda know who ah 
ya so i think mereka have been very smart s like but uh when anda talk about pelaburan in such , big skala anda know overseas real , 
estet and perkara like itu saya think , uh anda first of semua must have anda first periuk of emas 
ya 
so instead of anda know anda are uh anda are struggling with hidup here and then anda are trying to anda know , uh pam in tunai in other negara i think itu is not wise 
but uh if anda already have anda know stable jenis of 
uh periuk of emas here , and then uh thats how anda think of anda know how anda want to extend anda anda kewangan overseas 
because uh overseas kewangan i think is sesuatu that 
ralat 
anda need beberapa good mentor ah 
ya oh exactly ya , hmm ya saya think 
itu is really luxury 
ya 
anda can use a lot  wang for a lot of lot a lot of perkara a lot of useful 
perkara ya , 
ya saya think because maybe when kita have kanak-kanak ah kita  cara that kita look at  kewangan and uh seseorang who is a single orang 
saya think ralat that 
 perspektif is , very different 
positive pengalaman 
okay 
what makes anda want to be alive le , 
mm 
saya would say  same perkara but okay what makes anda feel alive 
mm 
mm 
mm 
mm saya agree 
i mean anda have to think that okay like  good outweighs  
bad and for saya i feel most alive when im somewhere new and then 
anda just realize like while anda know were on  same planet but how come  perkara kita experience so different for contoh maybe one wanita anda could be in  gurun and anda feel like oh anda know masa is still moving and seseorang else is experiencing sesuatu different just like how okay maybe now im here in singapura seseorang else 
is experiencing sesuatu else maybe could be better could be worse but yeah itu just makes saya feel like oh ada padanya so many perkara in ini dunia that 
kita dont know 
and then ya dia just live itu to  fullest 
so i will say that ini whole kunci really takes a lot of kegembiraan out of what kita usually enjoy for contoh travelling right saya would say thats  biggest pukal oh 
ya 
mm 
well i think itu lets kami escape realiti even if itu just for awhile right 
mm 
ya okay , 
hmm 
so whats anda favourite aktiviti to 
um why 
mm 
ya 
so i wan na thank anda for re introducing saya back to yoga 
saya really think itu gives saya lain bukaan to like 
not only strengthen saya sendiri itu gives saya lain cara to like santai and then rejuvenate and then just be at damai with saya sendiri anda know 
and i like how itu makes anda feel after setiap sesi anda know anda put in hard kerja and then anda reap  manfaat of itu afterwards itu like ah saya feel good about saya sendiri so yeah saya just went for a hot kuasa earlier on and now i feel great 
ya 
but  whole titik of saying teras is like 
anda yeah in anda teras anda need anda have kekuatan in anda 
core kanan to even go for teras so kuasa would be 
okay 
mm okay mm 
mm itu is a good satu 
saya would like to try itu baik i mean lembah buka semula september eleventh i jangan think at i mean itu what mereka say lah i jangan think itu very optimistic to saya to be going there anda may not be able to come back but , 
ah saya agree ya 
ada padanya not so much active pengujian as well so uh saya saw as saya just earlier on saya saw ini quite um saya wouldnt say traumatizing bahagian of a slightly upsetting , gambar uh itu was like uh oh tunggu okay kita are on positive 
pengalaman saya keep itu for later on , positive pengalaman saya keep itu for later yeah , 
oh is in indonesia itu a , a foto taken in indonesia 
oh ya okay 
well ill say um one of saya favorite tempat is grand ngarai or basically  gurun 
um so everytime im there i just feel like wow saya cant believe ini is really on bumi 
like is  medan is just so different and itu like usually for saya uh ill pemacu from california so i mean california sendiri is a gurun but anda still get like telapak tangan pokok and pantai and  lautan 
but as anda drive Ke arah anda drive up north Ke arah vegas anda start to see  medan ubah and then anda just realize like wow saya cant believe 
itu just menakjubkan and then yeah  Batu are semua red just from 
i mean that was  o c babe ya just wow out of ini dunia for saya get a bit emotional when im there 
itu saya happy tempat ya 
ya 
ya 
so saya was there last tahun again right um saya went to ini tempat called navajo tribal taman so itu 
where  monumen lembah is kita rented a tempat kita stayed with  red India so i mean itu under udara bnbpaper size 
mereka gave kami a little is in  belakang of ini red India rumah mereka built a little rumah uh theres elektrik but there is a 
tandas so if anda wanted to use  bilik mandi 
di luar rumah and then if anda wanted to shower theyve dapat like luaran pancuran anda know like how anda bring anda own big beg of air and anda shower from there so 
well i i think saya cried while saya was there at malam sebab saya just never seen so many bintang in saya hidup 
out of ini dunia uh oh saya tuhan 
probably but yeah what about milik anda , 
mm 
okay 
mm 
mm 
mm 
ya actually youre right ya were very lucky , 
mm itu true 
but i see most of mereka actually like being in asia though , 
mm 
but kita are i would say kita are in 
ya in perbandingan to other perlumbaan 
itu is true 
mm anda got a titik , 
just click baits most of  masa 
mm 
okay what makes anda experience adrenaline rush have anda ever gotten itu im sure anda have 
okay but okay itu not that bad anda know how beberapa 
orang get that adrenalin from stealing ini is very mild 
oh 
ini is a very strange perkara to say but okay so usually when kita conduct new perkhidmatan kanan on papan 
anda actually get adrenaline rush like anda can say saya will start from baris tiga puluh one and then anda just wan na keep doing itu until semua orang else is served so anda have a ada padanya really a tempo 
to anda doing perkara like for contoh but okay sakit take off  talam and ill ask anda what do anda want to eat and then what do anda want to drink and then semuanya anda just like , is like very quick so that there is adrenaline lah when itu comes to itu itu very strange to say that about kerja right uh 
but when anda start anda dont want to stop until semuanya is finished 
so 
itu may seem that were very kan jiong to do perkara but actually kita just want to complete and maybe yeah  adrenalin being bahagian of itu so didnt know right semua anda think is ah kopi teh , or saya 
yeah not sure if anda can relate but please lihat at saya differently okay 
im pasti ini happened banyak of masa but i dont actively keep trek 
do anda , itu like in anda muka do anda 
okay , and apa sahaja that anda remember 
kita dont ya kita try not to bear dendam 
also right ya saya think itu kami itu why were kawan yeah , 
yeah what is saya best kejutan saya best kejutan 
lah , kejutan or 
not uh i mean uh ill be happy if saya was 
but 
itu not  right masa or bercakap of which i actually plan a kejutan for dia outside um 
promosi where anda can get  mesin for like a dolar 
but anda have a like a monthly langganan with mereka for one tahun and then anda can get ya and then ini langganan is like kredit so basically anda are paying for kredit setiap bulan and anda get  mesin for jenis of free so 
ya saya got itu and then uh  mesin is coming on hari minggu so i gon na see how itu plays out 
quite excited about itu like as kejutan 
so theyve got different mereka got uh  langganan so mereka got different rancangan um itu starts from tiga puluh five empat puluh five lapan puluh five um im like doing a free 
promo saya can start working for nespresso , to do a promosi but 
but ya so i asked dia what dia purata on perbelanjaan on kopi setiap bulan and then i found sesuatu that was quite suitable and then ya so hes gon na get a mesin anda know sometimes i know dia wakes up very last minit to do kerja and then im sure ini can save dia beberapa masa and 
ini is like kualiti kopi as well yeah why would anda be interested 
oh cold brew okay but if itu 
okay as compared to a tembak of espresso 
oh okay mmhmm 
mmhmm 
isnt itu like uh itu like a french tekan but anda put in  peti sejuk uh okay what dia has now is a french tekan so i pemikiran anda know itu a bit uh troublesome like anda have to wash and then remove  serbuk and what not so i pemikiran ini would be a easier cara to go mm 
but saya im not a kopi peminum i really dont know about semua ini perkara too 
saya tekaan ada padanya very overpriced kopi though 
is itu as compared to other like local jenama where anda get kopi o 
like americano , hmm okay on average how much do anda drink a hari 
okay so can anda live without itu okay 
okay so itu keeps anda huh okay  what  kemalangan 
aww is itu like a makanan koma agak perasaan 
oh 
okay 
anda know how orang say mereka would take maybe anda know anda taken too much kopi when anda start feeling like ah anda jantung berdebar and then  
palpitation saya have never experienced itu im just thinking if saya should try itu , 
okay 
oh okay maybe itu was too strong i jangan im not sure , okay ya , a big peminum kanan mm okay well 
are anda going to do apa sahaja ini hujung minggu , 
apa sahaja exciting 
well anda mentioned anda were going on a um saya mean anda mentioned anda guys were thinking of going for a trek or luaran aktiviti 
that not late not that early 
ya kita could plan sesuatu okay 
bahagian one debat tajuk one 
improve always improve  kualiti of hidup uh ill start off by rebutting  proposisi 
so  proposisi has stated how electronic teknologi has provided many kelebihan such as kemudahan easier komunikasi and pendidikan saya will rebut ini by saying that 
itu brings about negative impak in  long jalankan in cashless contoh of atas talian membeli-belah itu has tidak ragu that created easier capaian to purchasing item without having to travel semua  cara to a bata and mortar stor 
however while itu may be 
senang for orang 
to crave for more senang 
and accessible cara of gaya hidup 
saya will not expand ini titik that  negatif will soon start to outweigh  positive impak 
or robot and mesin that can help ini syarikat of kedua-duanya usaha and masa 
as stated before orang are constantly looking for a better cara of living resulting in a kebergantungan on teknologi and syarikat may start relying on mesin instead of real hidup pekerja 
ini eventually leads to retrenchment as orang are no longer regarded as sesuatu essential to syarikat 
 pekerjaan kadar will definitely increase in  long jalankan and orang being out of pekerjaan is not a stable kualiti of hidup at semua for kejadian in singapura there 
has been a hype of genki sushi because of mereka interesting cara of using teknologi to serve makanan instead of using pelayan 
ini makes pekerja that work as pelayan undermined and overlooked and mereka mereka do not provide  same jumlah of hiburan or insentif ini is one contoh of how 
modern teknologi is able to replace human pekerjaan and made orang jobless due to ini interesting prospek 
to conclude ini is one sebab why modern teknologi can not always improve  kualiti of hidup as itu 
little aspek which shows that in  long jalankan  positive impak will soon turn to negative 
okay so  proposisi has stated how teknologi has helped immense anda know uh manfaat 
while dia titik maybe valid itu is equally important to take in akaun  ethical impak of modern teknologi as mereka contribute a different perspektif and present itu not so positive impak 
of masyarakat hari ini 
there are indeed many cara to define  kualiti of hidup mentioned by 
ini includes  economical aspek intellectual aspek and cultural aspek 
which  proposisi 
has left out 
saya still strongly believe in modern teknologi being impossible in always improving  kualiti of hidup as itu has itu batasan when considering  ethical and more impak itu has 
however kaedah still skim penyelidikan behind semua  teknologi kita have hari ini has become a concerning isu for many kumpulan of orang with sharp kepercayaan that are shaken by ini penyelidik 
one contoh saya would like to suggest would be stem sel as itu is an contoh of how modern teknologi penyelidikan has been very integrated and popular among biology saintis Kini 
ini has created many ethical masalah one would be that orang finding itu too invasive as itu has  potential to create new hidup 
other ethical cabaran would be  eksploitasi of penderma and that only  rich are able to have capaian to ini in penambahan ini penyelidikan can also lead to unnatural , of , 
such ethical masalah can not be easily resolved as itu complicates with  set minda and pandangan of 
lain thus 
 kualiti of hidup can be improved in terma of certain kawasan such as ubat and komunikasi as  proposisi has mentioned but itu can never improve semua aspek of hidup making ini pernyataan questionable as mereka states that itu will always improve  kualiti of hidup 
which is used like an absolute istilah to suggest how modern teknologi will never has negative impak on  kualiti of hidup which i have proven that itu is false 
itu is short lived and over masa  negative kesan will outweigh  positive thus 
modern teknologi can never always improve kualiti of hidup 
at  penghujung of  hari modern teknologi is a double edged pedang in  cara that itu positive impak has itu negative kesan 
as well 
ini has been shown in saya titik that while modern teknologi opens up for more peluang in hidup and also provides so many manfaat itu ultimately undermined  societys moral and ethical kepercayaan 
ini will impact  kualiti of hidup 
as orang with kepercayaan affected will not find that modern teknologi improve mereka kualiti of hidup but instead made itu unstable 
even though ini 
impak uh quite uh 
um trivial saya believe that itu will still 
tidak setuju with  pernyataan as  pernyataan does keadaan that modern teknologi will always improve  kualiti of hidup which is not true as itu depends on  jenis of orang youre affecting and how itu will impact ini kumpulan of orang in  long jalankan thus 
maaf can repeat ya saya can not really hear 
sorry ya cutting off kita cant hear anda uh i think itu still cutting off a bit okay 
okay 
tidak 
bahagian one debat tajuk one 
okay so i will start first so firstly i will explain  definisi of writing so 
menulis is an maklumat rich artikel 
in surat khabar former writing in kontrak aesthetic and expressive bentuk such as puisi 
muzik menggubah and naratif so semua jenis of writing specialised in mereka own genre and ceruk saya will definitely not be as effective or applicable in other kategori 
so for contoh like 
beberapa superior menulis is like uh william shakespeare 
kita learn that during kami secondary sekolah uh kesusasteraan kelas 
and why kita learn 
william shakespeares instead of other puisi is because saya feel that dia menulis is more superior 
than lain and i feel that 
ada padanya a sebab why kita learn 
about dia kesusasteraan and semua dia like penyair in sekolah rather than lain so 
from ini konteks saya feel that 
beberapa menulis jenis 
are more superior than  lain and lain would be um 
for contoh anda want to go for 
magang or anda are applying for a kerja so 
how anda write anda sambung semula 
and 
how lain write i feel that theres a perbezaan because 
uh anda bos will look through anda sambung semula and then mereka feel might uh anda kawan one or anda 
or yours might be superior to one lain so 
obviously mereka will feel 
and feel itu and uh mereka will prefer  
once that uh writing like more superior ya 
and mm 
but however like i believe in  keunggulan of certain writing jenis , so like for contoh like generalistic and 
persuasive gaya of writing lah saya feel that itu more applicable hari ini in kami globalised dunia 
puisi and novel are considered to be less relevant already because 
i mean for like for saya sendiri saya would 
rather know more about  
upcoming berita like  data statistik and 
uh apa not and like puisi and novel i feel that 
ya like uh 
uh to beberapa like itu may be interesting 
for mereka but to saya i feel that 
mm is not saya 
uh jenis of reading ah 
ya so  former is like omnipresent and seperti is use 
kedua-duanya in traditional and new media for like journalistic penekanan gaya of writing 
and then like saya feel that 
um big perniagaan also relied on 
yang berita to gleam like valuable wawasan from current peristiwa and like how certain tindakan rancang and keputusan would have to be 
uh tweak or to accommodate perubahan like around  dunia 
so like for contoh like uh  recent berita where 
which regard like uh unprecedented uh jatuh of minyak , harga 
and itu had to be eh specific and 
clearly like banduan 
with short ayat and like without berbunga bahasa 
and because 
mereka do not want to distract  data analisis and like sebab certain like uh tafsiran salah like by yang that are unable to 
uh hargai like complex linguistic gaya and like contoh uh  more recent berita which is  covid sembilan belas 
saya feel that uh itu has to be returned as a more 
important tajuk utama uh and 
itu should be a tajuk that semua should know about as itu i feel that itu is a more superior 
uh peristiwa 
and ya i feel that uh 
anda uh i feel that  artikel that is being written is more , superior than lain because uh obviously itu more important and like ini is like a dunia of pandemic krisis 
so 
itu definitely has to be like a written in a more superior cara than other artikel due to  kepentingan aras of itu 
so therefore like  puisi 
 kepraktisan of 
journalistic and persuasive menulis is about more suited to  political and uh 
perniagaan arena 
and 
ya that is for 
saya proposisi 
however like saya feel that um 
orang have different like keupayaan to write in different cara and ya i agree that mereka semua have different pengetahuan on how to write but then 
uh as pendidikan gave kami uh knowledge then pengetahuan is also like kuasa saya feel that with ini kuasa um 
definitely one is one menulis is more superior than  lain because of maybe how anda phrase itu um what jenis of bahasa anda use to 
ya basically how anda present itu as well and how other orang baca so mereka might 
so ya saya feel that like different tulisan are superior than one lain like due to  different konteks and  cara that mereka written so to sum up like there will definitely be beberapa tulisan around  dunia that 
are more like superior than  lain as well as beberapa tulisan like hold a much more important and like mm higher meletakkan in  hati of lain and like ya ini orang 
will regard  menulis as like more superior as  cara mereka are formed so like for contoh like kontrak like um 
when anda received a kontrak um  cara 
but itu is being presented and  cara itu being uh written at itu is quite important for  pekerja 
because mereka have to read through like what other terma and syarat so itu is like just a cebisan of Kertaspaper size and then itu is just written with what 
how much anda are getting paid what masa anda will have to work and what and then anda just sign  kontrak so mereka might feel like itu cukup um invaluable ya thats what saya 
rasa but in lain kes if is a kontrak filled with um much more descriptive 
maklumat of 
like more descriptive like um what are like  terma and keadaan and terma and syarat of  kontrak and like for contoh like if anda decided to resign so what are  
what are beberapa manfaat anda can enjoy or like is there mana-mana like um 
like ya so basically itu just like  cara of writing so 
saya feel that uh semua ini is in bangsa hidup like mereka will feel that dia lives a better and more important kesan to mereka ya so thats semua have thank anda 
okay so like lain titik that i feel that um 
like anda mentioned that different tulisan are like superior than one lain due to  konteks as and  cara that um mereka are written and like anda also mention that beberapa tulisan around  dunia that are more superior 
eh um am i right maaf 
but if like if anda think about itu if like um everyones like menulis is equal to like one lain then 
in ini dunia like there wouldnt be mana-mana like pertandingan lah because anda mentioned that um like tulisan should be like 
or itu like semua like menulis should be equal and then  there shouldnt be mana-mana like um superior pembezaan or like mana-mana jenis of different ranking ah so like um like even when kita have kami english um peperiksaan during secondary sekolah or primary sekolah saya feel that 
when kita write like kami perbualan um which is like a 
im not oh forget what saya said um english uh ya itu basically anda have to write uh like a narrative cerita so i feel that um 
there will definitely be superior menulis as 
if not semua would like get  same gred like ya and then there will be like tidak persaingan and like i feel that itu is unfair ah because one might be writing uh more superior than  lain and 
if mereka kedua-duanya get  same tanda then there isnt really a titik ya thats what i feel thank anda 
ya who cleans  aircon pengawal though 
orh 
i jangan know tambang is not that dirty let saya see 
itu looks fine 
i think sebab of dia 
and kita got ini perkara 
okay lah but itu not used for ten tahun not so long , 
then turns out only for gincu is itu 
ya but itu lip hari what obviously like 
if not why would mereka write bibir hari 
but then mereka specify down there lip hari first 
is itu  only jenama anda buy from 
ya 
then  gincu also same what tidak meh 
then why do orang buy make up atas talian 
periuk Penyembunyikan like really look like ini periuk like itu is itu 
so why do anda want to use  creamy one instead of like a cair one 
ralat bergantung 
uh tunggu then what im doing 
i tidak know ada padanya such a perkara 
ah why 
like why , 
oh 
oh right 
tunggu okay um ya so 
saya thought anda want buy make up for dia 
then but what else dia need sia 
saya think dia like got semuanya already dont know what to buy for dia 
lor saya show anda 
sees  kesukaran in setiap peluang then a optimis sees  peluang in setiap kesukaran is by 
itu by winston gelita 
ya anyway seseorang gave itu to joanna 
itu what anda think of 
as in i tidak mempunyai didengar tak terhingga for a long masa 
why mereka never even come back what mereka doing 
tunggu saya think saya got hear before 
but dia came back dia album not bad sia  
did dia only have one album 
kami oh tidak 
tidak itu not a new one 
ah ya that album 
ah itu dia first one ya 
itu is like one of  album that i actually can remember 
and know  lagu inside 
not semua lah but like 
k maybe not a lot but 
oh then anda put like itu 
ya but then wont itu hear saya then cause  kepingan telinga so near 
ya saya think itu okay too 
as itu if anda have a mic kanan then anda put near anda then anda will hear saya coming out from anda 
kawan anda know just now kita had what 
kawan saya got menggigil 
saya tidak mempunyai seen one leh okay k 
seize  kesukaran 
how to

oh ya that one orh 
bukan dia p five or p six 
oh p six english kanan 
wah eh anda actually got help improve sia 
then anda just amalan with dia like perbualan orh is itu 
saya bet  induk love anda now 
but itu  same uh keluarga or like same kanak-kanak 
oh wait anda tuisyen is two jam 
i think just now anda know kita had  fokus kumpulan sesi with  great eastern 
ya then itu not itu cukup menyeronokkan sia like itu doesnt even feel like two jam 
like kita have i think five orang like semua gadis 
then got ini orang from hwaCity in Minnesota, United States chong also 
but then i think joanna knows dia 
because anda follow dia on instagram saya went to stalk dia , 
i jangan know how mereka kumpulan one but then like then when kita first entered panggilan right then  lelaki who is facilitating was like hei i  kedua-duanya of anda from hwaCity in Minnesota, United States chong do anda know masing-masing other 
i lihat at dia then dia looked at saya like ralat , tidak 
ya anyway  soalan mereka ask like not 
not insurans related eh 
ya then at  penghujung kanan ralat giltry tanya like dia ask  orang asked whether got mana-mana soalan or maklum balas 
then mereka just say what mereka want to know  younger orang younger penjanaan better bla 
then insang was like oh then itu not for a pengambilan is itu 
saya know kanan that sound like sesuatu saya will ask eh not dia then i ya then  lelaki was like oh tidak not at semua like itu does happen in very rare kes but most of masa is just for kami like kita want to get closer to  younger penjanaan bla 
ralat like quite young eh twenty plus 
like nearing tiga puluh saya think judging from dia muka 
ralat got one is vincent tan 
didengar of itu 
manusia saya shouldve taken gambar of mereka muka 
uh tidak ah mereka just say great eastern 
like mereka never mention apa sahaja about h q or not 
but anda said anda didengar of  vincent lelaki 
oh okay 
but anyway mereka just like show kami how

ya 
ya then 
then mereka also like ask kami like what kita 
ralat nilai 
like anda wang or what then like semua of kami right 
only got one bincang about wang  rehat semua talk about minat 
then in  penghujung  lelaki was like wah ini is one of  most like sihat and friendly and polite kumpulan then like whatever facilitated leh kita semua just what  neraka 
then dia like dia got a lot of soalan dia like jangan believe kami jawapan that jenis 
like got one soalan dia ask whether kita like to work in a kumpulan or kerja alone

saya see more lipas than itu 
ya itu hari itu was at  freaking hidup bilik anda know 
like theres tidak makanan there also so i jangan know itu like a full saiz one

how do mereka start to talk about itu 
what were kita going to talk about oh ya  tuisyen

i jangan know well see maybe after ini then sakit be fine with kucing anda know like how im halus with anjing after itu tuisyen 
after itu pelajar 
anda can get ebola from kucing 
negative pengalaman 
eh 
ah ini one anda dont have right saya give anda one first tambang ah asrama and i tidak watch  first one saya , saya watched  second asrama where  semua  gadis 
so dia so imagine saya was like i think ah itu masa was in saya dua puluhan then i always go on cuti with adeline with saya teman wanita 
so suddenly kita watch ini jenis of cereka especially when dia was hang then that wanita poke dia semua  darah come out to  mandi kanan then i was like oh saya tuhan that is hell aduh i like 
that i think that really frightened saya to kematian really frightened saya to kematian like saya do not want to go on percutian again that jenis of perkara lah but of kursus lah obviously after that saya say go for cuti lah but itu still give anda that kegelisahan anda know itu like  bukit have mata after itu cereka saya watched bukit have mata so i was like 
okay im not going on a jalan perjalanan ya jalan perjalanan saya didnt do itu , 
setiap masa saya if sakit kita go as a keluarga kanan 
going jalan perjalanan saya prefer if is a large jumlah of orang two three kereta yang jenis of 
perkara uh i a konvoi uh so are anda sure anda did not watch apa sahaja that uh give anda merinding and is like a very scary perkara 
uh 
ya saya want to vomit already 
uh 
ah okay that one bagus 
okay that one beri anda 
ralat okay 
think ini one do two three masa already ah , already start ah kita go nombor three okay 
i start first an peristiwa that made saya very angry 
saya think a keadaan where uh saya suami fidaus anda remember when saya uh dia got a tiket for dropping anda off at  bas hentikan 
so when  kerajaan keep asking uh sending huruf and reminder to pay  fine and for dia to submit dia full perincian and masing-masing masa saya asked dia have anda done itu 
then dia said ya dia done itu , anda know 
uh ya do that masa but dia never lepas anda at  bas hentikan dia drop anda somewhere at dover ingat for anda to go to sekolah take  kereta api to go to sekolah 
do anda remember dia stopped near a bas hentikan so uh 
so then moral of  cerita dia masing-masing masa saya asked dia right have anda fax  maklumat have anda do itu dia said yes and then  best bahagian saya saw  bentuk dia said dia already fax itu but  bentuk was left at rumah so i know hes lying and then  perkara escalated big until become a mahkamah kes remember itu was being 
panggilan to go to  mahkamah uh and then pay a bigger halus because itu kereta milik to kami bapa uh so 
itu really made saya very angry because if anda were anda make a silap anda dont get other orang involved 
and then when anda get peringatan and anda still dont do itu , itu really agitate saya itu like , why cant anda even do itu is itu that difficult is itu that difficult for anda to do itu uh that really upset saya 
uh so anda got  anda got an peristiwa that made anda very angry or not 
okay so nombor four 
so annoying 
wah now anda uh now anda like describing nombor five already is itu 
ya 
isu that i feel upset i think orang have  hatred lah 
like yang like perkauman or like uh kelas klasikisme ini jenis of perkara kanan saya think orang should stop having i understand that uh beberapa orang might uh have a rasa of like uh draw a baris ya but apa sahaja itu is right mereka should have like 
kita seek hormat for semua orang anda know , i do i am a strong beriman 
uh not of that anda treat semua  cara that anda want to be treated tidak saya dont believe in itu saya believe anda should treat orang 
uh lebih baik than mereka deserved yang jenis of perkara because  dunia perlu uh orang said respect cinta that orang care for anda know that 
if anda know sometimes when anda receive so much cinta and anda see orang are polite to anda right then anda like think like how can i just now be mean how can just now i be ini be that anda would push diri anda anda know anda beat diri anda anda know 
and then there theres tidak cara that anda would want to look at other bangsa negativity anda know anda would just want to fix diri anda 
so i think  dunia needs i think itu is what that make saya always upset when i counter semua ini uh insiden lah that  dunia perlu to change i jangan think  dunia getting lebih baik saya do not know whether is itu because im empat puluh ini tahun i seen a lot of perkara 
and whatever i rasa is always correct apa sahaja i predict oh 
correct ah that upset saya i dont im scared of  how do saya say ah quite afraid of  dunia now lah 
then now i add in nombor six ah that is saya kegelisahan in  pos dunia covid right saya kegelisahan orang become more selfish kita see so a lot of ugliness during before  c b 
after  c b orang kiasu buying lap out semua  bahan makanan that jenis of perkara so saya 
in  pos covid dunia saya think saya biggest bimbang is still about orang how selfish mereka are then  best bahagian recently saya neighbour kongsi in a kumpulan whatsapp chat dia was asking pendapat what should uh dia do when dia knows seseorang 
who was breaking  rumah karantina peraturan so semua of kami right actually advise dia pergi and , make a laporkan then in  penghujung after yadaCity in Illinois, United States yak dia said oh i think is okay lah saya would dia wouldnt want to dia dont want to make a laporkan to dia kawan then is in saya jantung kanan so are anda like seeking perhatian 
then in  first tempat so why do anda ask kami anda ruffle kami up , anda make kami worried because ini jenis of orang , let say  ah  orang dia knew had covid 
dia spread lain new kluster and gatal be so selfish of 
itu orang and ini jiran 
not to report right 
so im thinking like orang then what are anda doing why anda do anda make kami like so worried mereka are so dont kita know there will be always selfish orang like in  berita setiap hari 
semua ini , ah positive covid has been here here kita are already so dead worried then kita know mereka are selfish orang and then kita know that orang around  selfish orang would cover up for anda 
so upset anda know ini jenis of perkara like 
kita semua like trying kami best 
doing perkara and then kita i do not want just want ini one orang right like create a new gelombang anda know like kami domino kesan like , because of anda semua 
ya that jenis of perkara 
but itu already happened what is already happening what 
already mutated what 
evolved already 
hello anda are not updated about  berita remember that saya shared about like a minggu two or a minggu ago itu evolved ten masa worsen  mutasi is only at j b ah mutan already ten masa bertambah buruk anda there anda see anda are not updated even though saya updated anda inside  keluarga whatsapp kumpulan 
hurt seseorang feeling ah nombor seven ah saya think 
when seseorang feel betrayed uh maybe at kerja saya think that what itu masa when saya hurt dia perasaan right because dia and i were 
kita enter  hotel on  kita are  same orientasi semuanya so itu is jenis of pengikatan 
then sesuatu happened  guest actually called up , to ask for bagasi down then not even five minit later  pengurus come around say eh why not uh bagasi are not down there i actually pointed to dia and said wah saya told dia already to bring itu down , so saya pengurus actually scolded dia anda know , 
and then dia muka looked at saya like when did anda tell saya saya said ya saya told anda just now only satu 
saya tell anda that i think that dia lihat kanan 
crush saya know then mereka cause saya bos always tell saya oh sila anda are when anda are in pengurusan kedudukan uh anda have to be bitch about uh anda have to be a 
jalang anda know anda have to change anda have to be so when saya told dia boss anda know when i just now backstab ini one saya feel like shitty anda know 
and i even after that anda know immediately after dia come down  pengurus want saya told dia i hold i hug dia tangan and saya said 
im so sorry saya did that to anda i promise never to do itu again that jenis of perkara , so imagine that perkara happened in two thousand six now itu two thousand twenty right , masing-masing masa i see dia until hari ini saya would say im , im so sorry saya did that to anda i would then dia would just laugh setiap masa dia see saya who laugh anda know dia said 
ya saya know anda never do itu again ya saya know 
eh theres tidak 
ya lah ya but at itu masa anda just want to save anda keldai anda know that jenis of perkara then anda hurt because anda know anda always hear about ini , uh pejabat politikpart-type anda know when anda backstab right saya thought saya kita okay doing that saya said oh that thats not for saya i feel like s h i t y totally 
saya can not do that dia  lihat on  orang face right 
 kekecewaan right anda can like im so sorry saya did that to anda ah that jenis of perkara ah 
what frustrate saya 
saya think saya anak perempuan lah when dia stubborn 
dia always frustrated dia always frustrates saya i always wake up everyday like say oh saya 
janji not to scold saya anak perempuan saya promised to be  cheerful one , saya promised not to be  mean one , but when i ask dia to do perkara three masa and dia dont do itu right , and especially like just now anda mentioned i think kita have  haiwan peliharaan peeve right when dia dont know how to said 
terima kasih anda please i , especially when kita go down and send dia to sekolah right when seseorang press  pintu angkat for dia jadi i would tell dia yaya what do anda have to say saya sebab dia is already seven itu should be like automatically come out from dia mulut anda know even 
though itu doesnt come from  jantung ah anda should auto mode anda know so masing-masing masa dia do itu ah dia pretend to 
like keep quiet jangan know how to say terima kasih anda good malam at least anda say hello yang jenis of perkara when orang smile and greet at anda semua ini is basic ihsan anda know so i told dia eh why anda since anda enter primary one anda change a lot anda know youll become yang rude spesimen 
can anda stop being dead or not i never teach anda to so setiap masa setiap momen pagi anda imagine 
i orang would hear saya grumbling anda know from  angkat yaya where is anda adab i teach anda wah why anda dont do like itu why anda become like itu so orang would look at saya one 
jenis so itu really frustrated saya really frustrated ya annoying very annoyed 
what about what anda call that um  , menjauhkan peraturan are like in  rumah maximum many orang 
but have mereka , have mereka confirmed  tarikh yet because deepavali is only like three minggu away right or three and a separuh 
will phase three be started by then 
orh okay 
hey itu deepavali lah itu can go more than , dua puluh also 
um honestly were not doing much lah because um 
saya im not even sure if 
i min is itu worth preparing so much for like what eight orang , 
ralat saya 
um itu been a semasa since saya went to tekka last saya dont even know when im going next 
orh abercrombie fitch ah a f ah 
orh saya thought anda talking about traditional for jippaCity in Illinois, United States okay for deepavali okay 
ya saya tekaan from there can lah from there if itu like um near tunggu actually tidak tunggu a f  nearest is in somerset kanan 
orh okay 
saya will but um 
saya have to see first ah because uh sometimes itu a bit hard to tertib pakaian online because um  saiz and then i can not test itu out and i also like sometimes anda know  ,  saiz also itu um berbeza-beza like if mereka say s itu might 
singapura s is different from like american s kanan 
so itu like confusing in a akal lah so generally i dont like  idea of buying uh pakaian and electronic produk online 
what do anda call like um either buku 
if uh like cerita buku or 
suka certain perkara like um anda know  what anda call itu  lengan kantung where saya keep saya telefon in when saya go and jogging 
yang jenis of smaller aras perkara lah 
orh levis s ah saya thought anda say , device orh ya 
ya saya dont minda ive never , bought levis s jeans before usually i get saya jeans from uniqlo 
oh okay 
saya jeans i think  last saya bought was about two tahun ago 
so far itu okay lah but um but okay lah because , of  berat that ive been putting on i think saya have to get a new soon 
um okay lah if anda feel itu cara if anda feel like youve worn itu for too long and anda sweat a lot and anda like anda went out and circumstantially did beberapa anda 
anda will need to anda need to wash itu immediately then in itu kes okay basuh itu after  after one guna 
but aside from that if anda like just go out to like sekolah 
itu in  aircon persekitaran  whole masa then anda come back rumah then anda dont have to wash itu immediately right 
ya like setiap five guna is itu i think thats  maksimum anda can go 
ya saya think that one would be mereka based on  because mereka are  satu who uh created  produk ah mereka are  yang 
because first of semua uh over  tahun when saya have a old jeans ill wash uh repeatedly i can see for saya sendiri lah like  warna used to be like uh lebih gelap and look itu looks more vibrant when saya first bought itu as compared to how itu looks now 
sesuatu like itu itu faded dimatikan and  ,  warna lah like itu not as dark as itu used to be like itu looks like 
basically , i mean i jangan know how to say i itu looks i dont even want to wear itu anymore itu doesnt even look nice anymore  warna 
um , 
so mereka will what mereka will clean kitar semula and 
make itu look better than 
but  jeans that anda give mereka itu has to be ah mereka own levis s one ah 
anda not in laksamana now 
oh ya orh okay 
wait  entire blok or what 
orh okay convenient oh uh 
orh okay , whens  pengubahsuaian over 
what are mereka doing actually 
mm how easy to go to sekolah 
alah but itu semuanya is for  modul only what which mereka are giving semua  bahan online so , 
well im bahagian masa so , saya got tidak kemudahan 
but saya did join a rekreasi recreational kumpulan lah 
itu basically a like a c a for outdoor pengembaraan 
exactly thats what saya was thinking also but um mereka allowed saya in fakta there are quite a nombor of bahagian masa pelajar there also 
itu is , tidak itu is official in fakta itu like a pengadun of full masa and bahagian masa pelajar at first saya thought itu not allowed but i think now because mereka know  nombor of bahagian masa pelajar also increasing so mereka allowed kami lah and mereka also know that similar to saya , saya current keadaan a lot of bahagian masa pelajar , are unemployed 
mm okay lah as long as mereka get to join  aktiviti saya think itu good enough right 
persaingan ya 
ah okay 
what do anda mean by laksana saya thought  sekolah will give anda 
orh anda must okay 
okay 
ya saya guess itu bernilai itu lah but still i dont know itu not just  wang lah itu also masa consuming what to travel semua  cara there 
like itu almost one jam perjalanan anda know 
saya think uh two hari ago 
 one in  galaksi c 
ya saya know saya was talking to anda about wanting to sign up 
so ya lah saya , decided to sign up lah 
ya lah then after itu saya 
and tidak , like sometimes okay but to be fair setiap single masa saya dont go three masa a minggu saya will note down to know how much im lagging so that for contoh if i go twice a minggu ini minggu next minggu ill cuba to go four masa a minggu to compensate 
technically tidak lah i mean saya , im actually free setiap hari because first of semua um  kuliah 
mm if have ya 
uh tidak kita dont have to sometimes dia will ask to just to see  kehadiran and dia want to know kami how kita look kami muka and semua 
mm then ah 
ah betul and also um dia will give like anda know five sepuluh minute break semua during  syarahan that one also i can just forward 
wah anda minus semua that itu um 
if normal like only not even three jam itu two and a half jam maybe even lesser 
okay lah saya tekaan maybe then itu being because anda semua are full masa pelajar so penyertaan tanda still kiraan but for kami itu semua  cara um kehadiran not taken at semua 
okay if physical bermaksud i prefer physical leh 
in  kampus sendiri like how itu was before ini whole covid keadaan lah 
because there anda can first of semua itu lebih baik to hear because kita are thats how kita are used to itu what plus anytime anda got soalan anda can just either raise anda tangan or during  pecah anda can go down anda know  syarahan theatre anda can just go down to  
go to dia and then ask dia 
why oh anda find out diri anda or anda ask anda kawan ah 
orh emel ah but then if anda ask anda can , get itu faster what 
then anda have but then anda have to submit itu by a certain masa lah itu even open buku even , even if itu not even without covid also even if anda take  peperiksaan in  kampus itu still open buku 
ya itu normal zum akaun 
ya lah if in fakta if itu sekolah akaun i jangan think neraka be able to change  nama 
can change ah 
then maybe later saya will change back lah after ini because itu a bit confusing also when saya had a mesyuarat with  rekreasi kumpulan s u s rekreasi kumpulan also 
three aktiviti excluding meluncur 
skate saya mean basic 
as in  three aktiviti a hari tabata tarian yoga itu a 
on  ais meluncur and uh 
ralat rollerblading uh skate 
in  juneCity in Virginia, United States in dua puluh lima belas ah 
setiausaha program head kewangan ya lah 
same ah okay lah ex co lah 
eksekutif jawatankuasa ah 
but for now im somewhat head lah 
mm k lah but once i start , once i start finding kerja , i dont even have masa for semua ini already what 
ya thats  perkara saya feel i mean tidak pilihan i have to be practical also lah ini one which one more important but at  same masa i rasa bad also lah to ditch mereka if i ever 
can not cope if i ever like can not commit 
i jangan think itu tidak such perkara as komited for one tahun semua if anytime i feel like  more important perkara saya lagging semua like saya have to stop ini already what 
ralat saya think hes uh one tahun kami senior lah so im meneka last tahun lah 
eh tidak lah can not be lah then i think maybe hes wait hes twenty five ini tahun 
tidak im just guessing when dia , when dia o r d when dia started universiti lah 
tidak anda can be naib presiden of at least after one tahun can already what 
itu because i only sertai now only so whatever that happen before saya only join in like augustCity in Virginia, United States so whatever that happen before augustCity in Virginia, United States saya have tidak petunjuk 
but i mean let face itu lah if i really can not commit and i have to mereka cant actually stop saya from leaving can mereka 
i mean saya know lah like 
saya know lah like saya feel bad also lah if saya have to but i hope i jangan have to lah but 
orh then like anda mean like then just be a regular ahli instead of  setiausaha lah 
ya lah saya thats why saya say at least saya have um good perkara saya have  timbalan setiausaha with saya lah so dia can take over what 
ya lah like ya correct i know like saya hope i jangan but i im just hoping lah ya lah sakit try saya best to commit lah 
mm , or maybe 
or at least ill , or how about at least i give mereka like ralat like one bulan in pendahuluan before saya leave 
mm 
i understand but however  presiden of  c a is also 
a bahagian masa pelajar anda know 
dia also , shes not shes a full masa working inside shesCity in Illinois, United States actually a regular saya just only found out 
ah and then shes a regular and then shes  presiden 
so i mean if dia is able to i think saya should also be able to lah lebih lagi shesCity in Illinois, United States presiden shesCity in Illinois, United States handling more perkara so im setiausaha only so i 
mm okay lah 
ya saya think saya should i think in fakta ya maybe in later sendiri i will 
maybe later sendiri i will talk to mereka about itu lah regarding  keadaan 
in fakta i didengar theres a running trek and medan c a also but im not sure trek and medan can full masa bahagian masa can join but swimming saya know bahagian masa can join also in fakta  orang who tried to 
get saya in is a bahagian masa pelajar also 
i mean what recreational already got swimming , beberapa more what beberapa more anda want saya to join 
tidak i mean recreational is one c a then swimming lain one what beberapa more am i supposed to do beberapa more now covid also where got swimming latihan 
mereka will train mereka will do teras latihan to train mereka berenang through  zum akaun 
like anda know ya anda know uh for contoh ah anda know anda face  lantai and then anda put anda lower separuh of anda badan on  katil 
and then basically balance anda other half anda top separuh of  badan 
basically strengthening anda abdominal lah basically anda anda will feel  bakar on anda abdominal lah 
itu like as in a cara to strengthen anda teras that helps for swimming or sesuatu 
wah becuase of covid saya have to say not even ini tahun that saya went 
last tahun lah i tekaan last tahun maybe penghujung of last tahun 
kita went together in uh dua puluh tujuh belas before saya enlisted ingat 
ah ya remember i dipinjamkan anda saya goggles and anda said semuanya di bawah in high definisi or sesuatu 
ya but ya lah i think itu was in dua puluh tujuh belas juneCity in Virginia, United States 
saya think dua puluh tujuh belas but after itu i went saya started going to safra ever since saya got  safra keahlian from n s because first of semua okay itu may be slightly further but itu free plus  kolam is much nicer mereka got  underwater radio mereka got um 
basically  ya lah  same muzik that anda are hearing in  berenang kolam radio anda can hear  same perkara bawah air because mereka got  underwater kalis air radio there also 
ah saya mean obviously lah because when anda are swimming anda , ya anda go down then anda come up so itu like 
but then what anda can do is anda can like for contoh if anda wan na test anda underwater kekuatan anda paru-paru kekuatan then anda can stay underwater as long as anda can then anda can listen to  muzik at  same masa lah 
dua puluh saya think dua puluh eighteen ive been going for  past two tahun i mean ini tahun saya didnt go at semua because of covid lah but ive been going since dua puluh lapan belas actually at least once a minggu or once setiap two minggu 
actually i liked itu because , 
ya lah then after that kita went to walk to , or sesuatu 
itu was in itu aiyo that was even earlier lah that was like uh dua puluh fourteen uh kita used to go that  anda talking about  lazy kolam right  jurong  one at  chinese taman kanan 
kita used kita went there in like dua puluh empat belas together with  when  whole kumpulan was together last masa 
ya lah that one is twenty seventeen lah 
tidak dua puluh tujuh belas was just uh anda saya darland hari i think just four of kami only 
ada padanya a foto theres a , there is a foto of kami together , outside  berenang kolam 
ya saya think darland took a selfie 
mm tidak ini tahun saya never go at semua 
and also because i heard  safraCity in Virginia, United States swimming kolam is one of  tempat visited by  one of beberapa covid pesakit 
ya not just  swimming kolam saya know itu  whole tempat but itu was a few bulan ago lah im pasti mereka would have disinfected  whole tempat by now 
ralat theres a e mart there 
and then um 
technically only  berenang lah saya wanted to use  energyone gim but actually right 
err keahlian harga 
itu not so much cheaper than  non keahlian harga like  what do anda call a non keahlian harga is like i think like thirteen dolar per masukan keahlian harga is like 
seven or eight dolar per masukan 
tidak but think of itu ini cara mengaktifkan is two lima puluh itu three masa more anda know 
eh saya know youre going to say that and but energyone is semua  cara in safraCity in Virginia, United States in yishun bila-bila masa kecergasan has three outlet in hutan and itu dua puluh four jam 
okay lah saya know lah like uh anytime kecergasan mereka take a much larger sum setiap bulan but at least in itu akal um first of semua anytime kecergasan saya dont have to uh i tidak perlu to call to buku slot uh saya generally  kerumunan there is lesser also and um 
saya got more outlet lah ada padanya like literally three outlet in hutan one is at  hutan south m r t where saya was working that masa one is at  galaxy c kita somewhat go there setiap jumaat or at least kita used to 
and one is at  woodgrove lah that one near  almalic anda know where bojangles used to be 
ya and itu itu anytime kecergasan is now there 
uh tidak okay not setiap Keluar is uh twenty four jam but  one saya 
okay  one im going to is  galaxy c itu six a m to eleven p m  one but other two is twenty four jam 
okay technically saya keahlian is at  one at  ralat woodlands south m r t there  blok  a c e  tempat komuniti pusat 
because itu where saya signed up because saya was working there but now i jangan go there anymore because im not working plus galaxy c is nearer also 
after  first one bulan lah during  first one bulan anda can only use at  one anda signed up at 
mm but after one bulan anda can use mana-mana of  even overseas one also can 
anda thought what , anda thought what singapore ah , itu is a i think i think itu american or eropah 
ralat for anda tidak because anda r a full masa pelajar anda go to campus regularly and anda got  free gim there so for anda itu , itu wont be 
very uh effective for anda wont be useful lah 
ya lah that is up to anda lah if anda feel anda dont want to be in itu kerumunan if itu getting more crowded sepuluh anda leave lah up to anda lah 
ah okay 
semua must leave  gim 
saya thought anda mean i thought i thought itu only anda because anda pemasaan will only end itu masa 
orh 
so semua with anda at  same masa is go same masa come out same masa lah 
orh okay 
okay lah 
but anda are going to sekolah alternatif minggu right 
and anda still go even on  minggu that anda dont have to because anda got c a to do right 
ah okay correct lah so 
a lot of orang will buku lah 
so like itu just like sesuatu like but if anda dont come within a certain nombor of minit anda pemesanan will be revoked 
then anda will give itu to seseorang else 
so what if itu orang buku two to three ah but dia come at uh two , two dua puluh like itu will mereka at least let dia use until three o jam 
but mereka wont let dia stay twenty minit extra because dia came late lah 
in anda kasut then , obviously saya will go to itu n t u gim because first of semua itu uh anda are first of semua anda not only are anda uh full masa pelajar but anda are also going to  kampus almost setiap hari 
and one minggu for sekolah and then  other minggu for c a so anda are going there so anda might as well make guna of itu lah if youre not then maybe anda can 
anda do  pengiraan and anda see lah whether itu bernilai to get a , a keahlian for a gim outside 
orh okay twice a minggu 
but because anda are only going twice a minggu youll already know confirm what masa anda want to go so anda buku as early as possible then why would anda not get  slot 
ya but make sure anda use itu setiap 
masa anda go lah basically two masa a minggu make pasti anda go lah two masa a minggu okay maybe itu might not sound enough but if anda are extremely consistent like anda two masa a minggu semua  cara for like six bulan im sure anda can see um 
beberapa uh penambahbaikan lah 
and also maybe  other hari when youre at rumah anda can do static at rumah or anda can go for a joging outside itu makes about four masa a minggu already what 
orh okay 
orh anda just use anda , 
orh like itu lah just use anda telefon to measure  jarak lah 
ya saya know actually 
actually now also can lah kita slowly increase like maybe after two titik four kita try two titik seven then three slowly peningkatan can lah 
ya lah , ya lah kita were lighter last ya lah 
not really itu just that after gim after saya do kekuatan latihan saya will do on  kincir benang like maybe a little bit lah like one to two kilometer 
ralat tidak actually um actually 
uh , im not seeing 
im not seeing itu as a hangat up lah but 
saya warm up just extra only saya after i kekuatan latihan then i run a bit if i can lah 
kekuatan latihan kaki hari 
then um got uh berbasikal also  basikal  elliptical mesin 
ya because saya recently 
must be three masa anda running jarak 
so for contoh ah if anda wan na 
cycling two titik four and running two titik four tidak beri anda  same 
anda must kitaran three masa  jumlah anda run 
so for contoh if anda can run two titik four anda should kitaran seven titik two or sesuatu like itu 
and then if anda uh what do anda call if anda 
and saya also heard berenang is four masa  jarak so for contoh if youve run one kilometer swimming anda should be swimming four kilometer and im not sure 
how many pusingan is that lah saya think if im not wrong one pusingan go and come is uh hundred meter i think so 
ya lah exactly lah so anda must swim empat puluh pusingan lah 
saya know lah itu quite hard saya maximum only do less fifteen or sisteen only 
ya lah one hari kita will go together and do lah 
one and a separuh minit 
ya so what do anda think i mean itu will be useful for anda if anda are after yu siswazah lah which is soon right like actually youll be done with sekolah in may right 
ya and anda graduasi is in augustCity in Virginia, United States 
hoepfully itll be okay by penghujung of ini tahun lah 
ya itu  same 
saya would like to start of ini debat tajuk kanan by um actually defining ,  pernyataan that is being used in ini tajuk which is , in  umur of internet t v and akhbar has become irrelevant so um 
before startingum saya would like to define like what ini actually means right so , 
if um kita know  definisi of akhbar ada padanya actually two makna to itu so  first is actually to represent a printed penerbitan in a bentuk of Kertaspaper size 
and  second cara of mendefinisikan is an organisasi responsible for producing a particular akhbar 
so in ini kes um im actually referring to  physical Kertaspaper size and not um 
 organisasi 
and then when kita say irrelevant itu means that itu is not connected with seseorang uh or sesuatu and definitely not at  atas of  kepala when itu comes to keputusan membuat , so  titik im trying to make here is itu akhbar as a sederhana uh is irrelevant to orang Kini uh because itu is sesuatu that 
definitely not come to mereka at  atas of mereka kepala when mereka think that mereka are searching out for uh berita kandungan 
so um , what 
saya keadaan ini titik is also because um 
okay before saya go to  penjelasan why um 
saya must say that saya berdiri is that , kandungan of what berita ralat penerbitan hasilkan is still definitely relevant 
but  sederhana here is  satu that is not relevant anymore because of 
um how behaviour perubahan , and 
uh 
 cara , that saya want to support ini uh pernyataan is because um  trend in past five tahun clearly showed that , err  nombor of bangsa buying akhbar uh went down , drastically and uh orang are shifting towards a visiting berita laman sesawang 
uh so trafik on  laman sesawang so definitely theres a very obvious shift of orang who move from um 
Kertaspaper size sederhana to uh website sederhana 
so uh , 
ini clearly ini behaviour clearly buktikan that uh akhbar as a sederhana has become irrelevant for , uh  pembaca out there is not that  pembaca , um hentikan membaca but then is just itu theres a shift of err  trafik 
um and also when itu says uh when  pernyataan says that t v uh and akhbar right so , for t vs kes um saya argumen will be  same because  kelakuan in  past five tahun is consistent with  kelakuan for 
um akhbar so orang generally are just not uh going to t vs for hiburan , or for kandungan uh that mereka want so um  very obvious shift is that , 
orang are going to perkara like youtubeCity in Minnesota, United States uh and orang are slowly , uh not having t vs in rumah anymore as well so that also clearly shows that , um 
orang do not rely on t v that much lagi 
so uh i tidak akan say hundred peratus , ralat of  orang do not use itu anymore but itu irrelevant because itu not  first , err on atas of mereka kepala when itu comes to keputusan membuat 
eh yup three minit is up 
okay anda overrun by two minit already 
eh anda overrun by two minit already , 
okay so to sum up two titik uh cultural , cultural um 
okay tunggu cultural and then uh ekonomi sumbangan and whats  ,  other titik 
itu  kandungan ah that is err reliable okay uh semua three titik i definitely agree because saya titik over here of argumen is not Ke arah ini arah because , clearly saya , uh saya stated that um 
uh kandungan are still relevant for sure i jangan think pembaca will stop membaca uh and 
saya think mereka have certain err aras of penjenamaan and kredibiliti over there right because mereka have been around , mereka penerbitan that has been around for  longest masa but , what i feel that itu tidak relevan is like if i imagine i mean  , penerbitan syarikat kanan saya will still continue doing what im doing wartawan continue right menulis , uhproviding good kandungan but then 
 perbezaan would be err probably not um 
not 
circulating  kandungan right through  sederhana of uh of physical akhbar so itu was  titik of argumen but setiap titik that um 
uh dion stated err that one saya agree with 
um so what why err to strengthen  titik kanan that im doing  kursus right itu also because um 
saya feel that ini is a kelakuan that uh jenis of seperti has tidak turning back , um because due to uh  lifestyle ubah of orang especially yang that are in  bandar hidup um , kita have less masa kita are looking for perkara that save kami masa , or looking for perkara that provide kemudahan um , and kebolehcapaian to internet is just so powerful and kita have kami mobile telefon with kami 
like everywhere kita go even at  tandas , um if itu could be next to kami even when kita are showering ya so 
just because of itu real kemudahan over there itu is uh , due to practicality lah that um manusia err , living at least in a bandar hidup right , uh will be moving uh Ke arah that arah of , on getting kandungan from internet um on atas of itu 
saya think uh having pengetahuan is king hari ini right so semua wants to know uh berita not just within anda negara but also berita that are from abroad and , local berita kandungan is sesuatu that will not be available on physical akhbar if kita um itu 
um being accessed lah in  bentuk of Kertaspaper size so , i think itu also one very key perkara that why orang are going Ke arah internet and , 
uh saying that itu irrelevant tidak min that kita err can prove itu hundred peratus semua orang is not choosing akhbar over internet kanan because i believe there will be a small 
bahagian of orang that will still choose akhbar due to , tabiat uh and blah whatever sebab but , uh saya would say majoriti will still uh eventually or have already moved Ke arah um kebergantungan on err internet 
yup so thats saya titik , 
mm do kita want to move into open debat 
okay um 
okay open debat 
uh is there mana-mana other titik that anda want to add on , 
uh so ya maybe anda want to , summarise saya titik first 
ya 
and and also um  jumlah of uh berita that anda can capaian on  internet is um much more than a physical akhbar lah ya 
ya , 
ya i 
ya i agree with itu so uh itu was what i agree with so saya titik is that uh if let say for contoh let take um 
ralat s t as err as an contoh right um itu 
ralat 
mereka are providing  same kandungan atas talian and versus mereka physical Kertaspaper size exact same kandungan same bentangan same foto ya so in itu kes , 
saya agree that um itu still works if  sederhana itu a true , uh a digital platform that one is relevant but itu is not relevant uh , itu already irrelevant when itu uh in  bentuk of physical akhbar and itu clearly states , 
uh in i mean what is happening on  tanah right now itu true because , like even pengedar of physical akhbar for s t are losing pekerjaan already because  permintaan is just so low 
ya so thats  titik saya agree with anda titik but ya saya titik is lain that sudut of uh 
ya itu what im saying  berita is relevant because  statistic rancangan that  trafik uh  pembaca did not drop but then itu moves from sederhana to medium a to sederhana b 
so contoh ada padanya hundred orang who read monthly with s t kanan , initially fifty on physical akhbar lima puluh on digital now anda see  trend is that , maybe mereka are left with sepuluh 
on  uh physical akhbar but sembilan puluh is on  , uh digital platform now so itu shifted not saying that  kuasa of  content lepas no  pembaca is  same 
ya saya argumen itu 
ah 
ya 
tidak that 
itu why saya titik is that , 
itu why saya titik is that  kandungan  perkataan on  akhbar is relevant but itu  physical Kertaspaper size  sederhana that is not if there is irrelevant im not saying that kandungan is uh irrelevant which is  
exactly what i define initially im saying , akhbar in ini kes for saya rujuk to  physical Kertaspaper size 
not  kandungan ya so all anda titik i 
setuju with saya only , uh disagree to  titik where , um 
itu um 
ya that was  titik 
bahagian two positive pengalaman 
wow uh why not anda start first bro for saya younger hari is 
very very very dark 
most of  masa saya just tried to suppress itu let saya try to find a memorable momen while anda tell saya 

uh saya get i get what anda mean like when anda are young anda go holiday tidak perlu to think about wang semua bayar for anda , 
itu ya that is a very carefree momen ya 
itu a good masa when anda are young 
go percutian 
ya i remember actually like once anda say that kanan saya remember  first masa i come to singapore 
like  pengalaman 
uh saya think  first masa i actually come here was when saya was ten 
for a two minggu percutian 
anda know um a little backstory cerita saya ibu and saya ayah was actually divorce so saya mak came to singapore 
and then like um met a new lelaki and then um anda know 
uh once  first percutian uh that saya ibu decided to let saya come here experiences  singaporean hidup was when saya was ten i think come here for two minggu percutian saya was so surprised that anda know  
 gaya hidup and uh  persekitaran was 
so different from indonesia youll have to be very aware in setiap jalan that anda go anda know anda might get robbed anda might stab anda might get kidnapped mana-mana momen 
in singapura anda dont have to care about itu 
saya come here was like wow so safe tidak jenayah so clean , 
so ya that was one of  most memorable momen 
okay 
ya i mean i im not a fond 
ralat 
like im not a pet orang lah but i think i remember having kucing once 
i benci kucing 
but uh eventually like saya grow to 
saya , saya grow to 
anda know accept itu like itu 
itu kucing would be anda know 
are bahagian of saya hidup but 
ralat ya tidak 
tidak im not  jenis that anda know itu have 
okay maybe saya do when saya was super young 
saya ayah used to have an akuarium of ikan 
ya 
and err saya think 
saya like  akuarium is quite big bro 
anda know one hari i actually ah 
go inside and swim with  ikan literally 
ya literally saya 
saya , i think saya was very young saya was like at least three saya think three or four 
saya 
yes saya ayah came back and came 
 
 hidup neraka out of saya like 
why do anda do itu why 
so ya lah , 
correct ya wow 
okay saya wish anda luck bro i harap anda luck 
mm so ah 
uh next one ya 
what are  mimpi and matlamat that anda wish to achieve before anda die 
ya how 
how thats  soalan how 
okay saya get what anda mean uh saya get what anda mean 
ya fahami but saya i i know like saya 
to achieve ya continue 
for saya uh okay saya mimpi and saya matlamat 
are more or less 
to give  best 
uh to saya keluarga and saya loved one 
but before saya can give mereka  best saya have to be  best 
so saya fokus is always actually be better than who i am semalam 
anda know 
keep improving keep getting better so that anda know uh 
because im saya firmly believe like hidup get better as anda get better 
anda know hidup stay  same if anda are  same anda know like so 
just uh anda know focus on 
doing anda best in semuanya that anda do 
peluang are anda will achieve what anda want to achieve anda know 
because once anda set  matlamat anda know  itu a jirim of um 
uh reaching that matlamat lah 
anda know saya 
current 
ralat like near 
like 
saya current matlamat like  short istilah matlamat is uh to ensure that anda know um 
im able to 
inspire orang 
to just pursue mereka mimpi and just 
do what mereka love to do because eventually if anda invest enough masa in itu peluang are uh  kembali in pelaburan will be there will be visible lah 
so uh as anda know i work tangan in tangan with revive s g where kita anda know give um 
give pendidikan regarding uh anti geng and anti dadah to  belia lah 
so itu is one perkara that are anda know i want to 
kerja on wholeheartedly because i believe like  masa hadapan of 
of um of 
uh kami masa hadapan depends on kami younger penjanaan so if kita can 
ralat 
educate mereka earlier 
mereka are and 
motivate mereka to be a better orang now peluang are  masa hadapan also will be better 
so ya lah 
because i think anda know like 
 
recently there is a lonjakan in uh like 
geng aktiviti among  belia and then ada padanya also like dadah and barang like itu i mean itu is still going on and most of  masa is  
anda know 
ya saya know but itu mostly  young 
ya and itu is also mostly uh young kanak-kanak mereka are involved in itu 
so if kita can actually just 
educate mereka properly 
and show mereka that hei 
itu better to 
stay away from itu because itu gon na be a buangan of masa and a buangan of anda masa hadapan then 
peluang are  masa hadapan for mereka and  masa hadapan for kami itu gon na 
bright got i mean so ya 
so ya what do anda love about hidup bro 
is a perjalanan to where bro 
is a perjalanan uh 
is a perjalanan 
itu a perjalanan to wherever anda want to 
bro 
itu semua about niat 
if anda niat is bad 
anda perjalanan is gon na be bad anda destinasi is gon na be 
so if anda niat is good anda perjalanan maybe bad 
but anda destinasi will always be good because 
peluang are like 
if anda want a beautiful paparan from  gunung atas anda have to struggle with  panjat 
anda have to climb um go ah what 
what is  what is  
what do anda get to lose bro tiada apa-apa 
anda lose tiada apa-apa by trying 
because when anda try even if anda fail then anda will know that 
anda know 
ah youve tried ya 
anda know but if anda dont try anda forever would not know 
ya so ya lah uh correct 
so ya itu what i love about hidup bro 
hidup is actually 
an peluang for anda to find out who anda are and what anda are capable of 
uh okay uh 
ini one saya think is uh when anda see 
orang like for contoh in revive s g saya have a ahli who actually went in and out of penjara for eighteen tahun 
because of geng related uh jenayah 
for dia to change and for dia to change 
semua of  sudden and to want to motivate orang to show mereka that hei that hidup 
itu a facade that hidup is a bohong 
beritahu anda why because im 
ive experienced itu and dia is dead serious on trying to help bro 
itu is sesuatu that is very commentable of dia 
and very inspirational because like 
dia could have just anda know 
ubah for dirinya and just focused on dirinya tidak dia want to spread dia mesej bro 
anda know dia want to better orang anda know 
so like itu is uh seseorang that i really admire lah 
so 
that restored saya iman in manusia anda know 
like i thought semua is only doing itu for diri mereka sendiri but tidak lah dia actually care enough to 
bantuan lain with  dia pengalaman lah 
how about anda bro um ya 
hidup is actually about giving actually 
if anda think about itu itu very logical 
anda mum give kelahiran to anda for anda to have hidup 
anda mum give anda love 
and pengasuhan and perhatian 
anda know like 
semuanya is about giving 
anda know most orang are just take 
take ambil take take anda get what i mean 
and never give back itu why like mereka tipu 
not living a good hidup lah 
because mereka forget to give mereka only take 
but once anda realize that hidup is about giving then peluang are anda will anda 
itu is more worth hidup 
anda know exactly mm 
tidak im so 
actually kita can talk about uh what are anda thankful for 
to be honest what are anda thankful 
for ya correct normal ya 
correct mm ya 
likewise lah begitu juga first and foremost anda have to be grateful and be thankful to god 
ya 
and uh im bersyukur to god setiap hari for 
for giving saya 
seseorang so special 
saya isteri to be 
itu is  satu that im very thankful 
ya definitely 
like semua that kita love is still happy and anda know still alive that is sesuatu that kita should be thankful about as well 
ya likewise bro begitu juga im bersyukur to have anda as a kawan as well , 
so stop and serah is itu 
so stop and submit ah 
negative pengalaman 
okay let talk about 
negative pengalaman ya 
actually uh , is uh is about ini covid uh locked down , lately i watch uh beberapa documentary kanan 
kerajaan uh 
announced about  kunci down 
and anda see one big kumpulan of orang rushing to 
uh get rumah to mereka kampung halaman , and semua mereka 
kereta api and semuanya and mereka semua stuck at pekan then could not get rumah , 
there was really quite 
quite sad lah and anda see big kumpulan of orang 
ya saya want to talk about an peristiwa that uh made saya very angry actually uh recently i bought beberapa durian atas talian 
ya , and 
and anda know i before i set let ini syarikat that im going to buy from right saya read a few ulasan there are a lot of uh atas talian kedai 
for selling durian , so i read ini one and itu seems that mereka had very good ulasan very positive and good kualiti , so ive ordered uh few hari before 
and then when itu , when  durian was delivered to kami right uh saya bought three kotak two of  , two kotak uh was actually one of mereka was sour 
and one of mereka um was not very ripe and i actually i paid like almost sembilan puluh dolar for three kotak so wah when saya call up  
syarikat saya say how come what happen to  durian why uh 
out of three two uh not  of piawai then 
mereka were like oh is itu mereka deny  fakta that anda know mereka durian were tidak good mereka say , can not be kami durian is uh top kualiti um there are not , mereka dont believe what i say so i tanya 
for a pengembalian saya say oh saya want to have a pengembalian , because anda durian is not up to  piawai but uh mereka refuse to give saya a pengembalian , and mereka think that um anda know mereka dont believe what i say lah so i was quite angry with itu insiden 
now i dont think saya will ever tertib from mereka again 
mm ya 
okay mm uh saya want 
actually ya  next one saya want to talk about is actually 
actually um there are when anda go out sometimes anda see a lot of 
uh especially  old orang ah 
itu actually mereka are in perlu and anda cant possibly help semua 
so 
sometimes anda just um beli uh beberapa tisu Kertaspaper size from mereka , and anda give mereka  wang but anda dont , dont take  tisu from mereka right so that mereka can use itu to resell itu to lain and make wang from itu again 
so ya so i will feel that ya 
because , there are so many orang that need eh need bantuan out there but sometimes uh kita also have limited sumber to help ini orang 
mm okay mm 
ya apa anda greatest takut 
for saya now is actually about kerja keselamatan because anda know setiap one um near ini uh covid kanan has 
pengaruhnya was a lot of orang , and then uh even saya suami syarikat as well uh  pengeluaran uh has gone down 
and then i min for kami syarikat as well kita havent get mana-mana projek uh new perintah lately , so anda 
one would never know that whether anda will be jobless or  next bulan or  next two bulan , so i think uh greatest takut for kami at  momen is about kerja keselamatan , sebab kita still have 
two um saya mean kanak-kanak to feed uh growing kanak-kanak to feed 
so 
bayangkan if um 
anda know last masa , before  covid usually maybe uh if sesuatu happened um  other rakan  kerja will still be quite secured 
because uh at but at ini momen kedua-duanya uh suami and isteri kerja may not be selamat anda know imagine if let say two of kami also lost kami kerja 
then will be a bencana a keluarga bencana 
so i think itu is kami latest takut 
ya , ya true anda never know , anda never know apa going to happen next one kanan 
because uh actually sometimes mereka syarikat dont really kongsi semua ini rancang with anda right , so if anda are not in  kewangan or if anda 
and  kewangan or in  higher pengurusan aras 
at  uh junior aras anda wont know what is coming , so anda can take pencegahan or even at ini momen when anda need to take , anda can take pencegahan there are a lot of uh then may not be 
pekerjaan for anda when is there a kerja that anda may not get anda same gaji 
so i think that is one of  
kegelisahan also and that uh  kebimbangan that uh orang are facing ya 
ya that is quite unfortunate lah for ini kumpulan of orang that just graduated 
and then anda know mereka have 
muka ini keadaan like itu , because but actually when anda just graduated anda should be very happy 
that anda know , um anda are ready to look for a kerja and masukkan into ini uh working dunia kanan , so if mereka have to face ini i think is quite a sad perkara , that anda know mereka can not even uh find a kerja or get  bayar that mereka want to have ya 
mm what about fobia do anda have mana-mana fobia 
actually i have ini fobia that uh 
when saya was in saya previous kerja 
uh because  uh persekitaran was quite stressful , so um as much as anda want to 
be careful with anda kerja right , in  penghujung anda make mistake uh 
one after lain so setiap masa when theres a new tugasan ah i jenis of seperti have ini fobia that 
will i be making kesilapan will i make more kesilapan so in  penghujung um how i overcome itu is uh pilih to leave  tempat , 
ya so i could not take  tekanan aras there , uh so in tertib not to 
to 
ya 
sometimes uh anda say sesuatu anda know when anda were very angry kanan anda will say sesuatu that uh 
youre not supposed to say then after itu 
after anda say out anda regretted saying that and anda know that ini uh mesej has already went 
across and itu has hurt that orang feeling , so but 
mm 
do anda have a adegan from a cereka that make anda too , angry to watch since anda watch korean drama , is there , sedemikian a adegan 
do anda have such perkara that uh 
anda can recall 
mm ya whoaCity in Illinois, United States so , 
mm ya uh 
not really lah saya watch yang i okay lah yang drama i watch a lot of yang uh 
suri rumah drama , itu not really , but i want to mention sesuatu about ini 
 kesal over uh what kita cant , what  dunia needs kami to do more 
actually is about uh guna semula kitar semula 
guna semula reduce kitar semula 
saya feel that anda know um as much as  kerajaan always uh 
mahu to educate orang to reuse reduce and recycle right , but uh beberapa of ini shopping pusat membeli-belah or  pasar raya mereka are not um 
doing enough for ini 
because i see a lot of masa , 
yang cashier will give anda double beg and semua ini uh getah plastik beg and sometimes anda already carry anda own uh kitar semula beg right and then mereka still ask anda whether anda want itu , so in tertib to really um semua orang put in usaha saya think if semua can 
be more mindful and ya guna uh bring mereka own kitar semula beg mm saya think that will be a better persekitaran for i mean anda will make a better persekitaran for semua of kami to 
true ah singapura is a bit late uh on ini uh other negara 
uh semua ini kitar semula perkara mereka have started many tahun ago ahead of kami so , um but 
i mean  older penjanaan mereka dont see  perlu anda see because mereka are used to  uh gaya hidup that mereka have , mereka just 
guna whatever mereka need mereka dont fikir of uh recycling mereka produk 
or use lesser so 
ya itu why  younger one have to educate  older yang 
wah ya sia sial worth itu bro 
ya eh two cebisan saya mean for kami ah kita tertib two cebisan is only what twenty dolar right 
beberapa more  orang give kami discount beberapa more sia if not itu was twenty one dolar 
oh i think sebab 
i think cause like mereka want to draw like pelanggan saya tekaan itu why like 
sebab now also competitive 
a lot of orang semua dine in one as in semua tertib ambil makanan semua ini jenis of perkara so i think like mereka want to make itu more attractive lor 
so i think harga make itu cheaper 
eh but mereka large saiz is how much ah sebab just now  satu kita eat is large right  
just now  satu that kita tertib  dua belas dolar one kanan 
wah not worth bro 
hannor , hannor 
penghantaran okay but okay so  perkara is penghantaran is five dolar okay but anda need to spend 
more than okay minimum tertib is twenty but anda must spend more than sixty eight dolar i think 
sixty eight dolar ah then mereka will wave off  five dolar penghantaran cas if not ah itu technically twenty five lah if anda tertib minimum dua puluh lor 
but itu still worth itu 
ah two for one 
eh two for one is orh beli two give one maaf 
but two for one already i thought itu like one for one that jenis of logik 
oh ya true true 
orh eh is  satu that  
mereka just like migrated over to singapore eh tidak mereka are , expat right 
mereka same syarikat meh or different or mereka work different barang 
oh then mereka cant be married right engaged right 
perkahwinan pertunangan ah 
oh 
oh okay 
but kami english is u k one walaupun 
wah then what jenis of istilah mereka use though like mereka dont use  perkataan jarang then use what often ah 
hardly ah 
but mereka dont know  perkataan seldom what  mereka tipu vocab should be quite good what tidak even mereka dont use  perkataan kanan mereka should know whats  perkataan mah 
orh wah but a bit 
then  suami also then  suami cuba to talk also can not 
orh 
but dia even recognise dia is okay what like apa wrong 
like orang will say eh youtuber eh take foto youtuber actually tidak what i dont think mereka are 
orh like orang keep looking at dia like 
or maybe like mereka use dia like saya dont know youtuber kerja to i jangan know 
as a ancaman or sesuatu like itu i jangan know 
saya think have one eh saya think , ini , got orang surely do ini jenis of perkara to threaten orang one 
wah okay 
oh so mereka not even p r is itu mereka are just like
