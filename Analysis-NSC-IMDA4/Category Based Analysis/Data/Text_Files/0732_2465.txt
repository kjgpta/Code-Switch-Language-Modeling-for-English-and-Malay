I'm proud of you for caring about yourself
volunteers
[oh] because they're not gonna do any physical okay
[ah] I see (err) no [eh] they haven't recruit volunteers for I say members
no not yet don't think so
ya
putting it on record is not your problem
no [lah] I think cause they are still trying to secure the heats
so if there's no heads they can't get the members
that will be kind of weird
(mm) ya ya ya
[oh]
[oh] okay okay that's interesting
do you miss it like joining something at least
(mm) do you intend to join
like next sem
don't know I feel like
(um) like when I join when I was in year two it was purely for the sake of okay trying out new things right and I tried both ad hoc and sub comm
and then yes <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>sangat</malay> [ah] try <malay>dua-dua sekali</malay> [lah]
why not and so <malay>entah macam dah</malay> try <malay>dua dua dah cukup</malay> [ah]
<malay>dah dan rasa</malay> okay [lah] <malay>dah dah puas</malay> then I I
experienced what I need to experienced in ad hoc ya
I feel like
I think I was like [oh] like it wasn't that great experience
and so I don't think I want to join again not in my last semester [lah]
yes last year best year
like I that was right so I am doing other shits instead of doing school stuff
that's the way
(um) <malay>cari jodoh cari jodoh</malay> who is next
okay set set
Muzmatch next sem
I try before I try before no no not me I ask my sister to download so she was like
I was like please please <malay>kakak</malay> you don't have anybody let me just try for for one hour
I feel she was like ya
no no no no no no <malay>sabar sabar</malay> no no okay so the the (um)
I downloaded for her Muzmatch [kan] can so we just wanted to see how the app works right and so like we never put anything about her [tau] like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>gambar nama</malay> [jer] like we never add in anything in her bio her profile or whatsoever and then after that (um)
it was that like it will it will really bring you to the guys [tau] so you can just swipe right or swipe left
and then like we saw the guys I was like [oh] my god there was a okay [lah]
<malay>tak boleh tak perlu tak perlu</malay>
you can just
(err) upload <malay>lepas</malay> like <malay>bila-bila masa</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak payah terus</malay> upload
ya
I actually I think so I haven't really use other apps
yes ya you try you can just try now after that <malay>lepas tu</malay> like she just delete but then she still receives like emails from cross match cause it doesn't entirely
delete your account it just delete like it just delete the apps on your phone [lor] then <malay>macam</malay> the account is still there there's something about you [what]
I don't think can
I don't know actually maybe we never look through it hard enough to find where to delete
ya so like
we swipe up one guy
nothing within the hour she deleted the account after that
didn't see it but ya so I think
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say you <malay>nak nampak</malay> more <malay>calon</malay> [kan]
I think you have to complete your profile first so when you because we never upload her her profile or everything right
then there were we it was a limit of ten guys I think
ya so we only manage to see ten guys so out of the ten guys we only swipe up one guy
he was cute he was cute <malay>tapi</malay> [kan]
<malay>orang-orang kat sana</malay> [kan] is really looking for
come here looking for like [eh] it is
but I I guess that's the whole point of (um) Muzmatch and also like like half our #deen# right the app this dating apps but the half of our #deen# is
in <malay>dia punya</malay> database include international people
so that was how my aunt got married
ya so ya
so at one point I think she was tired of finding guys she just wanted to
<malay>macam</malay> like
just go all out and try and then like okay so she she knows what she want she's like okay I'm serious I want to get married I wanted do this I want do that right I want I know what I want in a guy and so she join half of our #deen#
I think half of my #deen# or half of our #deen# I can't remember and then (um)
she met this guy so like (err) he is from another country
but like he comes to singapore and wants wants to do work and stuffs I think
and then he came to met her and the parents of her
nd then now they are happily married but now she lives in australia
ya we want international guys
sure sure ya
that was kinda kinda
cool
yes what what is that yes <malay>tapi kena bayar</malay>
the I think because
to show that you are really serious and not like having fun you know that playing around Muzmatch <malay>tak payah</malay>
half of our #deen# need you can have like yearly subscription or like I forgot what else ya I told my sister (um) by the time she reach a certain age
and she still no guy I can help pay for her subscription
if she wants
(mm)
is it
I didn't know
[oh] okay okay
I feel like Muzmatch when you want to create the thing right they will actually ask you
how halal are you ya ya they will ask you about prayers so like the question was [oh] like how often do you pray then there is like sometimes most of the time everytime that kind of thing
I feel like that's the I feel like now that you said it I feel like there was one of the questions that was asked ya so in their profile they will show
<malay>macam</malay>
I think I wouldn't mind I would say I'm not against it
it's just I I feel like
(um) not saying any couples out there who met through dating apps like you guys can be happy but like
I feel for me if I want to fall in love with a guy I have to know the guy in real life first
like I'm not the kind who superficially <malay>macam</malay> [oh] if you give me this this things about you list me this things about you then okay
you fit the ideal in because sometimes it's like act it's like you say things and you show things that you want people
to perceive of you that doesn't mean that they are truths about you
I like I rather go through the process of finding these things out myself about you and then I decide like I don't need
(um) this interface to tell me okay ya
(mm)
ya
opinions on that guy also affect my opinion on that guy also like for instance if people around him keep saying that [oh] my god it's such a nice person and he doesn't this this this then I'll be like okay see it's like he's kind to a lot of people then he must be a nice person
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya and then that's kind of hard to to do with a guy that you meet on a dating app because you don't know the his friends
right you only know him and after that if he chooses to let you in on his social circle then you will get to know his friends but besides that
you only have him ya but like you will say [lah] like if that's important then
meeting a guy in real life whom you know through like mutuals and everything is more important
[eh] do it [leh] let me be the why
no [lah] I mean sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> K when I say <malay>dia orang</malay> serious [kan] it's like <malay>dia orang betul-betul</malay> serious want to put themselves out there
but you can tell from okay so because my sister friend
join Muzmatch for quite a while and she dated a guy on Muzmatch but like she told my sister that the guy is that (uh)
(um) quite trashy
it is so like I said like the things that they put on your profiles doesn't reflect
what who they are in real life you know I mean
ya so ya she dated a guy and then she broke up cause the guy was just too
[eh]
ya
ya like it really just depends on your <malay>rezeki</malay> I guess
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
I guess (um)
when you this is very superficial [lah] but I guess when you do it in real life
it makes you come across and that's desperate
ya because nobody knows how many guys you are talking to in in a dating app you see
you can be talking to twenty guys and that they they just think that like I mean they probably won't think you are talking to them alone because you are on a dating app but it feels like you are talking to them alone
but if you were to do it like in uni context for example when it's such a small social circle
and you put yourself out there and you
you know try your very hard right then it that case becomes desperate
ya
correct I know like I before I join (um) ad hoc and stuff like people already
say [lah] you know did like people like actually join ad hoc and stuff for the sake of
ya so actually that that was what
turn off people from joining ad hoc last time
like during before like during that time when I wanted to join
I don't know
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
what's like your ideal date
ya [lah]
I would like to know
ideal date no I don't think so
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
so is that your ideal date or your ideal first date
first date ya
[oh] ya ya ya ya but like first date you <malay>terus</malay> want to <malay>pergi</malay> trekking
I I don't think that's anything is too much
I think it's up to people preferences
[ah] because
<malay>sebab</malay> you <malay>duduk</malay> side by side
watch the movie what do you mean okay then
<malay>jangan</malay> date <malay>orang gatal</malay>
okay ya I agree with you <malay>pasal</malay> the movie like
<malay>kalau tengok</malay> movie <malay>tak boleh berbual</malay> and then you
<malay>buang masa</malay> like if it's a date like like first date you know that you <malay>buang masa</malay> like <malay>dua jam tak berbual</malay> then like
[oh]
I mean it opens up doors to topics of conversation afterwards like
if you going out to <malay>makan</malay> and everything
ya
[ha] your date how long
(um) okay K K ya trekking sounds like a great great ya
okay I first date
I like nature so
(uh) no I feel like trekking <malay>nanti</malay> (um)
I will look so unglam
like just
I I won't I won't dump it on scene on the first date I don't want you to run on the first date I'm gonna capture him first you know
like I will wait for like a few months
maybe like the second month ya [oh] let's go trekking then we see how [lah]
<malay>macam</malay> very superficial ya first ideal date [ah] I feel like
I like I like going outdoor so so so maybe I would like a picnic
ya
right ya
like I would like a picnic then we paint
<malay>lalu</malay>
ya right
like like I don't know like I had seen my friends who are couple and then go a picnics
ya
and then like <malay>dia orang masak sendiri</malay> you know and like so cute then they have like those picnic baskets and then like [oh] ya it's so cute
ya so sweet
the mat <malay>tikar</malay> flat lay yes yes yes yes
it's so beautiful
ya then after that we watch the sunset
right
[oh] no [oh] my god
okay if let's say you are on a bad date okay
would you ghost on him half way or would you
ya so <malay>macam</malay> if you think like those <malay>cerita</malay> like or like I don't know like <malay>macam</malay>
they just went toilet and then they never come back
but what if like the guy <malay>betul-betul macam</malay> very disgusting very rude
(mm)
[ah]
okay so it depends on how bad the guys is [lah]
[ah] I see
ghost
(um) so I I suddenly remember <malay>pasal</malay> you did you watch the smart local ya
ya so that was this (um) they were talking about their dating experiences so there was this person who said that he was catfished
by (um) catfish K catfish <malay>tu bukan</malay> <malay>kucing ikan</malay> okay <malay>tapi</malay> so basically like
(um) on a dating app you pretend to be someone else
or you pretend to be something very different from who you are like you don't have to pretend to be someone else but you can just pretend to be younger or older or like
shorter or taller that kind of things so
then he was catfished by a much much older woman like at at that point he was only
nineteen eighteen ya
I think so [lah] ya then after that he was catfish so when he came right like
he saw the lady was much older at that point is so young right and then like (um) he just went to toilet
and then he just never come back
ya
(mmhmm)
it is
I mean
I think if I was catfished
the the the guy obviously deserves to be ghosted
because like why in the world would you lie to me in the first place
ya right
that's why
like I don't think that's a nice way to present yourself
ya do you watch like the netflix <malay>punya</malay> [ha] what's the
[ah] I forgot the name like the dating ya ya ya ya
that's this thing (um) that you date
the girls on one side you guys on one side and then the girl and the guy will enter the same room but they cannot see each other
and then they will have like conversations <malay>bukan bukan</malay> it's not a <malay>cerita</malay> it's like dating reality
show (uh) that day I just find it
<malay>sekejap</malay> [eh]
ya and then (err) so basically they will get to know each other through those rooms for like a few days
and then after that like if they like each other right they they can continue meeting each other through those room but they cannot see each other so when they can see each other is when the guy or the girl if you want proposed to the other person
so only when they are engaged
then they can meet and this all happened within one month
have you watched that so far it is it is
I I really forgot what's the show [ah] cry
maybe just finding
[kan]
just you know
I mean at this [oh] love is blind yes yes yes
ya love is blind is it was a pretty interesting show actually
(err) ya ya ya it is it is
like out of
many couples right only two got married <malay>tak salah</malay> I
ya
so even then there were a lot of dramas and everything because you can only meet the person so
at that point it was really a matter of
(um) they will basically they were trying to prove like does looks matter do looks matter
ya like in in a relationship
so at that point because you cannot see the other person so it's really about
whether you can really appeal to this person just through your personality [lah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
would you ever
no I I would be
I I feel like ya but like but like
I I think in matters to some extent that I get to see who I'm interacting with and potentially get engaged to you know
ya
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
match making [ah]
(um) yes yes I guess it is the same thing like
ya but I guess that [one] is it's kind of sad [lah] cause they don't have a choice you know
ya
what change
that's nice too right
I used to set deadlines for myself okay twenty five I must get married
ya it is
ya really is right but like that was when I was like still young and naive and just thought like [ah] you know
ya twenty five sounds like a good age after uni ya
and I no guy also like where am I going to look for
guy ya like
I have but I have a lot of my batch mates <malay>dia orang dah beli</malay> you know
my batch mates [tau] I understand seniors but my own age
ya ya like
shit
ya ya [kan] is
is I feel like it's really stupid like the the fact that
can only apply where people can only apply if they are getting marry and stuff and then like how the age limit to buy an apartment
the law says it's thirty five years old like I think that's really stupid
(err) ya and also like
I think the government also want people to procreate right so like they want people to get married have children so that's an incentive for them
yes
yes #hazimah#
for women our future generation to suffer
ya
[oh] my
actually ya that's a good thing [ah] and I I've thought about this my answer is no [lah] I don't think I'm willing to have children
at it like in this knowing that the world is like this
nonsense nonsense it is it is and like
I don't know like I don't think I want my children to grow up in singapore
like not it's too stressful then
to be a minority in singapore it's something like in other countries you will still be a minority
true
true true true it's just that for a country that price itself over
multiculturalism multi racialism whatever
ya
I saw I saw my history teacher posted this on story
so it was about this article about this (um) malay muslim lady who decided to make <malay>halal</malay> mooncakes because
there are a lot of <malay>halal</malay> mooncakes in singapore and then her caption was like you suppose to hiatus already his her caption was
(um) to my sec four students (uh) here like (um) no actually is like [oh] (uh)
both she teaches both so she was like here is a good
[oh] I'm proud to live in singapore (err) to my sec four students here is a good example of multiculturalism
and then just like right right and then I'm just like
but like you see you can always find minorities doings stuff to be
to like make an effort to accept other cultures but you don't see majorities doing that the same for minority cultures
so you can't possibly say that is multiculturalism if it just fits into
your ya
correct and then I was like [oh] K
no I haven't have you but I saw snippets of it
[oh] god
I saw I saw yes
about like [oh] like why did you not care about politics [oh] because is fatally boring right it was like it's boring
it's boring to you because you don't care about the or you don't care to change about the world that fits you perfectly ya
that's exactly what I discussed with a friend that I fell out with
you know like
it is but
no it's not some disagreements and like like I said to this friend like
it's not something that you can just agree to disagree not when my rights are
being violated you know like when not when I'm denied these rights
(um) have privilege over
you know it comes easy for you and that's why you can just choose to say I don't want to care about politics because it's so boring and it doesn't concern me but for me
politics is so deeply entrenched in every aspect of my life and for you to say that
(uh) like being so nonchalant about it it it hurts me [lah] because then do I even matter to you
because I feel like if you want to be
(um) you (uh)
are a majority in this country right you have a lot of power and privilege
and if you're not willing to do something with that power and privilege
then you're just being an oppressor already you know if you are not on the side of the oppressed you are with the oppressor
<malay>dia orang tak sedar diri</malay> [oh] my god
then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>kalau kita bilang dia orang</malay> [kan] [oh]
<malay>korang ada</malay> chinese privilege or whatever [kan] <malay>dia orang macam</malay>
<malay>kecil hati</malay> [oh] <malay>mana ada mana ada korang korang ni</malay> just oversensitive [lah]
ya
I <malay>pernah ada kawan ni</malay>
<malay>dia tak percaya</malay> chinese privilege exists in singapore
<malay>dia mati-mati tak percaya</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> because is is okay
I so
perhaps it's also because if they acknowledge that chinese privilege exist then they have to
face the fact that you know the there's this inherent problem in the system
that is damn perfect suits them perfectly but denies
(uh) huge like minority groups of the same rights and privileges you know then then they will have to to you know they know that there needs to be changed by they are unwilling to go through that change because it brings inconvenience to them ya
ya
so <malay>dia betul-betul tak percaya</malay> [tau] chinese privilege exists
<malay>habis dia dia buat</malay> this long twitter thread <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
it doesn't exist <malay>pasal</malay> [oh] (um)
<malay>budak-budak melayu tak bayar</malay> school fees <malay>untuk sekolah</malay> it's very very cheap compared to <malay>budak-budak lain</malay>
and then like talking about Mendaki system (uh) subsidies and stuff and like
<malay>dia betul-betul usaha</malay> [tau] <malay>untuk</malay>
prove that no chinese privilege ya
it's (uh) (uh) [oh] my god when I read it I was like K [lah] <malay>buang masa</malay> [jer] [lah] I <malay>baca tak ada apa-apa</malay> it's okay thank you very much
ya it's just (um)
it's just
ya I feel like
when people say that [oh] you want more why why is it that you need more many represents or more minority representation
for you to hear minorities kind of what they face ya right like why do you need so is that you only hear people with power
what then then who are you really representing that you are not representing the people's voices you are representing yourselves people with power amongst yourselves
yes yes that's
ya so
so <malay>kesimpulannya</malay>
<malay>saya tak nak anak-anak saya</malay>
<malay>awak</malay> [a'ah] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>tak kisah pasal</malay> (um)
<malay>rakyat-rakyatnya yang</malay>
ya it's true true but you see why is it that we always have to compare with other countries why can't we just compare with our own and admit that it's sucks
<malay>bersyukur</malay>
ya
I don't think you should just compare countries across countries like that
which countries
ya I agree with you like
there are other form of oppression that minorities face in singapore it doesn't have to be
[oh] because [oh] like other countries if you are muslim you die you know but in singapore like there are oppressions like #hijabi# don't get to wear a #hijab# all the time
there are instances at work where they have to remove that and that is something conflicting with religion and
you know being in workforce
ya
ya
ya like
ya it's like [oh] we should be grateful that we are giving you some rights [oh] [oh] okay
ya like
ya like okay can then like
I think like <malay>dulu</malay> (um)
coming from a I feel like a
I would say privilege background
like I was very (um)
blind sided to all these issues that was prevalent to this society
like I was
I feel like I was like always trying to be accepted in
ya ya
ya
ya
took a lot of unlearning to finally accept that you know what
it's okay like
ya like I'm proud of being who I am and I shouldn't care about what others
like
I mean that's how conversation works
[oh] my god like ya

not actually a lot of things is not on the river a lot of things is
no idea maybe there's a river there that's all
right and then I feels like [ha] maybe cause like can go first
they don't have the crews anymore so then the boats then <malay>kita orang pergi naik</malay> it just like a short it's like <malay>macam</malay>
a bit like a roller coaster kind of
really inside the lock right it's like a lock right there's a mechanic you know so you just go through it's like a ten minutes ride
ya <malay>kita kena bayar</malay> five dollars but besides that everything is like
no I thought it was going to be real but it's not
but but (uh) #kai kai# or #jia jia# whichever is the female [one] she's pregnant yes cute
then like they like she had to she couldn't come out [lah] she was she rested in
in his own enclosure
ya
like the I think #kai kai# is the guy [one] #kai kai# was (um)
#kai kai# <malay>masih makan jumpa makan makan makan</malay>
<malay>habis dia makan</malay> ya
[ah] menopause ya
so <malay>dia pun</malay> pregnant [lah]
[oh] ya <malay>dia makan banyak</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi yang</malay> the pregnant
the #jia jia# was just sleeping like rolling around sleeping
ya so then the <malay>apa tu</malay> (err)

babies like on where instagram
maybe that's why your algorithm is just on this yes ya
(mm) that is interesting I think mine is also on
(uh) <malay>apa tu apa tu kucing</malay> and also you know those <malay>macam</malay> couple couple <malay>buat</malay> video
no it's not it's because <malay>kita orang asyik tengok</malay> some videos <malay>pasal</malay> couple couple so the algorithm just
shows that
<malay>macam sedih</malay> [kan]
<malay>apa</malay>
ya
ya but like I feel sometimes <malay>dia orang</malay> post <malay>benda yang</malay>
should have just kept it to themselves <malay>macam</malay> something not everything other people should be
shared to everyone in the world because some things are so intimate like
ya like I was saying (um)
like something are just so intimate <malay>macam</malay> I recently saw this video <malay>pasal</malay>
[oh] (um) <malay>dia</malay> went through
miscarriage and then <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>teman lelaki tengah nangis</malay> on the bed <malay>dan macam dia tengah</malay> comfort <malay>teman lelaki dia</malay> I think
a bit <malay>dia ambil</malay> video on this stuff <malay>dia macam saja nak</malay> post [jer] then I am just like this kind of things in life are
so intimate to you guys I
maybe different people have different perceptions of what is intimate to them but in my opinion this kind of things are
I don't know it's just
true
true true true true I
I would say that I can agree with that of course like I I'm all for you know normalising guys crying and miscarriages happen in huge like
be able to talk about it openly but as you know it's just
ya ya
so ya I don't know like
(uh) I like when I watch videos <malay>macam dia orang</malay>
<malay>tunjuk dia orang pergi</malay> on dates <malay>tunjuk orang buat begini begitu</malay> cute cute
they are like
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] <malay>apa</malay> challenge
<malay>dia orang buat apa</malay>
I see
ya
there is this I have this favourite couple the guy is so sweet and then like there was like a date the girlfriend did a challenge called my husband and then the guy was like [oh]
my heart you just called me your husband
[oh] so cute
I guess maybe like at that stage they still don't know yet but then when someone says it like that it gives them more reassurance that one day it's gonna happen you know
you you can try [lah] like [oh] like do a live [oh] my husband here then like
then your mother follows you right later your mother [oh] okay [lah] then your friends then
husband <malay>bila dah nikah bila</malay> [ha]
#adam# <malay>apa siapa tu</malay> (uh huh)
<malay>pelamin dia kat rumah</malay> [eh]
<malay>nak tahu</malay> [ah]
I've never thought of it that way
<malay>bodoh</malay> [lah]
emcee <malay>cakap</malay> (um) <malay>mari</malay> (um) <malay>teman-teman dan keluarga</malay>
(um) <malay>semua orang sila carikan pengantin pengantin perempuan hilang</malay>
[oh] my god that time my sister <malay>pergi kawan dia punya kakak</malay>
(um) <malay>majlis perkahwinan</malay> then it was <malay>cantik gila dia tepi laut</malay> and
it's it's not open <malay>dia bukan takde</malay> shelter it's sheltered <malay>cuma tapi dia macam</malay> how to say (uh) it's like <malay>kampung</malay> style open windows so there is a shelter but it's <malay>tepi laut</malay>
like it by the beach <malay>tepi laut</malay> kind <malay>cantik gila</malay> like <malay>dia punya</malay> deco and like the view
true true <malay>kalau nanti hujan masuk</malay> confirm <malay>mahal</malay> it's definitely <malay>mahal</malay> it's a it's a well-known expensive wedding venue no no K see I have
this rule is that <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak kahwin</malay> actually <malay>takde majlis pun</malay> okay actually ya
like <malay>secara jujurnya majlis bukan untuk kita majlis untuk ibu bapa</malay> ya ya like because
I've heard like a lot of times people like the the people the guest coming to the wedding are not really people that you
know or are close with they are just people that you invite because it's a formality that you have to maintain relationships yes yes
with family members ya
[kan] and like in this pandemic like you
it is telling [lah] that that's actually you don't actually need to invite a lot of people you can just stick two hundred people and and that's it
you know
ya <malay>orang kecil hati</malay> [kan]
ya so
#inshallah#
putting it out there yes I think my my family won't be nice too
okay [lah] good luck to my sister then
<malay>terima kasih kerana menghadiri</malay> (um) <malay>bersama</malay>
#alisha# <malay>dan sekian terima kasih</malay>
