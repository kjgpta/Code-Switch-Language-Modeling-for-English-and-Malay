COVID situation
I don't know [ah] okay <malay>sekarang sekarang</malay> (err) I'm in army [kan] so
but the same for you [lah] you're also in army right so (err) it's just [ah] social distancing
okay
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] what are we doing now
okay understand
(mm)
ya
ya I think <malay>sekarang sudah tak boleh tak boleh pergi</malay>
like you cannot go places a lot of places [ah] <malay>banyak banyak banyak tempat tak boleh pergi</malay>
<malay>atau dia punya ada</malay> limit
<malay>ada</malay> limit to entry [ah]
(err) <malay>kalau</malay> [ah] tak tak tak sekarang masih masih</malay> five <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>sampai seratus</malay>
(mm) <malay>bukan</malay> [ah]
ya for for any event you can have hundred people
I think so I'm not sure
I think it's still phase two I think it's still phase two no it's I think it's across like
I don't know but I think <malay>tengok tengok apa</malay> like orang lain yang</malay> instagram stories <malay>nampak</malay>
<malay>ada ramai orang cakap tak ada</malay> in the same venue <malay>tapi</malay>
they take turns [ah] like in six
so <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam pagi</malay> family then (err) <malay>petang</malay> just <malay>kawan-kawan dengan</malay> friends
ya
I'm not sure I'm not sure that's just what I see [lah]
ya
(mm)
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>iya ke</malay>
(uh huh)
(uh huh) (uh) (mm) [ah]
(mm)
[ah] yours is [ah] that <malay>yang yang jemputan</malay>
next week is it a hypothetical situation or is it actually true
[oh] actually [ah]
[ah] okay okay good
okay [lah]
[a'ah]
[ah] evening <malay>semalam</malay> only <malay>semalam</malay> I posted about it
(err)
I don't [ah] nothing much about it it's to me it's (err) quite interesting what the government is trying to do
cause (err)
I post that like the last thing I said was (err) it's a measure
that is focused on
grades
but ultimately the aim is to take
take the focus of parents away from grades [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> it's a bit contradictory
[ah] paradoxical [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay>
(err)
like it it
because currently the parents' focus is on grades itself so
what other way to affect them other
other than to take the grades itself [ah]
really your score
really [ah] I see
[ah] I haven't seen that
[ah] same
no wait no I haven't I didn't I didn't see that part particularly
it was more about more about the transition from primary school (err) to secondary school [lah]
as of time
ya ultimately (uh) what happens (err)
what secondary school the person goes to will affect their post secondary education yes that's true
ya but I haven't read up enough
anyways I'm not too concerned about (err) that
but I just found it interesting that's why I read up a bit on it
(uh huh)
(err) these days like
<malay>macam</malay> (err)
<malay>memang</malay> I don't keep myself up to date that much
like I don't read the news
ya
[ah]
[ah] (uh huh) <malay>memang memang betul betul</malay>
ya
basically that's the thing
(mm)
(err) okay
I <malay>sudah tengok apa kebanyakan orang</malay> [kan]
okay <malay>kalau tengok</malay> in army in army
<malay>berbeza kalau</malay> compared to police <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>itu memang</malay>
applicable stuff in my opinion they're doing stuff that
okay not necessary that applicable but they're affecting the society
ya they're actually protecting society but when it comes to army [kan]
ultimately what is to singapore is manpower
they need the manpower to do stuff like
<malay>macam</malay> for example pack
<malay>lapan</malay> pack
or
fireworks
I guess
so
<malay>sekali dengan</malay> diagnose [ah]
[ah] <malay>pasal</malay> for us like
(err) we come from then
<malay>kita memang tak banyak apa berbual dengan apa orang lain</malay> [lah]
we just talk to our own people [lah]
[ah] own circle [lah] ya [oh] ya
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
ya these two years not wasted
<malay>satu tahun belum lepas kau nak</malay> two years okay okay <malay>tak apa</malay>
ya so far
ya [ah]
ya (err)
for some people <malay>kalau</malay> they didn't go to
<malay>dia orang memang</malay> won't have the opportunity to
(err) <malay>jumpa orang lain</malay> [ah]
so unless they went out of their way today
(uh huh)
(mm)
[ah]
[ah] <malay>betul betul</malay> actually it's actually true [ah]
(mm)
do anything else
ya true
[ah] ya I I agree like now is the best time to be in [lah]
but even in you can do stuff outside you can learn other skills in your free time [ah] if you have free time which
not everyone has free time honestly
then (err) as I was saying [ah] in army is <malay>penat</malay> so
(err) so army
a lot of people in combat stuff they will train combat stuff
(err) which wouldn't be applicable [lah] cause when will we go to war
god forbid ya
no no I'm saying it won't I'm saying it won't yes
because ya it's fighting but as a logistician
I think that the things that I learn (err) can be applicable [lah]
(err) recently I went through this (uh) ammunition course
then (err)
ya I learnt
ya I learnt a lot of stuff [ah] (err) stuff related to storage
and (uh) inspection
pretty cool ya
ya we can't talk much about that
ya not
(err)
going out with my family that rarely happens
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang suka buat dengan</malay> family [ah]

ya
ya that's good
[ah]
[a'ah] ya really
[ah]
ya

(mm)
good point ya the thing with me is that I have

every time I go home he always
ask me questions about (err) when is our commissioning date
or when you will get a number one [ah] like that (err)
ya but during (err) during
he always ya that was the time when he compared the most because (err) <malay>pasal ada apa</malay>
(err) the start of the
for me for me there was the #tekong# experience [kan] the #tekong# experience <malay>dia orang</malay>
so my <malay>ayah dengan</malay> my <malay>kakak ikut pergi naik</malay> ferry <malay>naik</malay> ferry <malay>pergi</malay>

[ah] ya you didn't do twenty four (uh) twenty four [kan]
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> the most recent batch they did (err) twenty four
in #tekong# ya that's kind of torturous in my opinion
they didn't have anyone cheering them on
[ah] for for us [kan] <malay>bila kita</malay> pass by
(err) #changi# #changi# <malay>apa tu</malay>
usually #changi# <malay>ke</malay> east coast <malay>ada</malay> hawker center
hawker center [ah]
east coast [kan] east coast <malay>yang ada satay itu semua</malay>
ya
they were like [oh] thank you for serving the nation but
we were recruits [lah] we haven't shit so we haven't done anything yet so
ya
but (um) is to is to
yes
ya
[ah] that's a good point ya they just did
ya
[ah] nine weeks and then next one nine months [lah]
[ah] [eh] I thought it was the end as in I really thought it was over
no I'm kidding
ya it's not for everyone it's okay
ya how about you [oh] you're going to talk about the pay [kan]
so (err) to me okay
<malay>jangan cakap</malay> pay [ah] you know it's more like a
allowance <malay>macam macam</malay> your parents give you during school
it's not much but it's enough for you to spend
like for me for us it should be I think <malay>pasal</malay>
(err) back in [kan] my my family gave me
two hundred bucks per month
which is a lot less than what I'm getting now but it was
more then enough then
but dude I don't understand why <malay>kenapa sekarang</malay>
<malay>sampai sembilan ratus pun</malay>
<malay>tak sampai dua minggu boleh habis</malay> I don't get it
but it's okay
[ah] okay
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>senang apa</malay>
[ah] same
[ah]
[ah] <malay>itu pun sekali</malay> [ah]
(mm) that's the thing <malay>pasal</malay>
(err) for a lot of people [kan] <malay>pasal masih muda</malay>
so it's their first experience of getting money
so they get carried away with how much money they're spending [lah]
they they think that they have a lot to spend so then they buy a lot of
things that they don't really need but
they think they can afford which
for the most part they can like <malay>beli baju ke beli</malay>
<malay>makan makan</malay> more extravagant more extravagantly than you normally would [lah]
because you finally have a lot more money
but the thing is that if you carry that on then
it's as if you had the same amount of money before you just
I don't know okay maybe your
you don't save that's the problem
you just don't save but you just spend more
start saving
[ah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
[oh] no me too
(mm)
(mm)
ya
same
yes yes [oh] my god
[oh]
election [ah]
ya
ya that's how it is but (uh) personally I also don't
(err) I don't follow that much
(err) I I do invest myself
in local stocks so local stocks aren't really affected by the election right
ya but my my coursemates [ah] [oh] my gosh everyday
they talk about
like they either talk about used to be they talk about but then finished already
so now they're talking about elections [kan] every day they will talk about stocks
!wah! buy this one buy this one sell this one which one more expensive [eh] [ah] this one going up the percentages all
ya and (err)
ya and I don't really keep up
but I understand I think it's good [lah] I think it's good that
(err) more of our generation are learning
how to make more money from their money
ya it's
it's good for our future
like in you can save up to twenty thousand
plus plus
if you're smart with it
compared to
us correct
(mm)
(mm)
ya that's a good thing [ah] that's a good thing for the future
we cause right now we're not earning that much right
then when we (err) get actual jobs we will earn
a lot more a lot more than we do now
and if we carry on with this mentality then it will be good [lah]
but the thing is that after this
after these two years of <malay>apa</malay> earning money
we're going to go through how many years
at least <malay>empat</malay> at least four years of uni for some of us [ah] especially kids [ah]
and then <malay>apa</malay> during these four years <malay>kita</malay>
confirm <malay>tak akan tak akan</malay> make that much money [ah]
as in unless you do a side job [ah] side hustle <malay>ke apa</malay>
(err)
you have to
I have to find a way to either make money or just I don't know I'm personally
going to try and rely on a scholarship <malay>atau kalau tak</malay>
no I don't want to burden my parents like honestly I don't want to burden my parents
<malay>dia orang sudah banyak banyak</malay> give me money [lah]
like they're going to sponsor my I mean okay driving license is not that much [ah]
but they've been sponsoring my whole life honestly
so
<malay>kalau boleh</malay> I would get a scholarship
for uni so they don't have to fork out more money for now
and uni <malay>bukan murah</malay>
depends [ah] especially <malay>kalau nak nak nak</malay> stay in hall (uh huh) stay in hall
ya so
ya
<malay>mana kau</malay> deal <malay>dengan</malay> [ah] some [oh]
okay
[ah]
[ah]
[ah] <malay>habis</malay>
ya
(mm)
[ah] <malay>betul</malay> [ah] saying this do you have a plan
personally I I
I aim to at least save a excess of five K (err) by the end of
(err) because I I've I've made a lot of plans [ah] like I have the investments
and then I also signed up
I got I got tricked into no okay not tricked I got lured into
signing a deal with investment savings plan
insurance [oh] my gosh yes
<malay>jadi</malay> so it's like
a few bucks okay [lah] about a hundred every every month
that they will take
then save it saves more than a bank of course anything saves better than a bank honestly
interest rates well
so ya just apply and then
other than that I don't know what to do
like maybe I should also start taking down
(err) how much I spend
that will be better right
yes
(mm) okay
(mm)
yes
(mmhmm) thinking about it's
it's a rookie work yes it's realistic

ya reading and writing doing exercise for five hours and then after that
because I need to eat I will go out and eat
