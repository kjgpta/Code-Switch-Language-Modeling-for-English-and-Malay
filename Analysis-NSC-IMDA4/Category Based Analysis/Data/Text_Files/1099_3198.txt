set and then it was honestly okay just that the the curry (err) the the chicken was like very small and it was I think because microwave [kan] so it was <malay>macam</malay> a bit soggy already ya so it wasn't crispy so I'm now I'm thinking about crispy chicken now ya
[oh] this morning I was actually quite happy cause (err) I woke up at what time [eh] like around ten o'clock ya then I was a bit hungry so <malay>tapi</malay> like (err) there wasn't enough breakfast for me leftover from my family so I asked my helper to help me cook
nuggets and french fries ya so while she was cooking right then #haziq# called me ya then then ya #haziq# called me so I was super super happy because like <malay>macam dah lama tak dengar dia punya suara</malay> ya so I so I was super happy so the moment I answered the call right
he was he was singing then I was like !wah! in my heart [eh] is like like bursting [tau] ya so I was so happy to see him singing and like being very cheerful cause like I told you that time (err) he was a bit down and like (err) demotivated [kan]
so when I like I heard him singing then !wah! like I was like thanking the god like don't know how many god okay I mean I only worship one god but ya I was like [oh] my god I was so happy that he was happy then he started walking also like I told you he hasn't gone out of bed for like I think at least one week [ah] ya so today was the first time that he walked and he was walking in front of me also

your face ya so ya [lah] so they were encouraging him to sing more [lah] cause they were happy that he's happy then (err) he even he was like (err) cause one of the nurses one of the male nurses is called his name is #rex# he's a filipino guy

okay I'm done
(err) what did I have for lunch [ah] [oh] ya because I was talking to #haziq# until so long right my breakfast end up became becoming lunch ya so I ate my nuggets and fries at around like one [eh] [eh] no ya around one [eh] no
no no twelve twelve sorry
ya I that's my comfort food
<malay>orang tengah sedih kena makan</malay> comfort food then after that gain weight after that <malay>gemuk</malay> after that (uh) regret
<malay>semalam</malay> ya I went out to go to the hospital <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak dapat jumpa</malay> #haziq# [lah] cause (err) <malay>dia tengah rehat</malay> so I just <malay>duduk kat bawah</malay> [jer] ya what about you
<malay>belajar makan</malay> [eh] <malay>makan apa kat situ</malay>
(mm) true I agree the ya those two dollar chicken rice two dollars #nasi lemak# at those are it's like a god send
ya correct even though it doesn't come with soup or like doesn't come with I don't know like (err) but the portion is decent ya the portion is decent then (err) the taste also not that bad ya so ya I I've been eating there quite a few times also
no I always go to the #choa chu kang# [one] cause I gym <malay>kat</malay> #choa chu kang# ya so sometimes after work I go to #choa chu kang# to gym but there's always a long queue ya so I will join the queue (err) I will join is an electronic queue [lah] so I will go there scan the code then (err) I will join the queue then after that (err) they will they will text you when it's your turn
gym box ya the gym box <malay>punya</malay> queue management system is like that
[oh] ya ya no no sorry I digressed and now I'm talking about (um) just in general me eating there because I love that place now ya #choa chu kang#
ya is near the the the the old school bubble tea shop the bubble tea shop that's only like one dollar plus only
ya ya ya but anyway ya that was in general I love that place ya but if you wanna ask me about lunch what did I eat for lunch yesterday let me think no I didn't [oh] okay I remember I went to [oh] cause I okay yesterday I was supposed to work full day but I took half day ya so in the morning I was working
but (err) in like after twelve then after that I wanted to go gym [ah] then cause my gym <malay>dia punya bawah ada</malay> this new burger king then cause our area you know there isn't a burger king nearby so I always never I'm like burger king deprived you know me and my fast food [oh] shit yesterday I eat burger king today I eat nuggets [oh] damn
ya okay so anyway ya I wanted to try the burger king you know why cause there's a new snow cheese snow cheese burger
it was surprisingly better than I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be a fail because you know usually like cheesy stuff like I mean other than cheese fries a lot of the cheesy stuff usually they fail cause like (um) it's not enough cheese or like the cheese is like fake cheese or something but this [one] is like they really use I think is mozzarella cheese cause when I bite into the burger right the cheese actually pulls
ya and I have no idea how they make it [lah] so like like how they can like make it in a way so cheap cause mozzarella is not that cheap ya then ya it was good then after that I went to gym then after that I went home to shower because the gym in #choa chu kang# doesn't have a shower
later like what time
(err) the burger (err) I ordered the meal then I added forty cents for what [ah] I added forty cents for onion rings so it was I think a normal burger meal is eight dollar ninety cent
ya so are you thinking of getting one tomorrow
right because our house area <malay>tak ada</malay> burger king <malay>dah lama</malay> then this is the newest [one]
ya
ya nice but I think right after trying the mozzarella [eh] no the snow cheese burger I kind of still prefer the swiss mushroom [eh] the mushroom swiss burger cause it's saltier and I love salty food
ya so I think next time like I would still recommend the the <malay>apa tu</malay> the mozzarella cheese burger to other people <malay>tapi kalau</malay> if I were to go back to burger king I'll end up ordering the swiss the mushroom swiss instead [lah]
ya don't know [ah] it's just like I I like it that way [ah]
ya then what did you do in the evening yesterday do you still stay in
[oh]
where
(mm)
mushroom soup how can mushroom soup be salty
what as in like is too clumpy
[oh] okay okay okay
[oh]
[oh] okay wait what is this cafe called again
is it is it like the
but is it like in a mall or is it like in the middle of nowhere
[oh] !wow! that's interesting (um) so why did you guys want to go there
(mm) [oh] ya since your friend has a car right so what did your friend order then
[oh] and that's enough for him
(mm)
(mm) [oh] ya I saw your friend before he's like a teddy bear
(mm)

ya yesterday I just went to the hospital [oh] like after I gym then I went home to shower then after that I was feeling pretty lazy [lah] honestly so I just (err) ask my brother [ah] [eh] can I take the car or not then he say can go and take ya then I took the car I drive to I drove to
then I park at this super far away <malay>punya</malay> car park cause <malay>dia punya</malay> parking fees very cheap it's like for one hour is like one dollar and eight cents
that is super cheap like that's the cheapest already normal price (err) all the other parking lots are like double the price is exactly double the price <malay>macam</malay> two dollars sixty cents (uh) sixteen cents [ah] ya ya but my worry cause I never went there before [kan] so
but when I went there I <malay>takut</malay> like because it's quite #ulu#
<malay>dorang cakap ada</malay> shuttle bus [ah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> because I'm gonna go there at night so I <malay>takut</malay> like
(uh) <malay>kalau bilang nanti bila malam nanti nak nak balik</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti ada benda</malay>
so I was super scared about that so like (err) when I reach there right it was quite empty like quite a few cars parked there [lah] to be honest so like I was not too worried but then to be safe [kan] I just parked right smack in front of the lift
right smack in front of the only lift there ya so the moment like <malay>kalau apa-apa ternampak cabut</malay> ya ya then like I think cause it was so #ulu# so when I waited a I parked my car [kan] then after that I waited for the shuttle bus <malay>kat bawah</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> like <malay>dua budak lelaki budak melayu ni tengah tengok</malay> [jer] probably wondering like what the hell am I doing there cause I think cause I was like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> wearing office clothes #ish# #ish# [lah] I was wearing with jeans [ah] the top <malay>macam</malay> (uh) like office <malay>punya punya baju</malay> [lah]
ya then after that <malay>dorang tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>apa budak ni tengah buat kat sini</malay> #ulu# #ulu# <malay>punya tempat</malay>
ya so I <malay>tapi tak kesah</malay> [lah] so like the shuttle bus quite reliable honestly speaking ya so when I took the shuttle bus then I drop off at where I was supposed to then I went to the <malay>makan</malay> place the <malay>kaki makan tu</malay> ya and I ate my favourite (err) what's that called the #lor mai kai# ya
then I wanted to buy <malay>dia punya</malay> what's the one that we ate that time [oh] <malay>dia punya</malay> honey barbecue #bao# the one that was very big and fluffy right that time we ate ya but this time <malay>dorang tak ada semua dah habis</malay> so they only had like #siew mai# and #lor mai kai# and the typical #nasi lemak# so I didn't want to eat so heavy for the #nasi lemak# so I just got the cause the #lor mai kai# itself is already quite big right
#nasi# [ah] sorry I ate the #lor mai kai# then I ate the then I order three #siew mai#
ya it's damn nice right for some reason that #lor mai kai# got the like the wok !hey! taste ya [oh] my god ya so that's why like !wah! I think if I go there again right I'm just gonna keep buying the #lor mai kai#
and I want to try the there's noodles also so like I reach there around six O five ya then (err) when I go there then I wanted to buy the noodles cause that time we didn't get to try the noodles [kan] so <malay>dorang cakap</malay> (uh) noodles the person who cook the noodles (uh) only available <malay>sampai pukul enam</malay> then I'm like but it's six O five
so I missed it by five minutes ya it was so sad but it's okay [lah] (uh) #inshallah# next time <malay>ada rezeki boleh dah makan</malay>
<malay>makan</malay> noodles <malay>dia</malay> there was this (err) it's a bit like #ban mian# ya it's it looks a bit like #ban mian# but like I think got like hot dog and egg and fish I think ya ya ya ya so it's like you know on like a cold rainy day that's the kind ya you just really want to <malay>makan</malay> ya like you just craving [kan]
ya so I just like I wanted that was the they say like all the noodles like the the cook <malay>dah dah balik rumah</malay> [lah] so I just like okay <malay>tak ada rezeki</malay> then ya then (err) ya then I ate there then (err) the person I ask the person whether can I stay there for a longer period cause by right <malay>dorang tutup</malay> (uh) <malay>pukul tujuh</malay>
[eh] <malay>pukul tujuh</malay> [eh] <malay>pukul tujuh ke pukul lapan</malay> ya something like that ya but then I wanted to stay <malay>sampai kul sembilan</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dorang cakap dorang tutup sampai pukul tujuh pukul lapan gitu tapi</malay> (uh) they allow me to sit <malay>dekat luar dia punya</malay> outdoor seating so it's not really outdoor [lah] it's still within the building it's just that it's outside the shop
ya <malay>macam</malay> in a way communal area [lah] <malay>tapi ada meja</malay> so okay [lah] so I <malay>makan</malay> there I <malay>duduk</malay> there <malay>sampai pukul sembilan gitu</malay> then after that I just went home ya I went back to the shuttle bus ya !wah! ya the shuttle bus was so hard to find like (err) cause it was a loop so I wanted to go to the other end of the loop ya but then ya it was so hard to find and thankfully
I didn't see anything at the #ulu# car park [ah] parking lot exactly so ya some more hospital [kan] ya so I was super scared then I just like okay never mind don't think about it
ya but #alhamdulillah# ya [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak nampak apa-apa</malay> then I just <malay>balik rumah</malay> [jer] [lah]
okay let me let me look at the other prompts
[eh]
I hope that we can play badminton later [seh]
ya I think so we still have like <malay>macam</malay> forty minutes to go
ya
this is the kind of weather that you just want to hide under the <malay>selimut</malay> then after that you just sleep ya [sia] it's like so windy I hope I hope when we play the badminton later it won't be too windy ya but I think even if it's windy I think I will still be fun [lah]
ya too windy I think too much but I think
ya ya <malay>tapi</malay> I saw <malay>kat sebelah dorang ada</malay> roller the want to roll the floor (err) when it's wet ya so ya it's not effective I must I must say that first as in how to say it's not very effective but it helps with the drying [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> it like last time when I <malay>tengah main</malay> netball [kan] I always use that roller to spread out the rain
so that (err) they all evaporate faster something like that [lah] I have no idea how the science works [ah] ya okay let me see what are the prompts (um)
okay if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
damn ya that's super deep I I didn't expect you to think of that
ya you know mine on is like super shallow
actually no I wanted to teleport so I can go all over the world and like you know [lah] I like to travel the world [kan] ya so like if I teleport I don't even need to go and flights I don't need to pay for flights and technically I don't even need to <malay>apa tu</malay>
(err) stay in hotels also cause like I just teleport home <malay>tidur</malay> one night then the next day teleport to greece again or something like that ya so okay [lah] ya okay I need to aim to be like you
damn what who who is that celebrity
[oh]
ya that's true
that is a very is #hyorin# right that is a very response is like a very well formulated kind of answer ya
ya
(mm)
[oh] damn
sounds very black mirror kind of
in what way can he help others
damn you say is the boy is it how [oh] !chey!
I was expecting like you know like a seven year old boy [oh]
damn
it's like it's like robin hood in a way
robin hood I mean takes money from the rich and then gives it to the poor [kan] but he does he does he do that like like that style or he does it for his own good
(mm) !wow! that sounds very deep ya I realise you really like watching a lot of random netflix stuff okay (um) do you have any other topics to talk about
no right okay wait I know I know I know I feel like this question both of us can answer okay what labels do you think you have been given by society damn son this is a very deep question
in general
I mean you already out of school so
(mm) stereotypes [ah]
ya I get what you mean [ah] ya is a bit (err) a little bit offensive ya but I think honestly for that [one] it doesn't really affect me the one that I always keep hearing is [oh] you malay [ah] you in uni [ah] [oh] so you are one of the what [ah] a smart malay [ah] they literally label me as a smart malay
ya I don't know whether you you experienced that before [lah] but I got it a few times especially even some of my friends who are currently still saying it then I'm just like damn keep quiet guys ya I just ya [lah] I know I know recently also like especially during (um) the circuit breaker period a lot of the hoo-ha on these racial slurs and whatever has been going on
ya I I saw a few videos on it [lah] during during circuit breaker cause I mean during circuit breaker <malay>tak ada apa-apa nak buat</malay> [kan] ya so I just <malay>duduk rumah tengok</malay> video like in a way very sensitive content just <malay>tengok</malay> [jer] ya so I always get that then like like honestly right when I hear that it makes me happy but at the same time sad also
ya like like what what is the rest like of my society like how to say like by fellow malay people doing that like we get such a label ya like I don't feel like I deserve it
to be called a smart malay I'm just to me I'm just right I'm just trying my best that's all to survive in this singaporean society and I think to you whether you are malay or chinese or indian ya like so the fact like when when people tell me [oh] you went from then go to !wah! smart [ah] then in my recent job interview <malay>pun dorang tanya</malay> [oh] I think your academic background is very good
do you regret choosing your current path then I'm like am I supposed to is that like a serious question like I I kind of felt offended like why can't I just go and do something that I like ya so (err) !aiya! don't know [lah] I don't know why they asking this kind of question so I I just I mean it was a job interview so it's not like I can retaliate or something
ya then I just like ya it's just something that I've always wanted to do customer service ya then she was like [oh] okay okay okay but ya like like quite #sian# [ah] to hear these kind of comments ya I just hope that one day because now now like our generation more woke already right ya so I really hope that (err) everyone will try to like calm your tits
ya and just like try to I don't know be more mindful of what you say [lah]
he's on what on the ship [oh]
ya that's true
you know like that question also like made me think of this one situation like I'm not sure whether you know but Mendaki has this initiative like for (um) youth mentors to reach out to in a way like at risk youths [ah]
ya so like those (err) from what I understand is more of like those people <malay>yang dorang nak lari dari rumah</malay> (uh) <malay>dorang punya mak bapa selalu tak ada kat rumah</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> maybe maybe you might need financial assistance all that <malay>pun</malay> ya <malay>selalu gaduh kat rumah</malay> and all that <malay>gaduh dengan kawan gaduh dengan cikgu</malay> that kind ya so (err) that is what <malay>apa tu</malay> Mendaki is trying to do [lah] ya this was (err) last year
so I was interested because at that time I had a lot of spare time so I just sign up [lah] because (err) even though to me [lah] like even though you are only in a way impacting one person's life as a mentor that one person is gonna be grateful to you like for in a way maybe [lah] #inshallah# like for the rest of their life ya so like the impact even though you can only impact like you only have like such little impact in your opinion to this person
you have you affected them so much that they change their lives around ya so that's what I wanted to do [lah] so I want I wanted to do that so like when I went to the interview right they were the !wah! the interview was like what like <malay>dua jam</malay> [siol] ya so ya so like I was talking for so long ya (err) I mean cause they want I think in a way they really wanted to get to know <malay>dorang punya</malay> volunteers
ya just to make sure that like you know in terms of <malay>adab</malay> in terms of your <malay>akhlak semua</malay> (uh) <malay>boleh</malay> pass [lah] ya like <malay>macam</malay> there is no <malay>macam</malay> red flag ya so like because these are people like the people like the student that we will be dealing with is like those people <malay>yang betul betul</malay> need help [ah] ya so like if you teach them the wrong thing then <malay>macam</malay> (err) Mendaki has to answer in a way [lah] so I I understand where they are coming from
ya so like I remember that time when they asked me whether I had any concerns right I did [ah] I suddenly thought of it on the spot during the interview cause like for me like you know for me like especially before this I the way I speak was very english she find ya very very
very english [lah] like not not queens english but like I concentrate more on english and my malay was terrible [kan] ya but then now I mean I am improving [lah] in a way in my malay (err) language exposure ya so like when I (err) my my question to them was like I am <malay>macam</malay> in a way
straight laced person like from primary school to go to secondary school some more it was a girls school then from girls school go to (err) and then from go to uni so like it's something that I scared I cannot relate to to the students there because they are very different from me ya and then like
like will they want to even listen to my advice or will they even want to like they probably cannot relate to me [lah] like your just be like your problem is different <malay>apa kau</malay> [kan] <malay>anak-anak orang kaya</malay> that kind ya so that was what I was afraid of [lah] my intention was to help them <malay>tapi kalau orang tak nak apa tu</malay> (uh) they don't want me to help then
like I I don't know [ah] like I just cannot cannot handle it [lah] ya so I was just I ask them that then they were like [oh] don't worry [lah] I think from what we know about you right now at the end of the interview they said that like it should be fine ya
it is [lah] ya cause (err) one of the mentors was telling me that like (err) he was a he was a mentor a few years back then he said that like one of the students that he was mentoring ran away from home and he slept at this mentor's void deck for like three nights before he found out
ya so like cause the the mentor always like I mean like always rushing to school rushing to work before that right ya so like he didn't realise that the kid was sleeping at his void deck and he didn't even tell him ya so !wah! I'm like !wah! if I were to be in that mentors shoes right what would I do you know like I cannot imagine myself doing that so <malay>macam</malay> to be honest in a way I just lost confidence [ah] like in what I am able to do
ya but recently some of my friends have been asking whether I want to join or not ya but I don't know still thinking about it right now my life <malay>macam</malay> still <malay>huru-hara</malay> so I need to let it get it settled first [lah] don't spread your eggs in two many basket ya too many things man
[oh] damn we have been talking for like fifty one minutes
[ah] [ah] okay let's look for one more question (mm)
okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
isn't education free [eh]
that's true but technically also isn't it like
like it can be a controversial opinion <malay>tapi macam</malay>
wouldn't you think like if
if the students work hard enough they're able to get scholarships to such places scholarships or bursaries are existing [what] right ya
(mm) ya and I feel like that like free education right will only help to a certain extent ya I think like underlying problems such as <malay>macam</malay> maybe social and familial situations ya so for example like those
those students like like let's say they have problems at home like in a way their parents are getting divorced ya then <malay>macam dorang tak boleh</malay> they cannot like how say is very they can overcome it definitely that is is not impossible but it's still very hard [lah] like you know like how they say equality versus what [ah] equity
I can't remember what's the other word ya like you know the the diagram of the like people standing over a fence then ya ya ya that that (um) analogy [lah] ya so like equity and equality right if I'm not wrong equity is making sure that everyone has enough resources individually
the customised amount of resources
ya ya
but then like for equality is like when everyone gets the same thing ya ya correct ya so like some people giving getting the same amount of assistance compared to someone who actually needs it more like may not appreciate it more [lah] ya I think is quite hard to differentiate like that [lah]
ya [oh] my god my throat
!hey! [oh] ya okay then for me what was the question again [ah]
(um) my first answer is food but that's not deep enough I tell you if free [eh] food is free right I will just I don't know why I would I would become a snowman ya okay wait let me let me try to think of a deeper answer (um) if something was free [ah] can I say time
ya
like you have all like literally all the time in the world
yes I want like you know like there is no such thing as time like people do not age people do not grow
is a like like your parents will be alive forever ya I mean ya [lah] like in a way is kind of what I will like you and but at the same time you won't savour moments as much ya !wah! it's like being immortal I cannot like I think I think I'll be super bored [leh] if I were immortal
no [oh] my god if I were a vampire
I think I will be a vampire because I get to sleep all day they go out at night I don't mind
ya cause like vampires ya you literally just be lazy [ah] okay maybe cause I just been watching a few movies right but vampires actually do nothing then like they just (um) and they have like superpowers that make it easy for them to hunt ya so like life is easy for them [lah] basically
aesthetics ya [sia] okay that's true that's true
I don't know and werewolves are ugly
unless you are like taylor lautner unless you can shape shift (hmm) will the werewolf be the shape shifting [one] maybe will be quite fun
