okay I'm actually very stress [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> the my wedding [lah
I'm planning to lik
two [lah] because the (um) the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle [lah] early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before [lah] [ah
that was the initial plan (err) <malay>tapi entah</malay> the situation can change you kno
(err) so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
(err) <malay>kalau</malay> we we I moved to his house [kan] at least <malay>nak pindah</malay> to our new house it's <malay>lagi dekat</malay> [lah] I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the <malay>barang</malay
(mm) then don't know [lah] to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house [eh] and then like <malay>rohana</malay> because <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] the the the <malay>budak macam</malay
<malay>tak [kan] nak</malay> share <malay>satu bilik perempuan lelaki</malay> unless they are willing to build (err) bunk bed [lah] which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed (err) we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed <malay>cuma</malay> share <malay>bilik saja</malay
so I thinking <malay>kalau</malay> if we move to my parents house the
(err
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least <malay>ada bilik</malay> and the house is bigger then <malay>dia pun dia pun cakap</malay> like [oh] ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
[ah] <malay>itu dia macam takut</malay> not really <malay>takut</malay> [lah] like you know too [dah] <malay>biasa tinggal kat</malay> east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding <malay>tapi</malay> due to budget [lah] [kan] (um
maybe consider to do two separate size [lah] so <malay>cuma</malay> no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be <malay>leceh</malay> you know because we have to <malay>tak</malay> [kan] I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
so it doesn't make sense [lah] to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
!aiya! ya just basically just a bit <malay>susah</malay> [lah
[ah] the one definite [lah
yes but then <malay>tak semestinya</malay> we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider <malay>macam</malay> like like what mother <malay>cakap</malay> is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take [lah] bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first [lah] it's either my side or his side [lah
[oh] that one I didn't check (err) because the only thing that I check was that if let's say (um) we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate <malay>ke tak</malay
[ah] because (err) I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong [lah] six months <malay>atau</malay> three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] s
<malay>entah</malay> but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then (um) one thing about the the is florida <malay>kasi</malay> ready ready like (err) provide the flooring (err) basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare [lah
(err) <malay>tapi</malay> I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply [ah] it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so (err) <malay>tak sangka</malay> that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan [oh] (uh) wedding <malay>macam mana</malay> (err) how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the <malay>saudara mara</malay> [dah] <malay>besar besar</malay> how about lik
the <malay>budak</malay> the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is <malay>satu</malay> famil
so that's why the the the budget is a concern [lah
(um
[oh] it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
[ah] okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part [eh] for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double <malay>ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year [dah] <malay>kena</malay> deposit you know o
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
!chey!
[ah] okay but then I mean ya [lah] whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows <malay>sekarang pun</malay> is about the same <malay>tapi</malay> we do have like thoughts abou
<malay>memang</malay> okay <malay>memang</malay> we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
<malay>kita buat kat bawah</malay> block ya let's say for my side [ah
I <malay>kita buat kat bawah</malay> block you have to consider that [oh] catering and decoration may not be under one (err) one company we may be separate and then (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one (err) price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like <malay>macam</malay> you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
<malay>mak andam</malay> all this separate lik
for me I think like [oh] because <malay>kita buat</malay> combine and it is a location that can provide a lot <malay>macam</malay> for the one at orchard righ
(err) they have catering they have decoration with including the (err) plumbing also and then (err) they include the door gift
and then (err) tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just and
and if you want <malay>kompang</malay> then that one is different thing [lah] then the only thing that I have to worry about is (um) the ride
(uh) the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because <malay>kalau boleh</malay> I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know [lah] my dad <malay>punya</malay> thinking i
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford [lah] if I cannot commit to tha
you know that budget right make it a small <malay>nikah</malay> and then just <malay>makan makan</malay> [lah] after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know [lah] my father got problem so and <malay>lagi pun</malay
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off [mah] so like (err) very proud you know finally you know somebody (err) my my child is getting married or whatever but the
!alah! they don't know the the cost to get tha
good wedding [ah] is really really great [lah] so <malay>macam entah</malay> jus
okay [ah] if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him [lah] because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the <malay>duit hantaran</malay> and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs (err) to ferry to each other to each side [lah] so at least <malay>kalau macam</malay> at one locatio
(err) there's no need for any vehicle [lah] I mean there's only just need one way [lah] just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
[ah] that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that [ah] want to get ready just go dow
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like <malay>kalau buat</malay> two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit [kan] <malay>susah</malay> and then <malay>kesian</malay> the <malay>mak andam kadang kadang</malay> I'm not thinking for myself [lah] I am thinking for other people so y
that's why [lah] is really really hard for me to think about this <malay>lagi lagi</malay> two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there [lah] from now [lah
I mean I get it [lah] you told me to work on it <malay>tapi</malay> the problem is I have been discussing like
parents [lah] all about these <malay>tapi</malay> I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
<malay>kita banyak</malay> discuss within each other its <malay>tapi entah</malay> [lah] when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then <malay>macam</malay
okay okay <malay>boleh</malay> okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum (uh) his mum <malay>atau</malay> she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least !alah! [dah] <malay>biasa</malay> makeup <malay>sendiri</malay> is best to you know <malay>biar orang kat orang</malay> makeup [kan] <malay>orang</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi pun</malay
burning hair to think of i
ya the <malay>mak andam dia punya</malay> at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already [lah] [eh] the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just <malay>tutup</malay> one eye [lah] for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and <malay>lagi pun</malay
I suggested to my mum [lah] like come [lah] to meet me and give me advice [lah
(uh) <malay>tapi kahwin sekarang</malay>
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic [kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity [kan] because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
<malay>itu pun</malay> okay no doubt her big plans changed [ah] but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the (um) th
planner is helping [lah] so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make <malay>bawah</malay> block [lah
but because now really very hard right so the (err) <malay>dia</malay> parents <malay>cakap</malay> okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels [lah
but then because is they have to top up more s
(uh) manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west [lah] so (uh) it's not a location that is suitable for wedding [lah] it's more to like education wis
[ah] so (err) they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so (um) no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
so her concern is that [eh] bento box <malay>mana cukup</malay> like is a malay wedding [tau] you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento <malay>macam</malay> is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that [lah] but then because of this [eh] (err) she had actually got enough as i
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
[ah] so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that (uh
became because of that also one good thing [lah] I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore (err
ya [lah] the week after the wedding [lah] she will do that means like I think mayb
within december [lah] she'll she'll do honeymoo
ya of course [lah] you too just want the <malay>nikah</malay> but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see [ah] <malay>lagi</malay> !alah! I think because the his mother also <malay>macam</malay
!alah! <malay>mak pak dia</malay> [dah] <malay>tua</malay> so he she's been trying to push him to get married [lah] so I don't know whether that means that [oh] just <malay>cepat cepat kahwin</malay> then [dah] or just want to make it a big even
because [lah] ya [lah] like you mention that I'm still considered an (uh) outside outsider [kan] so I mean <malay>kalau boleh</malay> I don't want to <malay>masuk campur</malay> [lah] whatever happens because it's not my family ye
<malay>tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana</malay> I mean <malay>kalau boleh</malay> I <malay>tak nak masuk campur</malay> bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what [ah] <malay>sebab ini pun</malay> ya at this time <malay>pun</malay> is good [lah] to get married <malay>cuma</malay
definitely [lah] now you [kan] confirm <malay>ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput</malay> and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean <malay>tak yah</malay> by choice [lah] but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if <malay>kata</malay> that (err) you want to invite a certain family member <malay>tapi sangat jauh</malay> actually like four hours is like already long [lah] [kan
<malay>kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput</malay> [kan] family <malay>jauh tu jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi tetap</malay> i
<malay>jauh</malay> in the sense of distance [lah] not is in terms of family tree so <malay>macam</malay> like there was one example that my friend she just got married like (uh) think two months ag
(err)she was apologising to [ah] <malay>semua</malay> like [ah] sorry ya <malay>tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak</malay> limit <malay>kat</malay> family [jer] then we all <malay>macam</malay> trying to reassure [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom [lah] I mean no issue what <malay>tapi</malay> ya <malay>tapi</malay> you all are like my like my friends and also <malay>macam</malay> I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam <malay>kalau boleh jangan lama lama</malay> [kan] don't delay right but then !alah! since they actually <malay>tuhan</malay> [dah] [dah] [tau] [eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind [lah] just get ready [lah] but (err) but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still <malay>kat rumah</malay> so limited to I think fifty person right <malay>termasuk</malay> her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like <malay>macam sedih</malay> because only family is there [ah] no friend so <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't know [lah] whether she still feels bad or not (uh) so she's been trying to like you come [lah] you come over to my house [lah] we will have lik
<malay>makan makan</malay> session or something but then of course due to schedule [lah] we cannot commit to certain times right y
it'll take about like a yea
because we are considered (err) <malay>sekarang</malay> first time righ
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know [lah] as usual pay me but then
ya like like okay [lah] you can like still had ya know <malay>tu</malay> I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also [lah] and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as [dah] <malay>bilang</malay> the parents then at least <malay>bila</malay> the both sides <malay>nak jumpa</malay> to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor <malay>yang</malay> for him is the <malay>duit hantaran</malay> actually until now I don't know the difference [oh] <malay>duit hantaran</malay> and <malay>mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's <malay>kalau macam untuk pasal</malay> wedding <malay>ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin</malay> that one is okay is i
and then for <malay>hantaran</malay> that one is considered lik
the groom side is giving a gift [lah] to the bride side is i
no no no not the <malay>barang hantaran</malay> but <malay>duit</malay
is it (err) [oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
cheque <malay>kosong</malay> [dah] <malay>melampau kot</malay> actually <malay>kalau</malay> let's sa
ya ya true dare to it y
maybe because of all these (uh) <malay>hantaran</malay> right I didn't actually [eh] one post <malay>kat</malay> Facebook (um) this (err) is like a page [lah] where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like <malay>macam</malay> those magazin
(err) so is there a magazine is through Facebook [lah] so this lady was cheated and (um) you know I jus
got married (um) in iBloom <malay>apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded [lah] drag until like <malay>baru baru juga</malay> [lah] and then (um) <malay>bagaimana tahu</malay> that the husband have a lot of <malay>hutang</malay
on top of the wedding [tau] because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because [dah] <malay>kenal lama</malay
<malay>sejak dulu</malay> so they they feel that okay [lah] since [dah] <malay>kenal lama</malay> [kan] and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage [ah] so maybe because it'
(err) <malay>macam</malay> it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that [kan] <malay>dorang kena ada hutang</malay> and then some more at the same time <malay>dorang nak dapat rumah</malay> which I don't know how [lah] so <malay>macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that <malay>dia macam</malay> stress like <malay>dia yang perlu kahwin tapi</malay> you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like (err) <malay>bukan apa ni bukan</malay
(err) loan <malay>daripada</malay> #along# [lah] its like those (err) school <malay>punya</malay> fees then <malay>dia minta</malay> bank loan for study he [eh] from what I read [leh] he the husband did investment so investment <malay>hilang duit</malay
so because <malay>dia tak boleh bayar</malay> I don't know [lah] all this thing I I don't understand [lah] so so she's like was asking <malay>pendapat</malay> [lah] like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so <malay>macam</malay> to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing <malay>sama</malay> [kan
[ah] against her or citing her so those <malay>yang</malay> against her right are like <malay>macam</malay> you kno
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
a lot of people <malay>macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia</malay> is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it [lah
<malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah] <malay>sayang ke kenal lama ke</malay> because I've had (err) friends [eh] who actually <malay>tunang</malay> urgent dating <malay>lama tunang</malay> about two years <malay>tapi</malay> ended they didn't managed to go throug
!wah! that means either like they are not ready financially <malay>atau</malay> just [dah] <malay>tak ada</malay> feeling <malay>lagi</malay> [lah] which <malay>saya macam pelik</malay> [eh] like you <malay>tahan</malay> for so long as in not say <malay>tahan</malay> [lah] dating for so long and the <malay>bila tunang</malay> you just give up [ah
ya [lah] a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because <malay>dia nak minta pendapat</malay> [eh
correct but then <malay>entah</malay> [lah] I feel like but then to me [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> going back to my friend [eh] (um) together for seven year
and then <malay>tunang</malay> for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got <malay>dugaan</malay> when they <malay>tunang tapi</malay> I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so <malay>apa beza</malay> ya when you <malay>sarung cincin</malay> then [oh] suddenly all the problems come up you kno
that's the thing [lah] and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
so <malay>macam</malay> that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that [oh] okay [ah] <malay>lepas ni</malay> (uh) <malay>nak fikirkan tinggal mana</malay> (uh) <malay>nak duduk mana</malay> but it's the fact that [oh] it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding [eh] is lik
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically [kan] you need to have okay [ah] for example like that that that particular location at orchard (err) it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that [oh] if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people [lah] ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course [lah] about thirty dollar plus plus and then [leh] I compared those tw
the <malay>lauk</malay> is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
(err) if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of <malay>lauk</malay
(uh) the other one is like the basic [lah] got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like <malay>kuih muih</malay> [ah] it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
they only offering two then drinks also is like [oh] asia's (err) hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company [lah] not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then (uh) there was one time (err) the package includes brida
he close bridal <malay>tahu</malay> then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else [oh] ya we can offer you th
<malay>kambing golek</malay> for about I think (uh) fifty people or the we'll issue (uh) like one thousand <malay>satay</malay> stick
you compared the price of each [eh] to a brida
(uh) as in (uh) part of the bridal right that means is (uh) <malay>tak salah</malay> it's two outfi
two outfit and then with <malay>mak andam</malay> everything he compared with the price of <malay>kambing</malay> and #satay
who would wanted [seh] and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person <malay>tahu</malay> and they even dare to say you know (err) because you know [lah] <malay>perangai kita</malay> after every wedding <malay>mesti</malay> will lik
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
this one <malay>tahu</malay> they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event [lah] we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding <malay>macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima</malay> and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe <malay>pukul enam</malay> ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me [oh
(um) we will only book one event for one da
so you want to stay as long as you want <malay>tak kisah</malay> do you know <malay>padahal</malay> both of them ar
<malay>kirakan</malay> muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies [lah] basically so <malay>macam</malay> it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better <malay>tapi</malay> the
