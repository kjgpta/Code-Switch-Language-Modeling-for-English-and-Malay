we thought of like (uh) let let's go get bath bombs
so everyone were very excited (uh) to <malay>mandi</malay>
(uh)
ya in the bath bombs
but
it was a mistake
<malay>sebab tandas tu besar</malay>
<malay>tandas tu besar</malay>

okay the <malay>tandas</malay> is the size of a <malay>punya</malay> flat (uh) the room the room size the ya this room size
yes so the <malay>pintu</malay> then after that
(um)
after that is the bathtub
(um) the toilet bowl
and then there's a glass door inside for the shower
so so the bath so so is the bathtub so the shower is actually facing the glass door the the glass door is actually facing the bathtub
so can you imagine when we were when
<malay>kita mandi kita rasa macam</malay>
<malay>orang tengah tengok</malay>

<malay>faham tak</malay> so
I was alone in the toilet they were all outside
ya but then none of us lasted more than ten minutes
cause we we we we sense we sense something we felt something I felt it too [lah] so I decided to okay I'm I'm not doing this you know I just like like whatever I'm just gonna just
waste the money [lah] I I don't don't care it's just like what
thirty
thirty bath bombs so
(uh) that okay that was the second night when we decided to (um) buy the bath bombs and
so we all slept outside okay so fast-forward
when we went home
that night okay when we went back to singapore
I told my mum and (uh) my grandma
so so we shared [lah] (uh) you know (uh) <malay>kita macam</malay> (uh) <malay>takut macam kita masuk kita masuk bilik kita rasa lain</malay>
so my so my grandma my my <malay>nenek</malay> asked [lah] (uh) <malay>apa yang lainnya</malay>
my my my <malay>kakak</malay> my <malay>kakak cakap</malay>
[ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
yes
so do you know so so you you know when people say the <malay>bilik berabuk</malay>
and it's a high floor what what do you think
right
so that's what been saying [a'ah] <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay>
[ah]
but
we didn't think much [lah] cause we were so tired we didn't want to bring it up and it make it very awkward for our for for all each other right
so okay <malay>bilik dia berabuk</malay> and then
I I can feel I can I think I said that I can feel that someone someone was staring at me (um) what I wanted I was using bath bomb then my sister also said ya she couldn't last for more than ten minutes she really wanted to quick quickly go out and then for some reason we actually felt something [lah]
so okay but none of us actually have third eyes
so <malay>kita</malay> so <malay>kita semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>diam</malay> [tau] <malay>kita semua tak</malay>
(um)
<malay>tak tak tak tak</malay>
<malay>tak tak</malay> share okay we didn't share with each other what happened so on the other side they also told they they told (uh) the same thing to <malay>dia punya</malay> to their to their family [lah]
so they also say so when we came together or during the family gathering then then we bring it up and say (um)
[eh] <malay>korang tak perasan ke bilik dia berabuk</malay>
ya
we only we only shared with okay technically we didn't share with each other we bring we we went back we we tell each other <malay>kita</malay> our own family members and then after that when my parents when my when my when my mum called her sister
when my mum called her sister then
they were like like <malay>makcik makcik makcik</malay> #kaypoh#
(mmhmm)
[eh] <malay>budak budak tu pun cakap</malay>
they all so they were like tell tell telling so
we didn't know [ah] my then my mum when when we came back from work [ah] then <malay>baru</malay> [ah]
my <malay>mak</malay> my mum said [ah] [eh] do you know that [ah] you know (um) they experienced (uh) whatever you all experience you know
then I'm like is it so we so so we so in the WhatsApp group we
so we in the WhatsApp group we said
you all got stories
and then they said ya I got ya ya we got
okay
let's meet let's meet at (um) let's meet at my <malay>umi</malay> house
so <malay>dekat rumah</malay> my <malay>umi</malay>
<malay>baru kita</malay> (uh) <malay>kongsi</malay> stories <malay>kongsi cerita</malay>
ya so and then they say okay first that's why that's why my cousin was so (um) <malay>macam</malay> very persistent (uh) to get
(uh) another bed
so that the <malay>kakak</malay> so that the sister can sleep no nobody is separated from each other
that's the whole reason
someone was supposed to sleep in the living room
yes
yes
yes
cause she actually had a history of like
(um) this this kind of thing [ah] ya so her instinct okay even though all of us
do not have third eye
(um) she is
more on her sense were much her instincts were much stronger so from the time she actually step in and she saw okay when we step in on the left it's actually (uh) on the left
it's a big mirror with (um) a shelf and actually that shelf is <malay>berabuk</malay> already but I didn't but for me <malay>berabuk</malay> is
(um)
for me <malay>berabuk</malay>
was the bed
was the mattress
I find it I'm trying to recall
okay so
okay for me it was the mattress
that was
(um) dusty
nothing else (um) was suspicious
but
to my cousins and my sister something else were
dusty
so we all see different things but overall the room was dusty
so overall [one] the room was dusty [lah]
<malay>bilik dia lain</malay>
<malay>sebab kita sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay>
<malay>sampai siang</malay>
okay technically we were like the late guests
so
I
think (uh) occupancy was
high
so they actually so they they gave us the highest floor
and okay the highest floor right okay the the the fact that the we got a high floor
we already at that point
we were like

<malay>ahli yang lain</malay> so what she was trying to say is that that hotel was known to be haunted where people actually killed themselves and know do [ah] they they hang themselves okay technically they kill themselves inside the hotel there were a lot of like scenarios in hotel so what the hotel did was
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>panggil</malay> (uh) <malay>ustaz</malay> buddha [ah] <malay>ahli-ahli ugama</malay>
<malay>untuk sembahyang</malay> [kan] the <malay>bilik</malay> to (uh) to <malay>sembahyang</malay> [kan] the hotel the blessed bless the hotel

so they did that (um)
so so the moment she know what that she (uh) quickly met WhatsApp in the group so we also Google [lah]
luckily it came out was in twenty fourteen and we were like
I went there last I went there
this year february just nice before the lockdown
no and technically okay
and okay this was
(uh)
<malay>ni kali kedua</malay>

technically it's not okay technically there were no living room [ah] during our time the suite the suite was different so there were no living room it's just (uh) king bed a platform a sofa bed a sofa so all of us
four five of us slept there then my parents at the (uh)
front room [lah]
so it was a different room but
maybe plus minus same size
so it were was that that was last two years with my family was last two years
this year january was with my cousins
[oh] only sixteen twenty
that (uh) definitely not more than thirty definitely not not even like
thirty
but it's a very famous hotel [seh]
speaking of <malay>orang kaya</malay>
<malay>kita tak ada jiran</malay>
[ah] okay <malay>kita</malay>
<malay>setahu kita kita takde jiran</malay>
<malay>tapi kita selalu dengar macam</malay> (uh) <malay>macam kita dengar benda</malay> [lah]
<malay>kita boleh dengar benda</malay>
<malay>tapi kita tahu kita takde jiran</malay>
okay <malay>bilik kita bilik hujung</malay>
corner corner
okay the the floor
okay the okay <malay>bilik</malay> the hotel is famous the hotel is very big
so the the the hotel very big right
(uh) the there were many sections
but we know that our area we don't have a neighbour
ya but we always hear like
(uh)
sound sound not not sounds being pushed we hear like foot we hear like (um) kids running like screaming and stuff like that
even though the
even though the door was actually far from the living room actually
we find it strange cause we said but we didn't even mention cause you know how <malay>orang orang tua cakap mulut jangan celupar bila kita dekat tempat tu</malay>
technically we we we just shut our mouth just in case we said something we we accidentally say something wrong
(uh) we couldn't be bothered [lah] cause
it's a big room and there were like five of us so our main main concern was to fit
all five of us in the room
and and and we do not want to we do not want to move move our things
<malay>leceh</malay> [seh]
okay but forty one
is was not the highest floor it was one of the highest I think it goes until fifty two
the top ten floors
<malay>kita tak kesah sebab kita malas nak</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>nak angkut barang-barang kita</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> okay <malay>kita dah bawa keluar semua tilam</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kat depan</malay>
so to put it back so so to put the mattress back and then we request for another room and then pack all pack all our things to the new room
like too much work [ah] we we we like (err) don't want [ah] we don't want to sign up for this kind of thing so we just like
everybody sleep in the living room
and just
stick to one another so technically we were like glue like stick to each other like a glue
ya so that was like
our experience in and we could have been to #krabi# if not cause of this COVID
[ah] it okay let me let me tell if this makes you feel better let me tell you that I'm going I'm definitely going to sleep in my sister's room tonight
we still when when we we <malay>kita</malay> share when <malay>kita kongsi</malay> story (uh) <malay>cerita ni dengan</malay> (um)
our other cousins
they were
like all five of us
can still feel the chill down our spine
yes
like three of us (uh)
three okay cause
I'm the scaredy cat kind right
I try not to pay attention to this kind of things but cause my cousins
were (uh)
saying it right
after we came back
it's like it makes me like it makes me think [lah]
[eh] ya
I I heard sound
you know I I heard noises I I heard I heard like kids
running that's why that
but to think of it
nobody goes down the emergency exit cause it's in the corner and it's a forty one floor why why why you want to go to the emergency exit
so the technically nobody would
run there and we were like in the corner it's like an L thing and we're like the we're like the horizontal [one]
so I was like and the before a long corridor
even though it's a very very famous and it's very convenient
the shopping mall is just down <malay>bawah</malay>
(err) given a choice I won't want to go back there
[ah]
but I've
but I'm okay honestly I will I glad that I experience it with my cousins
cause if I'm if I'm cannot experience it with my family my my mum who knows my mum will end up reading one one whole book of like
[ah] recite recital and
ya you told me about your <malay>kakak</malay>
ya but your <malay>kakak</malay> cause your your <malay>kakak dah tidur</malay>
