it's good for the eye
okay thanks okay
you want to start you say [ah]
how's your day
it's been like I started I <malay>pergi pasar tadi pagi</malay> after that
okay so was what happened okay I'm going to rant to you about our friend
may
okay so <malay>tadi</malay> [kan]
so <malay>tadi tadi</malay>
basically what happened was she's not happy with the
six weeks thing right
so yesterday [kan] she I told you she texted me she was like she's going to do something about it I'm like ya you should do something about it
so
today
#cheng san# go and message me <malay>cakap</malay>
[oh] miss not happy I'm like okay so miss not happy then I told her already [what] what's happening
yesterday right
then #cheng san# was like [oh] I think she wants to like
convince everybody I'm like ya I know that's what is happening
and then may was so extra he started he made a whole group called scheduling
it's quite it's quite annoying [ah] <malay>pasal macam</malay>
so that group is called scheduling
and she was busy talking about how she interviewed these people these people as in like five people two directors and three
and #ming gee# that's six people okay
and she's like [oh] some of them say they are open to it
(um) and some of them said they want six weeks and some of them
say [oh] they confirm don't want that three weeks I'm like if you have only six people out of thirty people that's not an enough like
enough like amount of
sample group [lah] if you were to compare with the
thing you know
so ya I'm just like
annoyed
but
I told her it's whatever [ah] <malay>kau boleh buat</malay> whatever you want to do [ah] <malay>kau punya pasal</malay> [ah] so
ever since then like okay I'll tell them that there's this like zoom meeting there will be a zoom meeting next week by the way
so
look out for that
I mean her guilt tripping thing is like a form of
guess loyalty like
you don't want to do it [oh] so you are going to be the cause of my downfall that kind of thing you know
which is so
her [lah] and it's
ya she does that
she can get very selfish very fast when it comes to
her work especially since when she's worth banking
and I find that
a lot of the times she never even bother to like work hard from the start
she procrastinates a lot which sometimes I get it because
we got our own issues and everything
but sometimes like
dump it on everybody else [ah] like
<malay>kau punya pasal</malay> [lah] you know
you got your own issues then
(ugh) okay whatever
so I just like did it bye
good luck
ya but I mean this is what happens
this is what happens when you like live in a right you cannot
control
hi we are failed students and
this is us everyday when we do thing
sub for school
where your <malay>malam</malay>
my mother is here <malay>ketawa</malay>
she won't stop
I'm just going to submit this time [ah]
then now she go
[oh] <malay>suji</malay> [eh] I ask [ah] <malay>dah tanya</malay> [eh]
I'll tell my mum you don't sell the <malay>suji</malay> first until
like you get the actual
cost and what size she want to sell cause she just take the picture
but then it's like this big and I'm like are you sure you want to sell <malay>suji</malay> that small
for like
a lot and then she's like I don't know
it's so funny [ah]
ya <malay>betul</malay>
[oh] she wants like the square one which I think is about that size
but we don't know how much to charge yet she's looking at like the market price but I told her to look at
cost price instead
yes
[eh]
do not off
(mm)
honestly an issue in [ah] <malay>kau tengok</malay> [ah] <malay>dah pukul satu pagi</malay>
unfair I think we should be guaranteed to have like a very quiet time at this
hour but
I guess not
it's quite crowded here and
kim #boon lay# [kan]
man it's just generally quiet [lah] also
I don't know [ah] cause that time [lor] <malay>malam</malay>
the only night shoot I did
I can remember well was #syaza's# #syaza's# shoot
but #syaza's# shoot jingle was there
#serangoon# but the landed houses
I forgot that cats are like nocturnal
I swear
!ow!
but ya I'm quite nervous about thesis
I did like I moved my to dos
to this new app called notion !wow!
so it's like a thing on youtube now right
the notion thing and I've been using it for awhile
<malay>tapi</malay> I haven't really like used it fully because circuit breaker
then I moved it all on notion
and now I'm like a bit overwhelmed when I see my list
[ah] I don't know [lah] it's like I know that my mock is
progressing much faster than a lot of groups
but I cannot help but still feel very insecure about
my old place
ya
and I don't know how the double producers are going to like handle it
considering I'm already struggling with one (uh huh)
it is supposed to be simpler
I got nothing to say [ah]
<malay>bila kita</malay> jewel [ah]
we we go out like three times a year
apart from school to be fair we we meet like everyday [lah] in school so ya
[ah] ya
once every twice a month
<malay>apa kau cakap</malay>
<malay>keluar</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>itu enam kali</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu enam kali apa</malay>
<malay>dua bulan sekali</malay>
okay [lah]
ya
but it's it's alright
and it's I actually enjoy this song called favourite nightmare by blanks
it's blanks like
blank page ya
I don't know it's very groovy
<malay>lepas ni</malay> so <malay>sekarang tak boleh</malay> okay
[eh] but okay so
there was like a dilemma you know that I like songs right
and then right you know the new song dynamite
so the new song dynamite came out right
and I cannot figure I like it or hate it
because it's super catchy and I can remember like the words
not all also [lah] cause <malay>dia orang cakap macam terbelit-belit</malay> also still
so <malay>tak faham pun</malay> but
<malay>apa</malay>
I feel like
it's so full of autotune these days
in the song itself like it's a trend to like
<malay>kasih dengar</malay> the autotune
and I'm like
(mm) I don't know how to feel about it
but ya
it's still fun the videos kind of cool they shot in a studio and the build the whole like
they have this like scene and they built the whole set in a studio and it was super big
(err) my I think the only like studio that can fit that is neapolis <malay>atau</malay> infinite [eh] studios I don't know
but it was quite cool [lah]
super big and it's like an actual like
door that you can like slam
ya so the walls even though it's fake it's like
strong
good job K pop
like the hotel #del luna#
okay
time for us to learn
how were
ya man like you know you know about that boy I think like ten years ago he he's from right
(mm)
this malay boy and he graduated and he didn't know what to do so he learned he studied korean language
and he went to korea without like any money or anything so <malay>macam</malay>
no thoughts head empty just went there and hope for the best
and now he's like a translator for like so many K pop groups
because he can speak a lot of languages
and he <malay>tak</malay> even go for like classes to <malay>belajar</malay> you know he just like
self study the whole thing
so good job man
ya I think it's quite cool [lah]
I don't know
I cannot remember someone shared like that article to me
but it was like a long time ago but his lawyer always tie him ahead I'm like !huh!
maybe I should do that !duh! I will never do that
my social anxiety will be like [ho]
ya
but
it was an option [ah]
if we go korea but I don't think we will be able to handle <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
work ethic
considering
we are dying now
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay
cause your your your heated my my I start first [eh] one for one [eh]
I don't know I always thought one for one was kind of dumb
because
if you <malay>ikut macam</malay> the business like module
you know that the cost is much lower
than you buy half the cost you know they have to do it like at least like what
third three hundred percent [kan] to get like a proper
profit margin or something
so I usually don't buy one for one unless it's like food
because
the
ya the food <malay>punya</malay>
satisfaction of the heart costs
a lot for me
compared to any material things ya
okay but ya I usually don't buy one for one and I can't remember anything that was
quite bad other than maybe like
I always buy things like notebooks for one for one
<malay>itu</malay> [jer]
okay you I know it's heated
depends I guess
just appalling ya
!huh!
are you sure are you sure
but only did that right when they first opened at century square
they had the it wasn't one one exactly but it was
<malay>macam</malay> you buy one and the second glasses you get fifty percent off
that was the deal that they had
but I don't know they have a good reputation [kan] a lot of these like youngsters like to buy owndays nowadays
try off the shelf as in what just
<malay>ambil</malay> and try
it's like feeding our insecurities computer act one day it's like [oh] you don't want to talk to people
here you go you know just come in
and like try on this bunch of specs you know
and then I don't know whether you try on or not so now like fifty people come and try on this specs in one day
that's kind of nasty
with our pandemic and everything
now I know they closed down the
<malay>tak bagi</malay> like anybody just <malay>masuk tahu</malay> so you have to like
queue to <malay>masuk</malay>
owndays
but still right if people are going to try out the specs it's a bit like
nasty [ah]
I have nothing to say about that [ah]
that one
it's actually up to like
personal responsibility and like social responsibility [kan]
it's like
you cannot compromise one or the other especially when we're talking about pandemics because
the virus is not going to choose you based on
whether
you are you are all by yourself or with other people you know they're going to choose you based on whether you are living or not [kan]
it's just like my issue with the the way they
relay the message of this like pandemic thing like how many people
<malay>sakit</malay> everything they keep saying they keep separating
migrant workers and community cases like as if
<malay>satu</malay> is one species another one is another species
like it's the same thing both is humans
if there's fifteen migrant worker <malay>yang kena</malay>
that fifteen migrant workers right the moment they go out right
they are exposed to <malay>tak akan</malay> migrant workers [jer] [kan]
obviously with everybody [what] with the
people that can be under community cases
just like
weird and another thing also was that
everyday <malay>macam</malay> add one two people like in the community cases [kan]
but my friends
and family members who are working on hospital are saying otherwise
so that's like another conspiracy that's like covering up
!aiya! it's so
shady
but we know that [lah]
but
but just what like
(mm) but that's what like breaks your breaks your trust
in the government and in the media right which is so sad
like I remember going to thinking like !wah! I'm going to be a journalist
you know I'm going to tell like
stories about the community and spread the truth
<malay>macam</malay> some kind of investigative like journalist <malay>gitu</malay>
but even the well known investigative journalists are doing it for the headlines let's be honest
just for the clout right so it's so sad [lah] like
we we have to rely on random people on the internet to like get real information
which at the same time people are making use of to like spread
false information
and then we all will <malay>mati</malay> together
nice that will be such a good like ending line but
we are only halfway through
we're not halfway through
nice
and we have to do more than what we see also because
(mm) just be honest
it's not just writing and radio it's the whole thing
another set of like nut cases
everywhere !aiya! it's just
I don't know <malay>macam</malay> as we grow older I guess
it's not that your like childhood dies it's more of like you start realising
what the world is then we get <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] okay this is how I'm supposed to be like tired and depressed everyday
but it's so sad that that's the standard
especially when people are like
<malay>aku lagi penat daripada kau</malay> you know I did more things than you yesterday and I'm like
is this a competition like are you trying to say invalidate my
tiredness
I just want to say I'm tired okay cause that's how I feel I don't want you to feel
insecure for the way I'm talking to you
but now it feels like a competition because you're like [oh] I'm more tired than you
so I'm supposed to like help you
feel better about yourself
I don't know why but ya
I don't know it's just dumb people are dumb
I agree I was people
but that's not true
ya <malay>pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>penat</malay>
I don't know [lah]
it's similar I think
it's human nature
that's true
I started
like looking into investing my money
honestly like watch stuff how people like really become millionaires
and they're able to like retire
at what twenty six
cause I don't know if I can do this anymore film <malay>penat</malay> [sia]
but it's very interesting like
they earn like a lot of money
but some of them I met I'm like I don't know how you all going to like be able to sustain that
you know what I mean because you're playing with stocks
which is like playing with
our economy going up down up down up down it's so fun like you know
(mm)
but that's how people grow their money right
investment
but there's still like that's still a grey area right
because I mean
the reason why gambling is like not allowed is because
there's this <malay>macam</malay>
addiction that you can
get stuck to it right
but do people like get addicted to stocks
to the point that they have no money
you know
just like my
ya
but you know what I mean
cause if you think of it that way and it depends on which <malay>mazhab</malay> you're looking at also
<malay>pasal</malay> if you're talking about
like <malay>kita punya mazhab memang</malay> we're not supposed to try gambling or anything
but we have no firstly we don't know whether stocks with gambling is like gambling
but no one is able to like
explain it
fully
so I'm going to keep my options open
there's other <malay>mazhab</malay> that's like
if you don't go off the deep end
it's fine
so
!yay! we love grey areas
!aiya! and then some more with this globalized version of the world right
everything's like merging right
like this idea of <malay>mazhab</malay> is it going to be valid in like fifty years if we're all still here
you know
that's like my question because the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing came about because of
like
different cultures and everything and it is to help the people be able to like
practise the religion without
<malay>macam</malay> concerns [lah]
you know and to fit the lifestyle
time how much lifestyles merge right
in like fifty years right
then is the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing going to change or what
because this is
islamic law [kan] but it's not like
a set in stone thing cause the <malay>mazhab</malay> thing was never like set in stone
until the scholars were like (hmm)
we got to do something about this you know
so more like the scholars in fifty years be like (hmm) we got to do something about this
you know and help the people cause people are going to move you know
like if a singaporean girl goes to like
I don't know the western countries
you know
she's going to bring her culture there
people there might adopt our <malay>mazhab punya</malay> practices
she will be adopting other <malay>mazhab</malay> practices and when she comes back here
then it's like (hmm) you know
culture changes also so it's like (ugh)
just
like I don't know I always thought about that I'm like
it's still going to change like
I think if you ask people people will be like it's not going to change [ah] but
I'm saying okay
like if you look at the history of how this was made then
it only makes sense that we should be moving with the times
cause at the end like the source of the religion is not about the law but like
just about <malay>sembah</malay> this one <malay>tuhan</malay>
and believing in our prophets our <malay>rukun iman</malay> and <malay>rukun islam</malay>
and not
whether
touching a dog is <malay>haram</malay> so ya that's like my
thoughts of this so deep
<malay>macam</malay> over
moved a circle
really [ah] shit
sorry
ya it's just a
it's a general discussion
it's about globalization
but I love tiktok
[eh] I spend a lot of my day talking (err) like watching tiktok
I don't know if you can tell
sometimes (err) sometimes I never notice then [oh] marina is like can you stop then I'm like why
and then she's like do you know how many sent I'm like no I just go
ya I forced her
I told her I wanted to send you stuff but
then you're not even on it so how am I supposed to send it to you I don't want to download everything I said that then she's like I'm not going to be on tiktok but then the next day she's on tiktok
looks like I got it
I made sofia go on tiktok also
she was shitting on her friends in school
to be fair <malay>kasihan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia dia macam</malay>
sec one <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> COVID <malay>terus tak ada</malay> friends you know she don't have proper friends in school
so she was shitting on her friends she was like
[oh] all these tiktok girls that's all they know tiktok then I'm like it's the same with you [what] all you know is anime
you know you cannot talk about anything else why don't you try and like
learn more about what they like so you can
you know be friends with them [lah] and then slowly
they will also learn to be friends with you you make their first move I said that
then she's like I will never do it
then my cousin did it
and now she's on tiktok also
it's just like okay
(mm)
that's a lie you send me stuff
okay sure
did you read about the the tinder algorithm
I didn't know they had like a
ya so apparently
in two thousand fifteen like someone exposed tinder's algorithm
so like when you first join tinder
like the algorithm gives you like a point system of how attractive you are
ya so if you are like like the more people like you the higher your
attractiveness level will be
but if the person who rejected you has like a lower
attractive level than you then you would automatically go down
because someone lower was like you you ugly you know and then if someone like more attractive than you likes you
then
your attractive level will also go up and that was the algorithm
few years ago
and last year they just changed it into like they said it was
a secret
but
everybody knows it's very similar
it's so shady like
!wah! I don't know man
are you saying me and #jufri# have the same face
attractiveness level
!eww!
do I look like that
so I already quit
so so in a few weeks because I've been super busy
and I got no time to even look anymore and I feel bad
because
all these people are like waiting for my reply and I'm like (err) so I just deleted
the scariest part is when
cause on on the app [kan] I I
at first I put my name
[kan] like my whole name I'm #nabilah#
after that
after that people could find me online you know
on like instagram and that was so scary I was like
this boy
just like me
and then I haven't even matched with him yet
and he already found me on instagram
luckily my instagram is private [lah] and then got nothing
also cause I don't post but
it was just scary I was like !whoa! people will like can find me anywhere
someone's going to find my like my baby photos then I'll be like
go do something with it you know
ya but the weirdest guy was still the guy that
who asked me for my instagram then followed all my friends
!ee! that's so disgusting
what a weird guy
(ugh)
(oo) I have that family member
you know that family member I don't know if I told you about him but he got married already [lah] to one of my mum's cousins
so basically he became with one of my he became friends with one of my mum's cousins
in secondary school so he started like
clinging onto the family
this is like there is a goal <malay>punya cerita</malay> after that
in that ten years span right
like he tried to get with that first girl that he was friends with
and then he went to all the cousins around the same age
and he was clinging to one of them at different points of time
then in the end there was this other girl
the girl who he got married to
and she had this other boyfriend and the boyfriend she was together for like five years <malay>tahu</malay>
so that's like
it's very long right I cannot five years and they and she was like dying to get married to him
but he wanted to study overseas which is understandable [lah] because when they got together they were super young
he went to study overseas then she got angry then they broke up
<malay>habis</malay>
the whole family was like [oh] <malay>dia dia minum arak dia pergi</malay>
<malay>apa dia makan</malay> drugs <malay>semua</malay> that kind of thing you know and then when we met him I was like he was crying
he was like
very sad about the whole how it went down
and then he got married to this bitch I'm like
[ah] you <malay>tak tak ada</malay> choice <malay>lain ke apa</malay> like
!ee! and the guy is not even that handsome he's just
he's ugly [lah] actually he's worse than #jufri#
ya
I think they lazy
it was so obvious
that's the worst part
you know I <malay>macam</malay>
like
are you okay
you know and then
(uh) but his
he's weird [lah]
I don't know I've never really liked him at one point he was the singer of the family then I'm like I didn't know he was family
cause I see him like twice a year like
it's just funny [lah] ya
it's weird there was this other guy
that I knew so he got married to this indonesian lady
they had three kids and then broke up cause the indonesian lady was a bit like a wild child [lah]
after that he he wasn't together with anybody for like a good ten years
then he started trying to get with one of the maids
one of our indonesian maids
that lady was <malay>cantik</malay> [lah] and she was with us for three years
but it was like damn disgusting
like <malay>kau tak ada perempuan lain ke apa</malay> that you want to go for this maid who doesn't want you back
you know and then then you know then that maid didn't want him the maid was like !eww! like that's disgusting
after that
he tried to get with this other maid and that is his own maid
and I'm like
I know it's kind of disgusting but luckily the other maid was like
!eww! no and then she got married to some other guy
indonesian much more handsome and fits her
cause she's very pretty
and this guy is like old the [ah] the
guy who wanted to go with her in the first place
I'm like <malay>kau dah tua</malay> stop it [lah]
ya the other maid is only like four years older than us
bro he's like double her age
crazy
indonesian girls
it's a thing you know it's crazy
[oh] my god

I thought it was only it goes on with like
white man movie that has that kind of kink for like asian girls
<malay>tak tahu</malay> asian <malay>pun boleh suka</malay> asian asian girls
it is funny [ah]
(mm)
I think he
he's crazy [ah]
[oh] my god that's that's like the the kind of guys that I will like shut down and not talk to after that you know
that kind of guys will be like [oh] <malay>nanti kita dah kahwin boleh masakkan</malay> I [lah]
<malay>masakkan</malay> I like some <malay>sambal goreng</malay> or something like that then I'm like !huh!
you think I <malay>kahwin ni mesti nak masak sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>kau kelakar ke apa</malay> you know
it's damn stupid
ya
I don't know
(mm)
it should swing that way
but I like male male chefs though male chefs are like
pretty cool so far all the male chefs I talk to are like
I will cook for you then I'm like that's right
it's like the first kind of the first group the one of the only groups of people
who will be like I will do something for you instead of you do something for me you know then I'm like [oh]
that's a good change
but I don't know
ya
[oh] my god when you don't have passion
gone
that's the worst kind
it's like I I I [ah] ya
it's like I get it [lah] okay like not everybody can have like a
passion passion you know
but I think you would have like some kind of outlook how your life would turn out in like
five years or something
or at least like ten years
like how you want it to look like
but no they just like [oh] I just
do like part time and
nothing much then I'm like [oh]
nice I don't know how to go on from there you know
it's funny
(mm)
<malay>banyak menganggur</malay>
like I'm sorry
I'm sorry that your insecurities are acting up because
I got to where I am
like I'm not saying you never worked hard but I worked for what I am and you know (ugh)
now now sometimes also I'm like
I don't know I find myself like
downgrading myself
just to fit a guy's standard
which is so sad
you know like especially if I really like the person
because of whatever
trivial
thing
which I obviously don't like them anymore
they'll be like
the I'll be like [oh] [ah] [lah] I degree <malay>tapi</malay> film [jer] film [jer] you know that kind of thing
like it's arts school it's nothing special
it's arts school okay it's so special
(mm) (uh) you're doing something so
cool and then you have to tell this guy it's not that cool
just to make him feel better about himself
about himself
!aiya! and you feel shitty about yourself I don't know I hate people
maybe I should just die alone
good for you good for everyone I don't know
uneasy
<malay>kau</malay> thanks man
that is just not my style
!aiya! my worst match just for ego boost [lah] lately only when I sad
then there's like the the
monthly cycle of like your emotions right so they always talk about specifically
but but they never tell me is that it goes on for a whole month
the cycle so sometimes it dips back down and the moment it dips back down right
it's the utmost match swiping
with that one photo of myself which I kind of like
ya like this is what you think of me
I don't look like that in real life (mm)
it's quite funny [ah]
there was a guy who asked what what was my weight
then I'm like I don't know if I should
tell you
because you're obviously not
here for me but more of how I look
and he's very curious because I didn't put like a full
like length photo
which you know
from my face sometimes you cannot tell now can tell [lah] then back then cannot tell
that's so funny then I was like if I tell you
what are you going to do
if I tell you I'm like hundred and twenty kilos what are you going to do
and then he was like
(err)
I don't know I think I will still talk to you [oh] you think
then he he left me after I said I was sixty
if you know I'm not sixty obviously
[ah] that's quite funny
I mean
(mm)
actually I'm the same [lah]
but I short lady [ah] so good for me
(mm)
I'd feel iffy about it [lah] but I I'll still talk you
you know I'm like I'm [eh] I'm short right
I'm let's be honest I'm short so I I always thought that
so the guy that I will be it will be a higher chance for me to get a taller guy
cause still all of the
okay the that one time I actually went out with that guy
he's too thin
that bitch like okay he said he was
taller
and I used the you know the calculator app
to see how much taller they did show me the actual science
cause I was like I don't believe him he looks damn small that's what I said
and he was small and
and I bet he was like !huh!
and I couldn't hide my my discomfort he was small
okay I'm not thin you know
I'm a big girl and so short he is small and thin
and I'm just like okay
you know I almost paid for ticket right for the movie ticket
because he didn't want to
pay at first
then I I just like he was like nevermind I will pay I guess
and then
he look at me he look I look at him then he like
okay I'll I'll pay like half I'm like okay I mean I thought you're going to pay for your own ticket [lah] bitch
cause I think you should be paying for the ticket
I didn't know that we had to discuss this we don't know each other so !aduh! it's quite funny
I didn't know it was a thing that girls paid for the ticket
I have nothing to say
maybe that was his experience
compensating for his lack of
height

he was damn smart though the way he took his photos
it was all from the bottom up
I was like
this is like a technique I will use I guess in the future
!aiya!
I lazy [ah]

higher angle [eh]
is it I don't know
I don't have people to take for me like nice photos and I I cannot like pose also
so I feel like the nicest photos of myself are like when I never even realise someone's taking a photo of me
because
I'm not
insecure
[oh]
that's my only photo that I use for until today because I don't have other photos
it's so sad (ugh)
