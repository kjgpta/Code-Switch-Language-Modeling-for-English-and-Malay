if that day right I already start (uh) applying for jobs on this (uh)
fast job app online then a few of the jobs [ah] like very interesting
<malay>dia macam</malay> [ah] there's one application that I tried is [ah] mystery shopper
have you ever tried that before
but (uh) because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
so then they pay you upfront <malay>ke</malay> or they
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will (uh) record and then they will see then they will pay
(mm)
(mm) but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
(mm)
[ah]
so basically you just have to rate the (uh) display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
[oh] my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy #paiseh# right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come [lah] it's just that they don't know who only right
[oh] my god
but imagine [ah] if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then [ah] another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the (um) it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
that means doing the pharmacy <malay>punya</malay> side [lah] but the problem is I have to
be to commit long term because I was telling them
I can only work until december but then <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that (uh) she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company [lah] but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya [lah] anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good [lah] it's three times a week only
(mm) permanent part time but they need it (uh) long term
(uh) shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
(mm) <malay>tapi dekat</malay> jems <malay>kau</malay>
is so it's quite convenient [what] it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
(mm)
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
ya I can actually <malay>kerja dekat</malay> (uh) <malay>sana</malay> [kan] if they can <malay>ini</malay> but then too bad
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already [mah]
that's why then another one I tried is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
(uh) the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
but that one is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> that one <malay>pun</malay> (uh) <malay>ada</malay> shift [ah] seven to
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff [lah]
(mm) (mm)
so just anyway just send [lah] just see how
but some of them [ah] don't even bother to reply
even (uh) temperature taking also they ask you to <malay>apa ni</malay> they will ask you to commit for at least
one six months [ah] six months to one year you know
and then (uh) they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose (uh) the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar [eh]
the one
<malay>tapi</malay> dormitories is very risky because
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that (err) also I think it's mondays to
[eh] it's alternate days [eh]
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
no because sometimes it's up to the <malay>apa tu</malay> management to
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week [ah]
actually they will give us (uh) every end of the month for the following month
<malay>tapi nanti dia</malay> last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully <malay>tak ada</malay> change
<malay>tapi kalau ada</malay> change then <malay>susah</malay> [lah] how am I going to call the <malay>ini</malay> [kan] the other job
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
[ah] rather than your part time job
correct that's why I think my colleague [kan] <malay>dia tak nak</malay> she doesn't want to do this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit [lah] and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
ya she requested for a full time <malay>tapi bagus kau dia punya</malay> because of
the qualification [lah] I think
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> because of <malay>dia punya</malay> qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's <malay>dia dia pun</malay> I think on work pass [eh]
(mm) because we cannot my current employer <malay>dia cakap</malay> if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal [lah] but so just log in <malay>apa</malay>
then my company say cannot because (uh) according to the rule you cannot do that [lah] if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
it will I think there's some law thingy [ah] and then <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] all these (uh)
passes holder like because what they are thinking is <malay>dia orang nak</malay> save on rental
[ah] then down there <malay>tak ada</malay> imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
so basically [ah] you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard (uh) my ex company
some of the pinoys [ah] they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
rent
<malay>tak tahu tapi kau tahu si apa tu kawan aku dulu yang si azman tu</malay>
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
because <malay>dia cakap</malay> that time [kan] [ah] during the COVID period then all these malaysian <malay>tak boleh balik</malay>
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
the father passed away a few years back [lah] so he staying the whole house alone and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] he advertise on gumtree (um)
<malay>apa ni dia cakap ada</malay> all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
so these (uh) factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra (uh) I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms [eh] and then I think there's (uh) three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people [lah]
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
with aircon and with (uh) that's it <malay>tak keluar pun</malay> and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas <malay>si azman ni pula</malay> (uh) <malay>dia kerja</malay>
day time he's at home he's working remotely [lah]
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself <malay>tak kecoh-kecoh</malay> you know
and
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how <malay>dia cakap</malay> cooking because all male
so he said (uh) sometimes they #dabao# then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part [lah]
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean [lah] then I'm like [eh] but you are using the toilet also [eh]
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent [eh]
(uh) I think five room also [ah] <malay>dekat</malay> woodlands
good money right actually
<malay>tu dia cakap</malay> (uh) because his pay was (uh) cut I think about thirty percent [eh] thirty
thirty percent <malay>ke</malay> forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he <malay>kena</malay> cut
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
but I guess it's okay [lah] because he's a guy <malay>abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik</malay> unlike <malay>macam perempuan</malay> [kan] <malay>suka keluar</malay>
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also [lah]
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit [ah] that time he mentioned
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle [lah] <malay>macam ada</malay> job <malay>ada</malay> job <malay>tak ada</malay> job <malay>tak ada</malay> job anyway I have extra income
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent [lah] you cannot (um) anyhow spend
<malay>tak boleh</malay> order <malay>tak boleh keluar makan</malay> I mean like once in a while
that's why
ya
so that's why then what about your side your company okay <malay>tak</malay>
maybe have [lah] because (um) they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and (um) I think flights also not regular so you have to
those who are urgently need to <malay>balik kampung</malay> or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
they have to go means they have to go [lah] I guess but then
ya [lah] like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the (uh) advertisement right or the job (uh) post on link in linkedin
are mostly <malay>macam</malay> like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
<malay>lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya</malay> resume <malay>apa semua</malay> then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency [lah]
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best [lor]
but then six thousand [eh]
I didn't know that (uh) all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K [ah] I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks [ah] sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
ya I guess <malay>tapi</malay> ten K [eh]
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure [ah] when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo [ah] is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental [ah] can
give her like four five K per month [eh]
because I have friends who married #ang moh# right so expat [ah]
she said she rented one condo <malay>dekat</malay> (uh) harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month [ah] you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already [ah]
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses [lah] I mean like (um)
as male bosses are okay
<malay>tapi bila</malay> sometimes [ah] when it comes to their private travel [ah] !wah! then the the wife can be bossy
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
that's why sometimes I hear complain from [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) the husband is paying [what] why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
[ah] I also got one experience because <malay>apa ni dia punya</malay> secretary <malay>punya</malay> boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then [ah] (uh) every year they have this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> trip home trip [lah] so call home leave
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves (um) so if they don't use and then just <malay>rugi</malay> [lah] it's like forfeited
so what the they did is they always [ah] book first book a travel first
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> along the way there will be changes of course
then got one time [ah] suddenly the the secretary call me and say [eh] how come my boss [ah] the krisflyer point is (um)
(uh) <malay>apa ni kenapa</malay> deduct [eh] I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) did he upgrade or any he asked me to check <malay>dia kata bila</malay> krisflyer actually deduct <malay>salah</malay> or what
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this (uh) relocation company
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything (uh) we didn't do any claim [lah] check <malay>punya</malay> check <malay>rupanya</malay> wife <malay>dia</malay>
the wife redeem (uh) free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part [ah] they didn't even (uh) say anything to me you know
then after that (uh) until I ask again [ah]
<malay>aku tanya dia</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> so the
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also #paiseh# [ah] I said [oh] ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the (uh) points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim [lor]
and never even bother to tell him
ya funny right can you imagine he <malay>sekali</malay> [ah] he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what <malay>sekali</malay> [ah] the
<malay>dia punya</malay> wife claim everything #siao#
ya
[ah] every time like that <malay>nanti karang</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah]
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
ya because the fare <malay>pun</malay> if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only (uh) get like fifty percent of the mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that (uh) got no rule [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
very flexible [one] [ah] that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
yes <malay>lepas tu</malay> the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes <malay>dia bising</malay>
I always get like you see [lah] you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
<malay>susah</malay> [seh] but you never know what sometimes [ah] last minute changes or last minute <malay>nak kena pergi sana pergi sini</malay>
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't <malay>ini</malay>
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket [ah] you must tell them this one [ah] if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
remember that time <malay>yang kau punya si</malay> ex
then in the end what happen
<malay>terbalik</malay> right
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay [lah] not that much [ah]
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
!aiya! for actually for them [ah] definitely they want to they will <malay>apa ni</malay> push push to somebody [what]
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot [lah] because this is obviously your mistake
for us [ah] the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault [lah] because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright [what] how can we just you know
book <malay>lepas tu tak</malay> check and then just give
but it's actually very scary [ah] especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
<malay>baru dia cakap</malay> don't don't repeat the same mistake
<malay>ni apa</malay> flight actually you take
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
no I think it's expensive <malay>pasal</malay> [ah] it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
but he's from which airport
it's either #ho chin minh# or #hanoi#
actually #ho chin minh# <malay>ada banyak</malay> flight <malay>apa</malay> vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
so in the end I think you must have booked him on [lah] because only these two fly direct [what]
other than that <malay>ada</malay> budget airlines
ya
ya [lah] very scary especially the hotel bit
of course it's not funny [lah] you crazy <malay>macam</malay> I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
<malay>tak</malay> messy <malay>sangat pasal</malay> [kan] if you were to do like that [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like
you do this batch I do this batch [ah] it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
<malay>macam</malay> departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date [tau] <malay>dia bukan macam</malay>
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling [ah] it's very messy so you have to see <malay>macam</malay>
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date [lah] so at least [eh]
<malay>aku cuma ambil yang</malay> departure on the saturday
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means [ah] the person that you cock up is your team or
<malay>tak pasal</malay> the different website got different allotment why sometimes [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] agoda they got ten ten room
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked <malay>tapi bila</malay> you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate [ah]
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already [what]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] because okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say it's individual booking
you can always book (um) through
all these third party from the website [lah] no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes [ah] hotel themselves even though they give (uh) they sell their rooms to all these third party
I'm sure they have their own <malay>bilik</malay> [tau]
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in [what]
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course [lah] right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people [ah]
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least [ah] you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one [ah] family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because (uh) booking from third party [ah] I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday (uh) sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
<malay>nanti</malay> they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you <malay>tak</malay> from this company this company [ah] so it's easier
then how
I think it's china #hong kong# <malay>tak payah</malay> visa
but #hong kong# passport don't need visa [what]
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> china visa [ah]
[ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival [lah] always (uh) tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
[ah] you can still it depends [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> if they are travelling around asia pac [ah] you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
<malay>cuma kalau dia</malay> declare as tourists then they don't need
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you [lah]
but luckily <malay>tak payah</malay> I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
otherwise you will waste one day
<malay>aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia</malay> jump
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
it's just the you know <malay>dia punya</malay> screw <malay>dia terpleot</malay>
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover <malay>tapi</malay>
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes [ah] you just
can you imagine [ah] if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then [ah] I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
the company is like neither here nor there <malay>kalau kau</malay> apply for a job and let's say you get a job
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company (uh) based right
[oh]
<malay>susah</malay> [lah]
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin <malay>punya tu</malay> is under recruitment agency no harm just go [lah] anyway they just want to collect data [what]
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity [ah] anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it !duh!
ya just put out your resume first [ah]
(mm)
