o
okay [lah] okay I take note [oh] ya by the way then that time (uh) besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix (uh) what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
[oh] how many season <malay>mampus</malay> okay no thanks
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
[oh] ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see (uh) who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated (uh) hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and #raquel# finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my [ah] two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or
okay maybe I check that out [ah] but are you buying anything
air fryer <malay>buat apa nak</malay> air fryer <malay>kita takde ke</malay>

[ah] <malay>biar</malay> [lah] <malay>asal dia orang dua bahagia</malay> [lah]
[oh] serious [ah] are you buying
[oh] ya then (uh) #alesya# belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
!huh! but #azam# isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay [lah] if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase [ah]
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what [oh]
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it [lah] I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true [lah] degree is important I'll think about it [lah]
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just (uh) rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree (uh) sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in (uh) in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored [lah]
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company [ah] I mean
(uh) usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he (uh) when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with (uh) a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
(uh) he is under maintenance side and technician (uh) if I'm not wrong (uh) under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know [lah]
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know [lah] I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as (uh) prison warden ya (uh) he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
(uh) the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace (uh) at just besides #changi# prison so
in a way beneficial for him [lah] don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place [ah] for him
if I'm not wrong [ah]
[oh] (uh) he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent (uh) not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they (uh) they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then (uh) they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong [lah]
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years [ah] that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then (uh) she told me about the benefit (uh) when she just join full time they even (uh) give you (uh) benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even (uh)
another friend of mine (uh) she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new #khatib# home ya she told me about it
they also provide (err) you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct [lah] but and all ya
(err) adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of (uh) fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company [eh] not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that (err)
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya [lah] just help me out if I need
fourth december he
(uh) fourth december [ha]
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
(uh) she told me (err) what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because (uh) she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated [oh] she also she also has degree by the way
(uh) chemical chemical science meaning I think (err)
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya (uh) right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while [lah] ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like #jurong# island that kind of thing that share more of like
(uh) exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay [lah] anyway
my bike what what you mean
(mm) my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
[ah] that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
(uh) tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation [oh] my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
[a'ah] (uh) engineering informatics yes <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> is more on
(uh) engineer <malay>punya</malay> side more on not say maintenance <malay>dia punya</malay> more on testings
his job is basically [ah] what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now [ah] ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one (uh) ya <malay>yang</malay> test <malay>setakat masuk</malay> <malay>setakat duduk</malay> from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad [lah] the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like <malay>abang azhar</malay> on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well [ah] he he works at <malay>dia kerja kat</malay> #jurong# (uh) water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level (uh) when it rises when it lowers (err) which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview (uh) every (uh) mostly entire of singapore like know the <malay>longkang</malay> and stuff like that
okay [lah] not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause <malay>dia masih dia orang</malay> sponsor <malay>dia orang</malay> sponsor <malay>dia sambung belajar</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>dia tengah ambil</malay> part time diploma
ya <malay>dia tengah ambil kat</malay> (uh) singapore poly because near to his workplace ya <malay>bayar sampai</malay> <malay>bayar sampai habis</malay> (uh) second year <malay>ke atau</malay> I forget I never got
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
(um) maybe [lah] I guess see how
but <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same [lah] but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small (uh) company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know (uh) you know they ride by they <malay>saman</malay> people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle [ah] like one my friend she intan at (uh) hers is under
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me [lah]
[oh] ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
(uh) engineer but ya [lah] I mean wouldn't (uh) wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
(uh) if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
<malay>dia bantai</malay> [jer] <malay>gaji dia besar</malay>
I mean <malay>kalau</malay> <malay>pun</malay> not bad (uh) <malay>dia</malay> <malay>sampai</malay> what two let's say you <malay>habis</malay> two forty five you extend what <malay>pukul lima pukul enam</malay> then after that
it's just another few more hours so okay [what]
ya I think so [oh] ya ya <malay>yang tadi kita berbual-bual</malay>
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
!huh! I thought it's under your name
ya <malay>ke ingat</malay> [oh]

[oh]
[ha] chain
chain adjust
<malay>tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang</malay> (uh)
<malay>akan</malay>
!huh! <malay>sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang</malay> clutch housing <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> bearing <malay>kat dalam</malay> engine <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> piston <malay>banyak benda yang akan</malay> effect your bike
[oh]
ya [lah] me [lah] I mean [ha] <malay>kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya</malay> ya <malay>tapi</malay> the reason I want to use is #ayie's# not say <malay>lumba</malay> your bike considered
<malay>untuk budak-budak</malay> (err) <malay>bawa motor nakal tapi</malay> you <malay>bawak terus jadi</malay> motor <malay>apek</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>kalau gitu</malay> how about <malay>kita</malay> share
<malay>apa</malay> X one <malay>apa</malay> (uh) [oh] [oh] class two A <malay>ke</malay> class two B [oh] two hundred [oh]
!alamak!
<malay>tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat</malay> carpark
<malay>habis</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> at the same <malay>time nak kata</malay> <malay>nak kata sayang tapi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> boring <malay>ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh</malay>
<malay>tapi ni</malay>
<malay>ubah suai ikut</malay>
<malay>kesedapan</malay> at the same time <malay>untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa</malay> motor <malay>boleh</malay> jam <malay>boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu</malay>
[oh] that time he ask me (err) he he asked me that (uh) how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
got a bit <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] in a way so he thought want to earn more money
so I told him like roughly [lah] how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as (uh) much more than his monthly but I told him [lah]
I told him [ah] that time I I hit about (uh) four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked [ah] my pay
was higher than him then tell him [lah] but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him [lah] the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him [lah] to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him [lah]
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure [lah] because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
no he he he was dead serious <malay>dia betul-betul</malay> (uh) dig through everything asking me <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab <malay>apa dia punya</malay> benefit <malay>apa dia punya</malay> you know (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) <malay>akan jadi kalau gini gini semua</malay> so I <malay>ceritakan dia</malay> [lah] I was (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
I <malay>bilang dia macam</malay>
okay <malay>kalau</malay> foodpanda <malay>leceh dia kita kena</malay> book shift <malay>kalau</malay> deliveroo <malay>dengan</malay> grab (uh) anytime <malay>kita boleh</malay> start <malay>boleh</malay> offline
then I told him [lah]
(uh) <malay>antara ni tiga</malay> company <malay>tak semestinya</malay> (uh) <malay>masing-masing ada (uh) <malay>dia punya</malay>
benefit <malay>dia tapi</malay> at the same time ya [lah] he <malay>tak boleh cerewet</malay> [lah] <malay>kita kena banyak sabar</malay> because
I <malay>pernah tunggu</malay> one hour for just one <malay>makanan</malay> so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him [ah] I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it [lah]
<malay>dia macam dia macam</malay> okay [jer] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal motor tu</malay> [kan] <malay>pun</malay> under <malay>ayah</malay>
<malay>pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula</malay> so okay [lah] pros and cons [ah] <malay>siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi</malay> understand [lah] maybe back then his workload was too much in a way [lah] <malay>pasal dia kata</malay> (uh)
<malay>ada budak baru masuk</malay> this and that so <malay>macam</malay> workload <malay>dia macam kurang tapi macam</malay> spread (uh) evenly [ah] so <malay>untuk dia</malay>
(uh) advantage [ah] <malay>pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya</malay> shift <malay>lagi dia ada pagi atau petang</malay> so that time <malay>dia pernah tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia ada bilang dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>cadangan dia kalau dia buat</malay>
<malay>kalau dia kena pagi punya</malay> shift <malay>lepas habis pagi dia dia</malay> (uh) [ha] <malay>dia buat</malay> delivery <malay>dia dia kayuh daripada</malay>
(uh) <malay>lepas maghrib</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai malam</malay>
<malay>tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dah cakap dah</malay> (uh) <malay>dia cakap senang</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> bag <malay>kau abang tak payah beli</malay> so you know [lah] your brother <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
!huh! ya [lah] <malay>dia dia berbual kat orang</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>dia sendiri</malay> that time <malay>nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli</malay> <malay>padahal dulu dia ada</malay> <malay>yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak</malay> problem this and that so I don't get his point [ah]
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
<malay>pasal tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar</malay> [oh] <malay>ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka</malay> you know <malay>tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham</malay> [ah] <malay>dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik</malay> motor <malay>bagi kat ayah</malay> so <malay>dia beli</malay> motor <malay>sendiri</malay> after <malay>dah berapa tahun</malay> ya <malay>dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>mana dia nak ikut minat mana dia nak ikut kerja</malay>
(uh huh) <malay>dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul</malay>
<malay>tak pasti</malay> [ah] <malay>tu kena tanya ayah</malay> (mmhmm) <malay>mungkin kot</malay>
then [oh] then that time <malay>apa abang ada tanya</malay>
(err)
(uh) he he <malay>dia tanya akak kerja</malay> grabfood <malay>macam mana</malay> (mmhmm) then I said [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> I (uh) I say [lah] the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
then he was he was shocked [lah] I say no [lah] because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked [lah] he he he judge but whatever [lah] I mean
I mean you just want to try try only [what] then and then I told him [lah]
like it's all up to individual [lah] I mean all
I I tell him [what] all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then <malay>dia terus bingit</malay> [ah] <malay>dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang</malay> [lah] <malay>kau panas baran macam gini macam mana</malay>
<malay>tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki</malay> how
<malay>tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena</malay> viral [jer]
ya <malay>ada yang</malay> that time #punggol# <malay>budak-budak</malay> grab <malay>gaduh dengan</malay> vendor <malay>pasal tak tahu sabar</malay> I think it was some promotion [lah] then I think
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
(uh) I told him (uh)
ya <malay>jangan jadi</malay> viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face [lah]
[oh] [oh] ya my friend my friend <malay>kerja</malay> #roo# (uh) this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot [lah] even though
(uh) was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
#roo# is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket (uh) add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable [lah] because
I mean <malay>kita dah layan hujan habis</malay>
<malay>takkan</malay>
<malay>bayar sikit</malay> [jer] you know so for #roo# to do that I'm very amazed [lah]
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> distance <malay>dia memang dia dia</malay> add on <malay>tapi ni dia tambah lagi</malay> because <malay>dia orang perasan</malay> somehow I think <malay>orang</malay> complain <malay>pasal hujan</malay> then you know safety and stuff so at least
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
worth it and you know <malay>macam berbaloi</malay> [ah]
[oh] okay [lah] maybe I see about that
ya for #roo# <malay>macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas</malay> so if compared to grab I have to take three orders <malay>tapi</malay> three orders <malay>pun tak semestinya</malay> I can get within less than one hour
ya <malay>waktu</malay>
but okay [lah] I mean I wouldn't complain already [lah] I mean as long as the market is good already [lah] because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
(uh) now (uh) based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to #hougang# mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I (uh) she she ride but she put under but (err) bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her [lah] [ah] they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me [lah] what's the logic behind this grab enforcers [oh] I mean I'm working [what] but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say [lah] like
<malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> no she didn't she wasn't aware until I tell her ya because she works (err) when she wants she was so she's not really depending on grab but she just if you just work for the fun of but ya when I tell her this so for her to do actually heard about this to her she find it like she pity for the other riders who get affected by this [ah] because it's considered their rice work [ah]
[oh] is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair [what] I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly [ah] !wah! that sucks
okay I'll take note [lah]
