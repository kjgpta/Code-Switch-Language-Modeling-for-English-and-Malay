like during that that test

don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
<malay>boleh boleh buat kerja</malay>
then (uh) (uh) besides <malay>sekolah</malay> [kan] like what what do you like to do <malay>macam</malay> do you have <malay>macam</malay> other hobby <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>apa apa benda</malay> [lah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school <malay>pastu ada apa</malay> O level <malay>abeh</malay> stress <malay>takle fikir</malay> yeah
[oh] during my free time I <malay>suka</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) draw I also like to (err) <malay>tengok apa ni</malay>
[ah] anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because <malay>takde</malay> time [kan] poly <malay>dalam</malay> I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to (uh) do my hobbies which is kind of (uh) <malay>macam sedih</malay> but yeah so
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally (uh) do (uh) my hobbies
yeah
yep
actually <malay>ada banyak</malay> plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
go for the trials (err) because I (um) I'm actually afraid of rejection
but (um) I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then (um) maybe in (uh) (um) year two then I will start <malay>macam</malay> join like start trying out for [ah] I've actually picked
<malay>macam</malay> a few is (err) firstly is [ah] floorball like (um) <malay>aku kata tadi</malay> [kan] as I've mentioned (uh) floorball and then second was silat
and then third is <malay>dikir barat</malay> ya but
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
ya it is it is that's why <malay>macam</malay> I'm like a bit <malay>takut</malay> to (um) you know join their team because (err) <malay>macam dorang nya</malay> expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet <malay>dorang nya</malay> expectations
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then (um) so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
!wah! how was it
but I think right I think confirm <malay>boleh</malay> pass <malay>punya</malay> confirm
yeah
[oh] for what
[oh] <malay>mesti sakit</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
<malay>banyak</malay>
[ah]
yeah
(mm)
then the the surgery <malay>bila</malay>
[oh]
!wow!
ya man I can't imagine myself
!wah! all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then <malay>dia</malay> <malay>dia kata</malay> like
(um) it's actually not that painful [lah] because like you know they put you in (uh) on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you <malay>bangun</malay> so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think [ah] after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you <malay>tak nak</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> side effects [kan] so ya
then
(uh) other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so (uh) how
how how how would you feel like <malay>macam</malay> you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like <malay>macam</malay> like your feeling
[oh]
yeah
(uh) I've never I've never <malay>apa ni</malay> had any surgeries before
I
I can't imagine the <malay>macam dia nya</malay> sakit
[eh] then [oh]
[eh] you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
[ah] small business
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I never say
no no no you you meant [ah] calligraphy is it
[oh] yeah yeah
ya ya ya so <malay>macam</malay> during my free time cause [ah]
<malay>apa ni</malay> I I love doing calligraphy right so I like <malay>macam</malay> I have I have like a mini business where
I (uh) <malay>buat</malay> calligraphy on <malay>orang punya macam</malay> notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like (um) quite a reasonable price [lah] so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
(uh) I like !aiya! basically like (um) doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>buat</malay> this business because
cause a lot of people [kan] you know singaporeans [kan] <malay>diorang suka macam</malay> study [kan] then <malay>banyak orang suka buat macam</malay> notebook <malay>diorang macam cantik cantik</malay> so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that <malay>diorang ada macam</malay> motivation to <malay>belajar</malay>
yeah [eh]
[kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID [kan] so like (uh) <malay>kat dalam rumah</malay> what do you do
(mmhmm)
ih
(oo)
!wah! !wah! tell me more
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also <malay>macam</malay> a good way [lah] for <malay>orang</malay> to you know <malay>macam</malay> get that extra cash
then like after after <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan]
you where's where's the first place <malay>yang</malay> you want to travel
yup
list them all
[oh]
[oh]
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
and remember <malay>yang kita semua jatuh sakit</malay> after we played at the beach
true
ya
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach <malay>semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit</malay>
yeah hopefully once like <malay>macam</malay> the border [dah] <malay>buka</malay> then we can go
ya
ya true true
!wah! for me right
after <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is (uh) <malay>mana ni</malay> Japan
yes
I've been there <malay>bila</malay> when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so <malay>macam tak ingat</malay> (uh) I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna <malay>macam</malay> go there again and then <malay>macam</malay> like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also <malay>macam</malay> if it's like an interesting country [ah] <malay>macam menarik</malay> you know <malay>pasal</malay>
like because (uh) I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there <malay>macam</malay> collect <malay>diorang nya apa ni</malay> figurine because like <malay>banyak orang kata macam</malay>
is <malay>macam</malay> quite cheap [ah] so I was like okay [ah] then I I think if if cause I like to collect
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
!wah! I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator [eh] with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
the the work is <malay>macam</malay> due next week [kan] then I would only do it like <malay>macam tiga hari</malay> before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too <malay>macam penat nak buat buat</malay> the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
[oh]
(mm)
ya (uh) me also like most of the time is always like cause I
always use my I'm on my handphone <malay>asyik tengok</malay> Instagram <malay>semua</malay> then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like [oh] [dah] <malay>lambat</malay> [ah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [lah] <malay>besok boleh buat</malay>
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
(uh) it can be done but it's just very hard
<malay>macam</malay> like group projects [eh]
[oh] recently I I <malay>ada macam</malay> this one (err) group project like I just finished <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>dua</malay> weeks <malay>lepas</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> it's called studio project so it's basically like because (uh)
my course is interaction design [kan] so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm (uh) ideas together and then come up with like (uh) a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting [lah] because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
(uh) how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
so my group <malay>kita buat</malay> we did this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and <malay>macam</malay> the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very <malay>susah</malay> app
to <malay>pakai</malay> because ya it's only my first year and then is also my <malay>macam</malay> my first time [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> then it's like <malay>susah</malay> [ah] then like all my other friends <malay>macam</malay> they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story <malay>macam</malay> interesting [ah] so like when users (uh) see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like <malay>macam</malay> arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next (uh) page or something so that's like <malay>macam</malay> there's an interaction there
ya that's about it
for you [eh]
(mm)
why kay you tell me
how #rabak#
!wah! I legit also don't like this type of people [leh] like they really make my blood go up [eh] like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to [ah] take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works [lah]
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
[oh]
[oh] that's interesting
[ah] ya ya
(mm)
[oh] that's good that's good
yeah
[oh]
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app [ah] because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good (um) for me I think your app is very beneficial [lah] for people yeah
(oo) that's good
ya ya ya very interesting [eh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
!wah!
that's cool
Animal Crossing is a very in game now [eh] a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious <malay>macam banyak orang</malay> like <malay>semua main</malay> [ah] then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
(mm)
!wah!
ya ya ya very interesting
<malay>macam</malay> look forward to [ah]
!wah! that that's quite a handful you got you got <malay>banyak</malay> project to <malay>apa ni buat</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
yeah it's good also because like [kan] year three we <malay>ada</malay> internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for (um) <malay>untuk</malay> like the company before <malay>diorang</malay> accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like <malay>diorang</malay> we're just like straight away <malay>masukkan</malay> you inside there but I didn't know like you have to <malay>macam</malay> go through an interview so I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite it's quite beneficial [lah] like <malay>apa diorang</malay>
<malay>ajar</malay> teach <malay>kat dalam</malay> yeah
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
(mm)
I also had like a similar a similar module I did <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) previously
where also same it's called (uh) effective effective (err) communication skill so <malay>diorang ajar macam mana</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> you know (err) if (err) communicate effectively and how to like you know gain (uh) confidence
and what are some of the
the like
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to <malay>macam macam</malay> you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting [ah] but <malay>macam sedih</malay> [ah] because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me [ah] from someone who is actually <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who (err) is (uh) confident enough [ah] to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
[oh] ya
ya
!wah! actually I make friends very instantly [eh] it's like ya because (err) okay the good thing about technology is that (err)
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school [lah] so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
and <malay>macam</malay> it's like quite cool [lah] because like then you can <malay>macam cari orang</malay> in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me (err) there's this <malay>macam ada</malay> this (uh) girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like [eh] I heard you're in the in the same course
then (uh) she's like (uh) let's be friends [ah] then from there (uh) we started being friends [ah] then (err) when during poly because (err) mostly it was on Zoom right because of <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation <malay>semua</malay> so everything <malay>macam</malay> is online
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya so (err) ya then (err) in school like when we <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for <malay>macam</malay> many years
ya so it was like quite easy [lah] in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing <malay>macam susah</malay> is that (uh) is like the modules [ah] because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never <malay>macam</malay> done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
ya
you [eh] what about you
ya
ya from secondary school then to poly
!wah! my one don't have [eh] cause COVID then no orientation very damn sad [leh]
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like <malay>macam</malay> party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
[oh]
!huh! really [ah]
[oh]
[oh] I see I see
[oh] I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything <malay>macam</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
I I think not bad [leh] the one that there was one time
I also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time (um) my I had I had this (uh) program called like so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours [lah] then you will get the
<malay>macam</malay> the badge <malay>gitu</malay> so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift [one] [ah] so it's not bad [ah] <malay>tapi panas gila</malay>
it was so hot
and the and the worst thing [kan] towards the is <malay>tengah puasa</malay> you know <malay>tengah puasa</malay> then like me and my friend <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak</malay>
then we then <malay>kita</malay> almost <malay>batal</malay> [lah] my then my friend [dah] <malay>tak boleh</malay> take it [kan] then she was like [ah] <malay>batal</malay> [jer] [lah]
ya
eight hours was (uh) painful [lah] then <malay>kita jalan jalan</malay>
ya we we we we walked around the whole of #Tampines# ya but it was very very rewarding <malay>pasal</malay> (uh) at the end of the day <malay>kita dapat banyak</malay> donation
ya
(mm)
!huh! <malay>biar betul</malay>
right
!wah!
kay [lah] not bad you know at least you all <malay>macam</malay> you know like put money inside [lah] donate also
ya
but if you were to do <malay>macam</malay> flag day again would you do it
really ya it is
[oh] ya ya I've done the morning shift [one] before it's very very tiring
<malay>penat</malay> I couldn't <malay>macam buka my mata</malay>
ya it was during <malay>bulan puasa</malay>
ya
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>tempat yang ada</malay> shade [kan] already [dah] <malay>ada orang</malay> so me and my friend like <malay>macam terpaksa</malay> [ah] <malay>kita stand</malay>
under the hot sun then collect [lor] but that spot was the best cause <malay>banyak orang lalu sana</malay> so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like !alamak! shouldn't have told them
[oh] maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad [lah] this COVID there [ah] spoil all the plan [eh] then like legit man then [ah] spoil then like I can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do Zoom Zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
ya true hopefully [lah] I I I really wish <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation will <malay>macam</malay> die down [ah] because it really affects [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> life
(mm)
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you
