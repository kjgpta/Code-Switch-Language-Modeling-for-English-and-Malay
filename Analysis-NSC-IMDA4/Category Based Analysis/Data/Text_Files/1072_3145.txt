just
[lah]
<malay>macam</malay> you know is in indo I think it's stands for
[ah] service [ah]

ya
[ah] <malay>sebab</malay> I think [kan] <malay>pasal</malay> pandemic <malay>pasal</malay> COVID then <malay>kita dah tak boleh pergi</malay> indonesia <malay>ke nak pergi negeri mana-mana</malay>
so (uh huh)
I like suddenly <malay>macam</malay> struck an idea like to go and
struck an idea that that
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
like we can we can use this service or people can use this service <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay>
(um) bring bring food or bring <malay>apa-apa</malay> [lah] like snacks <malay>ke apa</malay> to singapore [lah] like they can <malay>macam</malay> some
<malay>macam ada orang dia orang rindu makanan-makanan</malay> indo then <malay>dia orang macam</malay> (uh) <malay>teringin</malay> [ah] <malay>nak makan</malay>
ya so (uh) this is one way [lah] we can
(err) bring
bring it up
to them ya so
(mm) venture
I think
(uh) about
actually it's just three months <malay>aje</malay> [lah] ya we are still in our <malay>macam</malay> trial trial run [lah] <malay>kita tengah tengok macam mana</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya</malay> demand and people's <malay>punya</malay> response <malay>semua macam mana</malay>
and <malay>dia orang kalau</malay> happy
and
and stuff we are
willing to venture out more [lah] <malay>macam</malay> venture in
(err) more more in depth
ya like I think this is now <malay>macam</malay> a good opportunity <malay>untuk kita buat</malay>
such a business <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab kita</malay> [kan]
<malay>dah tak boleh</malay> travel
for the meantime so
ya I'll just use this opportunity [lah] [kan]
(mm)
business I think mainly <malay>macam</malay> communication [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> [ah] like liaise
language barrier <malay>ada sikit</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal dia orang</malay> [kan] <malay>berbual bahasa</malay> so <malay>ada</malay> certain things <malay>kita tak faham</malay> then <malay>kadang</malay> miscommunication <malay>juga macam kita nak</malay> <malay>cakap satu benda dia orang</malay> interpret as something else
then (uh) <malay>tu tu</malay> one of the difficulties [lah]
ya I can see
then <malay>lepas tu macam</malay> (err)
<malay>sebab kita</malay> [kan] <malay>tak boleh ada</malay> there
(err) physically so we must monitor them by whatsapp or like ya like to liaise (err) with my contacts over there [lah]
then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
(uh) ya
I think that's mainly what the the difficulties are the rest not so much
ya
ya
no [lah] I have a few a few friends they are doing it together with me ya
<malay>dia orang macam</malay>
ya
one of them is not is a housewife [lah] so she she's just doing some side business also then ya so she's also doing this [lah] then for me and my other friend we are like working full time
ya so ya like ya this is like our part time [lah] time management so far okay
<malay>macam</malay> (err) we we
try to (err) minimise our workload [lah]
(mm) from day to day
ya
but (uh) I think it's okay [lah] it's a feasible business I think [ah] what about you like do you have anything like you want to start up with

[kan] <malay>selalu kalau tak boleh pergi</malay> <malay>ke apa</malay> just to buy our necessities then <malay>sekarang dah susah</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab barang-barang</malay> <malay>kat</malay> supermarket <malay>semua mahal</malay> [seh] then
ya
[a'ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay>
(mm) ya ya
hopefully [lah] #inshallah# <malay>ada</malay> (mm)

actually <malay>kalau macam</malay> new zealand <malay>kalau kita sewa macam</malay> caravan [kan]
I I think <malay>boleh</malay> consider [lah] parents <malay>macam</malay> (err) elderly <malay>ke orang-orang</malay>

so <malay>macam</malay>
I don't I think it's a it will be a good experience <malay>untuk orang-orang macam dia orang</malay> [ah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> actually my parents <malay>pun dah berumur juga</malay>
so
it's it's good [lah] to bring them
<malay>macam dia orang boleh tengok permandangan</malay>

my parents <malay>pun bukannya pergi</malay>
<malay>jauh-jauh sangat dia orang selalu pun paling jauh pun</malay> (err) indonesia

indonesia <malay>punya</malay> view <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>lain</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> new zealand new zealand <malay>macam</malay> [ah] then also <malay>dia punya</malay> climate <malay>pun</malay>
(err) <malay>lain ada sejuk sikit</malay> ya (mm) (mm) (mm)
[ah]
(mm) correct <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>orang melayu</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita punya apa lidah</malay> or something [eh] our taste buds [lah] <malay>macam mesti kena ada pedas</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> or <malay>mesti ada</malay>
<malay>sambal ke apa ke</malay> (err) <malay>kalau macam</malay> bland <malay>ke macam</malay> let's say <malay>pergi</malay> western <malay>punya</malay> country <malay>macam makan</malay> pasta <malay>ke makan macam</malay> cream cream or cheese (mm) <malay>tak semua orang macam melayu suka</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>sambal tumis</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] okay [lah] interesting
ya
(mm) (mm) [ah] ya [lah]
ya [lah] different perception <malay>macam orang pergi dengan</malay> parents <malay>mana pergi dengan</malay>
<malay>kawan pun macam mana</malay> [kan] ya so
ya if if for me maybe it's <malay>sebab sebab</malay> (err)
<malay>sebab apa kita macam</malay> (err) sometimes <malay>kalau</malay> okay [lah] like when we were young
it's it's nice to travel with parents because
you you don't have to fork out any cash ya you don't have to fork out money parents your parents will like buy for you or spend like so you don't have to worry about that [lah] but with friends [ah] you have to consider all of these things [lah] budgeting [lah] <malay>apa</malay> all that
ya
so like you like to go travel like so
like what's your favorite season [ah] (mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
I see actually no I mean
(err) spring is considered (err) winter right or is it after winter sorry [kan] ya but I I mean I personally also like winter [lah]
but (err) winter like it's very fun [lah] cause
like when that time I went to (err) europe [ah] then I experience the snow and all so it was (err) quite fun like you can have snowball fights <malay>semua</malay> ya then like you do all the silly silly things [lah] ya that we you don't get to experience in singapore [kan]
ya so but (err) how to say <malay>macam</malay> the aesthetic
aesthetically I would prefer (err) autumn
ya like the beautiful scenery of the autumn leaves like it's it's really nice [lah] ya
(mm) ya correct
(mmhmm) ya ya is like
(uh) I think jackets at least we can still save [lah] for our next few trips <malay>ke apa</malay> ya ya hopefully get to experience again
once the this is all over [kan]
(mm) like you really (mm)
!wow!
(err) [oh] ya okay [dah] <malay>pernah pergi</malay> [lah] ya I went before (uh) once ya
it was it was actually during autumn [lah] that's when ya I got to experience autumn
ya
so I think you also went to korea right if I'm not wrong korea like !huh! korea and japan I think there are a lot of similarities but but the difference is I think in the terms of <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>orang dia</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> like the the people there are really polite
polite <malay>gila</malay> like they
they are very (err)
friendly also and then I I also like every time you go to like seven eleven or any convenience store they always greet you [one] without fail ya so that's one thing I like admire [lah] about them
then so ya singapore (err) ya correct
ya basic courtesy obviously manners ya ya [lah] but I guess japanese people are just born or they are taught that way [lah] right
since young so
that's why
[ah] then [orh]
(mm) you should try the <malay>apa</malay>
there's the bullet train [lah] ya the high speed train all
no I only took the high speed train only
because because I couldn't afford the no [lah] I feel that I I because the destination I'm going doesn't require me to take the high the bullet train [lah] it's just the high speed train which
like normal [lah] I I mean it's quite fast when you're inside it it's quite fast I think travelling about three hundred plus kilometer per hour ya
but you already like when you're inside you don't really feel anything
ya like ya
which is not bad good ya but
like you said it's quite expensive it's (uh) the food
really
(mm) ya sure can I can bring you like there ya I mean there's I mean I've not been to all the places [what] so I also like keen to go visit all the other places
in japan
ya so it's it's good [lah]
I think it'll be a good experience right
ya so
!wah! all this conversation about travelling makes me want to
(err) miss I really miss travelling [lah] like (err) (mm) ya ya ya (mmhmm) (mmhmm) ya
ya
(mm)

(mm) (mm) ya [lah] I see
(err) I'm not really but depends [lah] on the circumstances <malay>macam</malay> if you ask me to go skydiving (err) part of me would want but part of me will be scared [lah] of course ya cause like I'm that that afraid
