<malay>tak nak cakap</malay>
earning
yes
[a'ah]
yeah it's true especially in Singapore [lah] to be honest
that's why it's better if you migrate [lah]
exactly that's why not many people migrate to Malaysia already
aha that one is (uh) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah]
it is what it is yeah
unusual superpower [eh]
any superpower
okay [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> would want to be invisible
I mean not that I'm already not invisible [lah] to be honest but it's okay [lah]
think of all the things I could get away with [ah]
like
[ah] okay [ah] we don't want talk much [ah] but like there's many things you can get away with for example like
I don't know skip class
[eh] #bocui# [sia] nah <malay>tak payah tak payah</malay> we don't snitch

<malay>apa</malay>
[oh] it's a series [oh] shit okay
patience [ah] [eh] patience [oh]
!wow!
so what am I like supposed to think
[ah]
<malay>aku rasa</malay> they talking about like
you know those
no more like aha
<malay>kau tahu</malay> like
some people they will write messages or like
put stuff inside a box
then they bury it at one place that they only know that kind of thing
okay then what's the answer then
when is that
[a'ah]
(uh huh)
yeah yeah
overconfident [ah]
[ah]
[ah]
but it's like a natural thing [ah] for <malay>kau</malay> [kan] and some it's honestly called talent [ah] to be that smart at that young age
for that part
(um)
[a'ah]
ya okay how primary school things [ah]
yes correct [ah] <malay>betul</malay>
it

[ah] yes
yes
it's a good band it's a good band [ah] it's a good band
[oh] okay actually I kind of get what you mean cause I'm I'm like that type also if like people overhype one song too much before I even hear it and it sounds decent enough
<malay>aku</malay> still wouldn't hear it [lah] to be honest cause
<malay>apa</malay>
yeah yeah
[oh] yeah yeah yeah
[ah]
yes yes
[a'ah]
but also don't need say [ah] cause <malay>kitanya</malay> radio our campus radio <malay>pun</malay> overplayed their songs [ah]

honestly say honestly say
I swear ya we can talk better let's be honest let's be honest

!huh!
okay one thing that I wish was free
(err)
<malay>aku</malay> feel like okay this will definitely make sense but
it'll be hard [ah]
transport
just free transport for everybody
it would cost a lot of but then the thing about that is that
a lot of people will take more transport then it will be over congested
then they will need to be make more and make more then the space especially <malay>kat</malay> Singapore [kan] <malay>kitanya</malay> country small
unless other places but I've heard like some other countries also like actually provide free transport
I've heard
[oh] <malay>mak</malay> yes
yes yes [eh] actually that's very good points [ah] [a'ah] [sia] healthcare
(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
wait that's the sad thing plus also it's not really a guarantee that they will do a good job [kan] that's another thing
no offence but like don't want say shade also to other countries but most of them also a bit (uh) corrupt [eh]
low-key <malay>kalau ada</malay> [ah] [eh]

(mmhmm)
yeah
exactly

(mm)
they should have just save their money for a retirement or something [ah]
or all that all that ya ya true
but <malay>kau</malay> imagine though
if everybody has money
then everybody will be the same
you know what I mean
there's a problem with that also [ah] there's a problem that lies there also
everybody being like able to fend for themselves enough money everybody
