(um) <malay>sebab</malay>
[kan] <malay>dalam kerja saya kita akan makan makanan yang</malay>
<malay>yang sedia ada yang paling senang</malay> so <malay>daripada</malay> McDonald <malay>ke nasi ayam ke apa-apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang ada</malay>
<malay>dan kalau makanan kat luar</malay>
<malay>ia agak susah nak makan makanan yang sihat</malay>
<malay>dan kalau kita</malay>

<malay>mungkin lebih mahal atau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> salad stop salad stop <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>murah banyak tempat ada</malay>
yes yes salad stop <malay>lebih macam sepuluh</malay> dollar <malay>untuk makan</malay>

<malay>kalau nak</malay> save away <malay>semua</malay>
yes [lah] <malay>makan makanan yang</malay>
<malay>sedia ada yang ringan yang</malay> normal [lah] <malay>sebagai seorang</malay> singapore [kan]
<malay>bukan tu sebab kerja saya</malay>
[kan]
<malay>bergerak daripada satu tempat ke satu tempat</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>dan mak masa bila kita makan semua orang akan macam</malay> okay first <malay>kita</malay> shoot <malay>dekat tempat ini kita</malay> (um) <malay>kat</malay> office <malay>ini lepas itu kita</malay>
okay the disclaimer <malay>nya saya seorang</malay> cameraman <malay>yang</malay>
cameraman slash videographer slash director or photography yada yada
(um) <malay>dan kebanyakan</malay> shot <malay>yang saya buat adalah</malay> documentaries

<malay>dalam satu hari saya mungkin akan ke</malay>
<malay>berbagai-bagai tempat untuk</malay>

<malay>dari pagi kita</malay> shoot <malay>di salah satu tempat ni dan mungkin tengah hari kita akan</malay> shoot <malay>di tempat lain jadi dalam masa</malay>
(um) lunch <malay>tu kita akan berpindah ke</malay>

<malay>bukan kata</malay>
hi seoul <malay>pergi</malay> #tiong bahru# [kan] so I <malay>pun nak</malay> try <malay>makanan sana</malay>
so there's one two <malay>salah satu sebab yang</malay> I <malay>cakap tadi sebab</malay> culture singapore
<malay>pengalaman mencuba daripada</malay> hawker centre <malay>yang</malay>
(um) <malay>merata-rata bukan saja di bahagian timur ini</malay>
<malay>dan</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
<malay>berbandingkan</malay> like
north south east west singapore <malay>dan</malay> (err)
<malay>cara mereka</malay>
(err) develop <malay>atau</malay> organise
hawker centre <malay>mereka pun tak</malay> same same but different <malay>macam sama-sama tapi berbeza kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> #bedok# corner <malay>sama dengan</malay> adam road
<malay>dari segi</malay> layout <malay>dari segi</malay> design
<malay>tempat tu bulat</malay>
<malay>dan di tengah-tengah tu</malay> open air
<malay>tak sebab</malay> [kan] renovation <malay>beruk</malay> corner <malay>tu sebelum ni dia tak bulat tahu dia panjang</malay>
<malay>sekarang sama dengan</malay> adam road
<malay>tapi yang menarik dia</malay>
(um) quality <malay>makanan</malay> quality <malay>makanan semua berbezakan dan</malay> you <malay>tengok kat</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
so
can we speak in english now
<malay>dah setengah jam</malay>
ya let's switch
(um) ya food wise
there's a difference in culture I feel like in the north south east west
it feels like in the north and we're talking about malay or <malay>halal</malay> food here
there's more standalone stores
you know what I mean like a must [ah] you type situation or you know rather than this places being integrated into a hawker centre I'm sure you can find like
good
one of like malay stalls in hawker centres but it's not like
in the east where
you can go to a hawker centre and there's gonna be good malay food ya but there's a lot of malays and the west there is I'm not saying that isn't I'm saying the
quality
yes
[oh] is doing what [oh] right right yes
indian muslim ya I I really don't mind going to one of her classes and just exploring (um)
the culture of food that they have
what do you mean in this area supper club
alright yes yes everything's changed now
a few friends are coming over
for to watch the polling results
on and I'm really looking forward to that you know what I wish I wish I had decorated the house with like flag political paraphernalia
but I I wouldn't I I know I would place <malay>macam</malay>
a bunch of stuff [lah]
well like lightning bolts too
(err) hammers <malay>tu</malay> ya <malay>apa-apa</malay> like the whole gamut
I am really looking for I I feel we should make good it's (uh) there's (uh) (uh) no more like a a culture food
or
a tradition exactly
yes well what
I feel it's weird man I
I really miss rallies
I really really miss rallies
it really it makes me feel like a singaporean like so much like a singaporean like I I
I feel the singapore spirit really comes out in and rallies especially opposition rallies
like not every I mean you got to be a premium rally inside
but there
(mmhmm) like the polling closes at ten [lah]
yes
maybe later than that
yes [lah] if you're the
!wah! and I saw
<malay>macam</malay> my friend's instagram or actions a reporter and they're all dragging this whole thing because everybody everybody's gonna stay updated just to
report there (err) news on this year [oh] ya totally but it's fun [lah] I mean is once in what five years [kan] when I was covering the elections now the last time I covered the elections wasn't that fine [lah] it was like
for bloomberg and we were just parked outside a school in shooting life crosses from there
it was a bit dull
and then we interviewed some ministers at
you know the bridge opposite canvas ya so we we did that
(um) but
ten years ago that was fun I was a new cameraman who say any like
but just join
and it was a culture shock for me [lah] I didn't know what the door stop was and then you suddenly have to fucking hold the camera
like for what fifteen minutes treat the door stop is when they
so
okay here's a few terms that's walkabout so walkabouts is when
the politicians would go walk around the neighbourhood say maybe visit house to house visit [ah]
after one year of the markets and after that and after the whole meet the people see you they would then have a door stop for reporters so door stop is when they stop somewhere
and collect questions from media
that's done
is usually done at the end but
it depends what the person tells my reporter [lah]
but it's almost always done at the end of their walkabout
(um)
cause (uh) I really you really do this or what
the is like work for me you know I I do this for quite a lot like clapped to say
nine hours a day no I'm not
for what [sia]
(um) extending our conversations outside
can [lah] but you have to
have a controlled environment right yes
so can defeats the purpose
I think conversations
well that's the thing of conversations lag is meant to be organic and if you can replicate that feeling of or
something being organic yet
being aware that you're recording something that's a trick to it
because it's a paying thing
I feel that's the incentive here
(mmhmm)
if it wasn't paid would you like
to record yourself talking to someone for like
I I don't think it will matter again you know what's interesting if this entire project wasn't about singlish but about how you communicate with
and you love do what something like that
yes yes (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
it's quite well
are we done with this must [ah]
must be one hour #swee# #swee# is it
(mm)
are you browsing anything on your phone right now I'm not
I have never brows my phone while
during this entire conversation [lah]
(mm)
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
tomorrow is what saturday
okay
I
wonder how the next few weeks would be
ya ya well what and I just have one job coming up [lah]
seventeenth
this month
so how about the
the locked out was what march
and we got so lockdown also [what] one month and a half
ya there's a phase one then phase two
no [lah] less than a month ya
(um)
I think life
right now
how is life changed for me
it's a cumulative of being married
going through COVID
(err)
I I wouldn't say it stress man
<malay>macam</malay>
what would life be without stress right but I don't think I'm in this position where I am really stressed about
what I'm doing like who I who I am I don't have an identity crisis
(um)
I'm just
going through life day by day
(um) doing what I was doing before this entire COVID thing
(um)
no I didn't to be honest with you
there was anxiety but I wasn't panicking with regards to that [ah]
I
was covering my bases and doing all
making sure
like people still remembered me and like
people would still call me right after this COVID thing like I mention I thank thankfully I'm working and (um)
like this documentary and new kinda genre of filmmaking right so
(err) when
(uh) COVID times or an election times I mean work does come in
you but you you know what's interesting now did I tell you about this (um)
(err) like people are sticking their claims over like what jobs they take now <malay>yang buat</malay> (err) cameraman and all that stuff so ya I find it
like people are panicking [lah] I guess low key panicking and marking their territories
(um)
ya ya I think so too
I I I don't know like I okay
I feel like I want to do it organically I want to do it in a way that
people respect and recognise me for my work (um) my personality and what I bring to it rather than guilt people into hiring me
I I I don't want to be that person that like
[oh] he use to be friends me he gonna hire me you know that kind of shit
I guess is an ego thing [lah] that's what I'm saying but like
I I guess that keeps me in check also in culture shock being able like
sharpening my skills making sure and relevant in how I work can what show them that kind of stuff [lah]
(um)
ya ya ya
ya and I feel is also with
your collaborators who you work [kan] people who get your ideas and concepts (err) I feel that's even more special than say doing
(um) money jobs or whatever [lah] like
ya ya ya definitely I'm I'm not denying that but
at same time
I I don't know [leh] like I I watch so much diverse shit right there
I mean like putting a camera down and just filming something and letting the scene play out that
art form of filmmaking is already it's a a miss is missing you know like
you learn from
orson wells like forgot foreground middle and background and how everything is playing out at same time
I I feel that art is missing in how we
(um) film today like everything is really fast pace or like
everything is
and here's the thing I don't think I've ever talked to you about it <malay>macam</malay> like the over shoulder short
so the cameras over your shoulder so right now when you're talking right the cameras like just behind me here shooting the part of my shoulder and showing you and that shot
is everywhere if you pay attention to food like films or series or whatever the head shot is everywhere
ya but if you notice <malay>macam</malay> old films or old work for example for example we watched five blood sister yesterday right
okay it was really good movie anyway (um)
she didn't shoot
that many oasis it was like he had the balls to just maintain a camera on the white shot
and let the scene play out which
you can see everyone's body movements like
I guess facial expressions isn't it isn't that out that like isn't your
what do you call that ya
it's more body language and stuff like that [lah]
I don't know I like (err) I I miss the art of
foreground middle ground and background
that that like that this obsessed me actually did this what I'm obsessed about actually you know
you know
I thought it was okay it wasn't like fantastic ya okay
what do you mean
[oh]
right or like four by three and angles to sixty point nine no it doesn't
[oh] like four by three and then goes to six to nine no [lah] it doesn't
(err) do the right thing
(um) twenty fifth hour like I would
categorised spike #lee# movies from like his nineties work to like
his post ninety stuff (uh) it's quite different
have you seen twenty fifth before
you that's really powerful man
no [ah] I think you should watch it (err) way back it ended well and I liked that he with the entire black struggle
the historic black struggle into the vietnam war and into current this current situation
ya
was that
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
right
(uh huh)
but but
so spike #lee# does that a lot like almost all his movies are about
some form of blackness in it like I mean he did malcolm X right that's
and it's early like say the nineties movies were all about predominantly predominantly black protagonist and antagonism like the drama that they go through
