<malay>abeh tadi kau tidur sampai kul bapa</malay> [seh]
<malay>penat</malay> [lah] <malay>tu abeh sekarang ada</malay> energy [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
[oh] I didn't know it's only twenty minute
cause I would think that it's like two hours
#muay thai#
<malay>murah ke</malay>
hundred thirty <malay>tapi berapa banyak</malay> session <malay>ada</malay>
no there's no like limitation <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> like that your coach
is not going to be there all the time [kan]
!chey! best <malay>nya</malay>
<malay>boleh ke tak tu</malay>
!wow!
!wah! best <malay>nya ada</malay> dreams
<malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>tadi</malay> you say you <malay>pergi lari tapi lari kat mana</malay> [seh]
[orh]
<malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>tahu tak yang</malay> I <malay>masuk dalam</malay> badminton <malay>punya</malay> team ya then
it's very tiring [lah]
if you think of it <malay>pasal dia macam</malay> cardio [tau] like you have to move everywhere <malay>kena jalan sini kena jalan sana</malay> strength <malay>ada</malay> <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak penat ke dah dah lari habis tu nak main</malay> badminton <malay>nak anuh</malay> evolve <malay>lagi</malay> best <malay>nya gitu</malay>
this is during my secondary school time
like I join choir <malay>habis tu</malay>
I quit choir
to join badminton
and then I was in the girl's team
ya and then (um)
I join competition
but do you that (um) I only
I didn't actually fight with anyone like you know be in a match
and I already secured myself second place
ya exactly
(err) (hmm) apparently it's possible [lah]
!whoa!
that's a very
defined goal
in your life
stand
one other days in this [one] is like what everyday
like do this
everyday or like just certain days
no it's not two K it's very little actually I think it's because
it look at our experiences <malay>tapi</malay>
the funny part is [kan]
when I search for jobs they actually want
people with experiences even though it's a
let's let's say it's a intern job
the intern job also they want experiences I mean like I don't know how am I supposed to find
a starting job to get all these experiences
in a good company
actually
what I look for in a job [kan] it's not just financial stability
but more of like
I want to be in a in a company that
(err) that actually appreciates you for what you do
<malay>susah</malay> [tau] <malay>macam nak cari</malay> company <malay>macam gitu pasal</malay>
nowadays
especially in start ups
they
just literally
<malay>buangkan kerja apa-apa kerja pun dekat</malay> you then like you don't even know
if this
job or experience is worth it because you are doing bits and pieces of everything
that's why I like I'm finding a job that actually
values
like
their employees [ah] that's very hard for me to find
my god
can I say something
so [kan]
(err) I was hired
and I have
(um) like a
specialist diploma
<malay>tapi</malay> there's this like
(err) diploma girl
she doing arts <malay>tapi</malay>
her job scope changed her from doing graphic design to digital marketing and you know what's worse
she is the head of my team you know when she is younger
and no experience and I've been in that company for six months
so I feel like shit you know like honestly because
like I have the qualities like honestly I'm doing really well like
in my job I really put in a lot of effort I work hard <malay>tapi</malay> like this girl she just goes in and then like she just be friends with the manager <malay>habis tu</malay>
she gets the job like as a head you know and everything <malay>semua</malay> I <malay>buat</malay> [tau]
like she literally throw everything to me to do then she asked me how to do this not I teach her [lah] <malay>macam ajar dia nak buat</malay>
teach the marketing
how to even do like a video thing you know like I cannot [lah]
and she's not hired for it but
she's getting paid more you know like I'm getting way lesser and she's
I don't know it's it's damn weird
she's twenty
ya
yes
that's true
let's let's not talk about this topic [lah] let's just (uh) move on because like I find
this type of (uh) topic [kan] like
it will never end
so what do you do now
like
what's your job scope
wait
so
you
telling me that
<malay>dorang tak</malay> actually <malay>buat</malay>
they don't really get
like the care like in that sense <malay>pasal</malay> they are only thinking about assessment academic
and then
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh] <malay>budak-budak itu</malay>
like
to say that <malay>dorang tak boleh cakap</malay>
while you're eating all these
how are they going to interact and then like
build on the social aspect
because I think the student care is there is to like
also like help them
not just academically [lah]
but more of like
mingling around with others
then if they can't do that then what will you do
<malay>tak ada ke mak bapa marah</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang tak tahu ke benda ni semua ada</malay> like
this is going on
ya [lah]
<malay>tak payah kerja kat situ lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay>
<malay>berbaloi</malay>
so I guess they're trying to mould them into
being this type of
perfect person
but
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh] <malay>budak-budak macam gitu</malay>
because
ya like I said
how is
that gonna help them in a long run because
you will totally be affected by this and traumatised maybe
<malay>itu</malay> [lah]
<malay>bagus juga</malay>
like my my parents <malay>tak</malay>
you know send me to student care
ya
last time <malay>senang</malay> [jer] <malay>duduk dekat rumah tengok</malay> <malay>dah habis kerja dah habis sekolah tengok</malay> <malay>habis tu makan habis tu boleh baring tidur</malay>
best <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
you know
so
<malay>dah</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak payah nak cakap pasal ni lagi</malay> [lah]
[ah] [lah]
my job scope
<malay>tak</malay> fun [lah]
no [lah] just do bits and pieces of everything
ya [lah]
so
yesterday
you <malay>keluar dengan kakak</malay> you [kan]

ya
actually
<malay>dah</malay>
<malay>dah nak dekat</malay>
<malay>empat tahun dah</malay>
like
this christmas [kan]
<malay>kita punya</malay> four year
anniversary
like literally on christmas
because ya he
he like
ask me out on christmas
<malay>tapi tak</malay> sweet <malay>sangat</malay> [lah] if you think of it
like it's on a christmas
a bit a bit weird [lah] like
but then it's like a reason to celebrate [lah] <malay>macam bukan</malay> celebrate christmas <malay>tapi</malay> more of like
anniversary

[orh]
[orh]
me and my boyfriend <malay>dulu</malay>
<malay>bukan dulu</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay> [lah]
we every month actually
celebrate the
like we literally go all out like we go eat expensive food
ya
<malay>tak</malay> sweet [lah] <malay>duit tak ada</malay> !oi!
!huh!
that is horrible actually
okay [lah] my boyfriend
okay okay [jer] [lah]
<malay>macam gitu</malay>
I think he's sweet
he is sweet he's very nice <malay>tapi</malay>
clingy
is the word for it
I think I'm the type
who
likes being clingy but I also have
to have the time alone
like to
to just get the energy back
I'm I'm
too used back then [lah] to be alone like being with friends
so when I was with him
when he was clingy I feel like
I'm being controlled
ya
[ah] <malay>nak makan nasi</malay> [eh]
<malay>kena tunggu</malay> [lah]
godma <malay>lama lagi</malay> !oi!
<malay>belum kahwin dah nak buat</malay> godma
<malay>belum apa-apa dah nak</malay> godma
ya that's true
I mean like
<malay>harap-harap</malay>
<malay>dalam berapa</malay>
<malay>tahun lagi</malay> [lah] <malay>tak tak lama sangat</malay> [lah]
hopefully
ya
<malay>tak ada tak ada</malay> there's no rush
I agree with that everyone has their own timeline
so
like
how is
you and your family
everything okay <malay>tak</malay>
actually
being the
eldest
<malay>susah</malay>
like very <malay>susah</malay> like
<malay>betul-betul susah gila nak mampus</malay>
you want to know why
<malay>pasal</malay> my parents
they really like instill this list of
a list of responsibilities that I have to follow
then
like
they always me you have to lead
so like everything [lah] like academically wise
<malay>pun</malay> I have to make sure I do my best
so that my brothers can
<malay>ikut</malay> [lah]
like follow the right path
ya and then my
brother's just came out
like
ya
and
<malay>tak bagus</malay>
like
ya it's it's
different [lah] like you can see
like as the years goes by my parents don't really care
about like
academic
like not as
how it used to be for me
!wow!
sweet <malay>nya</malay>
okay [lah] like <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> tips [kan] I will say
(um) you have to take
the scolding
like
<malay>tapi jangan</malay> like take it too hard [lah]
it's it's just like how they expect you to be all these <malay>tapi</malay>
just take it with a pinch of salt
like you are who you are so
[ah]
so sweet
<malay>biar betul</malay>
(uh huh)
actually have [lah] my my mother <malay>ada kata sikit</malay> like last time
<malay>bapa dia pun ada macam</malay>
you know <malay>semut</malay>
<malay>minum kencing</malay> it's actually
a sign [lah] actual
(um)
ya but then he ended up passing away
ya when I was young
so I think what you can do [kan] is
try to reduce as much [lah] <malay>jangan minum banyak sangat</malay>
<malay>minuman yang</malay>
<malay>bergula</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>tapi kita selalu makan nasi</malay> [seh] <malay>hari-hari</malay>
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau nak kata</malay>
<malay>kuah lemak</malay>
!aduh!
<malay>sakit macam mana</malay> [seh] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>bukan senang</malay> [seh] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so <malay>kalau gitu nak kena makan apa</malay> [seh]
salad [jer]
<malay>itu</malay> [lah]
<malay>mahal juga</malay> [seh]
<malay>tapi sayur-sayuran</malay> [jer] [tau]
<malay>sayur-sayuran dengan</malay> sauce
<malay>habis tu mahal gila</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>sayur-sayuran kena</malay>
<malay>kena jaga</malay> [seh]
<malay>kalau tidak akan rosak</malay>
<malay>kalau macam</malay> you know
like <malay>rosak</malay> [kan] you you call it
<malay>habis tu nanti macam</malay>
the nutrition
nutrition site
is not there
then how are you going to make sure like the money that you spend on is worth
especially if you buy a lot at one go
ya
I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
I think
it's a lot of work
like there's so many things you cannot juggle at one time
and for those who cannot multitask or or like
plan the days where a weeks well
confirm will have a hard time coping
I don't know anything about the twenty two curse
but then
I feel like
everything
it's not free [lah]
in the end
you have to work hard for it even if it's
small little things
even like let's say happiness within family
you have to work hard
to put in time effort even money
like sometimes I feel to have the happiness in family can have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family so really balance everything
sometime I feel
to have the happiness in family [kan] you have to work but then you work when you working how you gonna have time for family
so
really balance is everything
so so they they drove back home <malay>dia naik naik kereta balik ke mana</malay>
<malay>rumah dia kat mana</malay> [lah]
!huh!
<malay>biar betul</malay>
<malay>abeh dia tinggalkan</malay>
<malay>datuk dia dekat</malay>
bus stop
<malay>tapi</malay> is that <malay>macam</malay> intentionally or
so <malay>dia tak</malay>
don't want to take responsible for him
that is
really cruel
<malay>tak baiknya</malay>
but I think like
there must be some problems within the family
like rooted deep inside their family in order for this to happen
you <malay>tahu tak yang</malay> like
how you treat your parents is how you're teaching your your kids to treat you
I find that very
crazy [lah] <malay>macam</malay> it's a wild thing but then
<malay>budak-budak ni semua belajar dari mak bapa dorang</malay> [pe]
so <malay>kalau dorang kurang ajar dengan mak bapa dorang sendiri</malay>
<malay>anak dorang</malay> confirm <malay>ikut punya</malay>
<malay>ikut punya</malay>
<malay>tak akan</malay> [lah] <malay>anak tak sayang mak bapa</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> [lah]
like
<malay>kena jaga betul-betul</malay>
like when we grow old
<malay>jangan lupakan dorang</malay>
<malay>tapi sedih</malay> [tau] like I see my parents <malay>kalau dorang</malay>
like you know because my mum's
mother
so with my grandma on my mum side
<malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>tinggal sorang</malay>
I kind of
hope <malay>yang kadang-kadang dia tinggal dengan kita</malay> instead [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
she's alone <malay>dia sorang-sorang kat rumah</malay>
so if anything happens <malay>siapa nak jagakan dia</malay> [seh]
that we won't even know
so nowadays I've been trying to like
telephone <malay>dia</malay> ask her how is she all these like
just some simple talks
and she's
quite old already <malay>kaki sakit</malay>
<malay>semua tapi dia tak nak macam</malay>
she refuse to stay at home
like she's
<malay>dari dulu</malay> [tau] <malay>dari kecil dia kata</malay>
she has
has she has been going out
like
literally like working studying all these kind of stuff
<malay>bila dia dekat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>dia rasa macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh bernafas</malay>
she's too used to walking out
so like
<malay>dia kerja dekat</malay> McDonald [tau]
then she
usually <malay>hari minggu gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia kerja</malay> like
two to three days <malay>gitu tapi</malay>
because of corona then like
the
the day she worked [kan] <malay>makin sikit</malay>
so she
like weekday she don't actually
<malay>kerja</malay> [ah]
but then she still go out
<malay>pergi</malay>
#geylang# <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>pasar</malay> [lah]
just to <malay>macam jalan-jalan</malay>
<malay>abeh macam</malay>
what the heck
like
your leg
<malay>tak</malay> okay <malay>habis tu</malay>
<malay>nak jalan sini nak jalan sana habis tu kalau</malay> anything happen <malay>siapa nak</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay> [kan]
actually I
<malay>tak tahu tak berapa tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
sixty to seven no <malay>tak</malay> [lah]
seventy to eighty
around
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>bukan</malay>
<malay>tua sangat tapi macam</malay> she at that age where she get her
[eh] I don't know how old
which [ah]
ya yes
ya she
like
she already have her <malay>semua tapi tak nak duduk kat rumah macam</malay>
<malay>boleh lepak boleh macam</malay>
you work your whole entire life
<malay>kau</malay>
<malay>pergi</malay> [lah] relax <malay>sikit ke apa</malay>
you know
<malay>duduk dekat rumah</malay>
<malay>tak payah nak buat apa-apa</malay>
some more she stay alone <malay>tak akan</malay> [lah] want to work so hard also
and like not like
nobody's taking care of her [lah] like bills <malay>semua</malay>
like <malay>kita punya</malay> families <malay>semua jaga</malay> [kan]
and from bills electricity bills <malay>kita pun bayar apa</malay>
for her
I think (um)
then
<malay>kalau</malay> you [kan]
if you <malay>dah tua</malay>
<malay>dah ada duit tu semua</malay> [kan]
you <malay>nak pergi mana</malay>
<malay>ada tak tempat yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>pergi untuk tengok ke macam</malay>
scenery
or attractions <malay>tapi jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>tua sangat ke macam</malay> like forty <malay>ke</malay>
you
you know what's funny
<malay>bila</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> [kan]
even
I find
<malay>yang tembok</malay>
<malay>tembok tu cantik</malay> [tau]
like you know those bricks
I will take photos of those bricks
an (err) we like !whoa!
like I don't know I I think like
the culture there is different okay [lah] <malay>dorang</malay> racists from what I heard
they are racists <malay>tapi macam</malay> their culture like how they move is like very free
very simple
like
I don't even like
<malay>teh</malay>
tea is not my thing
but then I I
keep thinking about it's like
[oh] ya the ferris wheel the houses
the <malay>tembok tembok tembok</malay> bricks
<malay>tak faham</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
there's something that is
calling out to me
true [lah]
that's true
<malay>tapi</malay> like
now that
<malay>ada lagi ramai orang tua dari orang muda</malay> [kan]
(um) this <malay>orang-orang tua semua ni</malay> [kan] <malay>kena kerja keras pasal</malay>
economy
depends on them also
and I think
birth rate
we cannot do anything about it [lah]
I mean
I have seen
like <malay>tengok</malay>
family <malay>dengan lima anak</malay>
<malay>abeh</malay> I <malay>pun macam tertanya</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
would this be something I would want
in the future
they look like
they're struggling
like
[ah] even the government helping them <malay>pasal macam</malay> like you can see [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
you look at these families
and then you like
<malay>tak tahu</malay> family planning <malay>ke apa</malay>
like okay maybe they they love kids <malay>dorang sayangkan anak-anak</malay>
they they really like
kids <malay>tapi</malay>
like
are they doing well
like
it seems very chaotic <malay>macam dorang tak tentu arah</malay>
especially when you see them
in public
you wonder about their well being
is it weird that I think that way
but I think
<malay>dorang betul-betul suka</malay> [lah] <malay>anak-anak semua</malay>
<malay>tu pasal dorang</malay>
you can see like they're
they're okay
like the kids are like happy and everything I think a a big happy family is
something
I would want in the future honestly
but then not so big [lah] <malay>tak nak besar sangat</malay>
<malay>nanti siapa nak jaga</malay> [seh] <malay>nak kerja habis tu nak kena</malay>
<malay>takkan nak</malay>
rely on
maid
I I think like
in the future right okay
the thing that is driving me to work hard [kan]
is that
I don't have in the future if I don't work work well
I can just get a maid
is that weird
like
I <malay>tak boleh masak</malay> I <malay>tak boleh</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak kemas rumah</malay> [tau] <malay>sebenarnya</malay>
so I've been living with a maid
so like if
I have that taken away from me
I <malay>rasa</malay>
<malay>tak tentu arah</malay> like I don't know
I don't know how to cook I don't how to clean
so if I have kids in the future
<malay>siapa nak jaga</malay> [seh] so I have to
<malay>bekerja keras</malay>
<malay>betul juga</malay>
hopefully I can get into a university
I have been
for now <malay>tengah cari kerja nak</malay> sustain
financially
some maybe <malay>dapat</malay>
hopefully [lah] <malay>dapat</malay>
scholarship <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>kejadah</malay> scholarship <malay>untuk tolong</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> [lah]
ya
ya
hopefully [ah] like
ya
actually I have
<malay>pun tak faham sangat dorang</malay> [tau] <malay>dorang punya</malay> subject <malay>macam mana</malay> how you
find all these like
<malay>pilih apa</malay>
but I do have a
plan in mind
on what I want to do <malay>apa</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay>
<malay>dulu</malay> I
<malay>selalu</malay> go with the flow [tau] like I had I had the mindset <malay>ni</malay> to just go with the flow
maybe that's why I
you know took a break
I
I took like a one year break
before I start
working
<malay>pasal kerja pun</malay>
you have to know
<malay>nak buat apa</malay>
so
good thing that actually found something that I want to try out
I <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>kerja keras</malay>
in that area
ya
<malay>bila</malay>
I also
<malay>tapi</malay>
that one year right
cause a snowball effect to [tau] <malay>tu pasal</malay> I
<malay>belum lagi masuk</malay>
university
<malay>dapat</malay> degree
<malay>pasal</malay> I see all my friends
<malay>kawan-kawan</malay> [kan]
<malay>semua dah habis</malay> degree [tau]
and then
I here waiting one more year to start on my degree
is that weird
<malay>betul</malay>
you <malay>nak tahu tahu</malay> you <malay>tahu tak</malay>
I <malay>malam-malam</malay> [kan]
<malay>kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>fikir</malay> [tau]
<malay>kenapa</malay> I <malay>ambil</malay>
that one year gap
like
<malay>kalau</malay> I
put in effort to really go all out [kan]
I would have been so much happier
I do feel depressed when I think of it
and it makes me sad
I didn't know you took a one year break also
ya I thought you were studying or working
november [jer] [pe] you know
I
didn't do anything I <malay>tunggukan</malay> boyfriend [jer]
like literally
no
I bet you didn't know that
ya
my savings I used to have savings
yes
that's true
I <malay>betul-betul harap</malay>
<malay>dorang</malay> accept I
<malay>pasal</malay> [kan]
that's what I've been looking at
like to get my experiences and maybe use that as one of the factors to why they should
accept me to the university [lah]
I know it's gonna be tough <malay>tapi</malay>
I <malay>kena cuba</malay>
like if not now <malay>bila</malay>
!wow!
thank you
ya
that's the thing I don't know how to look at their courses
like I know what I want to do but I don't know like you know this
honours thing and then what minor
I <malay>perlukan pertolongan</malay> [lah] in that area
I hoping to get marketing

<malay>sebenarnya</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kerja</malay> I <malay>dulu</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> you know like
<malay>pasal kita nak</malay> experiences [kan] they think they don't really take us
like
seriously
just because we have many experiences with different companies
<malay>tapi</malay> actually I think <malay>yang</malay> if it is a very good
like
okay like it also depends on the company they how they think
<malay>pasal</malay> if
you have a lot of experiences
in that sense
you can help the company
the future company
in all these
areas
like maybe to improve you know
better

like lesser or something you know like
<malay>tapi</malay>
it's hard [lah]
to to know how does the hiring works
<malay>tapi</malay> did you know that I mention
like I <malay>kata tadi</malay> like
even intern job <malay>dorang minta</malay> experiences
that is the funny part to me [lah] <malay>pasal dorang nak</malay> experiences <malay>tapi</malay>
they are not okay with
<malay>orang yang</malay>
is
categorised under job hoppers
so how are you supposed to be like a
graduate
with already experiences
like let's say they are looking for
did you see this advertisement job advertisement
they say they want someone in the twenties
but with like ten years of experience
ya that it was like going around in on the internet for awhile like
they ask so you <malay>boleh</malay> imagine <malay>tak</malay> like
you expect to be like
ten plus like in your teens
and already start working or something
I have no idea
that's one of my wish
that's one of my wish [lah] in life like
I just want to have a job
that I'm happy to wake up to
I think
it's really hard to find
<malay>tapi</malay> you gotta
you gotta work hard for it [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
it's also depends on your mentality
how you have
like what's your outlook of life
which
is hard to change honestly
that's a very good question actually <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] talking about movies
you want a genre <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>suka tak</malay>
I <malay>suka</malay>
<malay>cerita</malay>
<malay>seram</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>penakut</malay>
<malay>selalu</malay>
<malay>perlukan itu</malay> [lah] <malay>bantal</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> cover <malay>muka</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] actually
illegal
illegal movies I don't know [lah] no [lah] it's not illegal it's more of like they uploaded on internet let let's say I come upon to it you know
and then I'll be interested in it and then
you know I've I've watch all the
conjuring series
ya
no I don't
I <malay>tengok</malay>
stranger things
it's good
like okay like in in my
in my
it's it's
horror like not really horror it's like thriller <malay>tapi</malay>
they're kids
so they're cute
like
like what they do is like something we can
relate to
I think everything is nicer with someone else
it's okay you'll
you <malay>akan jumpa jodoh</malay> you <malay>juga</malay> trust me
god has
plans for you
so <malay>tak payah tak payah nak sedih-sedih semua</malay>

I can foresee you being happy in the future [lah]
so
okay back
to stranger things
you <malay>ada</malay> Netflix <malay>tak</malay>
okay <malay>tengok</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak akan</malay> obsessed <malay>punya</malay> [lah] confirm like okay
actually game game <malay>ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> you start you <malay>memang suka</malay>
<malay>tapi bila dah kelamaan</malay> [kan]
you <malay>rasa macam</malay> !alamak! boring [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
but
what
caught me caught my attention until like
I <malay>nak main hari-hari</malay>
at first okay I think they will start because of the hype
<malay>tapi</malay>
then you get the fun out of it because
you <malay>dapat buat kawan</malay>
<malay>berbual dengan dorang</malay>
<malay>habis tu</malay>
you kind of have this friendship with them so like it's more of like
you <malay>tak nak</malay>
quit the game because
you have friends
to be there for you already
so like if you cut
the game out your life [kan]
you <malay>rasa macam</malay>
you're cutting
<malay>kawan-kawan</malay> you <malay>juga</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak main</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak apa</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> control [kan] you
I <malay>akan tolong</malay> you
ya
I
<malay>ada main</malay>
on my four
<malay>tapi</malay> like
some level [kan] I <malay>tak boleh</malay>
overcome
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau</malay> I <malay>main dengan adik</malay>
I
you know I <malay>maki dia</malay>

<malay>ada orang kena maki punya</malay>
the younger one
youngest
[ah] <malay>dia tak main</malay> [lah] <malay>dia main</malay> FIFA
I <malay>rasa</malay> that you should
invest
in a game
like like literally okay let's
you don't have to buy a four you can buy a switch
I think that's
the easier way that you save money
eventually if you were to play play nation all the time
I <malay>tak</malay> invest I <malay>tak buat</malay> investment <malay>tapi</malay> my boyfriend does it
<malay>dia</malay>
<malay>tapi dia</malay>
<malay>dia dia tak</malay> okay at first
<malay>dia ada banyak duit</malay> [kan] <malay>abeh dia</malay> invest
I wasted that money <malay>duit tu</malay> [jer] <malay>pakai untuk</malay> investment <malay>abeh dia tak ada duit untuk macam</malay> spend
the invest on
ya he's he's hoping to get dividends <malay>tapi</malay> like he spends a lot
<malay>dia dah pakai banyak duit</malay> [tau] <malay>untuk macam</malay> invest <malay>habis tu dia nak</malay>
rely on dividends
<malay>abeh dia tak duit macam</malay> savings in case of emergency
actually I not so sure
<malay>pasal</malay>
