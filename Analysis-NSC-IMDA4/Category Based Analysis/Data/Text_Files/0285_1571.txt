okay
alright <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay so basically <malay>aku tanya</malay> (uh) whoever living at my place first to do this [lah] cause I thought need to do at my house
then I <malay>aku</malay> call <malay>siapa</malay> #ham# boy <malay>dengan</malay> (uh) I they technically live near my place [what] so easier so I call them <malay>dua dua tak nak buat</malay>
I actually [oh] my god I forgot to tell ham he told me (uh) <malay>dia nak fikir dulu</malay>
and ya he say he want to think about it first
but I mean come on [ah]
I rather do it now with you then wait for his reply what you know what I mean
because
I'm not sure whether because they say the spots are filling up very fast
[ah] <malay>nanti kita</malay> sign up then wasted <malay>tak dapat macam mana</malay>
so I say that to him [lah]
no is based on <malay>macam</malay> first come first basis
(mm)
okay basically (err) my friend <malay>hantar aku ni</malay> okay before that she wanted me to go for a debate
so they were looking for people to debate [lah] like eighty
eighty dollars if you get
[ah] I'm not sure whether per debate or what because I mean I love to debate [what]
so (uh)
<malay>sekali</malay> suddenly she just sent me this [lah] so I actually thought this was a debate
[ah] so <malay>aku</malay> so I ask my mum first if she allow she say okay
then I [ah] call you [lah] (uh) I was looking for people [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #ham# boy
(err) I
actually one of my friend who stay <malay>kat</malay>
<malay>rumah</malay>
[ah] very near right <malay>tapi dia tak nak</malay>
like I don't I don't get some people <malay>punya</malay> mindset <malay>macam</malay>
you just need to talk for one hour
with me
we've known each other for how many years
twelve seven years
<malay>tak</malay> [kan] <malay>satu jam pun tak boleh berbual</malay>
you know what I mean
maybe maybe maybe
alright okay so
<malay>sekolah amacam</malay>
(mm)
seriously [ah]
okay
okay we don't talk about [lah] [eh]
is (err)
that's yes correct that's the main reason why I left
(uh huh)
[ah] right
that's the thing [ah]
[oh] my god <malay>teruk</malay>
<malay>merepek</malay> no no no seriously
even
but government allow sport activity [what]
[ah] actually <malay>aku</malay> call <malay>kawan aku ni pasal</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> because the thing why they don't want [ah] ask you first is because you live very far away I thought you need to come and to my place
[ah]
so I call this guy he's known for speaking [ah] good malay
(uh) to mix we always mix
[ah] always any conversation we have automatic <malay>kita selalu</malay> mix <malay>gini</malay> mix <malay>gitu</malay> mix <malay>gini</malay> mix <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah]
[a'ah] it's very standard [ah]
(err) okay so three wishes
I would wish
to have (err)
army style discipline
okay
because
correct but it takes a lot of work
and you know me I'm a very lazy person
okay okay okay [lah] let's stop like unrealistic not unrealistic but
things which are not reachable our wishes okay
I would wish
[oh] my god
you know what
<malay>kita tukar</malay> question [jer] [ah]
<malay>tukar</malay> question
okay next question
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk
why do you like what what what were your dreams or what are your dreams
ya can can
(mm) [ah] okay okay
so
let me guess <malay>kau kene kerja</malay> for
very hard for maybe a few years before you can actually like you know
settle down relax there K <malay>dah</malay> settled
something like that
[ah] alright alright alright alright I understand I understand
me
basically right if I were to follow my dreams
I would drop my (err) future [lah]
basically my livelihood
because that K basically I really want to
[ah] be a professional sports player
okay
(uh huh)
a professional sports player maybe soccer football K we talk about soccer [lah] cause
they have very good prospect in a sense
(err) but the thing is if at this age I were to like you know try
maybe I'll take one to two years mean at least twenty plus then I'll be in a professional team
but in the meantime who's gonna pay for my livelihood
for example if I made it big who's gonna before I make it big who's gonna pay for my part maybe I want play in a England who gonna pay for my flight there accommodation food
[ah] so before that success I have to
the risk basically my parents money [lah]
[ah]
ya that that's another thing
because
okay let's not talk into specific [lah] but
Singapore soccer is a no no [lah]
even ex players also tell me is I don't know like for leisure leisure okay [lah] <malay>tapi nak</malay>
commit and [ah] <malay>macam apa</malay>
all macam #haziq#
[ah] that's a bit unrealistic the passion is (uh) actually is that I understand I used to have that passion but to be realistic and have a livelihood in Singapore using that kind of (err)
career pathway so called
it is not realistic to have a easy life [lah]
[ah]
alright
sorry
[ah] true true Malaysia pay better
(um)
[ah] but then <malay>nak cakap dorang bayar ke tak tu lain cerita</malay> [lah]
but I mean it is what it is
yeah
alright
next question if you have any unusual superpower what would it be
ya basically any superpower [ah]
but why though
police police are you all hearing this police
me I would love to teleport [ah]
anywhere and everywhere
!wah! so I don't have to think about being late
so I don't have to pay for transport
actually basically it's about being late [lah] I don't want to be late [lah]
ya so for example [ah]
my parents ask me to be home by seven
six fifty nine I <malay>aku dah kat rumah</malay>
six fifty nine
if possible at six fifty nine point fifty nine
the fifty nine second <malay>aku dah kat rumah</malay>
(mm)
no
I mean it looks
interesting honestly it looks interesting
but I am watching a more
not realistic more historical drama
basically I'm I'm watching [ah]
it is a
historical turkish drama so basically before how they found turkish the ottoman empire right how to ottoman empire started
this is how this is the drama about [lah]
[ah]
so they talk about the <malay>dulu orang</malay> Turkey <malay>macam mana macam mana dorang</malay> settle <malay>hal</malay>
(uh) <malay>rumah tangga</malay>
(uh) <malay>musuh</malay>
<malay>cucuk belakang</malay> and all [ah] [oh] my god I tell you
it is an emotional story
(um) sad
<malay>berbual pasal sedih ada</malay>
<malay>marah sampai nak</malay> bang table <malay>ada</malay> serious serious it it was all emotion
but
no it's a series series
(mm) but the first two seasons super draining
super draining cause they go through torture after torture after torture
yeah
(hmm)
okay let's see
if you found a time capsule from yourself ten years ago
what would be inside
wait what
if
okay I I don't understand this question do you
if you could turn back time
[oh]
I think they should put
if you could turn back them where would you go to
that will be an easy answer
I will turn back to
primary four
why
because basically I got first in class [ah] in primary three right
okay
it was a fluke I didn't study and it was a super fluke seriously
so I got first in class so I got confident so sorry primary five primary five
so primary four I was like you know competing with this guy that guy <malay>macam</malay> the race to become first in class [ah]
then I got first in class again in primary four you know
then <malay>sekali</malay> come to primary five <malay>dah kerek</malay> [kan] two years in a row [ah] don't need study [ah] #lepak# [ah]
it's time to blend in because I I won't I didn't blend blend in well (err) in primary school
[ah] because
(um)
how to say [eh]
I might have been a little bit of a smart alec
so people generally disliked me actually
yup
no [lah] I mean that that's the problem [ah] because
back then
if I didn't I hadn't had this issue and I didn't I wasn't arrogant
I wouldn't have (err) you know
instead of the okay <malay>sekarang kita dah</malay> first in class [eh] <malay>kita</malay> focus [jer] how to be best in the cohort
I was like there are these people dislike me I want to blend in with them
so <malay>aku</malay> start <malay>bergaul dengan dorang</malay> be like them
#lepak# <malay>kat luar</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tak belajar</malay> after oral
<malay>dorang semua balik</malay>
<malay>aku main</malay> catching
[ah] prank <malay>orang punya rumah ketuk pintu lari</malay> you know
you knock the door get out of the staircase go down
[ah] play soccer at the void deck all [lah] so
I will change my mindset [lah] but then without this the the thing is the thing about life right
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kita punya</malay>
past <malay>tak terjadi</malay>
it wouldn't us in the future
so that's the thing I'm like if I could turn back time would I turn back time
but if this didn't happen I wouldn't be like this you know what I mean
yes definitely
because
I hate this [ah] cliche phrase
but as annoying and cliche and you know like <malay>jijik</malay> as it is
it's true [ah] what doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I mean basically that song was over how do you say over hyped
like you know for example [ah] that song is good
but then a lot of people start to sing it before you even get to hear it is like !wah!
I'm not gonna listen to it because people make it sound so annoying for example
I still remember this song payphone
it was a famous song it was not bad of a song [ah] [kan] maroon five is one of the
yeah one of the good guys
but because of people around like payphone I'm like no I'm not gonna listen to it
[ah]
<malay>tapi kau tahu apa lebih teruk tak</malay>
what's worse is you hate a song
like you are that early not early founders [ah] basically before other people hear and it's overhyped you hear this
then people start [eh] you know this song or not but you are thinking these songs like two three weeks ago
but then after two three weeks then people start to hype it like this song [ah]
old town road
so
I think I've not formerly I was I listen to it because [ah] there was this video playing that song [ah] so like [oh] not bad the the the song is quite catchy okay
I go search old town road K [ah] I put it in my playlist for like one two weeks
I removed from my playlist then people start telling me about this song I'm like
it's in my heart I'm like excuse me
<malay>kau zaman bila ni</malay>
you know but I'm like [oh] ya [eh] nice song nice song [ah]
so it's damn annoying [ah] actually
please please please don't talk about our campus radio
I'm I'm glad he didn't join
we should have been the [lah]
yeah [oh] my god <malay>dorang punya cara berbual</malay>
okay [lah] okay [lah] we cannot throw shades [lah] okay let's not throw shades alright
yeah
okay we have a very good question here
what is the one thing that you wish was free
(mm)
yeah
make sense
yeah precisely
yeah
you know what's worse actually
transport is another matter I feel what needs to be free is healthcare
for those who can't afford it
yeah
because you know
(um)
some countries let's not name them
the price
is horrible
and
some countries [ah] will want you to pay first before the surgery happen imagine right a heart surgery
critical surgery
some (um) country [ah] they you need to pay first know <malay>walaupun berapa</malay> critical <malay>apa dah nazak ke pe</malay> you need to pay first before the surgery happen
(mm)
ya
precisely
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's a sensitive (uh) topic
okay
let's see next question [eh]
if humans no longer need to work to survive what would we do (mm) very good question
ya we K basically right
what you're trying to say here is like so called
like <malay>dulu punya</malay> time [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> yeah people work work but they work for
for K for example <malay>orang dulu</malay> we they can have chicken they can have cows and all that
so their work is technically just taking care of their their herds [lah]
so in return they get is
food
correct
so actually if you think about it
you don't need to work
you have a few cow sheep chicken
(um) rice
all yours
what do you need to worry about
think about it what do human need
let me phrase that ya what <malay>apa manusia kena ada supaya kita hidup</malay>
food water air
precisely
but because of the modernisation of
the world
people find a need [ah] okay I want a
iphone
because it's the best
and [ah] okay basically iphone is good [lah] those who have it is good but I want a latest iphone because a new one just came out I wanna keep up with the trend
(um) shirt let's spend five thousand dollars on a piece of shirt
which I can get for ten dollars at #pasar malam#
and then
shoe (uh) twenty thousand [lah]
you know [ah] Off-white with Gucci and maybe Versace
yeah
my pants I would spend about two thousand dollars because the materials you know the material actually
I also don't know what the material but it costs two thousand means it's good right
you know something
my friend was talking about someone who
[ah] bought a very expensive car [lah]
(uh) so recently so I was like
okay
so
they are like [eh] you know this this and this bought this and this I'm like [oh] okay so
because like
come on think about it think about it you buy a fast car
in Singapore how fast you wanna go
two hundred kilometre power
you buy something not to make full use of it
this will happen when you got too much money [lah]
you want to show off
and all
give me their money [lah] I can put to better use
okay [oh] yes sorry
(mm)
(uh)
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>dia punya masalah yang betul</malay> [kan] is actually <malay>apa</malay> [tau]
life <malay>hidup</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> life is so simple
but people just live to complicate it
we don't talk about now we talk about ten years from this since the creation of mankind <malay>ada je masalah</malay>
[ah]
so I guess this is the challenges in life you have to face [lah]
that's harsh but
you gotta do what you gonna do [lah] right
alright next question
[oh] this is a good question what everyday activity would be a torture if you had to do it for eight hours straight
everyday activity [lah] <malay>bukan kerja ke apa macam</malay> K for me
for me eating
like
if I'm full
and I don't want to waste food
it is a torture for me
so imagine have to do it for eight hours [oh] my god
[oh] my god I can't imagine it
I think that's the best tortures someone can give me
yeah
I mean K
the thing is yes there are good foods and like for example if a food is good I can eat four times
but
if the food is mediocre one time is enough but even if I were to eat a very nice food right
<malay>nanti muak</malay> [pe]
and what <malay>jelak sama</malay> [jer] [lah]
yeah
ya so like
like they say [ah] everything in moderation is good
no that was that is to
do a certain
ya so that's understandable
[eh] <malay>kau tahu itu hari aku mimpi</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal sekolah</malay>
I guess so I was dreaming this
you were at the table the setting was different [lah]
but the shop and what they sell is is correct
so basically I went to queue for guess guess
what would I buy
yes burger
I was dreaming of the burger but I was thinking the burger in the dream
<malay>macam apa tau dia punya ayam</malay> doesn't look good <malay>dia punya telur</malay> doesn't look good
so I'm like [eh] so there's now two shops [eh]
<malay>yang mana lebih sedap</malay> which one looks more appetising because for me
the most important thing in a food
is the look
if I were to try new food [lah] outside food the look is so important
(mm) (mm)
and
(mm)
is that even a question
of course I would come unless I got [ah]
hopefully
[oh] you know what I just want to come [lah]
(um) next month
yeah
if you are wondering why I'm looking at the right right
like you know I'm not looking here because basically the main screen is here but you are at the second screen
(err) [oh] okay okay [oh] okay okay
okay (hmm)
[oh] okay what is the pettiest reason that you would like to dislike someone [eh] sorry sorry sorry
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
(mm)
face
same same same same same
yeah
but ya
I mean it's true but for me I I guess I guess in my opinion
I feel like I have a
intuition that I can read people face so like I know [oh] <malay>muka gini</malay> [ah] <malay>gini</malay> [ah] <malay>orangnya</malay>
some people just the face
it's like you know how they say a picture tells you a thousand words or thousand things yeah I guess I I implement that to people face [ah]
like [oh] <malay>muka dia macam gini rambut dia macam gini</malay> [oh] <malay>macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>orang dia</malay>
okay I wouldn't say expert because
(err) I mean if I say I'm an expert that will be bragging right
so <malay>tak</malay> [ah] so basically I can tell you two experiences in my life which I was wrong
first
okay the first one was the first was quite right [lah]
because
I see him I think he's like that we got close
then we our way then he is like that
so I guess in a way it's it's right but the one I'm wrong is you
I expected you to be a super <malay>mat rep</malay>
your hair
it's your hair
your hair compliment your face when you first came in school
but come on [lah] it was like what blonde
(err) <malay>perang perang</malay> [kan]
so actually !alamak! confirm <malay>mat rep</malay> [eh] <malay>fikir dia siapa</malay> [sia]
then I was like
[ah] see [ah] this [one] [ah]
see a lot of her classmates like that already
but when I got to know you all you all are the best people in
you have to admit [ah]
as strenuous as three as our course is
we have the best people
in our course yes
but compared to other course compared to other course we are like
pretty little rascals
like for example try what we do go to engineering course I think the <malay>apa</malay> the headmaster <malay>apa</malay>
course head [eh] <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] the
[eh] don't do this [lah]
you know what I mean you are like come on [lah] you know what
guys you will get caught next time
but #kena# our
you wanna get expelled is it
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
but did you do it
yes
I knew it
but I mean for you twenty classes or twenty opportunities to look for the right one
<malay>kau</malay> confirm <malay>menyesal sikt kenapa</malay> #hamizan# <malay>tak ingat</malay>
no comments
(um) okay
let's see
what is the pet sorry we went through that already okay
if you can instantly master three new skills what would that be
what would they be
I
(um)
for me
mike ross
yes photographic at absolute best memory
everything I hear everything I see is in my head
I want to that kind of memory
(um)
can [ah] but how long want to train
yeah
that's first second is (err)
skill [eh]
what skill [eh] <malay>apa kita boleh buat</malay> let me see let me see
maths
[ah] I am good at cracking jokes
I already master that since I was like primary school so
but maths [ah] maths [ah] like you know people who need the calculator and like
you go shop then got a lot of (uh) discount this discount that interest this interest that
that is inevitable so like when they calculate I calculate it must tally so that they cannot cheat me [ah]
[ah]
I straight away you give me okay twenty percent of this with ten percent of that then minus zero point eight percent of this then you get this this this this this I want to have it in my head
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya but not the maths that we use like you know what I mean
like depends depends depends
algebra would be used for those algebraic works
but plus minus times divide
<malay>itu penting paling penting paling mustahak</malay>
yes
okay
<malay>aku tengah tengok dia orang punya</malay> question
it's good [lah] they give a few
so that we don't run out of things to talk about
okay did
okay wait let me search the meaning of this word retrospect
!alamak! cannot search [ah]
what is do you have any idea what's the meaning of retrospect
I mean I heard of it before tapi <malay>macam</malay>
actually I heard but I don't know the meaning [lah]
K retrospect
a survey or review for past course of events [oh] basically
a remembrance of a past course of event
that you feel is funny but at that time is not funny
okay I got one
so me and cyprus skip class <malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>cerita ni</malay>
and <malay>terjumpa</malay> fabian
okay
so
that is my first time meeting fabian okay
you all told me he was scary he was this he was that
so he would I mean I didn't laugh but inside my heart I was laugh but after that when I leave the office I also laugh
but then it's not funny [lah] okay we skip class
then you know his (uh) <malay>dia punya cara marah macam mana</malay> [kan] see he will talk nicely then suddenly he shout
then you remember remember the joke
take out the ring take out the lanyard
put hand on our table look at both of us he always do that
ya ya ya ya
but if you think about it if you think about it is actually
a scolding [ah] a serious scolding [ah]
but
sometimes you gotta take
the silver lining of a bad situation right
I deserve the scolding
okay but
I gotta cheer myself up
<malay>takde</malay> [lah]
[ah]
I mean
it's hard [lah] it's hard
yeah
damn but
[oh] my god I miss class
ninety percent of people I miss [lah] definitely
ninety percent
that that ten percent
you cannot talk about it [lah] [eh] let's not throw shade to people [lah] [eh]
but [oh] my god I miss our class with
(uh) #ham# boy
S&W
(uh)
you only spend time when [ah]
actually you only spend time when we going home so I miss going home with you [lah]
like that we really sit down and talk
[ah]
[ah] yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean I was [ah]
I was always with cyprus and at that point of time I was like you know researching about laptops [lah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so I mean it it it comes in handy
but not every time [lah]
[ah] definitely <malay>adalah orang nak beli</malay> laptop so I can them like bombard them
[ah]
but
come on it was something super unexpected
but is the biggest reason is because
okay we were O level students correct
you were you were you were right you were O levels what okay what
is our true purpose of
(um) graduating from secondary school for O levels student
like what is our so called rite
poly or correct
so okay [lah]
maybe O level we couldn't do well
because of certain subjects at maths science I don't know what else okay
(err)
ya okay then you have to go to okay
then from where's where's the next destination
precisely but my grades are not good enough to even you know try to get into a <malay>apa</malay>
so <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh] my god
I when I never study I get this but when I study
I get zero point zero two
points better like <malay>apalah nak jadi</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay> [lah] <malay>hidup macam ni</malay>
you know what I mean
but
it's for me is <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] like I I can't believe [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
K [ah] <malay>kalau gini dah tak boleh masuk</malay> poly [kan] what what's the point
[ah]
and I have better options [ah] I have better prospect so
obviously [ah] <malay>kita macam</malay> you know what
if I'm gonna go this way
<malay>kita punya</malay> pathway <malay>macam gini</malay> [jer]
but if I choose another way I got better potential so I did the right thing but was hard thing to do [ah] to leave you all
but do you know what made it easier
because I hated every moment of
one week then I didn't come for another one week
ya <malay>macam</malay> is <malay>merepek bila kita kat sekolah dorang bagi kerja masih sikit</malay> [jer]
you know what I mean
<malay>abeh kalau kat rumah</malay> I mean K fine fine it's true we are free we are more free
but you don't push a big
lump sum of work to us just because we are free we are not
accustomed to that [what] you know what I mean
like giving
precisely I <malay>aku</malay> it is
I find it super <malay>merepek</malay>
so it it made me like [oh] you know what [ah] so tiring [ah] <malay>malas</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>tak leh</malay> [ah] <malay>tak leh</malay> [ah]
so
true [lah] true
yeah
<malay>abeh</malay> come by my house [lah] one once in a while
I really busy but if you come I can make time for you because K basically right now I'm more free [ah]
cause I'm laying low a bit
[ah] I'm relaxing a bit
gathering myself for bigger things [lah] in the future
(mm) so you can actually come down
<malay>dah kat kat mana</malay>
three more right
(mm)
alright alright I I will look forward I will look forward then will be here for
!huh!
[eh] #kim# <malay>cam</malay>

<malay>kalau kau tanya aku</malay> [eh] (mm)
okay <malay>kalau kau tanya aku</malay> this about
now I'm nineteen right maybe nine years ago
okay with me in my teens thirteen I mean I'm still my teens but
when I still interested in sports
definitely fit body
hundred percent
because I could go far
I really could go far but
like that [lah] this I guess this my fate [lah]
so if
in the past yeah fit body now [ah]
whatever god give me I'll take [lah]
like (uh) whatever it is [lah] good looks fit body
but now I'm going to so I guess I have to choose fit body again [lah]
like know because
if they give us like pre before you <malay>masuk</malay> right
<malay>dorang kata</malay> if we pass we get two months off know
<malay>siapa tak nak</malay>
[ah] but [oh] my god you ask me to you ask me to run okay sit up manageable but I'm just not a upper upper body strength guy
that's why that's why like I don't play
hyper transport
and even if I do play right the roads I play are very
suit to my body [lah] like
okay for example <malay>kalau</malay> soccer we don't need upper body strength technically technically
we don't need upper body strength
<malay>kalau</malay> basketball [oh] definitely [ah] you need upper body strength [ah] but that means
like I pay for competition <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>kau tahu kawan aku suruh buat apa</malay>
#izzul# <malay>kau jangan</malay> pass <malay>kau jangan</malay> shoot [eh] sorry sorry sorry
you don't pass don't shoot [eh]
don't pass
don't need
just defend the ball
because I'm the fastest guy in court
so it's annoying [lah] because
fastest
sometimes means the best but I'm the fastest but not the best
no no no K basically in basketball [kan] <malay>kalau kau main</malay>
if you look at the oppunent team [eh]
the best is usually the fastest
[ah] but then you put
myself in my shoe you put yourself in my shoe I'm the fastest but I'm not the best in fact the worst [ah] offensively
[ah]
so
but I have to keep up with those (uh) because yeah basketball is technically new to me I started playing like what four years ago only and people have been playing since primary school
so my game and <malay>dorang punya</malay> game <malay>tak sama</malay> definitely they are better game sense than me
okay that's one
so I'm not exposed to
basketball as much as them so they can do things
not to my knowledge <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang buat ni aku tak boleh</malay> counter
and you tell me okay so just do this do this do that but then I still can't do it because I'm just not (um)
used to it [ah] like I'm not exposed to it [what]
[ah]
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) yes
okay
there's one good question
actually not one good question I've been saying that for the past few questions
if you were to eat one dish
for the rest of your life what would it be
for the rest of your life
for me
<malay>punya nasi ayam</malay>
<malay>dengan dorang punya sayur</malay>
for the rest of my life bro
<malay>tak kira apa-apa</malay> [lah]
frugal [eh]
the one near the bus stop to go to
yes yes yes
super cheap super affordable bro I add extra chicken with K
I bought one plate
of a one set you know with the vegetable and all
add extra chicken add extra rice costs me less than
seven eight dollars
less than that no five six dollars you know
where you're gonna get in Singapore
your house [lah] because free [what]
right
[oh] chicken rice for the win bro
funny [ah] you
nah
nah nah nah nah nah
poly is not my thing anymore studying is not my thing anymore !chey!
[oh] I mean you want to go there to eat chicken rice I will probably get scolded by my parents
but I don't mind
you know because (uh) you have to understand in Singapore <malay>susah nak dapat</malay> natural food even it comes to the most natural thing
chicken
beef
[ah]
correct so parents <malay>aku suka apa</malay> [tau] they like (err)
#kampung# chicken they make sure it's from a
not say #kampung# [lah] but you know #kampung# means they bring it up naturally
[ah] it it it you don't have to worry about the
others [lah]
(uh)
correct correct
yes yes
so they are very particular when it comes to food because it's the basic survival [what] the basic survival need

okay maybe it's oxygen
maybe [ah] I don't know it's been a long time K last time I I we use that was like primary six I think
yeah
<malay>kau punya</malay> okay [ah] let me see [eh]
what do you think of the COVID situation now
sometimes better is not enough right
then
ya !wah! I mean
true [lah] true
then <malay>tak tahu dapat dorang punya</malay> salary <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>dorang punya</malay> families <malay>kat</malay> overseas <malay>macam mana</malay>
but you
you you know something that I wish they could implement in Singapore because of this COVID nineteen situation
every store
okay or at least those super crowded store
that people will go to
have a
book reservation <malay>punya</malay>
(uh) system
so we don't have to queue and wait
what time they give they allow us to be there we'll be there
but be strict [ah]
we book from this time to this time exactly at that time you must leave
[ah]
correct
(mmhmm)
(um)
<malay>kalau dorang buat ni</malay> [eh] <malay>kalau dorang buat ni kan</malay>
<malay>dorang punya</malay> tracking system <malay>pun senang tau</malay> actually you know what implement to all shops

this is the problem right find solution [lah]
not run away or not just like you know what
I don't care
let's just open our shop we need to make money
this the thing about Singapore cause every single thing cause money
every single thing
of course every country but there are countries who [ah]
how to say handle this quite well very very well in fact
ya but
I mean
it is what it is [lah] [ah]
so we just have to take care of ourselves [lah] that's why you know [ah] like
honestly this phase two open my eyes a lot [ah] like
actually we don't have to go out always
okay [lah] playing sports and all is a different thing [lah] you need to you know move because like <malay>berapa hari lepas</malay> [kan] <malay>aku kat rumah je aku macam dah tak leh tahan</malay>
