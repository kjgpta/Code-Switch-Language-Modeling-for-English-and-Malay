I actually can go back to my actually I can go back to my
uncle's shop actually I can go back to my uncle's shop and and work with him and or work
you know but I don't I I don't feel like doing that [lah] so
so lately last week last week I actually applied for
I actually applied to work in seven eleven actually
ya I actually that I actually thought (um) monday since since (uh) like
monday and friday I'm not schooling right so
I mean okay [lah] the whole week actually I thought I thought everyday I can work part time like
from at at night [lah] night shift like I can work from eleven to
(err) eleven to I think
seven [ah] seven seven eleven near
near my house [lah] near my house like
ya so I actually applied for the job but
but funny funny [leh] I I didn't
I didn't get a reply [ah] they didn't reply me it's actually
I thought <malay>macam</malay> I thought like I thought
<malay>macam</malay> like seven eleven jobs is easy to get [kan] but
but ya even I applied for seven eleven also I didn't get [seh] I didn't I didn't they didn't even call me back so
I applied for I applied for part time at yamaha also my old job [kan]
[ah] yamaha music asia I applied
then they called me back they say you're (err) ex staff right you're an an an an ex staff right then
I said ya then how come you want to apply for part time then I explain to them like I'm schooling right now then like I
ya I'm studying audio also so [ah] it's easy for me to
to work somewhere in (uh) plaza <malay>singapura</malay> [lah] plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then I can (err) it's
something for me something I got experience in right then I I can I can do it
easier [lah] so they they actually called me two times they already sent my name
to they asked me which (uh) which location you prefer
then
!huh!
ya so I I I actually applied for the that one right the the
the the yamaha one be a second time you call me you see which which area you can go eat exit policy
second they called me they say which [ah] which area you'd like to work in then I said plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then
they send my resume to plaza <malay>singapura</malay> then
now I'm waiting for another call [lah] then they so far never call they're taking quite some time [ah] I don't know what's the
ya
ya
give up
ya true [lah] true right now I think
I think what my mother said to me was that (err) right now the employers I think they
they know that a lot of people are looking for job temporary because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
temporary only because right now it's difficult to get jobs so
I think the employers know that (um)
some people are not really serious about the job [lah] they just want to have a job at this moment because
it's ya you know like
a lot of people going through financial difficulties at this point [lah] so
that's what my mother said [lah] then I I think I think quite
true [lah] like like the seven eleven thing I think they know that
(err) I'm just applying
I think because when they when they look at my resume like you know they [ah] (um)
I'm a older production student in LASALLE then like
(err) diploma you know like why do I want to work in seven eleven that kind of thing so
so I I think they they they know that
this is just temporary [lah] a lot of people looking for
urgent temporary jobs [lah] so ya they know a lot of people not not really serious at the moment
ya
so
ya [lah] of course [lah] I I I
of course I feel like twenty when we were twenty plus
twenty plus
was a different was a different feeling different feeling like you can a lot more things then
then like (um) if I can turn back time
of course I will turn back time [lah] I will I will do (mm)
I will I will I will do my twenty plus differently [lah] I will do a lot of things differently
right now like age catching up [lah] definitely like (um)
ya getting easily more tired or you know like (um)
ya it's not it's not that
I'm not that fast anymore something like that
different [lah] when I was twenty plus I think I think I always thought that like
like like (um) [oh] I'm the best I can do
[oh] I can do a lot of things but as you get older then you realize you
(um) you realize
you're not really the best [ah] other people better than you or then you
you start to ya [lah] it's a different thing [lah]
because I I know because right now my in my class also I
that's what I'm going through also [lah] different you know
my classmates are all twenty plus right so
ya [lah] different different privileges
yes
correct [lah] actually actually true [lah] I I
[ah] I know I mean the the the thing is that because (err) right now the right now the
in so called millennial or
or the twenty plus right they
they have a different way of <malay>macam</malay> approaching things [lah] they
they sometimes they talk to you in a
in a in a different tone than than than
what people our age will
talk [lah] I feel like I I feel like our age people will have
people have more <malay>macam</malay> people are more more polite [lah] <malay>bila</malay> I talk to people
[ah] nicely have respect for elders but
!huh! I don't know about the the the the current (um) I don't know about the
the the the current twenty
nineteen to twenty plus now I think
they but not all [lah] some of them some of them are I mean some of them really still
still still have
still have (um) respect for people respect for elders and
talk to people nicely I feel that
some parents really did a good job [lah] teaching their kids
ya really some some are not some are not I mean some are really
<malay>macam</malay> really down to earth they they know
they know how to talk to to
older people [lah] so those kind of people I feel like
those kind of like my classmates I feel like they
their parents really did a good job in teaching them [lah] like (um)
like old old people old values [lah] old values like like (um)
like ya like how singapore was last time or you know

<malay>cara hidup sekarang sekarang</malay>
<malay>makin laju</malay> everything became became faster
then <malay>macam</malay> everybody rushing then <malay>macam</malay> like
<malay>aku</malay> feel last time was more (um)
was more relaxed [lah] more
laid back chill ya
so (um)
COVID I mean
<malay>ke</malay> time lockdown [eh] time lockdown I (uh) lockdown period I think
(mm)
(mm) <malay>takut tak</malay> [lah] I mean
apocalypse no [lah]
ya actually <malay>aku</malay> actually I I thought of that also [lah] I mean I I already
imagine that imagine that everybody everybody
like fall sick everybody became zombies I already thought of that already actually
but then ya
but but so far I mean during during COVID
period lockdown period I was mostly working I was actually going to my uncle's barber shop
just cutting hair everyday wearing mask and
that was what I was doing [ah] nothing much [lah]
I I was just trying to get along earn money [lah] you know ya
ya
[oh] okay okay okay ya the first the very first (um)
ya the very first lockdown ya phase one [lah] phase one circuit breaker was
was ya [lah] it's a bit a bit (um)
a bit stressful [lah] stressful situation you cannot go out then you cannot do this cannot do that then
[oh] circuit breaker itself ya
ya
ya the first few days ya I I felt like like
I felt I felt angry actually I felt like
I felt I felt like [ah] I I don't care [lah] I will still go out [lah] I will still do the normal things I will still go out and buy food and all that [lah] I will still
ya but after awhile then
it got more serious then I realise it's actually
a very serious thing [lah] then I I
you know I I I decided to <malay>macam</malay> I came to
accept the fact that it's a very serious thing [lah] so it's not like
it's not something you can like <malay>belek</malay> here <malay>belek</malay> there and like go
just go out you know like
(um)
and not get caught or what <malay>macam</malay>
ya so I in the end I followed the rules also [lah]
ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [ah] [eh] I remember I remember those times [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
weird [lah] you never see never see singapore suddenly
like empty empty empty streets like suddenly (um)
(hmm)
(mm)
ya (mm) definitely different
different time [lah] you know (err) nobody
nobody expected this to happen [lah] so so everybody
a lot of a lot of people was stressed [lah] that time they a lot of people stressed (err) a lot of (uh)
domestic violence suddenly at home inside homes like
usually the man the man will get angry [lah] then
because ya
so
ya no work ya ya correct (mm)
so a lot of people were stressed right now also I think
I think if you if you see on the streets actually actually a lot of people
don't have jobs [eh] actually if you see like in like let's say
like today I went to like #tampines# interchange like my house is like
two bus stops away from #tampines# interchange right so
like today I like almost everyday like go school I see a lot of like (um)
like old people you know like they they don't have jobs but they trying
to make ends meet like they they collect
(err) cardboard boxes or they collect tin cans all that
then sometimes you see you feel quite
(err) hopeless [lah] you feel quite sad [lah] like like like <malay>macam</malay> like
like
you know a lot of people are going through like a lot (uh) like harder
times [lah] a lot of people going through like more hardship [lah] you know that
if you think you are like
<malay>macam</malay> going through hardship right actually a lot of other people are going through more hardship [lah] like
quite sometimes I feel quite (um)
I just feel quite sad [lah] sometimes when I see all this [lah] ya
ya ya ya ya ya ya
forced [lah] forced to
forced to stop working and
ya that one ya [lah] <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [lah] there are a lot of a lot of view a lot of <malay>macam</malay> views on that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like
my mother will say something my my father will say something you know like a lot of people
will say different things [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
like nature nature telling us something <malay>ke apa</malay> you know that kind of thing so
ya but anyway like (um)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] we just have to make the best of it [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya [lah] but <malay>sekarang</malay> I mean (um) ya definitely <malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>aku baca dekat</malay> news
