and my name is #haziqah#
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay [ah] (um) just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today [ah]
ya so two more days before friday !woohoo! and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
[oh] so you go back to school all the way
!wow! we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
[ah] the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
<malay>adalah kaedah</malay> get in the workers are you get everyday
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
<malay>kuih suji</malay> is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
[oh] I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause [ah] number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but [eh] actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having [eh] a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's (uh) I don't think that it is (uh) economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like [oh] hello good morning like greet them and then (um) scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so (um) ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause (uh) it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like <malay>berat</malay> it's just so heavy and
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like [oh] my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues [ah] they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
[eh] I don't know [eh] I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
<malay>ada aku kisah</malay>
!wow!
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like [eh] well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example [lor] then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like !aww! you got a forty seven [oh] I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on (um) students (uh) to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
(um) and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to (um)
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics [lah] so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like [eh] you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like [oh] english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue [oh] and like
[oh] and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like [oh] like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like [eh] you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
(um) only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena [eh] novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than (err) poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into [ah] mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching (um) teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where [eh] you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly [what] that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like (um) india or
at any
any colonised (um) sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce (mmhmm) scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that [lah] that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
(uh) I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this (um) having that divide you know (uh) haiti versus the dominican republic
#puerto rican#
!wow!
ya [lor] so
[oh] also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in #jakarta# per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their [ah] ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world [leh] even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are (um) there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around (um) say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them [what] at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
<malay>malas nak layan</malay>
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
like really <malay>tak kisah</malay> like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that [lah] even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like [oh] it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like [oh] say like in primary school you don't have like [oh] you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
you the <malay>minah</malay> that's very <malay>bising</malay>
<malay>mulut besar</malay>
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
why would I wash my <malay>selimut</malay>
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then (uh)
I'm tired
stop yawning
!wow! okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
#kaypoh# boy #kaypoh#
(mm)
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue !duh! is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds [ah] cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with #gingy# though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
(mm)
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
[oh] speaking of that right (uh) there's this tweet saying that (uh) what [ah]
(uh) the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just (uh) what do you call it [ah]
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
[eh] doesn't make sense [oh] is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like (um) south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it
