[oh]
[ah]
[ah] okay okay despite I want to understand <malay>macam</malay> further (err) okay disc jockey when you say you mix one song to another song [kan] so which means you have two turntables correct
so what you are trying to achieve is <malay>kira macam kau nak</malay> make
(err) like (err) a track from scratch <malay>betul tak</malay>
[ah]
yes
you want to become the artist
[ah]
okay so okay in in in bands <malay>punya</malay> kind of a point of view band [eh] it's like you want to have your own band instead of play you're having a band with (err) <malay>kira main</malay> cover [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay> [ah]
ya ya ya ya
okay
