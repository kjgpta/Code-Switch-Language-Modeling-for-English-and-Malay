at the haunted house [lah]
because I <malay>dekat tepi-tepi kadang-kadang ada dekat tepi-tepi</malay> there was this [one] <malay>yang dekat tempat tak ingat</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat tempat mana</malay> but it was it disguised itself himself herself as christmas tree <malay>habis aku</malay> [kan]

ya I'm not scared just shocked only
ya he was laughing <malay>pasal macam aku</malay> [kan] <malay>susah nak takutkan</malay> [a'ah] <malay>then tiba-tiba dia macam macam itu</malay>
then sis was like [oh]

I don't know
sixty something <malay>sama</malay> [lah] <malay>aku rasa</malay>
ya and the
I wanted to go but I was

but one of the scariest is <malay>aku punya kawan</malay> ya <malay>tak pun yang</malay> the <malay>kak pon</malay> clan and she also looked like <malay>kak pon</malay> [ah] that [one]
my friend I said my friend is one of the scariest she also looked like <malay>kak pon</malay>

I don't know
[kan] I wanted to go [seh] because <malay>aku rasa</malay>
it
will scare the shit out of me [ah]
relatable
<malay>yang hari tu aku pergi pun</malay> the the year before <malay>aku pergi</malay> the only thing that scared me was the
<malay>macam</malay>
#sabah# <malay>dia orang macam buat</malay> #sabah# <malay>punya</malay> voodoo shit <malay>begitu</malay>
<malay>ya</malay> [lah]

so when I got out from there I got slightly freaked out [ah]
it's not really <malay>macam</malay> scary
<malay>aku suka</malay> [eh] <malay>benda begini</malay>
<malay>tak tahu tak ingat dekat mana</malay>
and I didn't let me think
[oh] ya ya ya but I can't remember when and where
sit
D marquee
I don't know
(mmhmm)
then
pretty groomer
was the coolest if not a normal cadres to eat
<malay>sikit hari aku macam aku tengok yang puaka tu</malay> [kan] and then they were like saying <malay>yang</malay> sis #huzairi# <malay>ni ada cerita pasal kawan dia nak cerita cerita-cerita hantu ni semua</malay> then suddenly <malay>dia punya kawan</malay> just kept quiet and then just say like I will tell you next time <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>lain hari</malay> [ah] then [ah] then they were like <malay>macam apa</malay> [seh] <malay>engkau tiba-tiba</malay> [ah] then <malay>sekali</malay> I think he texted or <malay>cakap</malay> [ah] the next time (err) or like call or something <malay>aku pun tak ingat</malay>
(mmhmm) <malay>dia dekat situ</malay> then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>dia balik</malay> [ah] then after that [ah] <malay>baru dia cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>tadi kita tengah cerita-cerita pasal tu banyak orang</malay> [kan]
ya
(mm)
<malay>habis</malay> [ah] then they say [lah] <malay>macam kadang-kadang kalau kita cerita-cerita benda begini macam benda macam</malay> it's like inviting the the thing then I'm like
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
where got ghost where got ghost
there's no such thing as ghosts [what] there's only <malay>jin</malay>
I don't know [ah] because like <malay>macam hari tu aku tengok yang</malay> incredible tales <malay>tu</malay> [kan] they say their #ah kong# is there because they never burn the house
you know like chinese believe that they need to burn things like hell notes then [a'ah] for the departed then they just <malay>macam dia orang tak</malay> burn the house for him so he cannot he got nowhere to go because <malay>dekat tempat dia tak ada rumah</malay> so he went back to the house
no [lah] that's not the belief
the belief is the hell note is to bribe the guardians of the hell gates then ya that's what I heard [lah]
okay but I got this one question for you <malay>habis kalau</malay> if you are poor what even can you do
ya but you steal is
you steal is because you need to survive kind [tau]
it's not the worst sin [lah] but they believe that <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] but <malay>kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun</malay> it's not it's not a
you want to <malay>bunuh</malay> people with what [seh] I don't know you have don't have anything [what]
ya but at the point of time it's not <malay>kira dia macam</malay> you are not of sound mind [tau] at the point of time
ya but then that's the only <malay>kira macam</malay> that's the only sin [lah] [kan]
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
but if you rich then you got a lot of sin you need to bribe a lot that's right
but islam is very fair
<malay>tak juga</malay> no I mean like islam is fair because <malay>macam dia orang akan</malay>
<malay>akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau</malay> and then after that if you have your <malay>buruk</malay> and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your <malay>buruk</malay> but then after that you will be given a chance to
ya let that's why you have to prepare yourself that's like another question
<malay>taubat</malay> [lah] that's why got
I asked this question during <malay>umrah</malay>
ya [lah] then that's why I say that's why that time I was in <malay>umrah</malay> then they they was talking about this [lah] like [ah] before we went to <malay>umrah</malay> we have like the course [kan] <malay>habis dia orang tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay then <malay>bila kita zaman</malay> [ah] this <malay>ustaz macam</malay> rock rock <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>habis dia cakap</malay> then <malay>bila kita zaman</malay> time <malay>zaman</malay> rock <malay>kita pun terlepas solat</malay> then <malay>dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat</malay> [lah] <malay>solat taubat</malay> then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back <malay>macam qada</malay> because you know you don't know how many
<malay>mana boleh</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
how would I know <malay>siapa kita nak</malay> judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about <malay>orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga</malay> just because <malay>dia kasi air dekat anjing tu</malay> so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to <malay>pertikaikan kita punya amalan</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>kalau aku pun aku bunuh</malay> [sia] <malay>aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa</malay>
but he already <malay>bunuh</malay> the <malay>ustaz</malay>
[oh]
<malay>niat dia berjihad apa</malay>
ya [lah]
ya
ya [lah] that's why [kan] <malay>aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting</malay> sis [kan] <malay>aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda</malay> word this word is for another word but actually <malay>kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>maki</malay> [jer]
ya but they always say that the paradise is not for the good people it's for the sinners
who repent ya
that's why <malay>macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah</malay> plus point <malay>dah malaikat dah tulis dah</malay> [oh] <malay>dia nak solat</malay> [ah] <malay>dia terus nak pergi tak</malay> [oh] <malay>tak dia tak pergi tapi tak</malay> minus <malay>tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya</malay> ya then if <malay>kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak</malay> [oh] <malay>nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai</malay> [lah] <malay>orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu</malay> and <malay>dia buat jahat</malay> then <malay>baru dia orang tulis</malay>
[kan] but I think all these all these people all these typical
people in our community makes it
it makes it <malay>macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam</malay> because
you guys are judgy bunch
like <malay>orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya</malay> sister sister <malay>nak sembahyang pun</malay> sister <malay>nak solat kita buat</malay> [jer] <malay>yang wajib</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
[kan]
ya [lah]
doesn't mean like you don't wear your <malay>tudung</malay> your <malay>amalan</malay> is lesser than
that was the thing that was flying
<malay>yang</malay> spaghetti bolognese <malay>punya</malay> hook <malay>tu aku cakap apa tu yang</malay>
I don't know maybe
okay
okay I will see you in twenty twenty two
<malay>lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua</malay> I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that <malay>aku ni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku ni</malay> perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people [lah]
ya man
okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
but it's a it's typical [what] to do that
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh] sis <malay>lagi kena teruk</malay> everytime I wear <malay>tudung</malay> then people all like <malay>macam cakap aku ni macam-macam</malay>
it's not about step good good [ah] <malay>dia macam macam</malay> [ah] !alah! <malay>perempuan tudung ni semua</malay> you know the guys that I like get to know right they say <malay>macam perempuan tudung ni</malay>
[ah]
actually <malay>senang</malay> [jer]
[kan] then [ah] it's like you cover your head but you never cover your bottom
<malay>macam kira senang dapat</malay> [ah]
then I was like okay but not all of them are like that [what] like how right now I have the stigma of a single mother
[kan]
but
it doesn't matter [lah] I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just <malay>apa kita</malay>
how we react to that it shows
shows [ah] shows how we are as a person [ah] so I don't care [lah]
[kan]
(hmm)
be more proper
[kan]
ya
(mmhmm)
[kan]
like I think those kind of things so so <malay>macam</malay>
to certain people it will be like
<malay>mengghairahkan</malay> and
men are known to have like mental images and they keep
[ha]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
seriously
[oh] damn you weird
weirdo
<malay>siapa</malay> #nurul#
<malay>siapa</malay>
the <malay>cantik</malay> one
I don't know [lah] whatever [lah] then
!wow!
she what her display picture [ah] <malay>yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab</malay>
(hmm)
!wow!
should we do that like for our
like
gain popularity
for goodness
no I mean like <malay>macam</malay> you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
(mmhmm)
[oh] man I can't do that
ya but that's another way for you to tone down your voice [what]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] sis more aware [ah]
but how to <malay>makan</malay> [ah] with <malay>niqab</malay> so you just open like that then <malay>makan</malay> I mean like ya ya [lah]
it's like a beat man
ya but then <malay>macam</malay> that's how people see you as a #hijabi# [ah] so when <malay>kau macam jatuhkan</malay> judgement <malay>dekat niqabi</malay> when orang <malay>jatuhkan</malay> judgement as
<malay>dekat kau</malay> as a #hijabi# then <malay>kau macam tak boleh terima</malay>
what [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
but actually <malay>macam betul</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk</malay> just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
<malay>ilmu</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa kau nak pakai niqab</malay> so <malay>engkau punya</malay> journey
[a'ah]
so <malay>macam kau punya</malay> journey <malay>tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu</malay>
what to expect how to bring yourself
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
[kan]
[kan]
is it the time for me to wear
<malay>dia macam</malay> there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
[kan]
okay [lah] not really [lah]
[kan]
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi macam</malay> okay speaking of this [eh] I was like thinking [tau] <malay>masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam</malay> very [ah] small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and <malay>dia orang punya tulang</malay> is very small so like
sis is already is big it's not like I am
not say <malay>macam</malay> fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then <malay>macam bila aku pakai</malay> [eh] <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> then I was saying this to #nek yam# you know then I was like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>habis nanti orang pakai habis macam</malay>
you know all these people <malay>macam pakai macam terletak</malay> [jer] then <malay>macam</malay> for me is like <malay>terletak</malay> and then <malay>tiba-tiba macam</malay> shoulder <malay>besar</malay>
and shoulder <malay>besar</malay> and then like then <malay>macam tergantung</malay> [ah] <malay>macam tergantung kita macam</malay> hanger so it's like it's not nice [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> then after that #nek yam# said something that <malay>macam terus macam aku terus</malay> (ugh)
<malay>macam</malay> then she say you wear things you want to wear a <malay>niqab</malay> you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of #allah#
sis <malay>terus</malay> shut up [lah]
ya [lah] but doesn't mean <malay>kau</malay> presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just <malay>macam kau tak boleh</malay> change <malay>diri engkau</malay>
exactly that's why like you know sometimes and I'm I'm thinking like you know moving forward like what kind of clothes I would want to wear as a #hijabi# that
with big build or who is plus size or you know like for people who are bigger [lah]
ya that's why
(mm)
<malay>dapat</malay> sis looking at her
it's like looking
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time <malay>macam</malay> she became a basic
I don't want to say that word
#ringarde#
ya
but then <malay>macam</malay> but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly #ringarde# [lah]
because you are not supposed to stand out you are supposed to
be modest for yourself and for your creator
in <malay>dunia</malay> [lah] (mmhmm)
<malay>tapi macam kalau kau dah</malay> actually <malay>kau pakai hijab</malay> [jer] <malay>kau dah kena</malay> sacrifice all these things [seh] slowly [lah]
