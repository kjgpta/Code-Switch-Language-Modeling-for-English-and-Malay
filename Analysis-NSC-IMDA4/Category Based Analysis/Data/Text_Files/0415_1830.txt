[eh] hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
(mm)
ya
iphone eleven <malay>dalam</malay> one thousand plus [ah]
so if <malay>kalau tambah</malay> plus <malay>atau yang</malay> [eh] sorry iphone pro [eh] iphone pro <malay>dengan</malay> iphone pro max
<malay>yang tu kena</malay> check <malay>dulu</malay> like <malay>dia punya harga berapa</malay>
ya
the same
have you checked
[oh] so I think <malay>tengok tempat dia</malay> plan [jer] [lah] <malay>tengok macam mana dia punya</malay> plan <malay>dia berapa</malay> gigabyte
<malay>berapa</malay> incoming call free <malay>semua</malay> like
<malay>dia punya</malay> specs [ah]
(hmm) <malay>tengok</malay> benefit benefit <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] okay
ten gigabyte [kan] per month okay
but currently you use what phone currently <malay>pakai</malay> phone <malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
ya ya
(uh)
ya ya our <malay>saudara</malay>
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years [eh] but I think you just bought [kan] iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade [eh]
[oh] still iphone [lah]
[oh] but I think recently you bought [kan] a new phone
!alamak! drill [ah] <malay>buto</malay> sorry sorry pause
<malay>yang</malay> iphone eleven <malay>tu</malay> (uh) you plan to take which plan
[oh]
ya
unless you have wifi [lah] at home you already have wifi [kan] or
ya
ya
<malay>tu</malay> full price [ah] no contract [ah]
[oh] actually iphone seven also not bad <malay>tapi</malay> I I would suggest iphone eight [ah] because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone [ah]
I think <malay>tu paling terbaik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan</malay> iphone eleven is really good enough [ah]
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
ya so that one that time was during COVID [kan] so <malay>sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> COVID [kan] so not to get more consumer to buy the phone [lah] at a cheaper price ya
even [ah] android phone <malay>pun sama</malay> [lah] like google the new google <malay>apa</malay> pixel [kan] they they make it cheaper [lah] but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit <malay>kurang</malay> [lah] compared to the previous one ya
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
must check the new iphone right <malay>jap</malay> [eh] let me check [eh]
there's about four point seven inch
it has a better bionic chip the <malay>apa</malay> it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition [ah] I don't think so
ya they are still selling I mean (um) you must check you must check <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>ustaz tengah</malay> check
<malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>ustaz kena</malay> check <malay>dia punya</malay> iphone <malay>punya</malay> iphone store
let me check
there's no more [ah] sorry they don't sell anymore [ah] iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven [lah] so I think for camera wise if you love the camera [kan] take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough [ah] iphone eleven (uh)
not too sure [ah] cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven [ah]
iphone X [eh] iphone X <malay>jap jap jap</malay> there's a face iphone
ya !alamak!
who
[oh] our <malay>ni</malay> [eh] parents [eh]
I think <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] mum is sleeping then I think <malay>bapak</malay> baru balik ya and
<malay>siapa</malay>
[ah] <malay>bapak kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>dekat ni</malay> [lah] <malay>iya dia kerja ni</malay> [lah] <malay>hari ni kerja</malay> [pe] <malay>hari ni hari rabu</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think he working three times a week
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off [ah]
I'm not really looking to job search yet [ah] cause I'm doing freelance [ah] so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year [lah] I try to finish this projects and without expecting much [lah] I think I think the most important thing is experience [ah] and the skills that I will acquire ya
<malay>tu</malay> I think <malay>paling penting</malay> [ah] so like <malay>macam nanti</malay> (um) once I've started working
once I start working [ah] I'm more prepared [ah] prepared than ever
<malay>kalau tak nanti macam</malay> before this <malay>kerja macam tak</malay> prepare <malay>sangat setakat apa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> relax relax <malay>tapi nanti</malay> end up <malay>macam tak belajar apa-apa macam</malay> cause
I think it's a bit hard [ah] because once you already
<malay>apa</malay> start started working [kan] you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing [kan] so you need to
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test [ah] they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills [ah] you have the knowledge
for coding [ah] ya so basically it's not that hard [lah] because really we can just (uh) search up in the in the <malay>apa</malay>
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
[ah] ya
ya ya some some some <malay>apa</malay> some company [kan] they
they know [ah] whether you you've you search online <malay>ke tak</malay> [lah] cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important [ah] it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
and they will ask you like on the spot [lah] like how do you solve this [ah] [ah] this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem [lah] I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is (uh) that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them [lah]
ya
it's more mostly interview skills [lah] that
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice [ah] you need to really improve on it [ah] then you have higher chance to to be <malay>apa</malay> to be offered [lah] by the company
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
[ah] monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast [ah] (mm)
the expected
[oh]
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you [lah]
[oh]
<malay>jangan kena pijak</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
[oh] okay okay
ya
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> like looking into like contract or <malay>apa</malay>
(uh) full time <malay>ke</malay> part time
ya
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> full time <malay>pun</malay> there's a lot of expectation [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
[oh]
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay> N level start <malay>sama</malay> time [eh] <malay>dengan</malay> O level
[oh] okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
<malay>tapi</malay> [ah] the
ya <malay>tapi</malay> the condition <malay>sekarang</malay> condition <malay>sekarang macam mana dia punya</malay> COVID <malay>dia orang ambil</malay> O level december <malay>apa</malay> this COVID <malay>kat</malay>
[ah] the
<malay>tempat dekat rumah ke dekat examination hall</malay>
ya
(mmhmm)
but <malay>dia orang ambil</malay> same timing <malay>dia orang ada</malay> own shift <malay>ke apa atau</malay> it's just one time
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
microsoft office [ah]
okay okay
[oh] ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed [ah]
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is (uh) I think
[oh]
(mm)
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically [ah] system engineer [lah] you are looking to that position <malay>atau</malay> you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [lah]
ya over work [ah]
ya
ya
yup understood
<malay>ada macam macam</malay>
software engineer <malay>ke</malay> if
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding [kan] they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable [lah] you can still read the code [ah] like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
<malay>macam mana nak</malay> spell F O R T L A N
[oh] okay okay [eh] never heard before [eh]
even though I am a computer science
C hash [eh]
I think it's called C sharp [ah]
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before [lah] during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know [lah] this kind of
<malay>apa</malay> skills [ah] like
mostly low level [lah] like C sharp python [eh] sorry C sharp (uh) what is it called [ah] ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable [ah] than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
for example <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay name like
I think it's like flutter <malay>dia ada</malay> own language which which covered dart [eh] dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is <malay>apa</malay> go golang [eh] golang
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
like owned by google [ah] so they they have their own language they make their own <malay>ni</malay> designed by them
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing [ah] more structured
ya
(mm)
how do you spell logs
[oh] log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya ya
ya
ya
ya
I think
<malay>yang tengah</malay> [ah] <malay>siapa yang tekan biasanya</malay> the manager [kan] the <malay>apa</malay> (uh) the business <malay>punya</malay> side the project manager <malay>dia orang akan tekan</malay> [kan] this <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>faham faham</malay>
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya nobody use [eh]
[oh]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but each country like they have their own server <malay>ke atau</malay> they have their own
means like singapore have one server so <malay>lain negeri ada</malay> their own server <malay>ke</malay>
atau combine <malay>macam</malay> asia
[oh]
[oh] okay
<malay>abeh</malay> sekarang like [ah]
like
you know <malay>macam</malay> COVID <malay>pun</malay> is getting better [kan] singapore
malaysia <malay>pun</malay> like they they do open the border [kan] to singapore [kan] <malay>macam</malay> only for those <malay>yang</malay> business
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] green lane <malay>semua</malay>
so for the purpose of those <malay>yang ada rumah kat sana</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> ya for us I think we can't [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> we are going there basically <malay>nak apa</malay>
<malay>nak cuti</malay> [kan]
actually <malay>boleh balik</malay> [ah] because technically she is <malay>ni</malay> [kan] she is not singaporean [kan]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
actually I'm not sure like our cousin <malay>yang</malay> always (uh) who are staying there [kan] who are staying there #syakilah# #iman# do they <malay>dia orang boleh datang sini ke</malay>
unless <malay>dia orang ada</malay> they <malay>ada kerja dekat sini</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang ada kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>atau rumah kat sini</malay> [kan]
#clementi# house

(uh) the rice and
<malay>kuah apa kari</malay> [ah] <malay>kuah kari</malay> and I just cook <malay>telur sikit</malay> then <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah]
I think I need to start learn I need to start to learn cooking [ah]
but it's a bit hard ya it's a bit hard
I prefer to cook alone [ah]
ya
[ah] that one the smell <malay>nanti apa</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>bau dia</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti tu</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti iya</malay> [lah] <malay>tutup tingkap</malay>
<malay>tutup pintu semua</malay>
but I know [ah] I know how to cook <malay>macam</malay> like simple simple [ah] like usually I cook thai food [ah] sweet and sour fish
and #kai lan# <malay>ikan masin</malay>
baby #kai lan# <malay>ikan masin</malay> so <malay>macam setakat ikut ni</malay> [ah] <malay>ikut</malay> youtube and
ya <malay>kadang-kadang beli kat ni</malay> fairprice
nearby [lah]
giant so just <malay>beli apa</malay>
<malay>barang-barang semua dekat ni</malay> [ah] <malay>barang-barang kat</malay> giant and fairprice
<malay>kalau ada takde</malay> [ah] just find a replacement [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
that time <malay>takde ikan apa</malay> [eh] <malay>ikan tenggiri ke apa</malay> [eh]
so (uh) I replaced it with <malay>ikan apa nama dia</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin</malay> [ah] <malay>macam ketul-ketul macam</malay> cube <malay>ikan</malay> cube
throw the like it's just
simple [lah] <malay>dia punya masak</malay> it's not that hard [ah] just <malay>ikut dia punya</malay> youtube <malay>punya</malay> tutorial
ya not much
[ah] boneless and <malay>dia macam</malay> I think it's dried [ah] dried food dried fish
ya <malay>macam</malay> you you <malay>macam</malay> very dried [lah] <malay>dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat</malay>
ya it's not in the fridge [ah] it's like dried [ah] dried #ikan bilis#
ya so <malay>macam</malay> like it's in terms in the form of cube [ah] cube then with that cube just [ah] <malay>letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu</malay>
once the the fish <malay>dah tu</malay> [kan]
<malay>dah lembut</malay> [ah] <malay>baru tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak</malay> baby #kai lan#
<malay>letak kicap</malay> oyster sauce so once <malay>dah</malay>
<malay>dah panaskan</malay> I think like
five to ten minutes <malay>dah siap</malay>
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome [ah] <malay>kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa</malay> make sure <malay>letak dengan tepung</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> sauce <malay>senang nak buat</malay> [ah] sweet and sour sauce
ya
ya you you need to get the fish ya fried first [ah]
<malay>dengan tepung</malay>
ya
it's homemade [ah] homemade ya
ya
ya capsicum
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] I think this is like the starting point [ah] <malay>cuma macam</malay> <malay>nak</malay> I think I took me awhile [ah] like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring <malay>macam</malay> you need to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>potong ni</malay> [lah]
I think the
ya true [ah] <malay>barang-barang dah siap</malay> if someone already did that for me [kan] <malay>senang</malay> [ah] I think my life will be easier
<malay>cuma itulah</malay> you need
ya
but also maid also it's not that cheap [ah]
cannot cannot like that [ah] I think most women nowadays is they prefer to work [ah] [kan] but depends [ah] [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so take turn [ah]
[oh]
<malay>tapi boleh ke macam tu</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada</malay> agreement <malay>dia</malay> is just one house [kan] the maid
the agreement <malay>biasanya</malay> one maid <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay> one house [kan]
okay
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] of course
ya for weekend [ah]
ya usually once a week [kan] like sunday
[ah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
pause <malay>jap</malay> [eh] pause <malay>jap</malay>
but if the maid <malay>macam</malay> they have their own <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>kerja</malay> timing <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
like
ya sunday off
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day [kan] except <malay>malam</malay> [ah] [kan]
ya
<malay>dah berumur</malay> ya
ya of course
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> fairprice fairprice fairprice <malay>punya</malay> online
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] sometimes I think
that time I saw like <malay>macam halal punya daging</malay> [kan]
ya really <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> which section [eh] the section <malay>yang ada</malay> frozen food
ya it's similar [ah] same as when you go to grocery
ya
actually I saw this youtube video [ah] very interesting <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>punya</malay> shopping
<malay>tapi</malay> I don't think singapore <malay>ada</malay> [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> like I think in america <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] which country <malay>atau</malay> china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop [kan] there'll be someone who welcome you <malay>pastu</malay> [ah] you using the [lah] I think it's a like the device [ah] you need to buy the device device
then you are like it's like shopping [ah]
[ah] it's a virtual [ah] everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real [ah] I mean impossible [ah] but its similar [lah] it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
if if <malay>memang</malay> ya stock finish of course the thing is empty [lah] <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [ah]
it's the same as you are shopping [ah] it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually [lah]
ya very interesting
<malay>tapi</malay> it's very hard [ah] like I mean the software wise like
ya I think like imagine like walking [ah]
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab [kan]
why
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
access to shopping mall [eh] is it
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally [ah] I'm not too sure [ah] there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before [ah] I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
<malay>berapa</malay>
of course [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> price <malay>mahalnya</malay> it's like you're playing four <malay>punya</malay> <malay>punya tu</malay> [kan] console
(mm)
ya
but I think can be solved [ah] like technology wise <malay>macam</malay> they keep changing [kan] most like it's probably [ah] I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change [ah] <malay>macam</malay> in terms of like the new normal
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
like <malay>dulu takde</malay> [kan] I think previously my company my former company <malay>dia pernah</malay> offer [ah] work from anywhere so one year <malay>macam</malay> they give like seven days [ah]
ya
<malay>kat rumah</malay> [lah] you can can stay at home or go overseas <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] as long as you do something [lah] usually the manager will <malay>ni</malay> [lah] the
the manager will ask [ah] like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint [ah] sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya
[ah] you also need to be involved in like zoom zoom meeting
you need to be <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] my company former company use zoom for <malay>ni</malay> [lah]
for presentation
ya of course [ah] I think they are going to make one in singapore [kan]
<malay>dia punya</malay>
ya
[ah] but I not too sure [ah] like I heard from the news ya and they were hiring [ah] (mm) I think a lot foreigner [ah]
[oh] ikea [ah] I don't I don't think so actually I don't buy like
<malay>macam</malay> container [ah] <malay>nak letak</malay> something container like small [one] [ah] ya but I think [ah]
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu</malay> my friend <malay>tanya nak pergi</malay> ikea <malay>ke tak dia ajak</malay>
so maybe I might go with him [lah] I'm not sure when maybe next week
which one the restaurant [ah]
of course [ah] open [lah]
but they limit [ah] they limit like
ya they they limit <malay>ni</malay> [lah] the number of [ah] customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure <malay>berapa</malay> [ah]
ya they make
one one table [kan] like ya seat of four or seat of two
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those <malay>yang</malay> one person [kan] they will sit at the seat of four <malay>kan nanti macam</malay> they don't <malay>apa</malay> utilise the space [ah] they don't make use of the space
then end up <malay>macam</malay> the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> weekend [kan] in #tampines# [kan]
ya the queue <malay>selalu panjang</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> control [eh] ya ya
ya couple family [kan]
ya
ya
[oh] counter table ya
[oh]
(mm)
ya <malay>betul</malay>
ya yup understand
not too sure [ah]
[oh]
shopping mall [eh] is it like shopping mall
[oh] okay
ya ya
open concept [ah]
it's like open concept [ah]
(mm)
ya
[oh] ya ya
(mm)
[oh] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya
(mm) truth
(mm)
ya
ya
ya I think it's a bit <malay>tu</malay> [lah] a bit
it's a bit scary [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> if
<malay>ada orang</malay> break the rule <malay>apa</malay> [kan]
like actually you say you heard places <malay>yang</malay> some
restaurant or bar [kan] they they have a lot of
<malay>apa dia orang kena ni</malay> [kan] <malay>kena</malay> warning [kan] because of this thing [kan]
like the customer <malay>tak ikut ni</malay>
ya
ya [lah]
of course [ah]
ya
(mmhmm)
ambassador
ya
[ah] true [ah]
I think just make sure like everyone just follow [ah] cause now nowadays people like
ya [lah] you see like in at <malay>apa</malay> shopping mall like it's those crowded [kan] nowadays <malay>macam susah nak</malay> control [ah]
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya I think they will just monitor [lah] this <malay>apa</malay> maybe there's someone
watching the <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> detect
ya
check out [lah] don't check out [lah] ya it's very difficult to <malay>ni</malay>
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible [lah] just that location wise is a bit some [ah] some ya ya true [ah] some some [ah] some might be insecure a bit [ah] like
to be in track [kan]
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
about I think regarding the the battery [lah] <malay>dia cepat habis</malay> [ah]
ya definitely [ah] bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running [ah] it will still run ya because it need to keep checking [kan]
like the the nearby devices [kan] <malay>siapa yang</malay>
I'm not too sure [ah] I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise [ah] so I think they need like support of
(um) google and apple [kan] to <malay>ni</malay> with the android <malay>dengan</malay> phone
I think so [ah] I think it's just the bluetooth [ah] like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device [kan]
ya this is not this is not easy [ah] because because I think they still updates [ah] they're still updating they are still improving
for apple [kan] and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone [kan]
or you still stick with <malay>ni</malay>
Google

I think this is still depends cause google home [kan] they detect <malay>ni</malay> [kan] the surrounding [kan]
the microphone is how far
<malay>berapa jauh</malay>
as long as <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] microphone <malay>dengan</malay> I mean <malay>dia punya</malay> google home [kan] <malay>ada</malay> microphone [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)

I'm not too sure [ah] like like what will be the reply like [ah] <malay>macam</malay> default like
[ah] there's something
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya maybe [ah] maybe ya ya the default <malay>punya</malay> default

ya
maybe you can try like alexa <malay>ke</malay>
like

[oh]
(mmhmm)
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
<malay>tapi</malay> but then it just think of us like their <malay>lagipun</malay> singapore is moving into smart nation [kan] so at certain points at certain [ah] zone for example I think #punggol# <malay>ke</malay> #sengkang# [eh]
like #punggol# [kan] there's there's a lot of flat [kan] so I think these flats <malay>dia orang ada</malay> their own smart <malay>punya apa</malay> devices [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart [lah] basically so <malay>bila macam masuk bilik</malay>
I think not too sure [ah] like they have their own ya they have their own brand [ah] I'm not not sure what brand is that [ah]
maybe maybe they collaborate (hmm)
I think there might be [lah] not too sure like
for example smart light you enter a room [kan] <malay>nanti dia macam</malay> the intensity <malay>akan</malay> increase [ah]
as we walk into <malay>macam tu</malay> example [jer] [lah]
so <malay>tak payah tekan butang ke apa</malay>
I think they have [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya <malay>macam ada</malay> sensor [kan]
[ah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house [ah] like or what like
ya
ya because
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country [kan] <malay>dia kat</malay> india [eh]
they use leg
<malay>pakai kaki untuk tekan butang dia</malay>
[ah] pedal pedal ya so they have to use
(uh) our hand [lah] our hand to press the button
ya there's some country use that [ah] <malay>macam</malay> pedal <malay>ke apa</malay>
ya
I think in singapore <malay>ada</malay> some building [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> like if inside the lift <malay>takde</malay> button
only <malay>kat luar</malay> [jer]
#paya lebar# ya I saw I went to #paya lebar#
