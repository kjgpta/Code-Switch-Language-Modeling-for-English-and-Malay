<malay>kalau kau hidup aku nak</malay> obviously like
every everything I mean like if a life has a purpose what and <malay>kalau</malay> if <malay>semua benda yang kau nak</malay> then what's the point of living right like (uh) might but basically you were just saying like

but ya in terms
in terms of my life
it's been hard [lah] it's hard it's been hard to tolerate life [ah] as it is [ah] obviously [ah] I mean like (uh) saying it for everyone ya <malay>tapi rabak</malay> opinion <malay>kau kau cakap</malay>
<malay>semua benda kau nak dapat takmo rabak</malay> [ah]
like
okay (um)
<malay>tapi untuk kau kalau macam</malay> about like relationship with a girl
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> like
<malay>apa kau nak</malay> (uh)
what <malay>apa kau cari dalam</malay>
(uh) in a girl for you to you know
basically (uh)
<malay>perempuan idaman kau</malay> [ah]
ya so <malay>apa apa perempuan idaman kau</malay> like
<malay>untuk aku</malay> I think like
that's (uh) in general <malay>tu apa semua laki pun nak</malay> [lah]
but like (uh) <malay>kau</malay> try think think harder think deeper like feel like deeper like <malay>apa kau nak apa kau sebenarnya nak</malay>
(uh) <malay>dalam wanita</malay> like because let's be honest [ah] like
in life you weren't like <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat perempuan yang sempurna</malay> like <malay>tak ada orang sempurna</malay> [pe] <malay>dalam hidup ni</malay>
so <malay>kau tak</malay> [kan] <malay>dapat orang yang sempurna</malay> so like just think deep like <malay>kau rasa apa yang</malay> those some qualities that
like we know you can find but
like obviously the perfect qualities like
what you're you're saying is isn't isn't going to be like totally achievable [lah] like I don't think everyone would
[eh] [ah] like a lot of you can easily find
someone like that [ah] so like
think deeper [ah] just like what's like let's say [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>cam aku</malay> okay let <malay>berbual pasal aku</malay> [eh]
<malay>untuk aku kalau aku perempuan yang aku nak</malay> is
someone <malay>yang</malay> (err) <malay>tak pandang aku macam</malay>
<malay>dia tengok aku macam lebih daripada lebih daripada orang lain</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>aku nak rasa</malay> like I'm like I'm just someone who whose the only one in the world [ah] like you know
you know <malay>kau faham apa aku cakap</malay> like
<malay>lawa ni semua siapa tak nak siapa tak nak lawanya orang siapa pun tak nak orang yang</malay> handsome <malay>semua orang pun nak</malay> but ya or [ah] and one more thing <malay>yang</malay> can
catch my eye is (err) is the girl funny [ah] to me if they're funny
to me if they're funny
it you know it keeps me alive [ah] it keeps me laughing I like to laugh you know [ah] <malay>apa ni ketawa semua orang suka ketawa</malay> [pe]
I mean like (uh)
ya so <malay>untuk aku perempuan kalau boleh buat aku ketawa</malay> that's already
(err) you know <malay>kalau</malay> (uh) in english <malay>dia</malay> called it like what red flag for one side of the team if
if I would say myself this is called green flag [ah] for like if they can make me laugh
if you get what I mean [ah] <malay>kalau faham</malay> [ah] <malay>kau faham tak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay>
ya like <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau boleh buat ketawa</malay> it's already something [ah] it's like a lot [ah] for me
because to me [lah] <malay>perempuan tak perempuan perempuan tak kelakar sangat [ah]</malay> like like maybe
like a lot of the girls [lah]
maybe I I think it's biased a bit
it's quite biased because a lot of the girls
<malay>yang aku jumpa dorang tak kelakar dorang macam</malay> lame [ah] but I mean I find it cute as well but
you know
and ya I've only met like what
maybe one or two girls <malay>yang</malay> I find (uh) very entertaining and <malay>kelakar</malay> [ah]
so ya like and another quality is I would say that's achievable
(um)
<malay>dia tak payah</malay> like <malay>faham aku dia tak payah aku</malay> [ah] <malay>sepenuhnya</malay> but <malay>aku</malay> just expect <malay>aku</malay> just expect <malay>dia</malay> to be there for me get me

<malay>aku cam aku cam</malay> in denial
and when I was in denial I was like
still (uh)
I wouldn't say want to force [ah] it was just like
maybe in that in a sense I guilt trip her not really guilt trip her [lah] but maybe maybe it was [ah]
I don't know [ah] for someone else to judge for you to judge or [what] [ah] like <malay>aku cakap dengan dia cam</malay> like

<malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>cuba</malay> [ah] <malay>semua benda</malay> [sia] <malay>aku cuba</malay> in that in the first one but
slowly I realised <malay>cam aku tak boleh buat pape</malay> [ah] and at one point [ah] I think I was just pestering her too much that I wasn't even pestering [ah] because actually <malay>tu</malay>
(err) <malay>hari jadi dia</malay>
and then [dah] <malay>gitu aku</malay> wish [ah]

(err) every platform <malay>yang kita boleh berbual dia</malay> block [ah] basically

<malay>aku tak nak aku nak</malay>
<malay>kesah aku tak nak tanya</malay> [ah] <malay>apa khabar</malay> like what's wrong you know <malay>kalau kau nak</malay> (uh)

so <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>aku tanya dia</malay> [ah] like (uh)
I hope you're doing fine like I I
I've been seeing you tweeting like for what the past few days [ah] some very emotional stuff you know and if you need someone [ah] I wouldn't mind being your listening
ear you know as shoulder
you know but unless you have a boyfriend
like I I
I mean I understand I mean I'm just not trying to intrude anything I'm just trying to be
I'm just trying to
[ah]
something like that [ah]
so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>terus cam</malay>
<malay>dia cam</malay>
so <malay>kita berbual berbual</malay> [lah] and then I got interested you know
[oh] [ah]
so <malay>untuk kau</malay> to be honest <malay>aku tak tahu tu</malay> too early <malay>ke tak tapi untuk kau</malay>
(uh) do you think what's what's the time limit <malay>untuk kau untuk kau</malay> move on like when do you think is the right time to move on and like
you know the right to move on to another girl and start
something fresh you know something new
<malay>untuk kau</malay>
okay when <malay>aku aku</malay> just started out with the girl
the new girl right the latest one
the one I'm having with right now (err)
I was
still in process [ah] honestly I was still in process [ah] low-key I was still in process
but
(err)
somehow I I
I move on [ah] I like to think I move on
you know and then some slowly I move on already and I finished healing and stuff you know accepted as what it is [ah] and I just wanted her to be happy and I
I want to be happy myself so ya
(err) I continue with this girl and
but why why I told you in the first
<malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] <malay>aku cakap dengan kau</malay> [kan] <malay>pasal aku</malay> feel like it's a crime
it's because time and time again even I was already with this girl and
and I believe and I know I'm in love with this girl also right
I still think about her also sometimes you know
and
[ah] I still think about her you know from time and time again I still think like
what is she up to is she okay is she fine <malay>ke</malay>
(um)
and
what comfort I comforted myself by saying like
okay [ah] maybe like you never actually
uncare for anyone you know if you really care about someone you don't really stop caring for someone right
so maybe that's why it was happening [ah]
but it feels it feels like a crime [ah] sometimes because I just
I just don't want to hurt who I'm having [ah] because I really love what we are having already [ah] so and it's
it's also a roller coaster but
she's been good [ah]
but some time and time again I still think about
you know that previous girl and
<malay>cam</malay> how how it could have been a lot [ah] so I don't know if
I want to say if I have moved on but I know I've moved on I
I like to think like I've moved on you know but
time and time again I will ask [lah] like
what what what went wrong
[ah]
okay so it's like
actually <malay>betul</malay> actually <malay>betul</malay> ya ya ya ya <malay>aku faham aku faham</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> continue
<malay>aku faham</malay> [ah] ya ya ya you could say that [ah] but
ya so I'm
I'm still with the new girl
and it's been
a hell of a ride [ah] I would say it's been hell of a ride and time and time again
I would say that I will still think about
my previous [ah]
my previous
girl [lah] and
to me it's fine I guess you know (uh) as you said also I think it's fine [ah]
<malay>macam</malay>
to care you don't uncare for somebody <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> [pe]
so and it's okay [ah]
(um)
(mm)
but I'm still young [ah] and I I'm still very young so <malay>cam aku tak</malay>
<malay>aku tak fikir-fikir sangat macam</malay> [oh] <malay>aku akan kahwin</malay> this third girl <malay>aku</malay> [dah] <malay>tak nak fikir sangat</malay> [ah] so [dah] <malay>tiga perempuan</malay> [sia]
<malay>aku nak kena aku nak kena layan ni semua benda</malay> [kan]
so <malay>cam</malay> from my experience I'm just going out with the flow
but
doing my best as well [ah] so if it goes to where
to where I want it to be to where we both want it to be then (uh) <malay>alhamdulillah</malay>
but if not
<malay>takpe</malay> [ah]
but <malay>untuk kau</malay> in general your <malay>kau punya</malay> love life [kan]
like
(uh)
<malay>kalau kau</malay> explain in general <malay>kau punya</malay> love life how has it been like
what's wrong
maybe with you you can start with what's wrong with you
<malay>faham faham</malay>
okay okay
<malay>aku bilang aku punya juga</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk aku apa salah</malay>
<malay>apa salah apa macam benda yang aku boleh perbaiki</malay> from like past relationships
first thing
<malay>pertamanya</malay> is
I learnt I had I learnt how to let go
okay
second thing is (uh)
you know I learnt how to accept
(err)
third thing thing is (uh) I learnt how to live in the moment
all the time [ah]
<malay>hidup dengan apa yang</malay> [dah] <malay>ada kat situ</malay> [ah]
so just live [ah] you know <malay>takmo</malay>
