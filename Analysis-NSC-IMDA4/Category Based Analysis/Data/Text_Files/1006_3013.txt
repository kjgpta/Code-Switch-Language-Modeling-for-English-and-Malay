<malay>bab kita</malay> (um) analyse companies and their sustainable (uh) efforts [lah] so from there we have to think of (um)
what we can (err) do for our (err) client's company so that they can become more sustainable
yup
(mmhmm)
ya you're right
but after school
I went out with my boyfriend to celebrate our fifth monthsary
<malay>tapi</malay> simple simple [jer] [lah] we went to <malay>makan</malay> (err) <malay>nasi goreng</malay>
<malay>kampung</malay> at <malay>kedai mamak</malay> at #boon keng#

nope
<malay>pukul selepas sekolah</malay> [lah] <malay>pukul tujuh</malay>
then
<malay>habis</malay>
did you <malay>jumpa abah tadi</malay>
[oh]
<malay>sama-sama</malay>
suddenly
thank <malay>sama-sama</malay>

it's one for one
<malay>jadi</malay> (um) the price total was (err) forty dollars forty five
yup

(mmhmm)
[lah] cannot <malay>tak boleh</malay> think ahead <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>berapa lama ini</malay>
!huh!
<malay>dalam dunia</malay>
[oh] I know
[ah]
[oh] <malay>saya tahu</malay>
<malay>makanan</malay>
<malay>sebab saya
<malay>sebab saya makan terlalu banyak</malay>
then
it's all on food if food is free and can be replaced with something rather than <malay>duit</malay> then (err)
ya I will <malay>boleh jimat banyak sangat</malay> [ah]
(mmhmm)
clothes <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>kadangkala</malay> [jer] <malay>boleh</malay> splurge
but
(mmhmm)
(mm)
so you're not open minded [ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
for me it's (err) <malay>mengada-ngada</malay>
like some
no
ya like some girls
or people that that do not respect (err) like
(err) ya other people like example <malay>macam</malay> service crews <malay>cikgu</malay>
that [one] <malay>itu tak boleh tahan</malay> [ah]
especially during class
<malay>kalau dia orang betul-betul</malay> like
<malay>tak tahu</malay> like boundaries like as <malay>sebagai</malay>
then like
that's a turn off for me
then text spam him

don't do that
boyfriend <malay>kita semua kat</malay> army
(mmhmm)
yup
I think
no
I feel like with the absence of (err)
like <malay>semua benda</malay> like the system capitalism <malay>semua sudah tak ada</malay>
then you will bring about chaos [lah] <malay>sebab semua orang akan</malay> like <malay>fikir</malay>
like of their own selves like in ways where they can survive so for example <malay>macam</malay> food <malay>semua</malay> food resources
water resources everyone will fight to get as much as they can cause there is no
boundaries you know what I mean
<malay>tak ada</malay> system ya
so some would <malay>tamak</malay> [kan]
so <malay>dapat</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> will definitely
<malay>dia orang</malay> will definitely be selfish [lah] of like whatever resources they can get
and it will eventually <malay>macam</malay> create havoc
so as much as capitalism <malay>semua orang cakap macam tak bagus</malay> it's like much needed in the
much needed in the society unless there's another way in which (uh) we could
(err) prevent like chaos from happening [lah]
