I don't know who
I mean I think you can guess [lah] who what what this entity is [lah] rather than who <malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>abeh lepastu</malay> then
thing is
<malay>kawan aku</malay> texted me
[ah] my our mutual friend <malay>dia cakap</malay>

<malay>abeh lepastu</malay> [ah] [ah] then after we came to the conclusion that <malay>tu yang</malay>
that entity he borrowed the money from [ah] standard [lah] <malay>nak</malay> verify
whether
you just anyhow give random person's number <malay>ke tak</malay> [kan] ya
so that afterwards <malay>aku macam</malay> [oh]

ya
that's the thing we didn't know he didn't even know my friend <malay>ni</malay> that he didn't know that <malay>dia</malay> would be part of this [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
basically like he was caught in the crossfire [lah]
collateral damage I keep saying collateral damage [pe] <malay>semalam</malay>
<malay>abeh macam</malay> we were just
once in the
<malay>abeh terus</malay> when I call him about it <malay>aku cakap kau</malay> tell me honestly [ah] <malay>kau cakap kau tak kasi</malay> number then afterwards I ask him
<malay>yang</malay> that time this [one]
shady number called my friend <malay>tu betul tak</malay>
[ah]
what you claim it was <malay>ke ini</malay>
actually unofficial entity that borrows people money
<malay>abeh dia cakap</malay> [ah] actually <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>asal kau tipu</malay>

<malay>kau</malay> tell us properly [ah] <malay>abeh macam terus</malay> sorry sorry <malay>kata dah</malay> clear
then I found out he hasn't paid in full that's why they are chasing after him
<malay>aku dah macam dah</malay> !haiya!
last month last month not a lot [lah] close to one thousand
yup that's it [ah]
at least that's the only thing I know of [ah]
(uh) his credit rating is bad
[oh] <malay>tu aku tak aku tak</malay> sure [ah] but he can go there [ah]
I think he needed money [ah]
ya
so ya <malay>aku abeh lepastu</malay> then yesterday [eh] this morning <malay>ke</malay> yesterday he said
[oh] that this is the case I mean I think I got enough problem to since I stayed over there
I'm going to move out and by the end of the month <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
don't do this [ah]
it's not what but
you
you didn't really

then afterwards she said <malay>dia nak tukar</malay> until
(uh) next year
[eh] no ya five <malay>ke</malay> march I can't remember
ya <malay>aku</malay> okay [ah] cause he's been a good
friend [ah]
so far <malay>tapi</malay> then
one thing on top of another [lah] that happen to him <malay>abeh</malay> then <malay>aku</malay> keep telling him don't do this don't do this you want to do them not here
<malay>abeh</malay> well
no one listens to me [kan]
the voice of reason
ya
what <malay>macam</malay> very
and no you don't someone who doesn't think of consequences on top like very short-term <malay>nya</malay> thinking

ya
you know you know those kind of people <malay>apa</malay>
I have a problem their their solution is this
but it fixes my problem now
but later I have bigger problems

ya
snowball <malay>anjing</malay>
<malay>dia belum belum belum</malay>
<malay>dia belum</malay> move <malay>lagi dia cakap dia nak</malay>
actually by end of this month
<malay>abeh aku cakap dengan dia takyah</malay> [lah]
end of next month <malay>dah</malay> okay
<malay>abeh</malay> like he thinks that
I don't know he thinks <malay>macam ye</malay> [lah] #paiseh# [ah]
but
<malay>kau</malay>
if he knew about shade <malay>kau asal buat ni semua</malay> [kan]
like I did tell
ya just say just say
ya
ya he should have been <malay>tapi</malay>
that's the thing [lah] that's as good as me using your name <malay>abeh aku tak bilang kau macam</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>nak pinjam duit</malay>
but
you know <malay>aku</malay> secretly put you as the <malay>macam kau</malay> applicant [ah] without without your consent
<malay>tu</malay> shitty thing to do [kan]
<malay>abeh kawan aku tu gi</malay> #geylang# <malay>dengan dia cakap macam</malay>
they were they kept calling him non-stop unknown number
he was pissed [ah]
rightfully so [ah] to be pissed
exactly
as of now today tonight
I have no idea I think he staying somewhere else for now not sure
too ashamed to show his face
still here
not really doesn't have a place <malay>macam</malay> I dare not kind of thing <malay>macam kau</malay> [lah] basically
you have a place to go but you rather not [ah]
that kind of situation [ah]
ya basically [lah] same thing [ah]
wait
he has an option but he rather not take it [ah]
but
now seeing this
<malay>aku</malay> didn't really bitch at him about it [lah] <malay>aku tak macam bising ke apa</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak</malay>
you know
like I wasn't really angry at him I I told I told him upfront <malay>aku</malay> I I said
I'm not angry at you <malay>aku</malay> more concerned rather than angry [lah] cause I was not in the receiving end of this [ah] so it's fine [lah]
you you are you did
you should apologise more to our friend [ah] rather than me but I'm just concerned that I don't know what else you did that you haven't told me
cause that time <malay>pun</malay> the previous issue <malay>pun</malay> he didn't tell me then I found out <malay>aku pun</malay> pissed [ah] I told you already not to do that anymore
I have
I have
[eh]
his side business side hustle side hustle
what
how I know [oh] but
you know people are driven by greed [what] some people do not know how to control their greed
<malay>macam</malay> it's addictive [what]
ya the other time his money at work got stolen I told you [what]
(um)
ya he left
(uh) some cash cause I don't know [ah] he sounds like an old man I don't trust banks I don't want to put money in bank
I have no idea why
and then afterwards he left his money at work at work locker not just work ya not even a safe
yes of course it got stolen <malay>abeh lepastu</malay> he was really bummed out about it
I keep advising him keep your money in in the bank
cause
no one listens to me
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
alright
<malay>aku</malay>
am thinking [lah] what to do now <malay>abeh ada</malay> other [ah] <malay>ada</malay> issues as well
no he borrowed me money <malay>abeh lepastu aku</malay> trying to recoup back the amount that he took
<malay>bab tu</malay> [lah] he's going to pay back I hope [lah] eventually
by end of this month
ya one thousand two plus rental one thousand
four
ya
it's really cheap [ah]
okay
so
(mm)
sort of
#fahim# no new developments
he's been avoiding us like the plague
I I I don't know [lah] whether
it's he does it intentionally to avoid us <malay>ke</malay>
he's just being him you know avoiding his friends
over a girl [lah]
I mean technically there is a plague going on [ah]
okay
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(hmm)
okay
ya ya ya yup
I've always wondered if any of them are scripted or not
probably [lah] [eh]
(mm)
fame
china boy
okay why
I think he still does [tau] maybe Facebook or something I don't know
I think so
okay which is true I don't
[ah]
from what <malay>aku</malay> understand [ah] my wife said the same thing you get me
ya ya like it it's inside [lah] and so it's called what you said is right correct [pe]
ya
why you were there [lah] at your place then he said if it was
if I did that
#farid# <malay>cakap</malay> he would just <malay>salam</malay> me and just <malay>cam balik</malay>
I mean okay [lah] it's true [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you I get there are some people feel that they shouldn't
be a part of it [lah] cause it feels like they are validating the relationship which they shouldn't
[ah] <malay>aku aku</malay> do feel that every time <malay>aku</malay> hang out and the mistress is there back then mistress [ah] now they divorced [kan]
<malay>aku</malay> every time
ya just boyfriend and girlfriend [ah]
<malay>aku</malay> do feel
(um)
in a moral dilemma every time
that
what I shouldn't be there okay [lah] #kim# said it perfectly [ah] <malay>cakap</malay>
you know I don't feel good that she's there
I don't want to validate this relationship <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want to say <malay>macam</malay> [eh] you cannot hang out with us [ah]
it doesn't feel right [what]
<malay>macam</malay> I want to hang out with him
but I don't want you to be there cause
I don't want
people to think that [oh] I'm approving this [ah] it feels wrong [ah]
so it puts us in a tough spot [ah]
back then [ah]
but then eventually what I did was <malay>aku</malay> just told him nope I ain't gonna participate in this anymore I'll just leave the group chat as long as you are still married to her
I am not going to hang out with the two of you if she's there
your mistress is there once you're officially divorced I will I will hang out with you all
yup
ya
ya
typical #farid# [lah]
like shadow boy shadow boy
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] good names
I think eight years
twenty twelve I think [ah] <malay>aku</malay> don't really remember exactly
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay> [eh] [eh] <malay>anal</malay> [lah] then okay anyways stress [ah] <malay>aku aku dah malas berbual pasal ni aku dah malas</malay> think
okay
(mm)
<malay>nanti kalau rosak macam mana</malay>
what the
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>cakap</malay> please <malay>boleh</malay> #astagfirullahaladzim#
okay
(hmm)
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> just the
okay let's say it was just <malay>aku</malay> #fahim# and
#loco# [ah]
<malay>lupa</malay> [ah] good names okay whatever [lah] <malay>bukannya</malay> [ah] okay anyway <malay>aku</malay> #fahim# and mistress <malay>lepak</malay> just the three of us the whole time
I wouldn't
<malay>tapi</malay> this [one] whole group
know [what]
she's gonna be there
<malay>tak</malay> usually we will know though
it came to a point where if #riz# there she's there
so we knew what to expect [ah]
I mean initially my wife was worried [lah] <malay>dia cakap</malay>
what if you get tempted to you know <malay>macam</malay> add in to the dark side <malay>aku dah macam</malay>
<malay>aku dah macam</malay>
do you know actually looking at this makes me realise that I shouldn't do this more than anything else
ya this is like good practical relatable lesson for me
ya
(um) from what I see [eh]
his wife now ex-wife his ex-wife had the things she needed
but not the things she wanted
and mistress had has the things he wants I'm not sure about the things he needs [ah] maybe she fulfils both not sure
to be fair [kan] <malay>aku</malay> only met his now ex wife [lah] very very few times I think
less than twenty I've known her since two thousand eight I've met her less than twenty times
I okay I mean I mean let's just laid it all down here [ah] [ah] the good point I think she is a nice patient person
diplomatic face
I don't know
ya true
like you need to be very patient with him [ah]
<malay>abeh kalau dia punya</malay> bad points <malay>aku rasa</malay>
she is too deep in this mentality where <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> it's just usually a I told you before we discuss about this before <malay>cakap macam</malay>
like you know girls generally have this mentality where
it's okay for them
to
failed in life cause they have a safety net somewhere
you know they don't have [eh] [eh] concrete plan to do whatever [lah] cause all their life they've been cushion by their dad financial <malay>ke</malay> emotionally or both usually both [lah]
so
they try they tend to take
weird risks [ah]
even at an age when you at you're not supposed to it's not applicable to all [lah] definitely but then it's easier to find these traits among females rather than males
ya ya okay it is controversial <malay>tapi</malay>
but <malay>aku</malay> I I don't know why I I see a lot of okay I'm not saying that I'm not discriminating [ah] this is based on I've observed maybe someone else has a better observation or throughout his life and as a statistic to
prove me otherwise okay maybe but based on what I've personally observed
<malay>aku rasa</malay>
not saying that it's super common [lah] no [lah] just saying that
if we are comparing boys and girls it's easier to find girls with all who has those traits rather than men
ya recklessness
[ah] recklessness (um)
<malay>apa lagi</malay>
probably lack of ambition
okay okay it is more so okay to be fair is more so of your family <malay>punya</malay> background <malay>dia macam</malay> financial background [ah] more than anything [lah] of course [lah] that plays a huge part
[ah] ya privilege [ah] ya [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] to be fair
usually
usually [lah] generally speaking
the daughters are spoilt by their dads and their dads has money
the sons are spoilt by their mums
the mums usually give their sons full attention
this kind of things [ah]
generally speaking [ah]
so based and on that
(um)
scenario like you always quite common [ah] for that dads to dote on their daughters and mum to dote their sons
ya so
it's quite
plausible [lah] I'm not saying that
I'm not saying that it holds true for twenty percent or fifty percent of the female of course not [lah] I don't have the proper statistic but I'm just saying that okay okay you get my point okay back to her <malay>aku rasa dia punya</malay> other other point
bad point would be
she <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [eh] #fahim# [ah] probably it is [ah] maybe in to say someone is crap but to say another person is <malay>macam</malay> he's been wanting her to lose weight but she did not
she keeps promising that she would she would she would but she did not <malay>macam</malay> many many many times
ya ya <malay>aku</malay> agree [lah] I mean he's not exactly the best looking male out there
or fittest [lah] even
not not even the fittest man alive [ah]
in terms of body
chunky
she's always been fat
as in
no okay
okay
[oh] did you see that post today obese is racist
where else already [lah]
what no one should use the word obese cause it's
what
don't know what don't know what and it's racist [ah]
<malay>aku macam</malay> how is obesity a discrimination towards particular race
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
it's nonsense
ya
no some <malay>apa</malay> no no surprise [lah] where you came from like which country you came from
[sial] [lah] brunei
<malay>aku rasa</malay> that's like one of the hardest nation to find obese people
ya
(mm)
[oh] is it
bulgy chonkers
ya
(mm)
[oh]
(mm)
ya ya ya
<malay>aku</malay> believe [kan] the country could do much better if the royal family
okay let's just call them government [eh]
if the government invest in their infrastructure a lot more
attack tourism [ah]
for investment
attack tourism [ah]
yup that that's the thing
invest in infrastructure in country <malay>lagi sikit cakap</malay> company
country
then you will see a better like it attracts more people to come <malay>abeh lepastu</malay> boosts a lot of opportunities blah blah blah the list goes on [ah]
but they don't so <malay>aku</malay> found out also that the poverty there is quite rampant know
not like
second and third
world country in southeast asia [lah] but still quite bad [lah]
if you look at the [ah] if you look at the net worth
of the top man there
ya yup
not close to no tax
ya healthcare is not free education
I mean there's I won't say it's not free [lah] it's not free
poly isn't free like everyone pays the same amount
like unless you are foreigner or I think
[ah] then uni isn't free
ya it should be [lah] or very heavily subsidise [ah]
but it's not okay [ah] let's talk about
[oh] so just now you wanted
to ask about
<malay>siapa</malay>
[oh] #khai# right
ya
anything [lah]
ya
[oh]
more
when it comes to that and
other things [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #wan# [ah]
cause he
told me a few things that she wasn't he wasn't he wasn't happy about with her [lah]
so <malay>aku macam</malay> find that to be very thought superficial is one thing [lah] the other [one] is
too trivial [lah] to even consider them
to be
no cause it was too long ago when they told me it was twenty eighteen I think
<malay>lama</malay> [sia]
<malay>kau</malay> okay you you talk to the guy before [kan]
you know how we talk [kan]
so it's hard to follow what you saying
it's like
<malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>abeh</malay> [oh] anyway <malay>dia cerita cerita abeh</malay> then he emphasise one one point for that half an hour
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> please [lah] get on to your next point [lah]
something like that [lah]
[oh] mistress
well he consented to it [lah] so it's not just her fault of both of them are equally at fault
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [eh]
she he he he said that
she better in bed
then
I wouldn't know [ah]
then she slimmer
ya
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>aku</malay> find that
<malay>macam</malay>
if you want to do this
<malay>takpe</malay> why does it sound like what
ya to me the way actually is very superficial [lah] [eh] he said this one line [ah] <malay>aku macam</malay> palm his face [ah] he said you know initially I thought
she was the one who needed help
but when it turn out #wai# was the one who needed help
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> don't stop throwing that kind of corny bullshit at me [lah] [sia]
<malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau</malay> please please please don't give me a
so ya
I mean that's why he deal [lah] him he claims that
was actually a cry for help then he wasn't happy with his marriage
I don't know I think was just become very stagnant [lah] rather than more than anything else but he doesn't want to admit
<malay>macam</malay> there's nothing is spicing up their relationship
ya
that's the thing
we told him
so we we did tell him to resolve matters with your
wife as big investment when you're still married [lah] if you said
I advised him not to meet your mistress first for at least two months or something
ever since news was way before I met her [lah] personally
I told him don't meet her for like two months or something then you see [lah] for yourself whether it's really what you want to pursue <malay>ke tak</malay> if it's what you really want then go for it of course [lah] no one listens to my advice [pe] <malay>aku</malay> [kan] just an <malay>apa</malay>
don't go there it's not safe you still go there
then she wants the house she wants to fight for the house
which which she should have done from the start [ah] <malay>aku tak tahu kenapa</malay> she still engaged to follow him around
<malay>aku</malay> just find that very creepy
<malay>korang dah</malay>
<malay>takde</malay> anything anymore together <malay>asal kau</malay> do this also I don't know
ya probably yup
[oh] six
fourteen
ya
I never knew you never knew the guy as
the adultery kind
but if you remember him from back then he was always flinging around
I don't know I mean I really thought he's changed cause of
he can cause he has a daughter then he kept saying [oh] my wife is good my wife did everything for me she takes care of my daughter I don't really have to do much <malay>macam</malay> you know I mean it's fair if your wife wants you to do contribute as well or do as much as her [lah]
fifty percent is fine [what] it's both of your kid anyway
<malay>macam aku</malay> don't agree with the mentality [ah] <malay>ada orang cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua kerja perempuan macam</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>ni ni untuk kau</malay>
<malay>salah tu semua salah ni</malay>
ya
<malay>abeh</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> you know some people would step up [ah] <malay>dorang macam</malay> believe that they are better at it
like let's say me and my wife
she realise that she's better at ironing clothes so she does it
cause I suck at it [lah]
yes I do only <malay>aku</malay> only one t-shirt <malay>aku</malay> don't iron
the rest I have to iron
it's good to have one <malay>kau</malay> at least buy a steamer [ah]
<malay>masai</malay> [sia] <malay>tak</malay> iron
yes exactly
[oh] okay [ah]
(um) so <malay>aku</malay>
think that
I don't know
I think it's bad idea for him to live apart
she finally realise that she cannot keep this up
you know lose not losing weight <malay>apa</malay>
gaining a lot of weight her sleep apnea was really bad
which is you were there when
#safwan# told the story
or have you left I can't remember
he said that
he said he was at her play [ah] their place [ah] her place there there so long if he was their place he and #din# this <malay>mat salleh melayu aku</malay> very confused
his name is #saifuddin#
his balding <malay>tak penting</malay> [ah] but
both of them went over to #fahim# place <malay>abeh</malay> [ah] #ruqayyah# was asleep
then #zafran# I think #zafran# has heard it before
and he was shocked that her they were shocked that the snoring was really loud she was sleeping in the master bedroom and they were at the living room getting so loud that they could hear it clearly in the living room
ya so I think she also realise that by gaining a lot of weight it happens to her [lah]
so I don't know
<malay>macam aku</malay> gain when I gain like what seven through sometimes I don't know how much I actually gain [lah] cause I don't really keep track
seven kilo I was so scared [sia] to the point where <malay>aku</malay> realise I must do something how can you gain like fifteen or twenty kilo it it looks like it [lah] I'm not too sure fifteen or twenty kilo and then there's thing <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] when life is good
ya [lah] I I know [lah] but <malay>macam</malay> you can tell [what] there's a huge difference when you look at the photo <malay>macam</malay> from six days ago <malay>ke</malay> ten years ago
then <malay>macam</malay>
[eh]
I really gain like twenty kilo [sia] <malay>macam</malay> you can tell [lah] [pe] the difference
I think for me <malay>aku</malay> at most gain about
ten around ten <malay>aku</malay> actually gain more initially then I <malay>aku</malay> started losing weight
I'm on a
