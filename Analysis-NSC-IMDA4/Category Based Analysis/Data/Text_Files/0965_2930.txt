I can think of one <malay>alasan</malay> that is very <malay>remeh</malay>
and and it's okay
the <malay>alasan</malay> is like is that maybe <malay>dia orang punya suara</malay> is a bit weird like if it's <malay>macam</malay> you know like if you <malay>dengar</malay> like someone speaking and you can know that they're just so annoying
