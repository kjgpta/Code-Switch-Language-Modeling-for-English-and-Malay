my name is #hazifah#
I'm fifteen
ya
so
sure (um) doesn't really suck you know
home based learning it's to me it's flexible but I get tired really easily cause I just get very side tracked
by food and everything else that's at home it's hard I mean you are out quite often so ya I always end up sleeping when you come home you know
ya
so how is work
ya
I mean we gotta live with it for now that ya don't have a choice we have to like I mean phase two is in on nineteen june
sixteen I think
[oh] ya
I think I think I will still be at home until this whole corona thing ends
[ah] this week is my last week so next week [ah]
ya next week sec two's and sec one's are having their last week of as well and then the week after that we completely normal
!wow!
ya if me I will just stay home I mean that's what I do quite often I come home right after school cause I don't really find the need to go out with this corona thing especially with the mask definitely not going out
I mean at least your place has aircon you know I'm in like a classroom with fans and it's so sweaty like if after [ah] physical education right (uh) we we'll take off our mask during physical education but then we're all like one two metres apart or something like that and then
(um) when we walk back to class we have to wear back our mask and like we're really sweaty and it's like really uncomfortable then we have to sit in the class and do our class work and stuff
ya but no contact no sharing of equipments and completely like I'm here right I'm like it's like one or two metres apart I think two
we don't play sports we just exercise so they will show like videos of (uh) people exercising and then we'll just join I mean that's so far I had my first lesson [ah] my first physical education lesson was to do exercise to (um)
like follow what like there's this youtube thing that they on and then we like follow what they do basically like your squats your lunges and all those things and basically on your own kind of thing [ah] so ya sort of boring
(mmhmm) it's kind of boring but you gotta live with it and like participate cause it's school you know
ya mask my mask really stuffy but apparently mine doesn't really get [oh] last week right so last week I was in school and then my friend brought some of her <malay>kuih-kuih</malay> for me
ya she made <malay>kuih suji</malay> for me and then she didn't make for me [lah] she make for #hari raya# then she brought some for me and then I was eating in class cause I'm a fat ass so you know gotta eat and eat then she what's that she (uh) she she pass me like (uh) in a styrofoam container and I
like keep I kept eating it in class cause I was like hungry and I was trying to I was trying really hard to stay awake in class and and (um) it was low-key hard but after like eating one or two right I think it got like at the (uh) edge of my lips
so it started to like stain (uh) sort of quote on quote stain on my cloth mask and then (uh) ya it end up becoming really smelly
ya but her her her <malay>suji</malay> was is a bit different like (uh) you know those bigger <malay>suji</malay> you know the I don't know if you know but it's like (um) bigger <malay>suji</malay> and then (um)
ya
ya and then the and then the taste is like a bit sourish not really sour but a bit off not exactly super sweet kinda taste then ya but I still ate it cause I was really hungry LOL
ya it stink and then it stink for the whole week because I only wash my cloth once a week
(mmhmm)
ya so not to mention how it's more environmentally friendly but one thing I don't like about the disposable mask right it hurts my ears like the tip of my ears here right where it holds your thing it hurts for me like I can wear it I wore it my friend gave me a disposable one and I kept it in the ziploc bag that we have to bring for physical education like every time we have that lesson
so I tried wearing it in class cause my nose was really wet and I was really sweaty cause I just came back from (um) and then I wore the I wore the disposable one and my ears was like hurting I think cause I was fidgeting with it a lot and also cause it's really big on me I think I need the baby ones
ya all my friends like they wear the adult size and they're all like fit's perfectly fine like even the elastic it's like nicely fitting it's not pulling too hard or what but for me I'm just like it's like what's the point of wearing it's so loose
ya and then the new the new mask that the government gave right recently is so thick like really thick and it's so uncomfortable and like when you talk right it's so muffled like it's worse than the first one
sticks to your face
like if you sweat right it sticks to your face
(hmm) I mean if you don't go out often you wear disposable mask okay [lah] you can reuse the mask every once in awhile depends how long you wear it
rich people things
I mean maybe they reuse the mask and like for maybe like two three maybe four times or like a whole week you know
same
ya I know I do that everyday and then the first day I went back right and then (uh) I I had to fold in my mask I fold in you fold out right I fold in and then (um) my friend was apparently she was indirecting me she was like cause at the side or at my jaw there right it it like comes out it flips out so it looks like fish
I mean she didn't say that [lah] but she didn't really told my friend and then (uh) ya and she indirect me I know it was me but like I just like (mm) whatever [lah]
she say something about (uh) she was talking about the mask and why the end like coming out kinda thing and I'm just like I mean I know it's me but I'm just going to <malay>tutup mata</malay> you know don't really bother
honestly school kinda suck I I really don't I don't exactly like school cause I just don't wanna see my friends okay it's not all my friends basically just the girls except one girl and I wanna see my guy friends cause like damn they the bomb they like my family
(mmhmm)
I know right (mm) I don't know I just feel girls can get very toxic I feel my only quote on quote girl friend is my sister
shade on you
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya but like they come there are like times where they can get really toxic where like like you say [ah] like out of jealousy or like whatever something like that like and so the other time I pass my math right for the first time in secondary school so I pass my math
and then they all looking at their marks and then they will start comparing and stuff right and then they looked at my marks and they were like (uh) they were like (uh) smart [lor] something like that [lah] they will say something and then they'll be like smart [lor] or like good for you [lor] and then I'm just like (mm) okay mean
she didn't understand you could have asked the teacher
(mmhmm)
it's hard [lah] because ya we're competing against at the end of the day when it comes to O and N's we are competing each other so it's hard but at the same time it's also how to how like the maturity level is not saying that I am mature I I can be very immature but like
it like talking about this right like maybe they don't talk about this kinda things but maybe it's their only way they see it to like you know okay I don't know what I'm saying but (um)
(um) I'm just tryna say the maturity level that's all
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
eight
eight to three eight to two something
(mmhmm)
(mm)
!wow! I study geography yet I only learn about climate change
(mm) ya
I mean actually (um) what you said about the singapore not having (uh) the other thing about speech blah blah thing [ah] (um) there's this thing where I learn in I think in english or something we had this thing where we can speak to the government about things
it's just not really open I guess I think you have to like make an appointment and then and then they will then I think you have to be there and then they will have this they have a conversation about it and then ya and also back to the education thing
they make us think about what we wanna do very early and it's really to me I find it really hard because what if I end up losing interest in that thing what if I don't wanna pursue it anymore can I just change into something else or the thing is it takes like a whole you might have to go back like if you wanna take
(um) engineering or something and then you lose interest in that and then you then you get interested in business you have to like take you have to go back to poly after you finish your engineering or something like that and then you have to go to poly and do your your (um) business
it's like very hard to choose what you wanna do and if you wanna stay there forever
(mmhmm)
maybe you can use your architecture skills to like you say you want to help people right maybe you can like I don't know build homes for those in need or (um) you know like help those organisation that that need architectures to like build houses or like whatever that is needed
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
haiti where that
wait is haiti a country
how do I not know that
[oh] (uh) the
nevermind I was thinking a certain TikTok saying so it's like this girl is like a maid and she's something like
she's like a mixed and then she mix the two names together and then she ya okay I'm done
funny
it's hard I mean the world is all fighting to be better to be like better than the other country and ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) for sure
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
cause like
ya
(mmhmm)
ya ya getting neglected is hard
at least to me it's being neglected (um) okay maybe that's how I see it I don't know about them but I mean all they do is talk about work and it's tiring ya it's like tiring to listen to it like everyday even though you sit down at the table just to have a nice meal and even if I'm there right
all they do is talk about work and like when I tell them to give it a break right they will like they will be like (uh) who give you the allowance and stuff like that and it's like !wah! I just wanted to have a nice family lunch but you just gotta bring up about work and like
that's all they do this all they talk about like if I go into their room at like at night right before they sleep they're always talking about work and this morning when mama was awake she was on the comp then she was trying to find ways to like like do (um) amazon stuff
and I mean I get it [lah] like you awake your mind is fresh and you wanna get some information about it inside whatever [lah] but like when it comes to family dinner or family lunch they just cannot stop talking about and it's so hard
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya and now that makes money plus people I think money weighs more than people
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but the good thing is that we have (err) government subsidies for hospital I think do we I don't know but there are like cool advantages of being singaporean at the same time it's also really hard to be one because of all the work
that's that is (um) on us put on us I mean even as a student I feel like there's a lot to do cause you know we got so many subjects at hand it feels like work not for my own kind of thing
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
streams
you know they stop you know they have (uh) my school is spelt as one H one O one U one G one A one N not gonna lie this year sec one is just kind of bad I think we got my school got trend twice I think by sec ones
and it's like bad and [oh] my god I'm sorry to say I really don't like the sec ones they are hella annoying okay maybe I was annoying but at least I wasn't like chaotic I wasn't out of hand kinda student I was still like
I was still like [sia] I was just really loud in my cohort okay maybe in just stream I was just really loud I was known to be really loud
ya sort of not really [lah] not a <malay>minah</malay> actually
ya I was really a big mouth but like at the same time (um) then when it came to sec two I really tone down like I really like you couldn't really hear me anymore
and then sec three and I'm just like really pure quiet when at this point I just like you all do what you wanna do I'm out of here I don't even wanna be here I want to sleep with my <malay>selimut</malay>
no my <malay>selimut</malay> is damn nice I don't know why you don't like it so comfortable
it's not I washed it okay I wash it every once in awhile when it gets dirty
it is !wah! the last I wash was like what one month ago you don't even wash your <malay>selimut</malay>
I mean it's dirty you eat on it you eat all your what you eat [ah] you eat your sensations at least I don't eat on my one
cause
it's my baby it's not wrong it's like my child it's like my cat but I don't bring my cat everywhere cause he doesn't really like to be around me twenty four seven so
ya
[ah] my eye's getting itchy
low-key think there's something inside [ah]
same
making me yawn
ya we got this it's fun though to do this
(mmhmm)
ya even though we have to like lock the room door and put please do not enter we are recording okay that's my that's my (um)
ya that is on me because like our last recording (um) #harith# was there and you know it's like noisy
I mean he likes to be in our room cause it's cooling cause his room is really warm cause now he has his bird right if I open the window right the bird just keep looking at the window and then if you like then I have to close it and be like what do you want ya I'll close it and he will like he'll look at the window then he will look away it's like ya don't ever open it
or not I'll beat your ass and the bird's really cute has really weird name though
there's nothing to be scared about I know she will just bite you but if it's bites you right it's (um) playful kind of bite it's to get to know you bite I had to deal with that for like the first few days he was here I mean he hasn't been here for very long but my index finger on my right hand right there's like the place where you bend
there's like a drop here that's where he continuously kept biting that and it's like really painful now cause he used the end of his beak to bite compared to sometimes when like cause his beak is curved right then your hand will like nicely fit so that's how he but then you will like his tongue will start moving it's like really weird but it's it's not really obvious but he's quite friendly one we just cannot make sudden movements he gets really scared sometimes
ya then you don't want to traumatise him
it's a bit like a giraffe's tongue it's not long though but it's similar to a giraffe's tongue somewhat similar
ya I'm tryna say it's like a giraffe tongue but like (uh) divide by like one million of it's size that's how small a a birds tongue is is like cute but yet when you first see it is like kinda weird after awhile you just really get used to it
he made a hole on my phone case I wanna cry
I gave him the old phone case he walk away [sia] and then no the thing is he likes the bright coloured one but he doesn't like the black one and then #harith# tried to put his phone case and then he went forward but with my phone case right the purple one he keeps coming forward but with the black one he's like nope I'm out
iphone is flat
he does
okay maybe he doesn't he just kinda goes forward and then he's like nah that's not that's not nice then he walks away then he comes back to my phone case and I'm just like stop it please ya
ya man that's you you cannot you you don't seem to bond with them I even if it's not yours can still born with it but you just refused to
ya that's #gingy# #gingy# is cause she's very <malay>manja</malay>
papa the way papa mama described #gingy# how she really likes to get stroke and the way I see #gingy# with #kaya# right like when they call her or whatever right it's quite obvious that she's a very <malay>manja</malay> cat once she gets to know you
you just it's just that some cats right you need more time to bond
and then they will like they would like to be around you but there's some cats that are just naturally <malay>manja</malay> and they like everybody that's not exactly bonding though
you don't if like if have those like like honey for example
he isn't exactly bonded with you at most like if he sleeps on the bed right and then you need to you wanna lie down on the bed too he doesn't mind you just being there even with he's okay if she just sleep and then he's behind he's like okay sure
but like with me right he is K at least I feel very bonded with him cause you know I feed him every day and then I stroke him and like I I spend always carry him to me I spend a lot of time with him I feel like I've bonded with him it's that special bond that you feel when you have like your own pet
I mean you don't necessarily have to get own pete but if you do get hamsters so our house can be a mini zoo (oo) I'm really hoping honey and and swain gets to know like gets to like know bonded
and so that they can
no so that I can let honey go as in when yesterday I let honey sit in the room right cause I was doing math (uh) I was doing my math class at the end of the day as well at about one forty one plus
one forty-ish so I was having lesson so I let honey in then I on the aircon then I was listening to class and then swain was in the cage and then honey I brought I took #harith# chair and brought it closer to honey I put honey on
no closer to swain I put honey on the chair and then I push the chair closer to swain's cage so honey was just really looking at swain for like a good what half an hour forty five minutes and then after a while [ah] I took honey and I cut his claw and then (um) and then #harith# took out swain
and then I held honey and then honey tried to interact with swain by smelling him but of course swain was like no I'm scared and then he run
and then after that ya so that was the end of yesterday's bonding and then today's bonding they sort of came closer a lot faster but at the same time honey was really scared okay not really
K at first when honey got scared when swain started like trying to smell him or like or like if the paw touch his body or whatever right he start to flinch and #harith# thought it was me but not me I'm not retarded
but ya honey flinched and then honey was like (um) and then after a while he started to be honey started to like (uh) get
really he got really uncomfortable after I kept trying to like put his paw on swain I did take his paw and kind of pat swain but then when swain turn around he flinched
I think honey is more terrified of swain than swain being terrified of honey
but then isn't jerry a mouse
true
but it's quite cute though and then when mama came right swain was really scared cause I think mama was standing even if I stand right swain get scared
so I think cause mama was standing so swain was a bit scared to like move towards honey also cause they were warming up honey just came into the room
also after honey started flinching and stuff right and then he he looked up at me he looked like he was begging to like for me to let him go so I let him go and then he walked to the door and then he was using his small little paw and he was like <malay>buka pintu buka pintu</malay> ya cause the door wasn't properly close
bro #harith# room is so hot like it's really warm and humid and has like [oh] my god
I (um) (um) the dream you had (um) I
they want to be friends
or maybe they're friends
but maybe they wanna be friends but like
but then but then you know tom tom maybe jerry doesn't know how to interact so he just keeps like ya you know
ya deep thoughts deep thoughts
(mmhmm)
I think I think spongebob and tom and jerry have very deep meaning because family guy and like simpsons they have a more direct meaning
but the thing is spongebob and tom and jerry they're very simple but if you look at like many more different perspective right like there's different meanings but
with simpsons and and family guy and those similar shows right they don't you don't really look at exactly different perspectives because they have like voices they have like constantly talking and it's a more complex quote on quote complex
talking compared to spongebob spongebob cause it's like kids talking get what I'm tryna say
[oh] my god
it's like it's like
it's like if you have talking right you can understand it so maybe it has a somewhat direct meaning maybe what you're you're what you are listening to is that's what it actually means but whereas you look at tom and jerry and and
you look at tom and jerry and what's the other show spongebob cause spongebob from the way their conversations are right is like very very simple
(mmhmm) true
(mmhmm)
this was really nice I hope one hour of putting the sign outside the door trying to keep people out
if we get this
