need to choose either sailing or a shipyard job [ah]
so like
so like (um) for me I I pick the shipyard job [ah] because I heard of like very good like (uh) what response from like my seniors say like shipyard is good over sailing [ah] because you know sailing got like a lot of commitment you know like for sailing (uh) <malay>bila kau</malay> sail [kan] (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>enam</malay> months like that
six month <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] away from your families [lah] which I don't think I personally think I cannot [ah] you know
ya that's why [ah] cannot [ah] you know
for me I don't know [ah] we usually we like homesick [ah] you know so I go
on overseas
but it's definitely something <malay>aku macam</malay> look forward to [ah] like in in the future [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah]
then also <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay (um) <malay>apa dia</malay> [eh] [oh] okay
(uh) I haven't pick yet [ah] any yet
but like I planning to [ah] so now <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) my first year [kan] [ah] I only got to like try out the different [ah] so like we all can like
<malay>apa</malay> choose [ah] the various types of sports or
club activities [kan] so for my first year as part of a
as part of a module
<malay>kat sekolah</malay> we you can choose [ah] so I for the for me I pick the <malay>apa</malay> floorball [lah] like something new [lah] for me like I never try before [ah]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
okay [ah] I find floorball quite interesting [ah] like
quite fun [ah] you know enjoyable your [ah] <malay>kawan kawan</malay> you know quite fun [ah]
but like honestly it's not something I like [ah] as a sport [ah] you know if
<malay>apa</malay> sport I prefer
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay got offer quite a few sport [ah]
you know you got <malay>apa</malay> soccer and basketball got tchoukball <malay>gitu</malay>
but I I don't know [ah] for poly I maybe won't pick like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) sports [ah] I will definitely choose something else [ah]
maybe like okay so for they got clubs [ah]
(uh) clubs as in <malay>macam</malay>
okay so you know got different schools right
got like the engineering <malay>dia ada punya</malay> business
then you got my school [lah] called the maritime academy then got the design everything right
so they got their own clubs [ah]
so my one is (uh) club
then <malay>macam</malay>
I was planning to join [ah] in the first year <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak dapat</malay> like you must go for <malay>apa</malay>
(uh) interview [eh] (um) when you first join then they prompt you to join then I apply [kan] then I went for the interview
like I talk <malay>banyak tau</malay>
I like talk a lot for the interview but then I <malay>tak dapat</malay> you know
[ah] that's why then like my friends who like just join then they like very blur blur then they apply they get you know then I like !walao! [eh]
[ah]
ya that's why
but hopefully if I tried apply again <malay>dapat</malay> [ah]
[ah] that's why (mm)
ya ya true [ah] it's okay [lah]
sports
clubs [ah] I think clubs can [ah] but I think you if I not wrong you also can
join other school clubs you know let's say you you can join design school club also
ya legit not joking man
ya can can actually can [ah] so possible
kay
so like for you [kan] Nads</P2>
your school what what course you take [ah] for you I know you are in year one but what course [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then what are the modules you will like learn
like for your course other than like programming <malay>gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) okay
[ah]
for me personally [kan] (uh) I enjoy the <malay>apa</malay> workshop [ah] not for like year one
because I <malay>apa</malay> secondary school I <malay>pilih</malay> [ah] what as my elective I pick D&T okay design and technology [ah]
so like for workshop practice is like something not something new for me [lah] cause I got experience in secondary school [kan]
so like for me is (uh) is fun [lah] cause it's actually something new [ah] some s- some of the what (uh) workshop practice or something you like welding (uh) you got the two types of welding <malay>macam</malay> gas welding <malay>ngan apa</malay>
arc welding [ah] something new [ah] then I <malay>macam lepak lepak</malay> you know
but (err) on workshop cause I workshop [ah] <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> four hours [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
[ah] like four hours of our that one you know and it's a module you know
like for for workshop is is a module and is (uh) about four credit score you know
ya so something easy can like get A [ah] you know
ya it's not bad but like honestly workshop is very fun [ah] for me
really enjoy [ah] cause like you can hang out hang out with my friends you know
then like you can do to do work together
something fun [lah]
ya
ya
then okay for my course right (uh) they got year one for year one to year two they only have like workshop practice you know like they equip you with like (uh) different kind of <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia punya</malay> skills [ah]
like we are they like
valve fitting or something all those kind of stuff right
then for year three [ah] is where like the interesting part [lah]
cause no no no before the internship [kan]
(err) <malay>apa</malay> they
it's another workshop but the that workshop right is like <malay>dia macam ada</malay>
what [ah] the ship's engine turbine and like the ship's engine (uh) fuel system you know so like for us (uh) students right before we go for internship right you must understand [ah] all these kind of (uh) machinery how it works
cause if we just go for (uh) what [ah]
if you just go for interview [eh] no sorry my bad but instead of interview <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) internship when you go for internship (err) what without any skill how you gonna progress right know what I mean
ya true so we need to equip ourselves with like some skills [ah] before our internship
[oh] what also [ah]
[oh] ya there's one interesting thing I I learned about from my seniors for year three
okay so they have this (mm)
[eh] they have this like a room a chamber room if I'm not wrong is the
(uh)
(uh) purifier room okay purifier room is <malay>macam</malay> like they do the heating of the main engine all that right so in this room right (err) you are given if I'm not wrong is part of a test [ah] it's like they are given five minutes to fix all the valve properly to the pipes
and also okay when you feed the valves right you must ensure that there is no leakage now
so like (uh) as the water level rises so it's about five minutes [ah] it takes five minutes for a ship to sink so that's an application you know so you must like quickly think fast
if I'm not wrong <malay>kita</malay> will be in groups of five people five people so you have to like maintain the piping system
water piping system and to prevent any leaks as the water level rises cause the okay eventually the water level will rise [lah] but you must prevent it from going up to our like chin area you know so as you are fixing the valve water will start flooding you know you know
so it's like a real life situation if you were to be like on board ship
so you must think fast [ah] ya
ya
ya that's why
that test [ah] honestly I haven't experienced yet [ah] cause I only year two now [ah] but something I look forward to [ah]
but for me because I choose shipyard it doesn't really concern me [ah] cause shipyard job it's not like maintenance of the ship you know shipyard job is mainly <malay>macam</malay> like inspection you know like okay as
as you become a marine engineer engineer in the shipyard industry
ya shore job you can progress to become a surveyor
or (err) what you call the inspector [lah] so they will maintain and check all the valves whether they're in correct order whether they are working properly to prevent like any failures when the ship sails you know
so that's more of like what a profession that
I'm looking forward to like go into [lah] like that [ah] ya
ya hopefully [ah] (mmhmm)
not bad [ah] not bad [ah]
<malay>ape benda</malay> like other things I do other than in school [lah]
kay for me right <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) in my free time I like to game you know
spend a lot of time playing game [ah]
but then like okay okay firstly I start when I game right (uh) I start off with mobile gaming [ah] then I started moving to <malay>apa dia punya</malay> competitive scene [ah]
(oo) #shiok# [ah] I tell you
like because like mobile competitive a lot of people are also going into it
it was like in the early twenty fifteen sec- my secondary school days twenty two [ah] then the prizes <malay>macam</malay> (uh) gift card vouchers so like as a student I I would not want to miss out right
<malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so something [ah]
something to kill time also [ah] in secondary school you know
then for you [eh] your free time what you normally do [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm) ya true true
then like just now you ask me like for my what got any I join right then for you [eh] cause like you know you are like
(uh) year one right like fresh student right got any plans or not to join any for your poly have or not
legit [ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(oo)
(mm)
so okay [ah] based on my experience right
if okay I think you should honestly go for the trials first [ah] cause like all the seniors will be like advocating you to like join a like promoting for you to join right so you go see [lah] which one you enjoy the most
know like okay like you I I personally I know that you will play floor ball in like what primary school or secondary school is it
ya so you obviously <malay>ada</malay> experience [kan]
so maybe you can make it to what (uh) #Temasek# poly (uh) floor ball team [ah] who knows [ah]
ya who knows who knows but I know the floor ball team very competitive [ah]
know
(mm) can [lah] you just you just go for it [ah] <malay>dulu</malay>
see which one you like the most y'know
[oh]
today [ah] I just finished my
last paper you know today
[ah] okay [lah] because like <malay>semalam</malay> I got study like the whole night you know like <malay>macam</malay> two
(uh) got a lot of content you know like one module can have like what eighteen chapters crammed into one one two hour paper
[oh] my goodness legit
so much to study
okay [ah] hopefully hopefully [ah] hopefully hopefully can pass [ah]
but then [ah] after the paper like
at three <malay>gitu</malay> I went for an appointment [ah]
for what [ah]
it's for like
how should I say <malay>macam</malay>
for my
infection [ah] or it's like how to say it's like a pimple [lah] you know in a sense and it bleeds [ah] so I have to go for appointment [ah]
check up first
and I read up ya it it's very painful and very itchy you know
but then I read up [ah] or on this right it's actually called the pilonidal cyst you know
and it's like ya is what very what very contagious you know so it has to be treated then I read up read up then they say <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) it needs to be like a surgery needs to be performed
you know so I immediately have to go down for consultation [ah] so like okay I pick today's date because I thought like <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(uh) it's a weekday and there will be there won't be a lot people [ah]
but then when I went there [ah] my goodness
like legit a lot of people [ah] I tell you !alamak!

then you're so crammed you know
[oh] my goodness
some reason I thought week day three plus
nobody will be there [what] right but then got a lot of people [ah] should have picked another day
the surgery [ah] okay so like kay just now I went for the appointment right then the doctor right keep
advising on the surgery
like okay [ah]
then then he keep saying like don't do this surgery [ah] cause like I'm only eighteen [kan]
then like it will affect my future [ah]
cause this surgery is it's like
quite risk [ah] quite high risk [ah]
have to like what cut open that [one] put me on anaesthesia
<malay>gitu</malay> then
once they cut open they take out the <malay>apa</malay>
the root right that grows on that pimple right once they take out they cannot stitch it back you know
so they have to ya
(uh) pull a skin
<malay>macam</malay> a skin from like either of like my back right then and cover the wound area after incision is made
so I cannot imagine [ah] [a'ah]
[ah] confirm painful [sia] legit

you know when you're like kay now
you finally in right
then there is like you must start studying right you know do you ever like procrastinate when you want to study
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
for me [ah] I also procrastinate [lah] like you know I prioritize my (err) playing games over doing work [ah] my assignments [ah]
but then again if like <malay>apa dia punya</malay> deadline is like
very close right then I'll start doing [ah]
like I would set a timetable
for me to plan out my time [ah] you know because if
I don't do right then my will be affected <malay>apa</malay>
[kan] like if I submit late then the lecturers will penalize me [what] so I obviously have to start on doing [ah]
but there are some points where like know procrastination like took over [ah] then I miss out some of my tutorial I have to submit
you know but I do blame myself for it [ah] you know
but it's something that I have to you know
tackle [ah] this issue of procrastination cause like
<malay>aku selalu macam</malay>
always [ah] since secondary school [ah]
always prioritise my games over the
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> our school work [ah] ya
(mm) !wah!
damn
ya it is hard [lah] but you know we must [lah] you know
it's very hard [lah] then okay like okay
through I believe that there are like some modules that involves in like group projects or like
prep you to for interviews in the near future have or not for is there like any course <malay>ada tak</malay>
ya group projects like that
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah!
(mm)
(mm)
okay
me [ah] okay I have [ah] okay recently
like for this semester one [kan] (uh) I have this (uh) project called the module name is which is <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh)
social innovation project [ah] (uh) ya
so like (uh) we all <malay>macam</malay> is
I think combined with
(uh) different types of (uh) people from different courses [ah] so like
(uh)
(uh) two from then <malay>macam</malay> two from school of computing and two from school of business then they all mix together
for <malay>apa</malay> (uh)
to do a project together so basically this like
what is trying to do with this type of module is
for you to get used to working with other people of different backgrounds when in the working industry [ah]
so equips you with this kind of skill [lah] but let me tell you something [ah] I do not like working with this kind of people legit I tell you [ah]
cause like (err) it's damn #rabak# I tell you this this kind of this kind of people they all don't want to do work you know they ask me to like
do for me then they keep complaining complaining you know like !walao! [eh] why why got so much workload [ah] [ah] I don't want do [ah] like all these kind of stuff you know then expect me to like do everything for them you know
[ah]
like this
ya
[ah] then okay okay this [one] [ah] it happen like
<malay>macam</malay> a few weeks ago before our final group project so like (uh) it was during (uh) hari raya haji right
then got we all got holiday right for us for us to celebrate right
like the day itself right so we were supposed to do like rehearsal [ah] for our presentation slides
then these guys right
ask me to come at like what in the afternoon you know for me to (uh) help them with something and present then when I tell them <malay>macam</malay> I say I cannot [ah] I like damn busy today I got my
my hari raya hari raya haji I need celebrate [ah]
then
[oh] then they say [eh] why like that we you the only malay just come [lah] then I say how can like that I holiday [what] hari raya haji why can come then they start complaining
then I got damn pissed off you know legit
[oh] my god then I just say I I don't I don't give a shit okay legit I'm I'm not coming then they was like complaining [ah] keep swearing to me I I don't care you know so and also for
since they are from computing school designs right
they should know the different type of <malay>apa</malay>
(err) the type of programs <malay>dia punya</malay> different types of software [ah] to do like animation <malay>ke</malay>
or like do some drawing design [kan]
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] I tell you [ah] these guys [kan] is even the girls <malay>tau</malay>
they <malay>diorang semua</malay> they don't want to do the work they expect the guys to do okay and they expect me to do when I come from engineering you know I have no background knowledge of <malay>apa</malay> different type of drawing you know
[ah] !alamak! legit I tell you I don't want [ah] but it's okay [lah]
ya but overall I think it's a good experience [lah]
cause in the end after like a few prompts right
for them to like cooperate together we all then managed to work together [ah]
and also ya it's good [lah] so for our project it's quite interesting you know our project
we made (uh) okay you know for our project our aim right
is to help people with depression you know so like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] (uh) we have to come up with an app we decided to come up with an app
to help people with depression integrate back into society
you know
integrate back into society means like okay if usually if what comes to mind when you think of depression people
like they are like very lonely [kan]
[ah] they are like damn lonely right
!alamak! why like this right then so our plan right for our app right is for them to interact
more with <malay>macam</malay> (err) people [ah] online people online [ah] like strangers you know not in not strangers [lah]
but like people who also suffer from depression for them to make friends it's like a connection hub you know
for people of them their type
and also for our app
because since like a lot of teens just nowadays use mobile phone right always twenty four seven they always use [ah] then we decided to come up with something interesting for them [lah] cause why what what will pull them to download the app right
our
(uh) our the depression app [ah] counter
so we decided to put in like some cute cute thing [ah] like <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>apa</malay> the
Pikachu [ah] Pokemon Go you know or not Pokemon Go concept ya
ya
then our app also <malay>ada</malay> you have (err) what [ah] you have the therapy consultation tab
kay so what's so special about this tab right
(uh) when kay it's for the user right the the the people with depression right when they use the app [kan] they can (uh) what [ah] (uh)
in a talk to like virtual you know virtual controls right so when they talk then they type right say (uh) how are you today then it'll automatically like reply back with something positive you know
ya
(mm) it's it's quite cool [lah] honestly
and also (err)
you can also prompt for
(uh) real life consultants online you know so you want to like one on one (uh) what (uh) questions you want counselling one on one can you know through the app s+which is what I find quite cool [lah] ya
ya (um) and also for our app right (uh) we also put what [ah]
(uh) since like most of us like like to game [ah] like we
most (um) people like to game like they download apps for what
(uh) games right
for most people right then
[ah] our app introduces like some mini short games [ah] so you got heard of (uh) what kind of games [ah] (err) like Fun Run have you heard of Fun Run
[ah] Fun Run like the that one
the run what I say
some mini games [ah] like also we put (uh) animal crossing [ah] concept into the games
so there's like a variety of
(um)
games for the user to play with [ah] which makes our app interesting [ah]
ya a lot of people [ah]
(mm)
ya so our app
since our app is based on (uh) like I said the <malay>apa</malay> [eh] the <malay>macam</malay> Pokemon [kan] like the virtual pet right
so we have introduced like
a
a kind of system where
when you log into the app every day
it you you will get like virtual currency or coins [ah] basically like everyday you log in to the app you get five coins so what what can the coins do so our team decided to <malay>macam</malay> what I decide to do [ah]
with the coins right we can use it to feed our virtual pet you know
so like the shop right we also have a shop [ah] the app also have a shop so it's the shop right we put (err) like the what [ah] poke food poke food includes like the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
what ramen or some like cookie [eh]
for you to feed your virtual pet then every time you feed your virtual pet it becomes more chonky you know
ya it becomes fatter and fatter and also with coins you can unlock like new different type of Pokemon [ah] which is I think quite cool [ah] so our ya it's quite interesting then it will drive
more people to download this app so I think it's like something like
people
will look forward to [ah] ya
forward to ya
so that's about it [ah] for my module interesting [ah]
(mmhmm)
ya ya
also got one more got one more if I'm not wrong (uh)
it was not this year it was last year last year's
semester two [ah]
ya semester two [ah]
it's called (err)
[ah] communicative I can't remember [ah] what is it but the main purpose of the module right it was to equip us students right to
<malay>macam</malay>
(uh) improve our skills you know improve our skills and also improve our interview skills
through this module
so basically got a few skills that they teach [ah] like one of them is [ah] time management skill right
so they give us like a timetable a timeline for us to complete different things then he our our lecturer teaches us the importance [ah] it's like more of educating these kind of skill why is it important in the future
when you go into the working industry you know cause without time management how can you do your job right [kan] do your job properly and efficiently
ya
and also what [ah]
what's that [ah]
[oh] your interview skills [ah]

(uh huh)
<malay>kamu letak kat mana</malay>
<malay>kat mana</malay> [ah]
<malay>letak dekat</malay> thigh [ah]
[eh] so you actually contemplating on putting a tattoo of a pirate ship on your thigh
[orh] but like of all the things a pirate ship [ah] that's like
that's like maybe what a the ten year old you will do or something (uh)
ya
sure sure
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia] its like
the spur of the moment that kind of thing [eh]
but I'm glad you I'm glad you thought it through [lah] !huh!
but you would think
!huh!
[ha] I didn't know [oh] ya yes ya recently like one of the <malay>budak yang</malay> [dah] he came back to station what last night
then he was saying that he working at some burger place with a lot of #angmohs#
then the guy like <malay>bawa motor</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
then he <malay>bawa motor</malay> then he got tattoo then the #angmoh# like [eh] !wah! you are so cool then the malay guy was just like
#siao# [lah] <malay>ini semua malik</malay> in singapore <malay>ada</malay> [sia]
<malay>bukan apa yang</malay> special
but he like just step step <malay>begini</malay> [ah] like that
but the #angmohs# were like you're you're so cool
ya [lah] he working at some burger
like the standard [lah] <malay>kadang kadang belakang</malay>
on the arm
it's a <malay>belakang tangan dia begitu ada apa tu</malay> flower something like that [ah]
is that an actual thing I've never really heard of
that you could do it
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>ada</malay> colour <malay>punya ke</malay>
<malay>tapi beberapa beberapa begitu beberapa ratus</malay> [ah]
[orh] I know my friend recently she bought like
my friend recently bought a she bought a tattoo gun
so she's like
she's like experimenting on herself first before she
offers to do for people [ah]
no [lah] it's just like her own <malay>macam tak ada kerja nak buat</malay> then just
brand tattoos for her friends that kind [ah]
and before she
ya so before she do that she's going to practice on herself first [lah]
which is <malay>macam</malay> <malay>gila</malay> [sia]
<malay>macam tengat buat kerja tidur</malay> [ah]
[ha]
actually
you you know you know about the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>bekam</malay> before
<malay>yang bekam melayu dia</malay>
[ah] like cupping
you know what's cupping
ya ya the one that they put the suction cup on your on your back
[ah] so <malay>yang kalau melayu buat</malay> it's called <malay>macam bekam</malay> [ah]
then there's like the <malay>bekam kering dan bekam basah</malay> so the <malay>bekam basih</malay> right it's they poke
like holes into your body then after that they suck out the blood
so the way they poke is like they use like some
pen with a needle or something then they just like then they just poke through your entire whichever part [lah]
so while I was getting that thing I was just thinking [ah] [sia] [lah] <malay>sakit</malay> [pe] this one confirm <malay>macam</malay>
I think like this is what tattooing feels like [ah]
and maybe if you ever think about getting tattoos again you should go for the <malay>bekam</malay> first [lah] then
you see how it feels [ah]
but like <malay>sakit gila</malay> [sia] it's like
<malay>pedih</malay> [ah]
like getting injections over and over again
okay [lah] I guess
maybe
but he was doing it quite fast [ah]
like really rapid
<malay>sakit</malay> [ah]

was that on impulse also or what
<malay>habis</malay>
(uh huh)
(uh huh)

then <malay>bangun</malay> like <malay>bangun</malay> like I don't know [lah] like ten eleven that kind then <malay>balik</malay>
I mean okay [lah] no rush like not like I'm in a rush to do anything also so like okay [lah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [ah]

[orh]
then <malay>keluar makan semua semua</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa ramai ramai</malay> [ah]
[sia]
[oh] then my medical call
not bad [ah]
quite interesting [ah]
like
cause the the call when it came in right it said difficulty breathing
then my then my was like chill [lah] yes [ah] okay difficulty breathing probably it's like
<malay>kalau merepek ke apa</malay>
not <malay>nak merepek</malay> [lah] but it's like <malay>tak tak tak</malay> serious [ah]
but the call said cardiac arrest so we were like okay
then we just go there like
as in we were rushing up but <malay>tak macam lari tak lari</malay> [ah] just like brisk walk that kind of thing
then we reached the lift lobby
we reached the lift lobby then suddenly one guy came running then he was like panting and <malay>berpeluh semua</malay> then he come in already
then we got into the lift together
then we go into the lift together then we took up then then my my ask him
(err) are you the one who called just now then the guy was like [ah] ya ya
then I started asking him then he said ya he [oh] his brother then his brother collapsed
then we go inside
we go inside
the got two people
one to fight back and one was the community responder
like
then they were already set up they set up the put up a dismal already
then when I came
straight away the second shock given
which is (uh) pretty rare [ah] to to to see like shocks getting given by the [ah]
ya but the guy
<malay>beberapa</malay> shock [ah]
[dah] <malay>beberapa</malay> shock already
<malay>tapi</malay> they shock all in the ambulance [ah]
(uh huh)
[oh]
[orh] but after the first two shocks after that no shock advised that you just keep pumping [ah]
I I think so
<malay>itu kali bila dia orang jumpa dia tak tak</malay> breathing [ah] no breathing no pulse
then
sorry what you say
see someone
for with a shock
[oh]
[ah] quite fast [ah] actually cause <malay>yang abang dia jumpa dia</malay>
so <malay>dia abang jumpa dia</malay> then he collapsed so I that one maybe estimate five
<malay>tak</malay> (um) I think I think five ten minutes max until the brother found him
then the <malay>abang</malay> straight away he called nine nine five then he started doing
then I think nine nine five dispatch the near the my responder app <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] ya people actually use that [ah] do you know that people actually use that
compulsory to what
[oh] serious [ah]
[ah]
(uh huh)
okay [lah] I mean
fair enough but also cannot really force also
but okay [lah] that guy quite nice the the community responder
he <malay>naik basikal</malay> then he cycled over
cause he was at home [ah] he said
ya so he's the first person to reach
(uh huh)
[ah]
[ah]
so from from no breathing no pulse [ah]
[oh] ya that guy
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
so it's within like ten minutes <malay>kena buat</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tak buat</malay> then
confirm gone [ah] is it
<malay>macam</malay> just show show face [ah] okay
(uh huh)
got the what again
[ah] the the one and two and three and four and that kind [ah]
[ah]
wait that was a doctor [ah]
<malay>asal boleh</malay> [jer] doctor
it isn't you know
!wah! <malay>rabak</malay> [pe]
#sian# [sia]
who gets to do as in nobody want to do [oh] nobody wanna do
why [sia]
(uh)
!huh!
but (uh)
I was talking to the the guy who came back station also [lah] so he was saying that
cause
when this is a new thing also [ah] like during out time was it or <malay>tak ada</malay>
[orh]
ya so
I don't know how useful this thing is [lah] but like
I don't know [lah] like a bit half useful a bit half <malay>macam</malay>
no point
cause I don't think I don't think anybody would ever get conveyed their [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>siapa</malay> about conveyance
[oh]
like normal alpha <malay>tak ada buat</malay> [ah]
so can [what]
!huh!
[ah] ya ya the ugly one [lah]
[oh]
ya ya
[oh] ya I #ding# was telling us [lah]
actually they can <malay>buat</malay> [ah] <malay>habis buat</malay>
<malay>terus yang nyonya tu</malay>
<malay>dia ada</malay> feeding tube so <malay>makanan terkeluar</malay>
<malay>habis cakap busuk gila</malay> [ah] so then he straight away ask the boy to take over
also he said <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>nak muntah tu</malay>
like <malay>busuk sangat nak muntah</malay> you take over [ah]
ya the guy was firefighter
it's the [lah] recall
[ah]
that is for firefighting or for the medic that side
[oh]
(mm) (mm)
medical relay [ah] <malay>habis dia nampak segak entah</malay>
okay [ah]
cause I came also like
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai seluar</malay> [jer] [ah] bunker <malay>dengan seluar</malay>
then the top helmet <malay>put tak pakai</malay> so it's just
<malay>bawa</malay> that one medical <malay>punya</malay> equipment bag then <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah]
then go up
but okay [lah] fire fight fire fight come first so
to us like not so
not so stress [lah] cause the guy do the access the all the stuff already
so we just like
I was the sec com ya
no [lah] but my is trained so it's not so bad
as in even if they don't we don't turn out as sec com still okay because
as in even if I came in with zero knowledge it's still okay cause my is trained
ya [lah] definitely [sia]
I like I mean like on paper it's the sec com take charge [lah] but
honestly most of the time it's really just the
the [ah] take charge
cause the [dah] <malay>kena buat</malay> one year course [ah] as in their attachment to the medical side
so like
but last time was to make up for manpower now it's for them to get experience and then go back to fire side to bring their experience over
ya so it's
last time <malay>macam</malay> indefinitely [kan] <malay>dia orang kat</malay> medical side
but now makes sense [ah]
ya
and fire bike
!huh! ya <malay>ke</malay>
high intensity what
what does it mean
is it a type
[oh]
(uh huh)
eight people
!wah!
but <malay>asal boleh sampai lapan orang buat</malay> is it wasn't like alpha be come like on time and then
[oh]
but wonder how often it's actually being used [lah] in
[ah]
[ah]
[eh] my friend from #paya lebar# also the madam told them don't turn out [sia]
they said they want to minimise
[ah] they the the madam told them don't turn out for call like for reservist
[ah] fire site
cause they want to minimize the exposure to the public
then
I #suay# [ah] my
it's just my <malay>sekarang</malay> like <malay>baru</malay> like #ons# [ah] <malay>sikit</malay>
ya [sia]
don't know [ah] apparently it's the first time [ah] that
only the
they said because of the or something [ah]
but I don't know [ah] not really buying it
ya <malay>baru tukar</malay> about two months ago
okay [ah] #bo pian# [ah] just go [ah]
then they also all the all the people were like
he ask us like (uh) sec com for I left [oh] ya the worst part is that <malay>dengan</malay> is double meaning now
so like the one five <malay>tu sekarang</malay> is on repair
so one five two replace one five two
so
one five two crew also turn out for
you get it
so I'm I am
so I am I'm one five one right
at the same time I am one five two
ya
ya
ya correct
cannot ya so either one either or one will turn out
cause the crew is the exactly the same so <malay>macam</malay> <malay>sama</malay>
ya so it's called double meaning [ah]
so like
ya [lah] so must just be extra alert
okay [lah] but as in #bishan# usually quite rare that something happens also anyway
then ya [lor] that's my last duty [ah] double meaning but I left <malay>tak ada</malay> call [lah]
ya <malay>tak ada</malay>
not bad [lah] at least I got to experience a medical call
like it
okay [lah] interesting interesting
I mean at least if ever really I come to a
like <malay>betul betul</malay> I need to do on somebody I think I'd be a bit more confident now
ya
<malay>pasal macam</malay> before this you only <malay>pernah dengar macam belajar</malay> theory [kan]
practice and practical
but to actually see it happen in real life
like different [sia]
what didn't you download the app
[ah]
(uh huh)
I mean <malay>apa</malay> office <malay>cakap</malay>
I think for you all different [lah] cause like your whole entire duty already doing that kind of thing
but for people who not
like not doing that every single day then I think it's okay [ah]
download what
[oh] no [lah] I don't even have my
cert for that one
I don't know I I think you need the cert right to at least go for those calls
ya then
[oh] the card [ah]
[oh] for a as a reservist [ah]
but do you actually go for the training and stuff
like the recourse
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>siapa</malay> [sia]
what did I what did I teach you
[oh]
why did I
have you actually used the hiemlich on anybody before
(uh huh)
[oh] I was reading on Reddit right
hello can you hear me
hello
ya ya
you got disconnected [ah]
[oh] ya our
I was reading on Reddit right like
got people who like
MPTY-
choked to death because they were too embarrassed to ask for help to hiemlich
like
I don't know [ah]
some thread that the they were they were out like a first date or something and then one of them started choking
so instead of asking for help right they go to the toilet to try to solve it then they just die in the toilet
ya
so then
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
that one they are not choking already [ah]
!huh!
so in the end convey <malay>ke tak</malay> convey

then you know that have you ever to the firefighting store
(err) something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> there's this very thick
heavy door <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
that you can close
[ah] so like
then two of them [dah] <malay>terkeluar</malay> so got one guy left inside
then <malay>dia orang dua macam main main</malay> [lah] so they
they closed the door but they didn't close it shut it was like ajar a bit
so it's just like they close ajar
then <malay>dia orang tunggu kat luar</malay> then like [eh] <malay>asal tak perasan</malay> [sia]
then after that
that was from their perspective but from the guy inside the room right his perspective right
it's that he was
banging on the door like <malay>tolak tolak tapi tak ada buka</malay>
and like the <malay>lampu</malay> was on everything
then he like
[sia] [lah] like <malay>tak ada buka</malay> [ah]
so then he don't know why okay this part this part is (err) a bit scary part [ah] he don't know why but he went to <malay>panjat</malay> to the downstairs the scary part
which is like cause it's ya as it's it's it's like a two floor kind of place
so it's like you can take the ladder to go downstairs to the first floor <malay>punya</malay> fire fighting store
then which doesn't make sense because
downstairs is confirmed locked <malay>apa</malay>
if upstairs <malay>tak buka</malay> then <malay>korang</malay> downstairs is like even worse it's gonna be locked also
but he climbed downstairs
then he climbing down the ladder he looked down <malay>gelap</malay> [kan] then he saw like a figure in a corner like swing back and forth <malay>begitu</malay>
[ah] then he like <malay>panjat</malay> [ah]
then he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs
he <malay>panjat</malay> back upstairs then after that then the door opened [ah]
then door open then he like he told them [ah] what he saw
then the two people outside like [eh]
but we didn't even close the door [sia] we just like we just held it ajar
<malay>tak tak dengar</malay> [ah]
ya that's the
that's almost as scary as the <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
as my my my call
as in not my call [lah] but the one that guy <malay>kena rasuk</malay>
mine is mine is like first hand experience [lah] this one is just <malay>macham</malay>

[eh] then <malay>si</malay> #affaf# <malay>macam mana sekolah dia tu</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> what we hear <malay>lepas tu ada kata</malay> start january <malay>ada</malay> start march what you have to start you know much ya okay the thing is
can she Google whether any provided result beside kaplan
no [lah] I mean
(err) <malay>tu</malay> [lah] I mean the the the
correspondents <malay>tu macam</malay> last time when I go melbourne study [kan]
in #seoul# is one of the agency other agency <malay>pun ada</malay> so like this (uh) uni [oh] kaplan one of it is there any other agency
we went to kaplan to register her
[oh] different uni
don't you think with his diploma in kaplan can she use that or not
to for the bridging [oh] no you cannot then you have to go this
uni <malay>mana apa buat</malay>
[ah]
[ah]
it's exam-based also [lah] I mean written written exam
but if there's no choice how <malay>rasa</malay> if
the one that those without the <malay>apa</malay> is without the examining examination <malay>tu macam mana</malay>
how many choices she have
but
so <malay>nak kena ambil</malay> I mean it's the same
line [kan] must be the same line cause
you cannot change
courses [eh]
ya I mean with this combination diploma
if she opt to other <malay>macam</malay> early childhood
can she use the diploma or <malay>tak boleh pasal dia tak</malay> bridging
ya example <malay>kalau</malay> [oh] this [one] <malay>ada</malay> the next one is this [one] is (uh) no not examinable
but the course is this
whether she want to consider that
cause if she want to choose what she want if you have to take exam she have to take exam [lah] [kan]
no choice
that's two [lah] <malay>satu sama ada dia nak ambil</malay> with examinable
or she will open with non-examinable but different course
and also must know whether the diploma if she has <malay>tu boleh pakai tak nanti kena ambil lagi</malay> [kan]
cause if she wait again <malay>dah</malay> she waste one year <malay>ni dia</malay> wait again <malay>tiga bulan</malay>
<malay>nak buat cepat</malay>
now is december
I thought she say <malay>dia punya sekolah macam</malay>
career gardens <malay>apa</malay>
(mm)
[orh]
is different course now this the uni is still exist [lah] I mean the the this the studies only the courses no more <malay>kenapa</malay> low intake <malay>ke</malay>
but part time will be what how many years three years
[orh]
but what is different if she's a part time students and full time student what benefit
<malay>apa</malay>
her
[orh]
[ah]
but the thing <malay>kalau macam</malay> because now <malay>pun</malay> she take the bus <malay>pun</malay> she will pay adults fee just no school pass [kan]
then she's no more [ah] means she's tertiary student what
(hmm)
like I said if the the thing is whether the diploma kaplan diploma is recognised or not for all of these other uni
ya
this [one] is (uh) this [one] the
[ah] bridging ya
so you must have that diploma
at first it's was ya
(mm) waste about five thousand one year I think is probably that <malay>baik</malay> go to other place [seh]
it's just is it good to sit with her I thought you must go to to the school with the
consultant I don't know then one time you just trash out <malay>nanti tak tahu lagi</malay>
ya
(mm)
but I mean does it change if
this is kaplan <malay>tukar dia punya</malay> uni [kan] with these courses
do you think also the same thing they might have new course new ones new courses
can check online <malay>tak</malay>
cause now is limited time [eh] <malay>sekarang dua puluh</malay> plus
I her <malay>other</malay> friends <malay>sekolah mana</malay> private <malay>mana</malay>
kaplan <malay>juga bukan</malay>
with her behaviour <malay>seram</malay>
not very confident
the thing is when you go outside
is different
how you carry yourself
if you don't
practise what you were supposed to practise you go outside

<malay>dia punya</malay> know <malay>dia punya</malay> movements a lot [ah] that's why make me
make me headache
[ah] maybe that time before I ate a lot [ah] <malay>banyak</malay> at that time <malay>banyak banyak sangat makan</malay>

really <malay>tak tak tak boleh menghargai</malay> [ah] <malay>permainan macam gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>rasa macam menarik tapi tak menarik</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk untuk orang-orang tua</malay>
<malay>tak menarik</malay> [ah] <malay>untuk untuk orang muda-muda</malay> okay [lah] but for old for senior citizens
I think they cannot afford (uh) to to ride that kind of (uh) rides [ah]
(uh) the best part also last time we did was (uh) what's that

electric engineer [eh] electrical engineering [ah] <malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [ah]
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> like
he was telling me also [lah] like he don't really know what he wants to do with his life <malay>gitu</malay> so <malay>takde</malay> direction <malay>gitu</malay> so he say he want to go for course counselling I say okay go go go go go good good good
because he
thought that (err) because <malay>dia punya</malay> poly <malay>punya</malay> course <malay>takde</malay> exam
so he thought maybe <malay>ada</malay> exam <malay>lagi senang gitu</malay> then he thought like maybe like even without <malay>macam</malay> passion he can still <malay>macam buat</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> survive <malay>gitu</malay> but then apparently he's like not surviving very well

if you ask me I say go ahead [lah] <malay>macam</malay> if you find something that you like and you really find something that you want to do that's even better than suffering for
like (uh) (uh) three four years [seh] (uh) (uh)
correct exactly my point it's it's like
I rather you do something you want to do [lah] if you ask me but he is already telling me like !wah! I don't want to feel like I wasted my time to but I'm like I would rather you do something you like honestly
[ah] <malay>baru</malay> twenty five [seh]

I've seen so many photos of new zealand in like postcards and I was <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
ya that was so fun right and australia in camper van !wah! love those time [seh]
ya <malay>bila</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> travel <malay>lagi macam</malay> camper van was so nice right I mean like it's a different form of travelling
and like it just allows you to see the world in a different way [lah] you know right compared to when we stay at airbnb
like you can just parked up anywhere and just
<malay>bila</malay> time <malay>nak makan</malay> we can <malay>makan</malay> or like we can just stop whenever we wanna rest
or just you know if you happen to find like a nice eatery remember the donut eatery
ya I think that was berry van !wah! that was so nice
fish and chips right
ya they do fish and chips in a different way at different places [lah]
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more when they were in australia compared to
ya [eh] you said that you went to new zealand the other time
do you do anything interesting over there like
I don't know like they have like skydiving bungee or something right
[eh] but bungee is like once in a lifetime kind of experience [eh]
what fifty plus <malay>lima puluh</malay>
<malay>sabar sabar sabar</malay> he actually did it
[oh] my god
serious [eh]
okay okay okay
[eh] but I heard if you do this kind of high risk activities right like so they will do a health check and then they will see whether you're eligible for activities and then you'll get some kind of like cert after it right
(mm)
so what interesting stuff did you do there since you didn't get to do bungee
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so my cousin and I didn't keep up
<malay>pergi</malay> pub [eh] <malay>pergi</malay> pub hot chocolate !wow!
[eh] so was the first time that you felt snow or <malay>macam</malay> how was it [ah] <malay>macam sejuk gila ke</malay> or like how was it
[ah] K
[oh] okay
wait but you but did you guys packed for snow or not like did you have your all your winter clothes and like your thick you know you have the thick wear and everything
K [lah] at least you were sort of prepared for it [lah] to happen
[oh] okay [eh] <malay>tapi dalam cuaca macam gitu sejuk-sejuk</malay> [ah] I think it'll be so nice to have a hot drink right <malay>macam</malay> hot chocolate or like
I don't know what's nice over there
[eh] hot chocolate <malay>dekat</malay>
(err) melbourne was quite nice right [eh] or no no no no let me think
there was another hot drink that we had at the melbourne winter market what was it [ah]
like it was like an (um)
like a ya like an apples spice drink or something right
ya
ya
yup yup correct [ah] <malay>rindu</malay> [seh] <malay>tu</malay>
[ah] my god super super #shiok#
ya like you know like I have like
the best memories in a camper van like there was one time
when do you remember when we were like cooking right we were cooking something
and then I think we were parked at some national park was it a national park
<malay>yang</malay> the one you remember the wombats there were wombats around us there were wildlife around us
ya and then <malay>bila</malay> wombat <malay>tu macam bau kita punya makanan</malay> !wah! he just like crawled up to our door
!wow! like that's an experience you won't get here [seh]
ya [eh] how come <malay>tak ambil gambar</malay> [seh]
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true [lah]
ya
ya yes
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kecoh saje</malay>
for a moment I was thinking like should I throw my pan out of the door so that they can eat outside you know because like <malay>kesian</malay> when when I saw them at the door they look like so hungry and I don't know like like I just felt like I needed to feed it to feed them
ya ya I guess and probably they can't eat human food also [lah]
ya more more expensive places (err) like
those I don't lame places [lah] like I don't know some jewel factory which is not what we we sign up for
correct correct
so unforgettable
[ah] <malay>lepas</malay> COVID <malay>pergi mana</malay> [eh]
[eh] but okay you can go by driving but if you could fly I mean the possibilities is endless [what]
that's true
[eh] but you know what I've always wanted to do really like drive up all the way like you know #selangor# pass #selangor#
and then all the way to the borders and pass to thailand like I think that will be so fun [eh] but the way need like I don't know do we need like some kind of
license or how how do we go about doing that [ah] to get to thailand by car
<malay>dia penat gila</malay> [ah] you have to break and make lots of stops right
yes yes definitely need to stop in [lah] like I need my dose of man
ya I really hope this goes away soon [seh] K <malay>tak sabar</malay>
[ah]
you can actually leave your car over there [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
nothing will happen to it right
like wherever you leave your car to travel to probably at the airport or something should be quite safe right
[oh] ya never thought of that [ah]
ya ya ya ya correct correct
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
ya but it's interesting to explore different modes of transport all your travelling [lah]
so <malay>macam</malay> like that time when we went to tasmania right like we'd I think we got on all kinds of transport [ah] there was car
we drove that camper van right and then we got through (err) got through to tasmania from melbourne by ferry
and then after that we still took our camper van on another ferry to bruny island right yup
ya and it was so cute
and then
I think that was just the experience of trying to see how you drive onto
ya but that was nice [what]
<malay>tapi rasa macam</malay> you <malay>macam</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
ya but at least from the small bruny island boat we could see what was happening around us when we went into the ferry right it like we couldn't see anything happening because you when the bunker and all
ya except when we went out to the deck [ah] to explore the ferry [kan]
bunker did I say bunker
ya ya correct correct the cabin ya
[eh] <malay>selamat tak</malay> seasick [eh]
ya I guess in a big boat okay you don't really feel it [lah]
ya correct
ya correct
ya [eh] you know what I miss another thing I miss about traveling
weirdly I miss the supermarkets <malay>kelakar</malay> [kan] <malay>kelakar tak</malay>
I don't know if you do [lah] but that's just me
they are just so <malay>lain</malay> right
ya the range I remember was definitely much more than what we have in singapore ya like
yogurts come on yogurts chocolates correct ya it wasn't that expensive
ya but like even the meats and everything was like so fresh !wow! I don't know why food tastes so much nicer overseas I think cause it's fresh produced right
ya
ya [lah] that's one of our ways that <malay>kita nak</malay> save <malay>duit</malay> [kan]
ya like so fresh and like
I don't know [ah] [oh] it's just damn different [ah] or maybe like we are just so used to singapore food that ya
ya the ice cream was
I don't know I <malay>rasa apa dah pakai</malay>
(err) wait (err) K let me recall [eh] van diemen's was the one <malay>yang kat</malay> farm right
ya
and then there was gelato #messina# which was <malay>dekat bandar</malay> like the city area
and gelato #messina# was [eh] what flavours were there <malay>lupa</malay> [ah]
but okay but you know the farm like the van diemen's one had (err) more like
farm and natural kind of flavours like the berries pepperberry and <malay>macam</malay> all those like fruity kind of flavors but gelato #messina# was like hip [ah] <malay>macam</malay> modern
so <malay>macam</malay> (um) I don't know [eh]
[eh] #amorino# <malay>yang mana satu</malay> [seh]
yes yes I remember #amorino# was the one where they shape the ice cream <malay>macam bunga</malay> like that <malay>macam</malay> the petals was that the one
yup you know that one ya that was but <malay>macam tak</malay> memorable <malay>sangat</malay> [ah]
ya but if I had to pick
(uh) [oh] it's a tough one (err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] (err)
#amorino# K #amorino# is off the question van diemen's for the flavours and #messina# for the range
ya I think
<malay>tak</malay> I'm sure you like my #messina# better right
ya because but !wow! #messina# has that much flavours that it's so difficult to choose one
<malay>pening</malay> [seh] I <malay>tengok</malay>
ya
<malay>faham faham</malay>
ya but like that's a refreshing flavour that I don't think I've ever tried in singapore you know what
apple cranberry are you serious
no that's like just purely like apple like granny smith apple and cinnamon but that's not like a super unique or anything [ah]
gelato #messina# [ah] hands down ya
okay to each their own okay to each their own but tom's palette cause they have like local flavours [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] what what do you call it (mm) what was it like #yuzu# and like seaweed ya so it's like the local palate ya so it depends I guess
ya (mm)
[eh] and the other thing that I really like about
going overseas is that like markets you know like the
the farm what do you call ya farmers' markets and the fresh produce !wah! best [seh]
like I think there was some interesting food also that we find at those markets right
<malay>macam</malay> there's raclette cheese in remember ya that was good [ah] that's not something that's easily found here
ya best donuts [seh]
[eh] but is it because is it because it was very cold over there so <malay>macam</malay> you know the experience of eating when it's cold and you're <malay>lapar</malay> like that just makes you feel that it's the best thing ever
ya
(mm)
<malay>borong</malay> market okay trying to remember
like that trend hadn't reach singapore's shores is it
<malay>macam</malay> it wasn't it wasn't like popular or <malay>macam</malay> ya it wasn't like the it wasn't trending yet [lah] basically
[oh] ya that's [eh] so actually bombolinis was like pioneered by dunkin donuts
dunkin donuts
(uh) I think it's the donut itself [ah]
very unique right
ya ya ya I remember they were like super thick and like !wow! oozing out [ah]
correct correct ya
like I remember there was one <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] flavour <malay>ni macam</malay> some honeycomb thingy right
like honeycomb custard or something !wow!
!wow! like mind blowing [seh]
ya that was interesting [ah] ya
[eh] what what was that like curry curry [eh]
[ah] thai green curry [eh]
I I remember I remember there was something like (um)
<malay>pisang goreng</malay> is it <malay>pisang goreng</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> they said that it was <malay>pisang muda goreng</malay> or something like that
[ah] plantains ya correct
I'm not sure if that that's the same thing as banana or not
they grill or fried I can't remember but it was actually quite nice [lah]
[oh] to like caramelized the whole thing [ah] is it
[eh] [eh] <malay>mana nak dapat</malay> [ah]
that was also like a random find right
like I remember we came for souvenirs or something else [lah] like an exhibition or something but we chanced upon the food like the food stalls right ya like we didn't task was really like we didn't even know about the brownie <malay>sebelum tu apa</malay>
ya
what's dragon's den <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> [seh]
<malay>ini macam</malay> shark tank <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] K okay okay
ya
how did you know that she was actually (um) in dragon's den as in
[oh] <malay>macam</malay> like the article like she published or something [eh]
[ah] okay okay okay
miss all the good food [seh] overseas but I miss (um) ya I miss that we had to be resourceful also overseas <malay>macam masak sendiri</malay> and all [kan]
ya
I do I do like <malay>macam</malay>
like you know when we were craving for
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] for example #prata# probably like we would actually
trying to find a #prata# shop or <malay>teh tarik</malay> shop and pay an exorbitant amount <malay>untuk beli</malay> just to <malay>macam</malay>
satisfy
ya I mean that was before we found instant #prata# over there [lah]
ya but ya [lah] I do miss I do miss local food when I'm away
so what was your point again
ya
noodle oodle I think
ya
ya it's things that you miss about your local food that you seek over there [lah]
just because you were craving and you didn't have it back then [kan] ya <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>entah</malay> [ah] maybe like it's the circumstances that made us miss food and therefore we feel that the food that we had overseas was so much nicer than <malay>kat sini</malay>
what what what what do you miss
<malay>kau</malay> singapore <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
what was so nice about it [ah] was it like the spices or <malay>apa apa yang sedap sangat</malay> [ah]
okay okay
livable boy <malay>sama makan sama hidup</malay> [eh]
ya
that was I think the same area as the pie shop is it
ya actually the pie also not bad also
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like <malay>apa</malay> [eh] what do we have shepherd's pie [ah]
like I no I remember there was sweet and savoury like (um) things on the menu
and then (um) ya like we shared quite a bit [ah] we went there I think <malay>malam</malay> [eh]
a pie pie face
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya that was nice also
!wah! <malay>rindu gila</malay> [seh]
(um) let me see there was very nice milkshake and jacket potatoes <malay>kat</malay>
ya
ya so that one was really like we drove into a quaint town
like was it even on our on our planning I'm I can't even remember [ah]
ya
ya correct
ya but you know in all those even despite all those changes and what not like we still managed to chance upon like nice places but
ya I think that was some some things which are unplanned are just
ya I just like
I guess [ah] I guess
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] like
like like I didn't even know something <malay>macam</malay> so basic and simple can taste so <malay>sedap</malay> you know what I mean
ya milkshake and skittles and wait <malay>apa</malay> what was the filling <malay>dalam</malay> jacket potato <malay>dia lupa</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>macam</malay> I don't think it was tuna what was it [ah] just like sour cream [eh] it was ya something like really simple but remember <malay>kita</malay> order <malay>lepas tu kita</malay> order <malay>lagi lepas tu</malay> ya it was that good [ah]
ya
of course [lah] we had to [what]
ya
<malay>sedap sedap sangat sedap</malay>
ya like it's so ya I don't know robably like ya like you said [ah] before the freshness of the produce and <malay>macam</malay> ya things are just
probably like
I don't know
more abundant over there
so many things to miss about being overseas <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>yang kita boleh buat kat</malay> singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that one standard [ah] standby <malay>duit</malay> [jer]
ya
no but you know why people spend on prada over there
because compared to when you buy over here it's much cheaper over there [ah] even though it's in a thousands
<malay>macam</malay> ya you really save more I mean provided you have the money [lah] but you really in terms of the price you you do save more and ya I mean people really like to go into stores <malay>pasal dia orang suka</malay> touch and feel the bags ya the shopping experience (err) like it's over there it's like
<malay>yang</malay> unbeatable [lah] and ya you I think
you can probably get a few bags for the price of
you know probably one or two bags that you get over here instead so you really save a lot [ah]
and because those factory outlets [kan] have everything under one roof [tau]
it's not just one brand <malay>tapi macam berlambak</malay> [ah] brand
bicester [kan] bicester
bicester
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester

alright alright alright so you guys were like <malay>itik dengan ayam</malay> [ah] <malay>berbual</malay>
wait wait let me guess let me guess
is it because the #prata# was huge
then
[oh]
wait wait wait so wait you are saying that means like #prata# <malay>bom</malay> [ah] so <malay>kirakan dia ada macam</malay>
but as in they served it on the side or <malay>memang</malay> it's it's really like with the sugar and all
[oh] my so he gave you guys one first or <malay>macam mana</malay>
ya at least this guy was nice enough not to capitalise on your
on your
[ah] okay okay okay
but they didn't sell any plain type just like the the <malay>manis</malay> one [oh] okay okay so it's just how they eat it over there [lah]
I see I see
yup
so what siesta time basically <malay>macam</malay> nap time lunch time nap [eh]
[oh]
but if they have a siesta okay because this is something new to me [lah] I've never I've never encountered this before so
<malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> siesta if they had a siesta like will they then open their shops until it after they reopen okay [lah] then that's not so bad [lah]
okay that's not too bad
because you know how like in australia they will like close their shops by like five or six except for weekends and thursdays or something like that
ya ya which is I think fair for the employees [ah] it's just the shoppers will probably be like [ah] what are we going to do now at such an early time like (uh) we still want to shop
<malay>masih</malay> [ah] madrid
he <malay>pernah kerja</malay> at malaysia or singapore is it
[oh] K K [eh] what was he doing in madrid
is that something you would consider like working overseas
(mm)
yup yup yup yup yup
ya working overseas is something okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
ya [lah] ya [lah] that's true I mean until you're really put in their situation then you will understand you know like
what it demands of you and whether you like it or not
cause like travelling is like a totally different thing but working and staying over there like the day to day thing is different from holiday happy happy [kan]
ya ya that's why [lah]
(mm)
like would you say that canada is a livable country totally
!wow! okay
(mm)
(mm)
but when you say community do you mean because you were studying at that time right so when you say community do you just mean that it was like the uni like your circle of friends who you met there or community at large <malay>macam</malay> like you know the muslim probably like the muslim network outside of your studying
(um) circles and stuff
[oh] but how did you find out about your <malay>ni</malay> the circles outside of your school
active [eh] [ah] okay
[oh] right right okay
ya so you've really got to immerse yourself in the experience of fasting overseas [ah]

[oh] last night my friend
video called me until until so late
my two guy friends one of them
(uh) no the the guy the one in the girlfriend
called with us [ah] but he himself is not there
ya <malay>yang</malay> birthday surprise
so the three of us
video called without him for the surprise
(uh) yeah
ya [lah]
<malay>tak salah</malay> [pe]
it's a surprise it's called a surprise
so (uh) we we got plan A and plan B
I mean I mean
I mean like [dah] [dah] <malay>berbual sampai</malay> one one plus
of course have to come up with a solid plan right
no plan A (uh) plan A we go we go #Sentosa#
the beach [lah]
so he and his girlfriend [dah] <malay>kat situ</malay> then me and my other guy friend
come as a surprise
yes I think it'll be fine
why [ah]
why [sia]
so weird
no so go #Sentosa# (uh) we come with a cake and some light snack I think like Pezzo [eh]
then ya
then (uh) we get this combo
you know that now they are promoting tourist stuff for Singaporeans right
yeah so there's packages that you can visit different places
yeah so we we are we are going we are going for this package which which is like (uh) forty two dollars
or go
(uh) the wax museum
Tussauds
ya I think it's that one
(uh) the wax museum some Marvel
<malay>belum</malay>
some Marvel
[dah] that's one for one you know means we can split into two [lah]
ya so split into two (uh)
one for one so two [lah]
yes
yeah
then (uh) that that wax museum (uh)
some Marvel Marvel <malay>punya</malay> like
(uh) what else I forgot [lah] what else <malay>ada kat dia punya</malay> package yesterday I I read together with them then ya [lah]
(uh) later [ah] but basically
basically (uh) those are our activities [lah] for the day
yeah then
after that (uh) they want to eat at satay by the bay is it
I've never been there my entire life
yeah
(uh)
no I know where it is I know
I know where it is but I've never been there to eat
no it's like a hawker centre
but very
the ambience the ambience is no it doesn't it's outdoor
night it's dinner
(mm)
ya so that's our dinner plan then second
(uh) plan B is
me and the not birthday guy
we go there and set (uh) we go Marina Barrage
yes we go Marina Barrage (uh)
we set up like a small
you know like my birthday that time <malay>macam</malay>
glamping something like that
ya but this one we
ya but now we do our own
is a company <malay>yang buat</malay>
so this one we do our own [ah] like small picnic mat some food very <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay>
this is Marina Barrage got anyone do tentage [meh] I never see before
no people just sit down and hang around there
that day <malay>punya</malay> is not bad cause it's a bit intimate in a way right
ya
because there were other people [lah] that's the best we could find actually
obviously [lah] everyone will aim for that spot got shade [what]
it's two onwards
I would think we'll reach there three plus [ah] this is our plan B
so the the the <malay>macam</malay> deciding factor is
(um)
if the birthday boy <malay>bawa</malay> motor <malay>ke tak</malay>
and my guy friend <malay>ni yang</malay> the non-birthday guy
<malay>dapat kereta ke tak</malay> he can drive [what] okay our intention is we we we told the girlfriend [ah] [eh] like
you you ask him [lah] go out for once <malay>tak yah bawa</malay> motor then I say but
but I say that will be very suspicious
because ya he then I say you use [lah] the excuse <malay>kalau pergi</malay> #Sentosa# like
parking <malay>mahal</malay> then he say but can park at the #Seah# #Seah Im# [eh] he always park there
he always park there then like
it's like it's like we might be meeting someone
I told them that
ya [lah] like caught them off guard kind so
yes
yeah can
<malay>boleh</malay> pass [ah]
ya
you must you must give the poker face like nothing is happening
no
he will definitely follow
because he did say he did say that (uh) she did <malay>macam bilang dia</malay>
(uh) on your birthday I already have something planned so you know
almost two years
[eh] or is it more than two I don't know [lah] but
long enough [lah]
ya
anyway
ya then that's sort of like the deciding factor [ah] then I said okay then another if if let's say
my other guy friend cannot get a car <malay>kereta bapa dia</malay>
then we go Marina Barrage because it's easier
what was the deciding factor again I forgot [ah]
no okay wait no if we have a car we go to Marina Barrage
what's the plan [ah] <malay>sudah lupa</malay>
[ah] actually if you ask me frankly I prefer <malay>kalau pergi</malay> Marina Barrage
because [dah] <malay>dekat dengan kedai makan</malay>
I don't like to waste time
yes yes
just just so that <malay>macam tak</malay> waste time on the road I feel [lah]
but
from the other guy he feels that [kan] <malay>macam meriah kalau dalam kereta semua</malay> if he <malay>tak bawa</malay> motor
then I'm like he cannot [lah]
yeah
yeah
I honestly think Marina Barrage is a good idea
I I lazy [lah] go through all that <malay>apa</malay> monorail [eh]
but but
okay I'm okay no okay [oh] wait wait wait
no we all like the activity we all can agree on that it's just that we know that we are starting late [oh] yes I remember the deciding factor
okay if we go #Sentosa# we must start like <malay>lepas zohor</malay> [lah] that kind
ya but then he has class <malay>ngaji</malay> so
yeah
weekday cannot [lah] he [what]
then
ya so need to wait he finish <malay>ngaji</malay> by the time like two already then <malay>nak</malay> travel all the way to #Sentosa# three plus
so you see three plus
we can enjoy the activity the package got five different place you know
where got time to
no no we didn't choose that there there is a package with cable car but we didn't choose that
no
<malay>kita kita nya</malay> more like museum attraction kind
it's not really
I know got #Shah Rukh Khan#
you've been with me at Hong Kong
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
what I say just now
no then like [oh] yeah that's the deciding factor because sometimes
the girlfriend say [ah] sometimes he like <malay>penat</malay> from so he
say he don't want to go for class [ah] he skip that week's class
then I'm like <malay>kalau</malay> he <malay>penat</malay> like you know
yeah
then I but I told her [lah] (uh) whatever it is we don't be the one to tell him
we don't be the one to tell him not to go for the class [lah] it's wrong
yeah
yeah I mean if he wants to let him decide on his own
he [dah] <malay>biasa buat</malay>
if he
<malay>siapa</malay>
#Tampines# [ah]
I think [ah]
no actually don't know
I think he usually come back #Tampines# he don't like to go back that house
no [lah] but he he always bring motor he will always pick up her first and she stay near #Tampines# hub there
so
no
he will always pick up then then we were talking then she was like okay (uh) <malay>apa</malay> you wouldn't believe it we wanna go #Tampines# hub also <malay>naik</malay> motor
even though it's like <malay>dekat gila</malay>
near #Tampines# hub
no <malay>lapan ratus lebih</malay>
yeah
yeah but ya [lah] he he likes
to <malay>naik</malay> motor [lah] so cannot stop him
yeah
ya ya that's the deciding factor now I remember
so if if he still <malay>macam</malay> go for <malay>ngaji</malay> then most likely is Marina Barrage [ah] cause
<malay>macam</malay> we won't be able to enjoy the attraction as much cause we'll be rushing
<malay>dia</malay> by six sudah <malay>tutup</malay> I think
attraction in #Sentosa#
yeah
six last [eh] entry [eh] something like that
ya [lah] which which means that there is five activities so if from three o'clock you wanna cut cake eat first that will be four plus already
cause we bring a small cake
(err) it's very he
okay the guy wants to get Butter Studio cake he wants to pay so you know let him be <malay>biar</malay> [lah]
yeah well they all want it that way
I okay [jer]
yeah
I give my opinions but you know (uh) eventually I feel that the one that has more say is the girlfriend [lah] cause
she would know how to get him there or
I like surprising people
I'm pretty good at it
but yeah I mean there will be a time where I'll be like you also right
so let me enjoy my youth
let me enjoy my youth okay
yeah but I really I really hope that we go Marina Barrage
yeah it's simpler
then like
you know the <malay>kedai makan dekat sebelah</malay>
I've never eaten there right so I ask him <malay>agak agak berapa</malay> [ah] <malay>kena bayar</malay> like how much is the
food [lah] estimate
he said last time he went he paid three hundred plus
but but with eleven people
then like I got a shock [ah] I'm like what in the world three hundred plus
<malay>korang korang makan apa</malay> [sia] <malay>dorang beli banyak</malay> [ah] all guys
all guys yes I must add that all guys
so it's like
and it was during the time so they are probably really hungry
and I was telling them [ah]
I was telling them (uh) I'm a very picky eater you know and like I don't know what's there so
I was saying that to the girlfriend
yeah
then
then she's like [eh] then I then I told her [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
worse come to worst <malay>aku beli air</malay> [jer] [ah]
then she was like <malay>kesiannya datang jauh jauh minum air</malay> [jer]
I don't I told her I don't eat satay
I really don't
yeah I mean if there's simple food like <malay>nasi goreng mi goreng</malay> I'll buy [lah]
yeah
[eh] but the place looks nice they wanna go DuitSg actually
I don't know but I know it's a famous place right now people are always going there
Canberra Canberra
DuitSg
(uh) they sell their specialty is what [ah]
[ah] like this type [ah] <malay>macam</malay> shell out [eh] I feel
I don't I don't eat this kind of thing [lah] okay
yeah <malay>macam</malay> I don't
to be very honest right I always dread everytime people ask me out to eat then they ask (uh) <malay>mana kau nak makan</malay> [ah]
I hate that question because like I really don't know where to go
you just make up your mind and then I follow
it's okay [lah] just go with the flow if cannot then cannot [lah]
we can just like
<malay>bawa</malay>
but like
very light food [lah]
cannot eat cannot eat I okay [jer]
(um)
(hmm)
(uh) [eh] (mm)
that that that that's a
that's a good
point [ah] I will tell them <malay>takut</malay> like <malay>penuh</malay>
(uh) I did say if we go #Sentosa# <malay>tak ya gi</malay> Marina Barrage Vivocity area <malay>ada</malay> [pe] then he was like <malay>tak nak nak makan</malay> restaurant #atas# <malay>sikit</malay>
then I'm like
Vivo (uh) that's what I thought (hmm) then <malay>dorang kata apa nak makan apa</malay> Mac then I'm like
then I'm like okay guys anywhere I don't know much you all decide about food
ya about food I really don't care
all I need is drink
I okay as long as I have water bottle with me
yeah
it was super hot bro
ya ya they did mention that
ya
anyway ya so that's the plan [lah]
(um)
then we talk about like other things [lah]
she you you can tell that she really put in effort to
<malay>kenal</malay> us [lah] cause she knows like
yeah
that's what she say [ah]
ya and she's not like <malay>malu malu dengan kita</malay>
she she was the one she was the one who said [eh] <malay>korang nak jumpa</malay> for dinner <malay>tak</malay> a few days ago then I was like
<malay>nak</malay> discuss about this [lah]
yeah then I was like <malay>masa tu</malay> I busy
I do a lot of things so
I'm like (uh) I think FaceTime better [ah] but like ten thirty onwards
ya so ten thirty onwards yesterday they call me until one plus
ya then
who the two guy friends and me that is our clique we have other friends but
#Arshad#
(uh) we were in the same class <malay>tapi kita ada</malay> different clique
[ah] subset [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
one big group
<malay>abeh ada</malay> smaller group
yes yes yes that's right
so he is in that big group
okay in that big group there's the three of us
inside got that circle three of us then inside this big group got another
slightly bigger circle the one that come over to eat
yeah [lah] you know
those people
no those people [lah]
those people are like the other group
overlap meaning
<malay>hari raya</malay> [ah] (hmm)
[oh] the thing is (uh) out of the three of us that two guy friend and me
the the guy <malay>tak suka</malay> the same person I don't like
yeah so so
so he he said what for attend such thing
like so he likes to be within this three of us
yeah
ya bubt it's easy for him to do that because he wasn't he's not one of the girls right he wasn't even close to her to begin with
yeah
yeah so he don't like
yeah
the other guy also don't like <malay>tapi dia pandai bermuka</malay>
yeah yeah
so sometimes <malay>raya</malay> also he never come then I a bit sad [lah] cause like I mean like I close with them [what] then only me and the other guy <malay>ada</malay>
then
ya no loss then he say it's okay (uh) I will go to your house for <malay>raya</malay> with the other guy [lah] just the three of us I'm like okay
ya then ya [lah]
so but then we
ya I think <malay>hari raya</malay> is the only time that whole big group meet
they know
they know how close I am with the other two
they I told you right they are going this weekend
yeah
yeah
yeah
then when I I said in the group I was busy you guys
no then then
#Arshad# say in the group (uh) <malay>apa apa kau kalau tak pergi</malay> then <malay>kita tak nak pergi</malay> [ah]
then I'm like no [ah] don't let me be the deciding factor [ah]
just go anyway I also <malay>bajet</malay> [lah] I spend
<malay>ni nak keluar</malay> for the birthday anyway I want to spend money right
(mm) ya true so
I also <malay>macam</malay> don't feel like how I would feel last time I'll be sad if I never I cannot make it you know
now now I'm just like okay go ahead [lah]
it's okay
I said that then then the the other girls they !alah! (uh) <malay>apa</malay> you never go then <malay>macam</malay> boring [ah]
then I say [lah] anyway
<malay>kalau pergi lima orang</malay> then that one person won't have a pair if you take rides
and I'm always used to be the odd one out so
if we go in odd numbers
I've been out with three people to and it sucked
ya
ya ya
and it really sucked
because every ride of course she would wanna go together with the other girl
(uh) I mean !huh! I don't mind
I don't mind I'm not
I enjoy [lah] but you must go with the right group of friends
so far the best experience I had was probably with #Humaira# and marissa
no <malay>tak pernah pergi</malay>
yeah I realised that (uh) I enjoy going out with
<malay>macam</malay> company just another person
I enjoy just one more person don't need like a group
<malay>tapi</malay> three three people is still not bad
yeah
ya that's how I feel with the two guy friends [lah] I mean
other than the fact that they are two guys
I okay
yeah
I don't also [what]
ya you see like like #Ria#
like I just go with another person anyway that one no
that one
that one no choice
only the two of us
(mm)
it's okay [lah]
I mean yeah they go see they are going they are asking about the price haven't buy the ticket
sunday
yeah
yeah I know [ah]
I told you what dorang <malay>kena</malay> <malay>kena buang kerja</malay>
so sad [leh] is
is because I recognise their faces so it
because they don't look they are not Singaporeans it's easy to tell [what]
no it's because I went there prominent [lah]
like
every weekend with different group of friends
during I think that one poly right
during my break
then I get the pass
(err) towards the end towards the end ya [lah] third year
okay [lah] (uh)
I sorry [ah] but ya [lah] that's the difference between you and me [lah] I enjoy [pe]
I enjoy all the ride now the rides that I used to be scared of is no longer scary for me
yeah
(uh) red one not blue
the blue one the <malay>kaki</malay> tangling
dangling I want to tho
yesterday [ah] the girlfriend was telling me <malay>kau</malay> [dah] <malay>naik yang merah</malay>

[oh] ya I remember eating that with #Humaira#
I remember you were pregnant [lah] last time when you go with me
crazy
I know

it clearly stated no pregnant lady should be on this ride
that was early early part [lah]
this is just before you went <malay>umrah</malay>
it's just before you went <malay>umrah</malay>
yes you are right
crazy crazy woman
yeah you're crazy
it was a thirty second ride [lah] so
some kids are scared
there is the moment that thing drop [what]
do you even remember what you took I don't think you remember because you were just having fun
yeah I went with Marissa she was she was screaming her heads off
#Aisha# <malay>aku takut</malay> #Aisha# <malay>aku takut</malay>
ya I told her that then she's like <malay>tak betul</malay> [lah]
(uh)
I got somemore drawing to do
[oh] ya I haven't reply <malay>ni</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya ya
ya ya cannot
cannot <malay>tangguh</malay> anymore
what was her email [ah]
need to find her email
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] anyway
<malay>semalam</malay> [oh] after we talk about the birthday thing we talk about like other things also [lah]
that's the thing I feel like she's not shy to speak to ask about
stuff also
yeah
she talked she talked about (uh) how
we were saying [lah] we know we know the process of how he met her right
then she a bit <malay>malu</malay> [ah] and then she was like <malay>korang</malay> [tau] [eh] we we know everything
they (uh) he saw her in school but he wants to <malay>kenal kenal</malay> with her right
so found her Instagram
and then
you know you know the line that guy like (uh) <malay>apa</malay> guys like to use or like they [ah] basically he said (uh) <malay>dia</malay> the girl that [eh] <malay>hari tu</malay> I saw you at
<malay>apa macam</malay> like [oh] bazaar #Geylang# <malay>masa tu bulan puasa</malay>
that day I saw you at bazaar <malay>ramadhan</malay> because he saw the stories [lah]
<malay>padahal</malay> he wasn't even there he wasn't even there I saw you at bazaar <malay>ramadhan</malay> (uh) wanted to <malay>tegur</malay> but you look
<malay>macam busy</malay>
ya you know the nonsense
nonsense kind of
line [lah] I mean it's not even true he wasn't even there that's the funny part
so she replied and then they started talking
ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
why what makes you why why do you think he <malay>lurus bendul</malay>
ya he knows what he wants [ah] that kind
ya
that's right
yes
ya (err) also because he knows himself better [lah] learnt from mistakes
last time he used to be a bit <malay>panas baran</malay> if he don't like someone
he will take action
!huh!
I think a bit [lah] he's not that bad
it's just that teenager angst you know
back then
ya ya ya whatever you call it
whatever you call it [lah]
but he changed for the better seriously he changed a lot
ya it's it's that kind of feeling [lah]
he's only what four right calm down
he's not even going to primary school yet then you will freak out
he will grow up because he meet
a lot of people he would learn how to do things on his own
suddenly you don't even hear him screaming mama anymore he will just mind his own business
so that he's not afraid to <malay>macam</malay> confide to you anytime right
(mm)
I think that's me
I think I share a lot of things happened in school or whatever to
I do that I do that just so she won't feel worried
that's my main objective not really because I want her to know what [eh] what's happening
no no no
now now as a mother do you think that is right
no right if you see your daughter or son
very quiet you don't know what's happening
I tell you already I don't know I you didn't
yeah yes definitely because I didn't even remember talking to you
you were
ya I feel like you were in your own world
you (uh) it's like I don't even talk to you I don't even know what's happening in your life
yeah
now now that you mentioned it just now right you got married when I was in sec one
so it sounds a bit funny
teenage [ah]
yeah but you already bloomed [dah]
some someone [lah]
yes
ya
really
[oh] my god you all nerds
and the teacher never react [meh]
(mm)
it's okay [what] you late but you still study well [what]
this is what [eh]
secondary school I very busy with my [ah] that's all I can say
seriously [ah]
[oh] my god even
even without O levels in your way

crash landing on you
I do that but at home
yeah but well
seriously so sad no exam also you study very hard
okay [lah] good good for you [lah]
some people can do it
<malay>abeh nangis</malay>
what in the world
I don't understand why you cry
[oh] my god I didn't know you were such a geek
you know you know when it was me in school when there's a surprise test
then I just look at my friends did you did you study no okay
then just do the test [lah]
I don't I mean
I learned halfway through in my life when I was in school
I learned not to put so much pressure on myself and some things I cannot control
what I mean
school's supposed to be fun don't have to cry over surprise test
I'm talking to you right now
yeah maybe when he's big enough like me next time you can story
yes of course
yeah
but in secondary school I think I was just busy with my and upper sec is my
until seven plus eight
until the
ya [lah]
it's okay A for effort
crazy
they never see [ah] I remember my friend
(uh) doing the practical right so at the back with the
drilling drilling machine it's called drilling what is it called I think so
but it's for acrylic right
she didn't tighten the acrylic properly and she on the drill
so the thing starting spinning so all the
chips flew out then cut cut cut cut cut cut her hand everywhere
and then I was just behind her and then I'm like
(uh) are you okay then I'm like off the damn (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
off the damn switch [lah] why are you like you know letting the thing keep on spinning
because she was shocked herself
then then I just
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] it's a bit it's just like
you know acrylic like plastic sharp sharp
cut cut cut cut
yeah so <malay>dia punya</malay> like plastic
the sharp edges
yes
so I just went to the side and pull out the plug
and then my teacher come
you know teachers are usually supposed to be strict right
he just
he laughed he was like what in the world are you guys doing
it's just a drill <malay>dia cakap gitu</malay> he would expect something to go wrong on another machine not a drill
the drill is nothing wrong it's just where the the the the holder where she put the acrylic she never tighten it properly
yes #kiap# the thing whatever you call it
but
no but sec two lower sec (uh) cannot enter <malay>ini</malay> [kan]
workshop
can [ah]
I don't even remember what I did lower sec
see [lah] what is it
[oh] you you have those type of days too
[oh] my god
imagine is #Bahril# knew this [oh] my god
nonsense
this is what primary school
[eh]
you know but truthfully right in secondary school days right
I rarely copy homework
truthfully I do but it's only those where I genuinely forgot to do or those where
<malay>susah</malay>
it's not really I leave it on purpose I've never done that
crazy
(mm)
yeah
I also
I do dance performance I do (uh)
I am a sports coach
and
it's not wrong [what]
sure sure
sure
if you say so
maths club there's a club for maths
that should be banned
that should be banned
yes
I know what is that that one primary school <malay>ada</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
you know what was my brain when I was younger
it was just dancing
drawing colouring I don't remember asking why the ball bounce like that
what is two plus two I don't care
you know
then
I I would be those type of prefect because every single day you're gonna be that late
you deserve it
(hmm)
wait wait wait wait
ran out of the school
(mm)
(mm)
I like those type of people
and then you walked back
why
(mm)
I've never <malay>kena</malay> detention
nice
ya just one detention is nothing [lah]
there was I think you you you know this story
I
I mean almost <malay>kena</malay> detention I think once
cause I was late right
(um) but my
my favourite teacher saved me
he stand so the discipline master stand here so all the latecomers right
so (um) my teacher came then pretend to talk to her then when she turn around
then he look at me then he point run run back to class because my class first floor [what]
then
the other students is just like
confused
no only me ya
(uh) then he said run run to class like he pointed to our class
so
<malay>macam</malay> so he he walked in front of the discipline master and talk so she won't turn around right
no [lah] cause I'm a good kid of course she wouldn't know me
(hmm)
my class is not but I am so
I've never made any teacher cry okay
it's not me
three
and my primary school I was in a class that made a teacher cry also
I think my class all very
!huh!
yeah
my primary school
my my primary school one time only [ah]
that teacher I think maybe she having a bad day or she's like damn tired already
she's probably just damn tired sick of our attitude
it's not attitude it's just (um)
you know [lah] primary school right like to talk talk talk talk talk talk a lot
yeah
who say
then
<malay>abeh kenapa dia nangis</malay>
[oh] I told you #Humaira# <malay>punya</malay> story
you can ask her later personally
you you have to have a strong mental strength you have to have mental strength [lah]
period
I would rather I would rather teach like secondary school
can just off is it

so basically (um)
the whole thing was just about meeting this guy guy and (err) so (err)
the whole premise is
he just needs to be very upfront and truthful about who he is and what he does and everything [lah] about his life so
true enough [lah] he is a very (uh) forthcoming and upfront person so that
is already an (uh) up point for him [lah] you know in in in trying to understand this whole situation that is how they want to proceed
so
number one (err) it was very easy and simple for me to just ask about his name and full name it wasn't very <malay>macam</malay> like (uh) <malay>abang</malay> why you asking for my name no [ah] upfront telling and then even talking about his job he just explain that he used to he is in the police force and then he used to work in (err)
#changi# airport
(um)
and that #changi# airport is what we thought it was [lah] to actually look out for suspicious characters and all that
ya
that's why [lah] but of course there's that connotation [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> it's not it's not really
that's why she's so she's so secretive she's so like unsure she's so she she probably receive it but don't know how to express it that's the problem and this is something she has to grow from it [lah]
that's why she gets a earful from me about it and then (um) so now he is (uh) working at (uh) #novena# and he is there because (uh) he wants to do office work and rightfully so [lah] because he wants to (uh) spend more time [lah] with your family
(uh) and
since he has going to move towards
getting married (uh) he thought this the right step [ah] as opposed to shift work
which makes sense and it's it's very sound [lah] in why he's doing it okay then he talk about (um)
okay they know each other for two years
two year they know each other for two years
know of each other for two years only got serious for one year
ya so that is the whole thing okay [ah] this one [ah] [oh] every time I do as in [ah] like
was it so difficult to [ah] get this out
so [ah] <malay>dia suka dia suka</malay> in the couch we are all sitting at the couch I was sitting at this side of the couch
he was sitting here <malay>abah</malay> was sitting at a chair that I brought for him I got #zina# to sit right beside me
the mirror the mirror side
[ah] middle side ya facing the living room ya it's in the
so [ah] what else (um) okay so I I
[ah] that one I didn't get to ask but that one is <malay>tak tak important [lah] ya
so the other [ah] important part was about his job experience [lah] so he did confirm his five years then I ask him can you explain to me what how did he get to five years then he explain [lah] actually he was doing national service but he was waiting for he <malay>apa</malay> the the sign on agreement and it it it only came after and also that's how he got disrupted he had to go through the whole process at police again
[ah] okay that makes sense then that makes sense with the timeline and he say he just finished his fifth year of of his bond this year
[ah] that one that one also he shared with me about the retention bonus and all that
[ah]
clear I ask him okay you know do you have contact (uh) do you have connect plan that's he look at me like (uh) what was that then I say like do you get certain bonuses for like certain number of years [oh] we call those retention bonus and he mentioned another bonus
so and and then he said [lah] ya [ah] six years seven years and then after that fifteen years and [ah] okay
<malay>apa yang susah sangat</malay>
that's why exactly that's why I say
this boy being very upfront helps the situation so that's why me and <malay>abah</malay> were very calm about it <malay>tak ada macam</malay> problematic so I spoke to them about the video thing I spoke to them that [eh]
[ah] so he told they he explain they both okay the reason why they rush for it was [ah] number one [ah] <malay>apa</malay> there was this timeline that they wanted to apply because if they don't apply they wouldn't get it at the place that they are looking for which is near their near his parents' place and then <malay>dia tinggal</malay> #pasir ris#
so at the end they they actually end up they they have to look for something that is resale [lah] because they want to look for some a place near (err) <malay>istighfar</malay>
because <malay>dekat</malay> (um) the parents place #pasir ris#
ya [lah] but I don't know why they want that place [lah] anyway so
I told them okay this could have been done better this could have been managed better don't you think that you would have this is my advice and this is what I
this is this could have been <malay>boleh fikirkan cara yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] [kan] which is to
<malay>bilang</malay> [kan] that you want to (um) do this to both your parents and #zina's# parents inform before you go on to doing that because what if you get that (err) the keys you know then what you have to actually this part <malay>abah</malay> was the one who [ah] already point out I just reiterated the point
<malay>nanti</malay> [kan] <malay>macam terdesak</malay> [kan] you have to like actually have to push for this [ah] then you are making it difficult for both sides
[ah] then he just he just nodded [lah] he he understood (uh) but I was still <malay>macam</malay> thinking [eh] do you are you apologetic or not about your your mistake here [ah] but I think it's in between [lah] it's in between that apologetic but also <malay>macam</malay> like okay
[ah] he did he think that because he his mindset is if let's say he gets it and this couldn't be done he can just cancel
so his from his stand is like no harm no foul can cancel [what] <malay>begitu</malay> I say it's not about that [lah] it's about you informing do it properly
correct ya
so (um) ya so that that part they understood [lah] you know what it's it's spilt milk ready [lah] [kan] like there's no point to talk about it it's not something they can change in the future the only thing that they can change right now like I said to them is
from now on you both need to be very upfront
inform both sides on what you want to do so that both sides are better equipped
[ah] then I then I also talk to them [lah] like okay want then I want to hear what is his plan <malay>abah</malay> also want to hear what is his <malay>apa dia punya rancangan</malay> [lah]
(um) then it was very clear <malay>rancangan</malay> is that
the next year somewhere <malay>dalam</malay> march they intend to <malay>tunang dengan zina</malay>
and then
that's why [lah]
that's why that's why I say I just want to hear him talk #zina# whenever #zina# butts in I was like I just wanna hear you talk and then (err)
the guy was saying ya so there's that and then probably meeting up the parents that means his parents to come and meet <malay>abah</malay> probably in december so that they give them some at least a few months before the engagement [lah]
the <malay>nikah</malay> would be in twenty twenty two end of twenty twenty two
at least <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] revise plan [ah] [ah] correct
[ah] I also don't want to embarrass [lah] #zina# cause like I said it could have been easily a bashing #zina# session but no point [lah] the point is to hear what he want what he's saying and whether it makes sense and whether this is the correct plan to go ahead with
[ah] then okay then at least say that gives proper time [lah] for you to both look at how you gonna plan this then I say then the <malay>abah</malay> was saying you know #zina# just got
(err) just finish studying <malay>jadi apa</malay> the plan in these two years for for her (uh) then this #azram# <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] ya (uh) this is to would be
for #zina# to actually [ah] secure a job
ya because he and then he explained it before before I even need to talk about <malay>macam</malay> like the financial burden because he said ya definitely it's not enough just for me #zina# also needs to work to build up a
that's why
so it's like okay at least he knows [lah] that's why that's why I say it's very it's very easy
that's why it's very easy because he seems to know the have a plan and he seems to okay so that's why <malay>macam</malay> it was a easy session because he was very clear and very direct and it was simple <malay>tak payah tak ada</malay> complication
so then okay good so you know that ya you both need to be working [lah] and you #zena# needs to build her and then I spoke to him also saying that you have work for five years you know right there is value in having a work experience #zena# hasn't gotten that yet so she needs to at least have one year of proper work experience
then they said ya the plan is for #zina# to
work so that she build her and then they also talk about children [ah] then say then their plan is after getting married they don't want to have children for at least two to three years
to build themselves up first then after that they can decide on settling down with children okay good that that that is a solid plan
[ah] that one okay [lah] they bring about the halal thing [lah] so I was saying that yes I understand where you coming from but look at the the situation right now
ya #zina# needs to do some growing and then like I said and you both need to
and I and I <malay>pun cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] that
you
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
grow up
<malay>dia zina pun nak kena</malay> grow up
<malay>asing asing asing masing-masing kena</malay> grow up <malay>tersendiri</malay>
<malay>lepas itu</malay>
grew up together
[ah] so you need give that time <malay>untuk</malay> you both <malay>nak kena</malay> grow up [ah] that's the thing <malay>budak itu diam</malay> [jer] so I <malay>tak puas hati</malay> because like you can just be numb about this whole thing [lah] that is a which is (uh) quite good as you're gonna either you don't absorb or you not receiving or you rejecting so many things that can happen right just because you're keeping quiet so after that <malay>abah</malay> is there something you want to (uh) anything you want to ask them (uh) I said ya so [ah] let me check in (um) so
#ashraf# you've heard from my advice that I gave just now and you heard about all the other advice at my dad has gave also
so one thing that I brought out is you both <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>tersendiri</malay> grow
and then
[ah] come together to grow
so what is your take on that do you agree do you disagree or what is your perception
[ah] then they say
okay for me I (uh) I feel that
<malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>nak kena apa ada</malay> this (uh)
grow up right <malay>memang nak kena ada</malay> grow up <malay>tapi</malay> (uh) growing up needs to needs <malay>perlu berada dalam</malay>
[ah] context <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dari sendiri sebelum kahwin dan selepas kahwin</malay>
<malay>maksud dia</malay> has to grow up both growing up can take place both as a single and as a married couple
so it's like if he [lah] in the sense that [ah] so so I said okay I think you both
not just growing up
a bit a bit like that but also but also he's trying that (uh) growing up takes place both [lah] during single and when you get married so I said then okay then the next thing is for you guys to set out a plan on how you gonna go about this [ah] so I made it very clear that don't just lip service <malay>dia perlu perbincangan</malay> further you guys need to communicate I told them you guys need to communicate this further need to talk about how you gonna plan this out and then when I say communicate <malay>abah dengar ini tak mahu</malay> communicate communicate like <malay>tak boleh nak jumpa jumpa</malay> <malay>abah</malay> there's nothing wrong with communicate I said so (um) I think they got it [lah] so now it's about them solidifying this by putting out a plan
then after the whole session also I told #zina# and even just now I texted saying that
<malay>kau orang nak kena</malay> sit down <malay>nak kena</malay> plan out how to grow individually and then after that plan out how to grow together then this will work if you just gonna say [ah] ya [lah] grow grow grow but you just gonna
<malay>tak</malay> work on it you just gonna <malay>macam letak kat tepi</malay> [jer] and just <malay>macam</malay> put it into the back of your mind <malay>tak nak macam</malay>
<malay>apa buat kerja</malay> develop this it's not gonna work
so
of course [lah]
of course I'm not <malay>macam</malay> blind to this [ah]
(mmhmm)
because at the end <malay>itu</malay> mama <malay>dekat</malay> kitchen and (mm) mama <malay>malu malu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti bila kita duduk makan baru</malay> mama <malay>duduk</malay>
anyway I
<malay>dayah tak ada dayah</malay> said she doesn't want to be there also [lah]
so (mm) ya then I told him okay #ashraf# after all that's been said [ah] I will let you know that I do appreciate that you come here up here it tells a lot okay being upfront
with us counts for a lot
okay that's why for now okay moving forward you guys both need to be very upfront about what you want to proceed with so that clear for both parties and it makes the whole process a lot easier
ya [lah] I said you have
I didn't say <malay>sembunyi-sembunyi</malay> [lah] I say you have to be upfront you cannot you cannot you know be quiet about things you have to inform
(mm)
then
(um) so basically that's it [lah] and then
at least it's it's clear [lah] that they have
at least he has his plan but
I observe from the
body gesture and how he interact with #zina# he is very firm he's just firm [lah] it's that not say very firm [lah] but it's firm <malay>macam</malay> whatever <malay>zina macam nak nak tanya</malay> [ah] #ashraf# right do you want water then he will just say
no he will just use
very <malay>macam</malay> he won't just he won't say [oh] it's okay #zina# he he won't
(mm) like
so I can see [ah] and the way he speaks also is <malay>macam</malay> very direct and very
(mm) ya can see he will be the one leading the the marriage [lah]
ya
so
ya
ya so it's not <malay>macam</malay> so as as ambiguous as it was [lah] at least it's kind of <malay>macam</malay> very clear at least they have a plan at least they are aware that they need to [ah] give #zina# time to work [ah] give #zina# time to develop
<malay>kita tak tanya pasal dia punya</malay> family ya I did so his father is is working as a relief taxi driver mum is not working
sister is working as a librarian but at #changi#
#changi# business <malay>apa</malay> #changi# [ah] ya that one ya that one warehouse [lah] ya so
ya so it's was very easy [lah] then after when he left also I was telling [lah] see how easy and simple #ashraf#
was
by just being upfront
<malay>dia macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> I I don't know that
no #zina# you have to learn you have to be proactive okay you will have to be proactive
be upfront and be proactive you cannot everything you don't know I think cannot
you want to be married you have to be proactive
so <malay>jadi macam</malay>
ya [lah] so basically that that kind of like eases up the conversation and we adjourn to the dining to eat
then <malay>abah abah</malay> is the kind where if he's
interested in someone he will have lengthy conversations and then after that <malay>abah</malay> like talk about so many things from people to world views to politics
ya no can see that okay <malay>abah</malay> is comfortable with him already
ya so
like my [ah] that's why it was very simple [lah] because
at first this guy already you can see right has at least some work experience and some knowledge about how you know a bit about adult working life at least that [lah] [kan]
so and he also can recognize [lah] the value in it and can recognise why you know #zina# needs to have that
and ya that's why he also decide that #zina# needs to work
ya but the arrangement is where do you get married and they settled down to have children two to three years time #zina# would be the one taking care of it
#ashraf# [ah] because (uh)
someone needs to be there at home [lah] he he's not gonna depend on like
his parents or #zina's# parents to take care of the child you know someone needs to work he will be working [lah] and then I then I ask him so (uh) are you exploring the possibility of #zina# working part time then he say ya if she can work from home then that's fine
okay okay then to me
[ah] that's something that they will have to <malay>macam</malay> resolve [lah] how but at the very least they are giving #zina# time to grow
(um)
okay [lor] then after then the
in the dining
(uh)
ya so that's why it was very it was a lot easier to to actually address all these things because
clear [lah] clear and upfront
and then ya like I said I got the full name got the wage it's been [ah] <malay>apa</malay> been attached to for the three months
[ah] it was okay normal not not that <malay>macam</malay> overly zealous also like
ya he was also upfront say that [ah] the past (uh) he has yet to have the chance to go for <malay>jumaat</malay> players
ever since COVID like <malay>macam</malay> basically he's just trying to share [lah] like you know it this is the situation for him also cause we were talking about this
the the we were talking about it wasn't like <malay>macam</malay> he just brought up we were talking about <malay>jumaat</malay> prayers and then we were sharing
different different things
so ya to me it's it's it's simple
ya <malay>tak payah macam pening-pening sangat</malay>
[ah] actually after that was a lot more interest <malay>lepas itu lagi</malay> interesting
for example
(um)
was <malay>abah sudah sekarang tengah fikir</malay> [ah] <malay>ini sekarang nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah</malay>
<malay>ashraf sudah balik semua sudah balik</malay> [ah] [ah] <malay>lepas itu abah cakap nak cakap pasal hidayah pula hidayah asyik</malay>
<malay>tolak tolak tolak semua budak ini yang terkena</malay> [kan] then I said <malay>abah</malay>
<malay>abah nak kena tengok</malay> [eh]
#hidayah# okay you you got two different daughters <malay>abah cakap apa</malay> different both are daughter yes both are your daughters <malay>tapi</malay> there are two different girls two different daughters
okay
#zina# is on the receiving end she is <malay>zina sudah memang nak menerima</malay>
<malay>apa berkahwin hidayah</malay> I don't think she is there yet <malay>dayah belum lagi ke tahap itu</malay>
<malay>pasal apa</malay>
then <malay>zina pun</malay> add in [ah] ya but she says she wants to get married ya <malay>memang dia nak tapi</malay> is she proactive looking no [what] she is not if she proactive looking she would have brought up some suitors (uh)
no she is not proactively looking she is just if it comes it comes she's not proactively looking for it
!huh!
then (uh) then I said so <malay>abah</malay> you need to understand <malay>yang ini dua anak perempuan berlainan</malay>
#zina# is receiving #dayah# is not there yet
so <malay>abah kena</malay> recognize that and #dayah# is happy at where she is right now in her life okay and then I say <malay>abah macam habis kita</malay> then I say okay yes I know I I <malay>faham abah tengah risau habis macam mana</malay> now <malay>bila habis sampai bila abah kata</malay>
then <malay>abah</malay> let me give you some advice
if you <malay>nak di</malay> to even
<malay>dijalankan</malay>
<malay>abah (err) mama <malay>bila nak</malay>
<malay>calonkan</malay> or <malay>menunjukkan calon</malay>
<malay>biar</malay> quality
<malay>biar berkualiti orang orang yang abah dan mama tunjukkan semua tak ada</malay> quality <malay>dayah sendiri sudah pergi selidik</malay> of course <malay>sudah sekali dua kali sudah kena mesti dia sudah macam</malay> give up <malay>dengan mama abah punya ini pasal mama abah</malay> just throw [jer] ya then mama say <malay>tapi</malay> the one <malay>yang dekat</malay> australia <malay>itu abah mama tahu tak</malay> he is just a taxi driver then #dayah# will think <malay>macam macam bingit</malay> [lah]
like she has to be the one working and then this guy is not working [ah] [ah]
then is mama say ya but this guy anytime he he he's well educated anytime he can
because he actually (err) <malay>apa</malay> he has worked for many years and he doesn't want to work anymore so he with all the wealth he accumulated he bought a house and he started to <malay>sewakan rumah ini</malay> so his earnings from the rental ya but the point is
#dayah# at is at this stage of her life
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang aku cakap</malay>
that's why I say <malay>cari orang berkualiti berkualiti</malay> is not just about
(mm)
(mm) so we don't know that [lah] !huh!
ya so anyway <malay>jadi macam</malay>
<malay>abah</malay> understood that [lah] I said <malay>abah tak boleh</malay> control <malay>apa dayah nak ini</malay>
<malay>abah boleh</malay> control <malay>kalau abah nak sangat carikan calon abah boleh</malay> control <malay>itu itu yang abah boleh</malay> control
so I said right now it seem that <malay>dayah memang belum lagi bersedia kalau abah nak carikan</malay> fine <malay>tapi cari berkualiti</malay> this if people are not are <malay>ada</malay> quality and I said <malay>pada abah</malay> it's not about social status it's not about <malay>macam kaya tak kaya</malay> ya it's about the <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match [ah]
basically this this guy ya
<malay>jadi budak ini dengan dayah</malay> are two different people so cannot
that's why
so [oh] anyway going back to #zina# I I told #zina# like
you need to sit down and you really need to (uh)
figure out the plan on how you gonna
<malay>buat apa memperbaiki diri sendiri</malay>
then <malay>membina diri sendiri</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas itu baru boleh fikir macam mana nak bina</malay>
<malay>bersama</malay>
<malay>jangan cakap saja</malay>
plan it out
<malay>tak boleh zina cakap</malay> [ah] ya ya okay I will look at it [lah] <malay>abang</malay> ya
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>cakap abang</malay> [lah] okay
fair enough [lah] if he (uh) considered (um)
cause he then I say (uh) I
he ya of course then he cause he come down like first he I said [oh] I got to know I started off the conversation with him I got to know (uh) <malay>semalam</malay> that (err) you you are #ashraf# then I was thinking okay how is it <malay>macam mana dia akan menerima ini</malay> [ah] <malay>cara</malay> [eh]
<malay>zina selama ini tak kenalkan aku</malay> like
<malay>nama pun tak tahu semalam baru dapat tahu nama</malay> I don't know [lah] but then <malay>lepas itu dia tanya</malay> (err) <malay>abang</malay> your name is #salim# is it [ah] yes
ya he was very comfortable and just calling me <malay>abang</malay> [ah] like if <malay>macam dia</malay> #satay# <malay>ada banyak</malay> ya then <malay>abang</malay> also can bring back the
so I thought (err) ya that's why it was easy [lah] <malay>macam abang pun cakap</malay> and because like I said
I told #ashraf# that I'm appreciative <malay>yang dia terus terang dia</malay>
<malay>ada apa ada wawasan</malay> [lah] [ah]
<malay>lepas itu abang pun cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>yang kalau ashraf datang habis tak tak apa tak</malay> clear [ah] <malay>habis suka nak kelentong-kelentong ini</malay>
(uh)
<malay>encik pun tak nak tak nak cakap cakap dengan ashraf ini</malay> [ah]
okay [lah] I thought <malay>macam</malay> the
<malay>macam mana</malay> it went through was good [lah] ya
[ah] #azlina# #azlina# need to <malay>macam</malay> grow up [lah] on this
I I address to her you see how simple it was you need to learn to be proactive like how #ashraf# is
because I I'm trying to point to our since you admire so much this person and you're <malay>macam</malay> like then at least pick up the good attributes that he has [lah] correct or not if you cannot pick it up from me then pick it up from someone else whatever just pick it up I said I said just pick it up what #ashraf# has did did you see or not how #ashraf# did it
I told her [lah] did you see or not what #ashraf# did
so simple right he just be straightforward be upfront <malay>tak ada nak sembunyi-sembunyi</malay>
[kan] daddy <malay>cerita senang</malay> then I say isn't it simple so that <malay>macam orang tak curiga orang tak terfikir-fikir orang tak keliru</malay>
[ah] you just have to be upfront [jer] [kan] <malay>senang</malay> and ya [lah] ya ya you need to wake up okay you need to wake up and see how to address this
ya
that's why [lah] she just
that's the thing
so she sees it as [oh]
that's me I'm easy-going
I I told her off about that
#zina# that is not easy-going
(mm)
<malay>aku cakap dengan dia yang</malay> easy-going <malay>dengan</malay> being firm
is not against each other you know
easy-going it is
when you are very upfront able to share easy-going you don't have to hide that is also easy-going [what]
you are not (um) having a hidden agenda you're not trying to mask certain things you're easy going you're an open book that's easy-going also
(mm)
that's why during the
during the discussion <malay>dengan ashraf</malay> I was saying #zina#
didn't have any plan you know what to do with her life I have been the one to guide her in what to study (mm) [ah] <malay>ashraf dengar</malay> [jer] [lah] what he want to say he just (mm) (mm)
that's why #ashraf#
if
(mm) but whatever it is he is already <malay>macam</malay> he never <malay>macam</malay> like show the reaction of <malay>macam</malay> you know or he didn't show it [lah] of being <malay>tak nak tak nak apa</malay> [oh] like shock or what I think he knows [ah] what he's getting into with #zina#
the way
ya [lah] of course
still a lot ya
of course
ya [lah] I agree of course that's why I said they both <malay>tersendiri nak kena</malay> grow and learn on what they need to grow about and then grow together only after the growing indeed <malay>tersendiri</malay>
ya of course we are we are happy that this at least he is competent [lah]
<malay>dia</malay>
I don't think he would [lah] if he does that he knows that he's just souring the relationship with me
if if <malay>kalau izat buat gitu</malay> then I will tell him off [lah] [eh] <malay>kau kenal dia ke tak</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kita tak buat ini kita tak tahu apa</malay> so we have to be we have to take this step <malay>kita kena (uh) <malay>apa kita mesti</malay>
(err)
<malay>ambil</malay> (uh)
<malay>kegiatan begini</malay> [ah] <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak boleh macam apa ambil</malay> scenario [jer]
push #zina# right
pull
pull
ya
consume
I <malay>faham</malay>
step up
no [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh terus macam lepaskan tangan</malay> no
(mm)
so ya basically concludes the whole thing [lah] with
#zina# and #ashraf# then
I was two zero <malay>abah</malay> open this topic about #dayah# then I was asking #zina# #zina# what have you been talking to #dayah# [lah] about #dayah's# like (err) relationship or [a'ah] <malay>zina cakap</malay> no we don't talk each other !huh!
say what do you mean don't talk each other then we to talk about personal things
that's it sit down here tell me what's the problem
she say ya #dayah# and me then ya I understand that you and #dayah# are two different people you have two different beliefs
but
at the very least you should find a common ground that you are both sisters and you are there for each other
then I say ya I know she has all this never like me you know
so you know now this is a problem right so what are you going to do about it
ya she also okay don't talk about her talk about you what are you going to do about it
ya I tried already I see I try already then she doesn't want to try
okay
what you are telling me is the same as what #hidayah# is telling me
okay so I'm going to take it as
you know positively
both of you have tried
<malay>sekarang dua-dua sudah</malay> try [kan]
<malay>dua-dua sudah</malay> try
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so you tell me <malay>apa nak kena buat sekarang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>nak buat apa sekarang</malay> then <malay>dia sudah</malay> [ah] ya try again [lah] try no
<malay>sudah</malay> try <malay>sudah sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>tak boleh</malay> [kan] so nak <malay>kena buat apa</malay>
do what you want me to tell you the answer <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] I have to give you the answer
!huh!
why you must have the <malay>jawapan</malay> for me
I want to hear from your own <malay>mulut</malay>
<malay>macam mana</malay>
and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> ya then <malay>kita nak kena</malay> ask someone to help [ah] then <malay>siapa</malay> this someone to help
you [lah] [ah] then
<malay>kenapa</malay> it has to be me to ask you to
get help from me why both of you cannot be proactively coming to me is it
you know <malay>abang salim kita ada</malay> problem
okay just kind of <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
see things eye to eye <malay>tak boleh macam bersefahaman</malay>
and we just cannot talk about personal things let's say ya do you know why <malay>zina kalau</malay> if this were the reverse that let's say you and #zina# you and #dayah#
I had the same kind of argument with me and #izat# I bet you [ah] you and #dayah# would not be talking to each other now
because the severity of it is so bad that you guys can't even talk about personal things
at least [ah] you see [ah] it me and #izat#
<malay>macam mana pun</malay> that has happen [ah] #izat# would still come and apologize to me
I'm doubting you know whether you and #dayah# would apologise to each other
then you did #zina# was saying <malay>macam</malay> like ya but you guys don't talk about personal no I talk about personal things to #izat#
<malay>macam</malay> like life [lah] about children about
<malay>apa</malay> marriage like that that
ya ya
[lah] <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like how how he (uh) <malay>apa</malay> decided to get married with with #salimah# then ya we have ya before even during during <malay>apa</malay>
during [ah] our <malay>apa</malay> being after being married also we still talk about <malay>macam</malay> certain thing we don't talk about jobs we are not <malay>macam</malay> pen pals is not like <malay>macam</malay> like the way I would talk to #faris# for example but
<malay>macam</malay> at least <malay>macam</malay> things things about personal things I still can talk to him <malay>macam</malay> I can easily talk to him <malay>macam</malay> [eh] #izat# <malay>kau tengok macam</malay> [ah] <malay>macam dayah</malay> is like I I can have the conversation with #izat# you know ya I can but <malay>macam</malay>
#dayah# and #zina# will not be able to talk about anything personal they will just talk about things that <malay>macam</malay>
that's why [lah] that's why it seems it's
ya [lah]
sure but okay maybe contextually is different but what I'm saying is you should be comfortable to be able to speak to each other
no we're not always at loggerheads this is just one episode all the while we have never been at loggerheads
when we were younger yes but when we were married this is the first of a long time
no [lah] not really enstranged like even after this one I I have <malay>macam</malay> move on and forgive him already like whatever he needs to work on it he knows that he needs to work on it it's it's a long working it's a long working process for him at the very least now he can learn to apologise <malay>dulu lagi tak boleh</malay> apologise <malay>pun dia punya</malay> ego is so big
what the
like have to see it as steps [lah]
so
that I mean like
I know that if I meet him the next time he will actually still come and say apologize to me just to <malay>macam</malay> make sure that we are in good terms because at least he wants to proactively want us to be in good terms #hidayah# and #zina# is different they are just happy with being ignored
<malay>dayah zina sudah</malay> give up with this thing where she would just be happy with ignoring #hidiyah#
that's how bad it is [ah] so at least me and <malay>izat kalau kita</malay> disagree but we will want to still talk about it we won't like ignore it like <malay>izat macam</malay> has a very strong point he will still want to talk about it like this thing that <malay>macam</malay> he feels very strongly that I'm going to be very aggressive he will still talk about it what he will not <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>tak nak berbual dengan si salim</malay> no he still at least wants to talk about it so at least that's healthy enough
how he approach it he needs to learn to work it out
how he <malay>macam</malay> best character he needs to learn to work it out
so okay [lah] I think
<malay>kita semua memang</malay> have your own areas of growth but
#dayah# and #zina# is like they just ignore the problem then I say #zina# especially now when you are about to get married what do you think would happen <malay>nanti bil zina sudah kahwin zina sudah pergi tinggal tempat lain lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi kau orang lagi</malay> will be more separated
I can tell that me and #izat# even though we are staying in two different place we still can engage in conversation
you and #dayah# ready have a problem <malay>bila kau orang tak sama rumah lagi</malay> what do you think
this passive aggressiveness <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay> [ah]
and not just <malay>macam</malay> like [ah] <malay>tak apa</malay> no it's not <malay>tak apa</malay>
(uh huh)
ya I I did I did <malay>macam</malay> tell her [lah] that at the end of the day we are all family and I also did tell her that (uh)
you <malay>nak kena</malay>
<malay>fikir</malay> how
this is important this <malay>memang mustahak</malay>
that family comes first
that you need to see that
you cannot just <malay>macam biarkan</malay> that this issue (err) to just continue as it is because it's not gonna be healthy
at the end you are both gonna suffer
so I told ya [lah] so I told her nevermind
the what I need from you is are you in agreement
<malay>bersetuju tak</malay>
<malay>nak abang salim tolong</malay>
[ah] first you have to you <malay>setuju</malay> if you <malay>setuju</malay>
you want me to help okay then that's enough for your side I will ask <malay>hidayah tanya hidayah kalau hidayah nak</malay> then
we will make it happen
<malay>jadi</malay> it's just that simple
both first of all the plan is get both of them to a room sit down talk about their trust issues that they have for each other the biggest problem <malay>masalah yang dia ada ini</malay> is trust issues #hidayah# doesn't trust her because #hidayah# feels that she is very incompetent still very childish and what what what what still haven't gone through life experience about what #zina# has trust issues because things #dayah# is no no it all dismiss I'm better than you [ah] so that's why [lah] trust issues you issue you don't trust each other's number one you don't trust each other in terms of feelings you don't trust each other about your thoughts [ah] so that is the the issue here then it will manifest to every other thing isn't it
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] it's just not healthy and you cannot just
<malay>biarkan macam gitu</malay> [jer]
yes so I
mama <malay>abah</malay> just listen so good thing was
mama <malay>abah</malay> willing to hear
and then
mama !wah! at one okay at one point
(mm) <malay>kenapa</malay>
(mm)
nevermind just (mm)
okay so anyway I'll just continue talking like (um) there was one point where (um)
#zina# was (uh) no I (uh) #zina# was saying that she was (um) the reason why <malay>apa</malay> she went on to telling #izat# first because she felt more comfortable talking to #izat#
then I said #zina# since when you are that close to #izat# then she said ya you don't know I'm that close to #izat# then I say rubbish [lah]
then she she <malay>sudah bingit</malay> [lah] <malay>bila kena</malay> rubbish then she walk off
I say since when I'm the one who hs been with you for all your stages
she she <malay>kena</malay> already [lah] then she walk off
so that's why I told her ya #zina# you are close to #izat# because of the boys ya I said that you're close to him because of the boys you did the boys are not there how will you be close to #izat#
#izat# is just a byproduct this relationship that you have I didn't meant to say the word byproduct [ah] but I say you are close to the boys just because of (uh)
(uh) you are close to #izat# just because the boys (uh) with #izat# you know
and because of the boys therefore you are close to #izat#
then I say since when you been talking to #izat# since when
all all the
then say ya of recent years it has been the case [ah] that's that's the part I said [ah] rubbish then stop it since when then she already <malay>sudah kena</malay> then she walk off to toilet
because like ya she had to hear it [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>mana !wah! you are the
you are that close to #izat# then I say which part
primary school secondary school tertiary
where where did it come from just got recent just because of this topic when and then just because of the boys [kan]
further studies
[ah] then I then I also
so going back to <malay>yang tadi</malay> [kan] we were talking about #zina# and #dayah# and I was asking #zina# who do you think you
need this person the person [ah] to help you guys bridge it
then she said me then I said ya then you think what #izat# can do this job [ah]
[ah] then #izat# do you think then she's like smile [ah] !aiya! [lah] cannot [lah]
then I say you know right that this is not his strength
you know right this is one thing that I know you know that I can help right
(mm) that's why
<malay>jadi sebab dia kena tengok</malay> and understand that this is the situation
(hmm)
<malay>jadi macam bila dayah</malay>
and #zina# sit down together then they can iron this out [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
you both are not proactive in the sense that you both didn't come up and ask why is it that I have to ask you whether you want this help or not really backward [one] really weird
so
they are basically complacent because right now they are in the same house they think right they have enough interaction with each other but it's not about the
frequency it's about the quality
they just don't see the point in <malay>macam</malay> making sure that they are
you know comfortable
ya of course
true [lah] <malay>dia tak boleh macam</malay> just simply you know say that [oh] this is a one time deal <malay>mesti</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ingat</malay>
ya so obviously it takes steps [lah] it's not <malay>macam</malay> I one time can <malay>boleh boleh</malay>
<malay>apa terus langsung</malay>

<malay>akak kakak</malay> last <malay>kerja kat mana</malay>
<malay>kakak kerja apa kat situ</malay>
<malay>penat tak kerja situ</malay>
okay <malay>kak</malay> okay <malay>kalau kalau kerja kat situ</malay> [kan] <malay>apa yang akak pelajari</malay>
<malay>ada ada apa kak kerja kak ada pekerja yang susahkan benda tak</malay>
<malay>sambil kakak kerja kat kilang itu kakak ada pernah buat kesilapan apa-apa tak</malay>
<malay>jadi kiranya kakak telah belajar</malay> [lah] <malay>daripada</malay> incident <malay>tu</malay>
okay <malay>kakak sekarang mempunyai</malay> (um) experience experience <malay>di dalam bahagian industri</malay> baking (um) <malay>kalau kakak diberi pilihan untuk mencuba</malay> industry <malay>yang lain industri apakah yang kakak mahu cuba</malay>
<malay>apakah yang menginspirasikan kakak untuk mencuba mengajar</malay> (uh) <malay>kanak-kanak yang kecil</malay>
<malay>kira kakak tahu</malay> [kan] <malay>yang kanak-kanak kecil ni kadang-kadang mereka akan menjadi susah untuk dijaga mereka mungkin nangis merajuk bergaduh jadi kakak rasa kakak</malay> have the skills <malay>untuk</malay> cope with this problem
<malay>dengan adanya</malay> technologies <malay>sebagai telefon bimbit dan</malay> tablet <malay>adakah kakak rasa yang teknologi ni baik ataupun tidak baik bagi kanak-kanak muda</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak bila kita kecil dulu bila kita</malay> around ten years old <malay>ke</malay> eight years old <malay>gitu bila tak ada komputer semua</malay> or <malay>bila takde</malay> handphone <malay>kakak ingat tak apa kita buat dulu bila kita</malay> time <malay>kecil</malay>
<malay>kakak ingat tak dulu beza</malay> [eh] <malay>sebab dulu kita takde</malay> netflix <malay>takde</malay> youtube <malay>kita cuma tengok</malay> live and live <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> if you want to go to the toilet <malay>nak kena tunggu</malay> advertisement
then remember last time you have to <malay>apa nak kena</malay> rush the toilet <malay>kalau nak kencing ke apa ingat</malay>
<malay>sekarang senang</malay> [jer] now if you want to go toilet or what you can just pause like sometimes if like I think about it [kan] like how did we survive last time like <malay>kalau</malay> you've to watch any shows you only have we have to look at what's on the schedule we cannot watch anything we want at anytime and then also last time there's a lot of advertisement like even now
like if you think about it nowadays we have a thirty seconds youtube advertisement right like you think it's a bit <malay>susah tapi</malay> like back then advertisement on is like two minutes three minutes and like it's a lot so like it's crazy how times have changed right
I mean do you remember back then that we have to share a computer
like there's only one computer in the house then <malay>kalau</malay> if the if I want to play then he have to wait for me and then like now all of us have our phones and we can just watch our show anytime you want you can play the game on our phone anytime you want correct yes
so I mean it's I mean in a way it's a good way because we we get to experience it but I believe that like my generation we get to experience both sides like we were there when technology started to become mainstream but then at the same time we also kind of grow up
in a time where technology wasn't like the biggest part in our life like I still remember having to use the in a in the diary thing
like back then like the player is a very common thing and like there's no netflix and sometimes we don't have all the all the movies in the world so just keep watching the same shows over and over again like tom and jerry mister bean that kind of shows
and while I can't deny that nowadays things are better things are easier it's more convenient you just feel like
we will miss those days [ah] like those are good days honestly I mean like
looking back if you were to be sent back to the to the time back then we probably won't won't like it but it you know it kinda shapes us to the person that we are today and (err) the new kids the younger kids they'll never be able to experience that and I think like in a way that
it's a memory you know you you can't deny it no matter how difficult it was
so <malay>kakak</malay> remember the first phone that you got do you remember about it
so given that nowadays phones they (uh) they can be quite costly do you think that it is worth to buy like the the latest and greatest phones or is it okay to just buy a second hand phone or old phone that came out like last year or two years ago what do you think
so like if you were to buy a new phone right what are some of the things about the phone that you will look for like what are the important factors in choosing a phone for you
honestly for me [ah] I think one of the important factors if you want to buy a new phone is the battery because the phone can have the best cameras the best screen can be so fast but what is the point of having a phone if your phone's gonna die
what's the point of having a phone but everywhere you go you always have a portable charger with you with a cable like I'm pretty sure we all want to feel the one like our phone really make us feel locked down on something like the last thing we want is
to be is to feel like even more locked down by having to have a portable charger am I right
I mean like I think one of the worst case is like let's say you're on holiday and when you're on holiday you want to enjoy the moment right you want to like be able to not worry about stuff because that's the point of holidays just to relax but like
the last thing you want is to have to worry about [oh] no my phone's gonna die especially if you are like for example in singapore if your phone dies like at least you can
you know your way around like you can just go to and all that but let's say you are overseas like in malaysia then your phone die like I'm pretty sure it will be quite hard right to travel
just going back a bit talking about #johor# do you remember going to #johor#
just I think it's a terrace
ya then but
well I mean I definitely miss the old house the old old #johor# house but there are the termites problem was really I mean to be fair it's not really our main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's why there are termites come and it's honestly quite sad ya
then again that's what happen when you choose wood as your staircase cause that you know termites love the food
despite the termites I still feel like if I was given a choice I'll gladly stay in our old #johor# house it's like
it's bigger
it's just better and also like compared to when we were younger like the neighbourhood change a lot like now there's a there's a gas station there's a starbucks so like it's very different compared to how it was when we were young
I mean it's also sad because in a way like it's different things have changed but and that's how it works
so you remember where was your best place in malaysia that you like to go for holiday
ya without a doubt malaysia food is good way <malay>macam</malay>
and there's someone who live in woodlands right like going to is one of a selling point and now that we can't go to
yes it kind of sad
(mmhmm) now the closest to #johor# we can ever go to is the woodlands waterfront there and just sit down there [ah]
ya remember the first time you go to waterfront woodlands waterfront I think so
do you remember what's there and what you did
the high elements
so do you have much experience with high element obstacle courses
so other than rock climbing at (uh) #pulau ubin# what are the interesting thing interesting thing that you did during your school secondary school time
so like once you graduate from secondary school right like what are some of the major differences that you notice moving from secondary school to
so like what is like the highlight to you like what was like some of the best things you did or made or bake
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
so (um) what's the name of your lecturer who is like you know or your chef
so what do you think of him do you think he's a good chef or a good lecturer
so what are some of the thing that you wish you could have had learned that you did not
or is it anything that you wish you could have done but because of COVID you couldn't do
ya like maybe there was something that you're supposed to be able to do but because of COVID you can't do it
what are some of the thing some of the good things that that you want to continue like even after COVID nineteen is no longer a concern like some good measures or something like that
(mmhmm)
honestly I mean the hotel was it was it was not so expensive but for the price I think it was a very good deal
location wise and the hotel was very perfect like it was very near to #bugis# like literally a five minute walk to #bugis# if you look downstairs there's a vending machine that sells all kind of things and then literally two minutes away from it is a burger king
and like honestly like the price was given the location all that it was cheap the room was okay the toilet was big the bed the bed could be better honestly but at that price I wouldn't complain
and the thing is I feel like the weak part of the hotel that was the because the was like old kind of like remember our old the the one at <malay>rumah lama</malay> that kind of like the controls are very different but what what was important at the end of the day I brought my four
and ya
and and most of the time we and most of the time we just order grab food
because there were a lot of options around the area like you can choose so many things
which is why I would recommend that hotel because it's it's a very good hotel and the thing is let's say
you want to go with a larger group of friends or with your family there's actually family rooms you know that can fit like five or six people
so definitely that that it was good ya it's definitely good
I mean honestly if you if I had a choice I wouldn't want to travel around singapore because it's expensive and I've seen a lot of it ya but given that I'm limited like I wouldn't mind doing it once like
honestly like as a as a ten year old cause I was I was in primary four that was definitely one of the highlights of my primary school like it's one of the most ambitious thing I'll say like I didn't expect to be performing at the esplanade at it was like a very very good experience very new experience and like
it was a twenty two song there were it was a twenty two set list so it was about two hours plus
I mean obviously there was a break and there was like there was like a break in between and I honestly I'm I've got a surprise that
I was able to go through that because who would have thought that a ten year old kid can like perform for like two hours
so ya I mean it was a good experience definitely I just wish that there were phones back then so that finding pictures on it will be easier
but they are I mean but I mean when I was young all of us have to wear make up
and I really hated it like we have to use the blusher and we've to use the lip gloss a little bit I mean I was a kid so you know
well other than that I remember going to last year and that was the first time I took a flight
honestly it was it was it was a very short flight it was about half an hour but given that was the first time I took a plane I was a bit scared
but ya but half an hour flew by very quickly and next you are already reached and ya and I mean from school life actually travel a few a few places like I've been to hong kong I've been to #bintan#
and honestly I feel like we going overseas with your school it's kinda good and bad like while the bad thing is like the teacher will let us just go anywhere in the shopping mall but then they will give us like just two hours or something so like you'll be in a rush
like you you wish you could just spend the entire day just like going shopping seeing the mall and all that
but I think because we were kids and the teacher like it was for our safety but I'm pretty sure if we're like in
applied poly or I pretty sure there'll be more freedom
right like the teacher will let us give us more time ya
but ya but it was definitely a good experience like my hong-kong trip I did not expect to go to hong-kong cause I remember it was within the first month and our teacher said [oh] we're going to hong-kong and I was like what
where was where where where where do you where do you like [ah] we're choosing to go to hong-kong [oh] why does it usually you overseas thingy
it was it was like a exchange programme it was for geography student
ya we go there
it was only for pure geog cause pure geog was a small class it was like
a class of twenty
pure geog there's way more topics it's more hard it's it's like science
ya I know it's like it's harder there's more topics so like there's more things you need to study
honestly at this point I can't remember much but if you were to give me a test paper I'm pretty sure all the memories will come because I got A one for geography for my O level and I love geography but right now if you ask me I probably can't remember
definitely you give me you give an O level paper I will I mean the memories will probably come in I mean it's like I don't really apply it on my daily use like of course the basic things I apply it you know
like monsoon rain sea breeze land breeze all that kind of stuff tourism infrastructure but

captain marvel I know that captain marvel is a lady [lah] but (uh) actually <malay>kalau</malay> you can make it into a man <malay>punya</malay> character <malay>pun bagus juga</malay>
so it's basically the strongest avengers in all the avengers even thanos <malay>pun kalah</malay> okay there's one more is I like to be the witch [ah] a witch
from also from avengers <malay>kenapa</malay>

even your body <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi macam</malay> bodybuilder have a small physique [lah] <malay>kirakan angan badan besar-besar sangat</malay>
not that good
meal [eh]
meal <malay>tu apa makan apa-apa</malay> [ah]
[oh] overseas okay I got one that I remember
[ah] until now I <malay>pernah makan</malay>
whale meat when I go to japan
<malay>itu</malay> that is very memorable <malay>apasal</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> whale meat <malay>yang paling mahal sekali</malay>
actually <malay>dia punya</malay> whale meat <malay>dia dia potong kecil-kecil tipis-tipis</malay> [jer] <malay>dia potong</malay>
<malay>lepas tu dia suruh kita makan dengan</malay> #ramen# #ramen#
<malay>dia punya</malay> japanese version <malay>punya</malay> #ramen# [lah] then <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>selepas tu</malay> first I thought <malay>macam dia punya</malay> <malay>dia punya</malay> portion <malay>dia</malay> is quite big [tau] <malay>besar tapi sikit sikit nah dia kasih</malay> too little
[oh] it's cooked it's cooked I know it's cooked cause (uh) it's not #sashimi# usually <malay>orang jepun kalau kasih</malay> #sashimi# <malay>dia akan letak dekat</malay> a different plate
but this one is cooked (uh) but not like deep fry <malay>punya</malay> cook [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I think steam or what [lah] cause
<malay>dia letak</malay> on top of the #ramen# itself so we must eat along on the #ramen# <malay>dengan dia punya</malay>
condiments [ah] basically <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> seaweed <malay>semua</malay> [lah]
ya that is actually it's not the nicest food that I've eaten but it is actually (um) the most unique [lah] <malay>paling</malay> unique <malay>sekali</malay> and <malay>dia punya</malay>
restaurant is actually located outside #meiji# shrine [ah] <malay>yang pasal halal</malay>
<malay>tak halal tu</malay> actually I got one guy friend who actually he checked the stall and one good thing about japanese <malay>punya</malay>
restaurant [kan] once they sell the seafood they won't sell anything else <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>babi</malay> or any (uh) meat stuff [lah] even <malay>ayam ke daging ke apa</malay> so once they sell <malay>barang</malay>
seafood is purely hundred percent just <malay>barang</malay> seafood [jer]
so that's the one advantage about people in japan
okay okay <malay>yang itu paling</malay> best okay <malay>yang dia punya</malay> whale <malay>bila makan</malay> it's [eh] <malay>dia punya potong</malay> slice very thin and small so when I I just cut bits by bits then every little bits
[lah] put inside my mouth it just melts <malay>dia kira macam makan</malay> butter <malay>gitu cuma rasa dia</malay> is <malay>bukan</malay> butter <malay>rasa dia</malay> is <malay>lemak tapi bukan lemak macam</malay>
<malay>kambing ke lemak</malay> [ah] no [tau] it's just <malay>lemak</malay>
but you just taste the sea water so <malay>kirakan</malay>
<malay>dia rasa betul-betul macam</malay>
<malay>lemak ikan</malay> and whale <malay>punya lemak</malay> is really one of a kind [ah] it's really !wah! if
the taste is really unique [lah]
<malay>kalau awak pernah makan</malay> <malay>macam</malay> sea urchin <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> I already eaten a sea urchin before also
and to me it's quite common but the whale meat the whale fats on meat <malay>itu itu yang</malay> very very very unique
<malay>yang orang tak pernah rasa</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak pasti isi</malay> or fats
but (uh) mostly it's I think fats [ah] cause <malay>kalau isi</malay> whale [kan] is a tough [kan]
so it won't melt in your mouth but mostly if it's the fats of the whale any fats <malay>yang kita makan masuk dalam mulut</malay> even fats <malay>kambing</malay>
<malay>ke lembu ke apa masuk dalam mulut mesti</malay> melts in the mouth
[ah] so that is the thing and <malay>lagipun dia punya</malay> I think <malay>dia potong tipis-tipis</malay> [lah] so I can't really
figure out whether it's the meat or the fats but highly likely it's the fats
the best [eh]
actually <malay>takde yang</malay> okay compare japan korea [lah] <malay>kita jangan cakap pasal</malay> thailand
thailand is <malay>dia punya makan</malay> just <malay>semuanya pedas-pedas</malay> [jer]
(uh) japan <malay>boleh tahan</malay> (uh) but japan <malay>punya makan</malay> is <malay>betul-betul</malay>
<malay>bukan tekak orang melayu</malay>
<malay>yang betul-betul tekak orang melayu</malay> is you know what (um) <malay>makanan</malay> korea
cause <malay>makanan</malay> korea even <malay>dia punya mee hitam tu yang</malay>
<malay>orang tengok tak sedap tapi orang cakap makan sedap yang mee hitam tu dia punya rasa</malay> exactly the same as <malay>kita punya mee rebus</malay>
yes #jajangmyeon# cause <malay>kita punya mee rebus semua</malay> the difference is #jajangmyeon# is <malay>macam dia macam basah-basah</malay>
<malay>dia tak ada kuah tapi kita mee rebus ada kuah tapi dia punya rasa</malay> exactly the same <malay>macam kita punya mee rebus punya kuah</malay> and of course <malay>kita punya mee rebus lagi sedap</malay> cause why <malay>kita punya mee rebus kita ada letak limau kasturi</malay>
and <malay>ada telur ada apa</malay> so <malay>dia orang punya</malay> is a mixture of japanese
<malay>punya</malay> taste bud <malay>dengan</malay> mix with into <malay>mee rebus punya rasa</malay> that's what I think
for korean dishes that is quite unique [lah] quite unique <malay>tapi yang</malay> I really like about korea is <malay>dia punya daging</malay> #bulgogi#
<malay>itu</malay> I can eat everyday I can eat breakfast lunch dinner <malay>dia punya daging</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>dia makan dengan nasi panas-panas</malay> enough <malay>ialah cukup</malay>
cause <malay>pasal pasal daging</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>macam makan daging dendeng tapi daging dendeng dia berminyak sangat tapi itu</malay> #bulgogi# <malay>tu</malay> you imagine <malay>macam daging dendeng cuma dah hancur-hancurkan</malay>
they shred into pieces and actually they cook in a hotplate !fuh! <malay>lepas tu makan dengan nasi</malay>
<malay>nasi biasa nasi panas-panas</malay> [eh] steam rice <malay>ke apa</malay>
<malay>sedap</malay> you can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner you can eat it everyday
you <malay>takkan rasa jelak</malay> I mean according to my taste [lah] cause I really like the <malay>daging</malay> #bulgogi#
to that extreme yes
yes I've tried #wagyu# beef <malay>yang halal punya</malay> actually we have
until <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) A three <malay>ke</malay> A two usually <malay>halal punya</malay> #wagyu# beef there's no A five <malay>yang tak halal punya iya yang</malay> A five cause (um)
<malay>yang halal punya</malay> is actually (err) it's only made in australia
<malay>yang</malay> the non-halal one is all made in originally from japan itself [lah] <malay>yang halal punya</malay> is only made in australia and australia usually their A is they can't reach the A five <malay>punya punya apa tu punya punya</malay> grading
[ah]
no the #wagyu# beef is actually made in japan
japan japan it's not korea
the the #wagyu# beef is actually made in japan cause there is this certain part of japan <malay>yang yang</malay> [ah]
<malay>lembu-lembu ni yang ada itu</malay>
the essence of #wagyu# beef [ah] <malay>yang banyak</malay> marbling it's also I heard there's also a
a special kind of breed only for
for the #wagyu# beef <malay>punya itu</malay> [ah] market
so only in japan then you get the really the grade A five <malay>yang paling tinggi punya yang paling mahal punya</malay> the rest of it is a usually (um)
<malay>tak</malay> (uh) no
the rest of it is always comes from australia australia <malay>punya</malay> is (uh) <malay>dia punya</malay> grade not that high [lah] but <malay>dia punya rasa</malay> okay [lah] actually okay [lah] the thing about
(uh) #wagyu# beef is just that <malay>dia punya lemak</malay> [jer]
<malay>yang</malay> if you if you really notice [kan] <malay>dia punya yang urat-urat tu</malay> is actually fats
so even the the normal fats the <malay>lemak</malay> fats is the same
what makes it different is that <malay>orang jepun ni dia punya</malay> #wagyu# beef <malay>dia suka potong</malay> raw
<malay>makan macam apa tu</malay> the #sashimi# [eh] then they cut raw slice very thin pieces then what they want is that #umami# effect basically once you cut thin pieces you put it in your mouth it melts then
<malay>ada itu</malay> #umami# <malay>punya</malay> effect #umami# effect is exactly like how you
eat <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
#ajinomoto# <malay>dia</malay> that that kind of effect that kind of taste that's what they chase for the #wagyu# beef
(uh) <malay>dia punya lemak-lemak dia</malay>
ya
[oh] like I say just now [lah] I only eat #bulgogi# cause that's to me is the best of the best <malay>paling sedap</malay>
the #bulgogi# is really my got to [lah] I've eaten <malay>orang makan</malay> thailand <malay>makan</malay> indonesia <malay>melayu semua</malay> I just like #bulgogi# cause #bulgogi# <malay>pun kira macam-macam</malay> [tau] a different part of korea <malay>yang halal punya</malay> they make different type of #bulgogi# the one that I really like is the <malay>budak-budak yang bikin kat</malay>
#itaewon# the #itaewon# actually is actually if you go up
the very big mountain is not really a mountain [ah] it's just a urbanised area
so when you go up (err) that hill
that hill <malay>daripada bawah sampai kat atas semua</malay>
<malay>makanan halal</malay> from singapore from malaysia
turkey <malay>negeri</malay> arab <malay>semua ada</malay> so at the top of the hill is actually a mosque <malay>nama dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>tak apa-apa nama dia</malay> is is not it's a <malay>adalah</malay> I kind of forgotten the name of the mosque
then after that if you go down
okay cause <malay>dia pun macam</malay> road [kan] so you go down on the other side you go down a bit
you will find this small <malay>macam</malay>
(err) <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] you know like those kind of arab street <malay>punya</malay> shophouses you go [ah]
<malay>macam gitu</malay> you go then <malay>adalah dekat situ</malay> [ah] actually <malay>yang masaknya budak-budak perempuan melayu</malay>
they are malaysians but the way they cook the #bulgogi# is very nice even a lot of koreans go there to eat the the #bulgogi#
a lot of them and also there are other specialty [kan] it's actually <malay>ayam rebus</malay> and <malay>dia punya ayam</malay> it's actually they take the whole
<malay>macam</malay> spring chicken <malay>dia kasih</malay> steam <malay>itu benda</malay>
and <malay>dia rebus kat dalam</malay> the chicken soup the chicken broth !wah! then they they just [ah] basically
the moment you order the whole chicken they just give you the whole chicken
<malay>dia tak potong tak apa</malay> the steamed chicken <malay>tu</malay> they just give you in a big pot then they give you a one
[ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> one bowl of rice
!fuh! <malay>makan sedap</malay> [ah] actually during winter <malay>makan tu</malay> is the best [ah]
cause I go it's actually
not really winter [lah] it's quite cold but not really winter <malay>yang</malay> I went to japan is I went there when it was winter and in japan
minimum degrees I was there was a
the lowest I've been there in japan
<malay>dalam</malay> minus
twelve [ah] minus twelve <malay>yang paling sejuk</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu yang paling</malay> best [kan] <malay>kat</malay> japan on the new year's day new year's day <malay>pagi-pagi bangun</malay>
you know what I saw I saw snow
that was the first snow I saw and
in my life in my life so basically that was the very personal [lah] I I actually go down
from the apartment I play with the snow for I mean <malay>dia punya</malay> snow <malay>dia punya</malay> snow is <malay>tak banyak</malay> must wait for the night time then we go to the
nearest park then that's where all the snow is [lah]
[ah] <malay>kalau</malay> you go cause #tokyo# [kan] is <malay>bandar</malay> [kan] so all the snow will melt in the concrete so basically you need to go to the park then
the snow will be at you know at the fields <malay>dekat yang pokok-pokok</malay> [ah] then you can take the snow from there
very interesting
(err) truthfully okay for long term wise I prefer singapore <malay>punya</malay> weather cause singapore <malay>punya</malay> weather you can only expect two
hot or rain cause if you okay for holiday wise I would really love to experience the four
<malay>punya</malay> weather [lah] like (uh) autumn
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> spring [lah] winter
cause why for I mean for own
livelihood [lah] I mean <malay>tengok kita tinggal dekat rumah</malay> <malay>berapa besar</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah</malay> <malay>kita</malay> then <malay>lepas tu kita punya kain baju untuk</malay> weather singapore <malay>sendiri dah</malay>
<malay>dah banyak apa lagi kalau</malay> imagine <malay>kita kena simpan</malay> for
winter clothings <malay>lain</malay>
autumn clothings <malay>lain</malay>
spring clothings <malay>lain</malay> summer clothings <malay>lain</malay> so we will [ah] take up more space and for a small country like singapore with our small houses right I don't think that's ideal [lah] that is for me [lah] but unless it's [ah] you are
talking about we are living in japan <malay>negeri dia besar</malay> even in japan when I went there I actually I checked out the houses there <malay>dia punya rumah sana</malay>
<malay>murah-murah</malay> and actually it's freehold [tau] it's not <malay>macam kita</malay> lease
ninety nine years is freehold <malay>rumah dia</malay> is actually very affordable
<malay>kita punya rumah</malay> three room you can buy a very big bungalow sized <malay>punya rumah</malay> in japan freehold
and !wah! I tell you the
<malay>punya</malay> scenery cause japan is very mountainous
so I've been to the neighbourhood area <malay>macam kita punya</malay>
<malay>tempat</malay> [lah] #hougang# #ang mo kio#
<malay>kita punya</malay> you turn left you turn right all you see are flats right <malay>kalau dekat jepun</malay> you go to that kind of a
urban area it's not really urban [ah] it's <malay>macam dia punya</malay> heartland [ah] <malay>kira</malay>
is all <malay>rumah dia</malay> is all (uh) <malay>rumah</malay> bungalow bungalow bungalow
<malay>lepas tu yang ada tempat ada</malay> gate <malay>yang ada tempat tak ada</malay> gate but mostly <malay>tempat dia orang</malay> is there's no gate so their communals spirit is very strong and in
okay in japan [kan] in a middle of
<malay>dia punya</malay> village <malay>dia</malay> is actually a farm
<malay>dia akan</malay> farm is actually <malay>itu</malay> farm <malay>dia</malay> (uh) <malay>jepun punya beras</malay> [kan] <malay>lain</malay> [kan] so basically all the villagers <malay>dia akan</malay> (um)
<malay>apa tu</malay> have this small mini farms that is actually when I asked the people there they say by right throughout history right that small farm is enough to
to sustain the whole village by right [ah] until modernization come [lah] but that farm itself right <malay>untuk kalau</malay>
<malay>nasi</malay> basic <malay>punya nasi</malay> is actually more than enough to feed the whole
the village so that is a very interesting concept only exists in japan from what I know of [lah]
so even until now also there are still people but not young people [lah] the old people [ah] <malay>dia orang tua-tua yang</malay> [ah] mend
the small farms in japan so basically when they mend the small farms right (um) <malay>yang paling</malay> best <malay>kita orang</malay> tourist they let they let us enter
and they let us to see how they do things very in a closed up and they are not very defensive [lah] but of course is best if you
know people who can speak japanese there
cause <malay>dia orang yang kalau boleh berbual bahasa jepun</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay> will be more receptive than people who can't speak japanese
can't speak japanese you can only speak english <malay>yang</malay>
not all the villagers can speak english especially the
the older generation so only younger generation can speak english but their english <malay>pun</malay> is actually
broken english it's not really full (uh) <malay>punya</malay> english the language that we learn (um) from our
school [lah] cause (err) frankly speaking in asia right
[oh] <malay>budak-budak</malay> singapore <malay>kita punya</malay> english is one of the highest grade [lah] <malay>kirakan kita yang paling pandai dalam bahasa</malay> english in all of asian <malay>punya</malay> country even if you go to like
russia even china you know <malay>apatah lagi</malay> malaysia indonesia <malay>ni semua</malay> their english level <malay>dengan budak</malay> singapore <malay>punya</malay> level
is really <malay>macam langit dengan bumi lain</malay>
really far [kan]
[ah] so that is the gist [lah] actually
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> for japan <malay>tak</malay> (uh) it depends on where you go <malay>kalau itu tempat</malay> is <malay>betul-betul</malay> hundred percent muslims okay usually <malay>macam gini</malay> even if you go
to any other country <malay>macam</malay> thailand even #bali# or what [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> if you go to a halal restaurant
there is owned by indians or arabs yes they will have a <malay>dua dapur</malay>
one <malay>dapur</malay> is for the halal the other <malay>dapur</malay> is actually is for their alcohol
beverages so they <malay>ada dua dapur</malay> for those pure
muslims usually <malay>yang macam</malay> if you go japan is those
<malay>orang kita cakap mualaf</malay> [ah] <malay>orang jepun mualaf ke apa</malay> [ah] they are muslims born and bred muslims in japan they will have hundred percent halal then they have the <malay>dia punya</malay> sign is also not the normal halal sign it's from actually <malay>kalau macam kita punya</malay> singapore <malay>ada</malay> MUIS
[ah] so they also have their own <malay>punya</malay> MUIS [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> in japan so basically even for korea also the same thing
for koreans if you go to those (uh) restaurants <malay>yang</malay> mend by all those arabs or indians yes they have a mixture
halal food plus alcoholic inside cause why they need to cater to the tourists
they cannot just cater
for muslims also cause they are in the tourists area and I think <malay>dia punya</malay> rental <malay>dia punya duit</malay>
<malay>sewa dia</malay> every month is very expensive so they need to cover [lah] they need to be smart in business there in order
for them to survive (mm) korea <malay>jepun</malay> all the same even #bali# even thailand all the same but if you
meet their pure locals or pure muslims then confirm chop <malay>dia punya</malay> area
hundred percent halal they won't accept (err) alcohol beverages around at all
very interesting [kan] that's what I when if you go around the world then you see [lah]
(mm)
correct correct correct is like that one
that's how they live their life I mean <malay>untuk kita kalau macam</malay> extra <malay>was-was kita jangan makan</malay> but you must we must know that there is actually two <malay>dapur</malay>
it's not one <malay>dapur</malay> they make they mix everything together no no no two different <malay>dapur</malay>
(uh) so they have the alcoholic
actually they <malay>yang</malay> the alcohol <malay>pun</malay> it's not really <malay>dapur</malay> [lah] it's just <malay>macam</malay> a bar just a bar place
for them to to you know to do their things
[ah] so that is the gist [lah]
(err) cause I'm still young now thirty two I would rather eat tasty [ah] but since <malay>kita pun dah ada banyak</malay> options <malay>sekarang</malay> so (mm)
actually things that are tasty can also be healthy [ah] but again [lah] like
(uh) what I know is that no matter how healthy the food you eat right don't eat too much [lah] <malay>kalau macam dia cakap buah</malay> avocado is good for your heart
don't eat avocado everyday <malay>nanti</malay> you get other complications when you get when you eat <malay>benda yang</malay> is too good everyday is no good if you search
into youtube [kan]
there's this <malay>guru</malay> from india he say garlic is the best (uh) medicine garlic is the best natural medicine but if you eat garlic everyday you will have adverse effect to you body so basically garlic is actually a very strong
(uh) have very strong medicinal properties under ayurvedic <malay>punya</malay> (uh) <malay>cara perubatan</malay> really a lot so
in at in fact in all their ayurvedic <malay>punya</malay> treatment they all use garlic
[ah] yes cause garlic is very good [lah] basically garlic is the most natural antibiotic
for the indian people so basically
<malay>apa tu</malay>
but you don't eat everyday you eat everyday you have a really an adverse effect on your body is no good
healthy [eh] I
healthy
fruits [lah] I eat fruits [lah] but (uh) if you want it
okay [ah] usually fruits [lah] I just eat fruits
<malay>itu aje</malay> the most the most healthiest <malay>yang</malay> I eat
[oh] almost everyday is egg [lah] by right egg is is considered healthy food [mah]
skills [eh] meaning what
<malay>apa-apa</malay> skills [lah] is it the the the
hardware <malay>dengan</malay> software <malay>punya</malay> skills okay basically skills right what I want skills from your beginning of the questions you ask me
whether <malay>nak jadi apa</malay> I say I <malay>nak jadi kaya</malay> [kan] so
one of the the three skills I want is of course I want to code I want to learn how to code very well not just to code [lah] code very very well so that I can build
(err) games I can build apps I can build a lot of things why
cause if you can build all that is a instant money making machine [ah] you <malay>dah tak payah susah-susah nak kerja</malay> eight to five
or <malay>kerja</malay> shift or whatever
<malay>untuk cari nafkah</malay> you straightaway have an app
and that is your business product [ah] after you have a product then you can easily make money from that product it's a
cause <malay>sekarang banyak budak-budak muda semua</malay> they
have the how to say the
the motivation to do business the all this kind of enterpreneurship
but what thing one thing they lack is actually a a product and product especially in <malay>negeri macam kita ni</malay> singapore we don't
produce any product but what we have is skill cause <malay>kita punya negeri</malay> [ah] is the hub for education so if we have the right skills <malay>kita boleh bikin</malay> product from that skill
from that product can we can make money a lot of money that is what I want one of the thing is
(uh) one of the three skill is coding skills
so the next skill I want is a of course
I <malay>suka makan</malay> so I <malay>kalau boleh</malay> skill <malay>untuk memasak memasak macam-macam masak</malay> (um) but one thing [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>suka masak</malay> I don't like to
<malay>masak</malay> a fusion style cause why
if you eat in malayan food council before <malay>dia punya barang mahal-mahal</malay> portion <malay>besar</malay> yes <malay>dia punya cara tempat duduk pun macam</malay> very posh
<malay>tetapi</malay> their fusion food <malay>macam betul-betul tak kena dengan tekak orang melayu</malay> even <malay>dengan tekak orang putih</malay> they don't like cause (um) when you
fusion western <malay>dengan</malay> asian <malay>punya makanan</malay>
you must get the right ingredient and the right recipe if not it'll be too
too much on the taste of asian or too much on taste of western side which is also not a good balance
(uh) I haven't I have not eaten in any of the restaurants <malay>yang ada makanan</malay> fusion <malay>yang betul-betul</malay>
(err) how to say <malay>ada dia punya rasa dia</malay> is you can actually you can want to go there again [lah]
<malay>tak ada</malay>
all
ya you just go there for the one time or you just go there for a an event <malay>macam</malay> birthday <malay>ke kawan-kawan nak</malay> celebrate birthday promotions <malay>ke</malay> [ah] probably
<malay>sekali-sekala macam gitu dah</malay> but for
to eat for every time no I don't want but of course I like I said I want to have the skill to know how to cook cause (uh) again [ah]
if if you know how to cook you can go anywhere
and you can actually make a lot of friend if we use your skills you can make a lot of money also
if you know how to cook with your skill cause
again (uh) it's all about the skill set [ah] if we got
even if you have a lot of skills right but if your skill cannot make money <malay>untuk apa</malay> [kan]
some more if you know how to cook it's not only you can make money you can also
feed yourself good food not only healthy but also good
food [ah]
just say food
[oh] ya (uh) the last skill [eh] I have [eh] okay basically for me [eh] I <malay>daripada kecil daripada menengah dua dah</malay> start <malay>belajar</malay> karate [lah]
(uh) I really want to have that kind of skill <malay>untuk</malay>
any martial art skill but I want to be very good at it <malay>macam</malay> example karate
[ah] judo <malay>ataupun</malay> mixed martial art but mixed martial art is very cliche very vague
so basically in mixed martial art there's no way you can become good but in karate yes and last time I learn
karate under okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style
and okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style is actually the original <malay>punya</malay> karate [lah] which is actually
goes very deep [lah] and also very (err)
they have very rich history (uh) their okinawan
in fact <malay>yang</malay> karate <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>orang jepun</malay> practice is actually fake
cause <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate
is a is totally different it's not the original karate it's all about <malay>orang jepun</malay> it's all about perfection
so if you go to a japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate
it's called <malay>nama dia bukan</malay> karate <malay>nama dia</malay> karate-do
do <malay>dalam bahasa jepun</malay> is a way of life even judo
karate-do #aikido#
all the do <malay>yang kat belakang semua</malay> is actually <malay>maksud orang jepun</malay>
is a way of life so <malay>orang jepun</malay> is more on to the perfectionism
<malay>tapi</malay> if you really learn the original okinawan <malay>punya</malay> style it's more of the
the relax <malay>orang</malay> #okinawa# actually <malay>belajar</malay> karate like even
<malay>kalau awak awak belajar</malay> #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate [kan]
even if you come late the the <malay>orang</malay> the instructor <malay>tu</malay> can actually still accept you but for <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate
if you're late for one minute [eh] they totally banned you from the class at all
so <malay>untuk orang</malay> #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate is actually <malay>untuk orang malas-malas</malay> (err) like myself
actually <malay>orang</malay> okay the main difference between #okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate <malay>dengan</malay> japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate is this <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate they learn every time they fight they will learn
how to (oo) (oo) <malay>dia kira itu dia punya</malay> how they breathe is how they get their strengths is by (uh) contracting I think it's contract or expand okay I think [ah] <malay>orang jepun punya</malay> karate is by contracting their body
<malay>untuk kasih badan dia</malay> tense
(uh) cause <malay>untuk dia orang</malay> what they learn from
#aikido# judo <malay>ni semua</malay> if you
tense your body means you have more strength but by right #okinawa# the original one right you cannot tense your body you must expand your body
cause only when you expand your body then like
(um) you can practise the real okinawan <malay>punya punya</malay> martial arts [ah] <malay>punya ni</malay> karate cause even
<malay>dia</malay> they call this <malay>macam kita</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia bunga-bunga</malay> [lah] <malay>kita punya silat bunga-bunga</malay>
<malay>orang jepun pun ada</malay>
(err) <malay>orang jepun pun ada cuma orang jepun</malay>
<malay>punya</malay> is a
<malay>nama dia</malay> #kata# #kata#
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okinawan <malay>punya</malay> #kata# is actually more
realistic more relax and more
practical <malay>tapi orang jepun punya</malay> #kata# is actually very short and sweet cause like I say again they focus mainly on perfectionism
they don't (uh) focus about <malay>dia punya</malay> feel
actually <malay>ini</malay> karate <malay>ni semua</malay> [eh] it's actually about the feel
so if actually if you ask a <malay>budak yang belajar</malay> okinawan karate <malay>dengan</malay> japanese karate if they were to spar
hundred percent confirm <malay>budak</malay> #okinawa# they will win cause <malay>orang jepun</malay> they also learn #kata# but <malay>dia punya</malay> #kata# and karate <malay>dia</malay> they do not know how to apply it to real life
self defence they don't know cause <malay>untuk orang</malay>
korea <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>orang</malay> korea <malay>punya</malay> the way they fight <malay>bila</malay> when they practise
#kata# it's actually they are
they fight for close distance
but <malay>orang jepun dia punya</malay> #kata#
the stands <malay>dia punya kuda-kuda dia</malay> is
to charge at the long distance
so example if you fight one guy he like to fight long distance another guy is meant actually the original <malay>punya</malay> martial arts fight is for
to fight the short distance
you ask them to fight each other <malay>yang</malay> long distance they will definitely lose
cause once the okinawan <malay>punya orang</malay>
come close to japanese <malay>punya</malay>
karate <malay>punya budak</malay>
<malay>dia akan</malay> blur <malay>dia akan tak tahu apa nak bikin</malay>
[ah] that's why when they have the any competitions
okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate will always win japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate
but the big but [eh] <malay>orang</malay> #okinawa# even though they are more relax <malay>dia punya</malay> gym you can come late all this kind of thing right
#okinawa# <malay>punya</malay> karate [kan] every class only maximum ten to fifteen people <malay>yang belajar</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya guru dia</malay> they don't like to take a lot of people so that's why okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate <malay>lama-lama</malay> is dying out
but japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
is they are they are how to say being trained in a mass level so basically in every class <malay>ada dalam</malay> hundred people
two hundred people <malay>tiga ratus orang belajar</malay> in actually in any one class any one time so what the whole world know about
karate is mostly japanese <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
they do not know about okinawan the original one
[ah] and also in [ah] in japan <malay>punya</malay> karate-do
they are trained not to use any weapons
but by right the original karate <malay>yang</malay> from okinawan one
once you get to a certain level you will be trained to use (uh) a weapon to fight
that is the true essence of okinawan <malay>punya</malay> karate
[ah] <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>bezanya</malay> it's actually there's a lot of difference [ah] you can talk
three days three nights [eh] <malay>tiga hari tiga malam boleh</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal ni tak habis-habis</malay> cause it's actually the <malay>punya cerita</malay> is very interesting
of course cause I like
things I like I really
I will really [ah] do research on it
sorry again
was free
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
okay for singapore context [eh] <malay>aku nak percuma senang</malay> [jer]
<malay>aku nak rumah percuma aku nak kereta percuma</malay>
(err)
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
yes of course healthcare
cause healthcare <malay>dekat</malay> singapore <malay>yang paling mahal lepas tu</malay>
<malay>yang lain benda percuma</malay> is of course <malay>kereta dengan rumah</malay> [lah] <malay>rumah jangan cakap rumah yang paling mahal</malay>
<malay>orang budak-budak</malay> singapore <malay>ni kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak kahwin tapi dia orang terpaksa kahwin sebab nakkan rumah</malay>
<malay>yang dia orang boleh mampu</malay> (uh) mostly is that's the case [lah] <malay>lepas tu yang pasal</malay>
<malay>kereta</malay> of course everybody wants to own a car even though for ten years
<malay>yang kau dah kasih orang</malay> lease for ten years <malay>engkau</malay> charge <malay>orang tu sampai</malay> hundred over thousand for a a normal car
so if you really think it's not that
logical but again of course from the government point of view is good why cause if you don't do this (err)
imagine all the roads will be full of cars everyday
and imagine all the
carparks <malay>yang kita ada</malay> is <malay>tak cukup</malay>
I mean that is the realistic view [lah] but if like you say you ask me again
<malay>apa barang</malay> free <malay>nak</malay> of course [lah] <malay>nak rumah kereta dengan</malay> healthcare healthcare is the most important
cause for healthcare <malay>dah ada pernah</malay> personal experience [ah] <malay>kalau dekat</malay> singapore you do not have any insurance <malay>apa-apa jadi dengan</malay> you [ah]
<malay>bayar</malay> [lah] <malay>sendiri sampai pokai</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> insurance <malay>boleh</malay> cover <malay>sikit</malay> at least <malay>duit tu boleh cari juga</malay> [lah]
<malay>boleh apa orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>termampu</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> no insurance at all [ah] <malay>kena bayar pokai-pokai</malay> [ah] <malay>pandai-pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>hidup nak</malay>
humans no longer
[oh]
[oh]
okay [ah]
<malay>sifat manusia ni</malay>
they like to
conquer
so most likely if we don't do anything like
what we do okay <malay>kita tengok sejarah kita dulu-dulu</malay>
then <malay>zaman kegemilangan</malay> islam
when meaning the golden age of islam
when people had nothing to do
what do they do
they learn more stuff
how algebra was created is cause of all these smart people who actually
they don't have to do anything for survival cause their life is already been taken care of the islamic the <malay>khalifah punya</malay> empire
so what they do is on their free time which they have everyday
<malay>dia orang tak payah nak nak pergi menanam tak payah nak pergi jual barang tak payah nak apa-apa dia orang ada macam itu hidup dia orang</malay>
<malay>ada dibiayai</malay> [lah] <malay>oleh</malay>
<malay>kita punya khalifah dulu</malay>
so <malay>apa dia orang bikin</malay>
<malay>dia orang belajar</malay>
<malay>dia belajar</malay> (um) (err)
<malay>zaman-zaman</malay> rome <malay>punya punya buku-buku</malay>
they translate <malay>daripada</malay> latin <malay>pergi</malay> arab
in fact [ah] even the egyptian <malay>punya</malay> historical book they can translate from egyptian to arabic
so that's why <malay>kita banyak</malay> actually a lot of our
modern stuff
came all the way back from that the golden age of islam
that few hundred years whereby islam was in their golden age
then we have all these smart people I do not know their name cause I don't
read up about them that much but I know they are the ones who actually [ah] push [ah] <malay>macam</malay> all the
scientific medicine everything that we experience in life right now
(mm)
everything
so <malay>kalau untuk zaman sekarang</malay> if you have that kind of time if we have that luxury of time
what we do right I think we also be the same thing [lah] we will explore <malay>untuk sekarang lagi kita ada</malay> we are very modernize
so most likely will
<malay>kita akan</malay> explore the space [ah]
space is our new frontier basically we will definitely create something or do something
[ah] just [ah] <malay>apa tu</malay>
go to mars maybe go to venus
[ah] cause I think that is the way to go [lah] you just want to explore
<malay>kita manusia ni</malay> we we love to explore
yes explore and learn new things
of course when we explore we learn
we automatically learn a lot of new things [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] repeat repeat <malay>soalan</malay>
activity [eh]
meaning what [ah]
work <malay>bukan</malay> activity work is like actually a task
task is different from activity <malay>kalau</malay> activity
(hmm) [ah] eight hours [eh]
activity [eh] activity
activity
eight hours [eh]
!wah!
no no no is working out
okay activity <malay>yang paling</malay> boring [kan] [eh]
cause right now I'm playing my computer games I cannot imagine myself playing this computer game for eight hours straight <malay>tak boleh</malay> cause (uh) you need to go to the toilet to eat you need to rest
so if you play the computer games for eight hours straight [eh] I
I don't think I can that kind of activity is really is bad for your health also very bad
<malay>apa tu</malay>
karma
ya
(mm) <malay>kalau</malay> okay [lah]
if I can answer this in two ways whether a layman term
or can make it into a comical joke [lah] if a comical joke easy [ah] double cheeseburger
cause why I every time I hungry <malay>kalau rumah tak ada makan</malay> I just go to the nearest mcdonald's I just order a double cheeseburger
so if you but if you're talking in that about karma all this kind of thing right
cause (err) my life how to say [ah]
it's a pretty boring [lah]
<malay>kira</malay> [kan] I don't do a lot of stuff
<malay>dekat luar</malay> I'm always at home so <malay>kalau</malay>
say about <malay>macam</malay> bad stuff no [lah] not really [lah]
<malay>kalau ada</malay> bad stuff <malay>mesti hidup pun</malay> I can't sleep at night also [lah]
I don't think I'm the kind of person but ya [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> not really [lah]
I <malay>yang pasal ni</malay> I can't really say much [lah] [ah] ya
actor [eh] (err)
okay [ah] actor is I okay until now right
I want to wake up as brad pitt why cause I only like him in one thing
(um) he was actually the
first hollywood actor to actually have the eight packs
<malay>dia punya</malay> abs <malay>tu</malay> eight packs and after he has the eight packs everybody after him
they'll go to the gym and have eight packs also he was the first one [ah] also another thing about brad pitt is that a
he plays in this movie movie which I really like (err)
what troy that
trojan war troy
<malay>dia jadi</malay> achilles achilles <malay>itu punya</malay> movie okay I like two movies [ah] in in my life right I like two movies is one is three hundred
one is [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] troy so that the difference
between this [ah]
troy three hundred is actually same thing but a troy
is actually <malay>pasal orang paling kuat</malay> achilles
that cannot be killed (uh) then after that
(mm) in the end he died he have a choice actually <malay>kalau dia</malay> if he if he doesn't want to die he has to stay in greece if I'm not wrong [lah]
have to stay in greece they will find a lovely wife you know this kind of thing but then people will forget about him but if he wants to
had eternal glory <malay>macam orang ingat dia</malay>
even a thousand years after he's dead which is now actually
[ah] [orh] even beyond that (um) you have to go to trial to fight this war and being achilles being a
egoistically that [eh]
any normal egoistic man he actually (uh) it shows <malay>kita manusia</malay> especially man [ah] (uh) all
we want to achieve in life in life is to be remembered
any movie you see any genre or what
all the male [ah] character whether it's the
protagonist or whatever
we just want one thing one achievement it's to be remembered that's all
we want to leave a legacy and they want to be remembered the same
for this [ah] characters also this achilles
(uh) his main purpose is to be remembered
as this greatest warrior that they have
that has ever lived in the world
in the history of mankind ever
you know so basically ya [lah] and the process of him achieving that kind of legacy especially I like
about this movie right about three hundred and <malay>ni</malay> [ah] troy is all the quotes that they used
which all the quotes that all the quotes
that they used (um) can really
make if you really into this [ah] like me
I am quite influenced by all these quotes cause I will take them to heart and I apply it in my daily life
example my workplace if it's very bad very stressful [lah] I remember the quotes for example from the gladiator
brothers what you do in life will echo in eternity <malay>itu</malay> word [eh] <malay>macam memang kita belajar ugama pun ustaz-ustaz pun cakap apa kau bikin kat sini nanti besok harinya pun akan kena</malay>
<malay>soal jawab</malay>
so it's it's about the same thing and also <malay>dalam</malay>
[ah] <malay>gambar-gambar macam</malay> achilles <malay>ni semua</malay> troy <malay>ni semua</malay> it's all the same thing it's their quotes [eh] you can actually bring it to real life and <malay>ikut</malay> [lah] so you won't lose out really you you won't lose out [one] [lah]
ya that's the gist
[oh] how I keep [ah] I don't know [leh]
actually I just went through life [ah]
this my life
like I said I have a very boring life and this is my boring life
no no no I
not say I don't read book I read books but I
I think about me and books is that (um)
after I read a book for half an hour
for the next two hours or six hours the book will read me so basically I'm already fast asleep but what keeps me awake is (uh) <malay>macam</malay>
all these (uh) youtube [lah] especially youtube
youtube or whatever even now they have screenshare all these kind of things which you just learn
from it [lah]
you just watch it cause I mean I'm that kind of a character whereby I need
to see things
then I'll be interested in things then I'll get
I need to know more info about the thing if you ask me
to do research I will do research on the videos
or the pictures
I won't do research about all the texts I won't read [one]
not say I won't read I I'll read but not all those lengthy <malay>yang</malay>
texts <malay>yang panjang-panjang semua</malay>
I don't like I would
prefer texts <malay>yang macam</malay>
<malay>yang pendek-pendek</malay> short and sweet <malay>kirakan macam gitu</malay> yes summary and also mostly
pictures and of course obviously the videos [lah] I really like this kind of things then
the thing about me right (err) I think I
quite a good memory basically what I see I can remember and what I want to remember I can really remember
for a long time but if I don't want to remember something [ah] (err) you talk to me today next day I already forget already but if I want to remember something I will really really make an effort to remember the thing
so that's the gist [ah]
thirty two <malay>tiga puluh dua tahun</malay>
seventeen years old [eh]
seventeen years
old self
<malay>tengah buat apa</malay> is it the O levels
[ah]
seventeen
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] actually seventeen
need to know [ah] you need to give me a time period
seventeen
[oh] poly [eh]
(err)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh] actually <malay>nak cakap</malay> (err)
advice
actually <malay>kalau</malay> if I look back in my life right
I don't truthfully [ah] I don't regret anything
<malay>kalau</malay> whatever I've been through is actually is for my own good also
whatever [lah] I've been through (um) but <malay>kalau betul-betul nak</malay> advice of course [lah] (um)
advice [eh] okay the best thing is
[ah]
cause at that time also <malay>kalau misal kata nak cakap</malay> [oh] you learn coding you learn all these app making right
[ah] actually frankly speaking [eh] at that time
you don't you won't have that kind of a
resource to the in fact the poly that I learn <malay>sekolah</malay> poly that I learn is actually that was the
first time I was exposed and we were taught the C plus plus
visual basics I still remember this
even though it's more than ten years ago [ah] and actually
(err) <malay>orang yang ajar tu pun</malay> the knowledge of the people that teach us the lecturers are not that (err) they are not that brilliant also
[ah] if you you can see they are not that smart also
so when you ask them the questions
they will start to get angry get
agitated cause they themselves they don't know a lot of things
so if you ask me to <malay>macam</malay> you know to start a something new I don't think (uh) there will be good advice cause
even for those like you imagine [ah]
microsoft mark zuckerberg <malay>ni semua</malay> [eh] the way they start [kan] is a really is all a downhill task [lah]
and I don't think at that time in with my maturity whatever I've been through in life I can handle that kind of
(err)
things in life yet
[ah] so cause also <malay>apa-apapun nak kena</malay> see
your character back then when you
(uh)
<malay>tujuh belas tahun</malay>
so my character when I was only
<malay>tujuh belas tahun</malay> really I don't see myself having that kind of burden
to be learned !wah! <malay>betul-betul</malay> (uh) <malay>benda baru</malay>
that kind of thing so just live life [lah]
just a live my life that's all [lah] (mm)
!wah! <malay>ni banyak</malay> boss <malay>semua cakap gini</malay>
where do I see myself [eh]
in five years' time [eh] okay in three years' time I'm confirm will buy a house already
and I will earn some a rental income a rental income from that
definitely so the five years' time I'll see myself is just same [ah] as what I see myself now
just the same unless if I fall in love and get married [lah] so usually is you do like that
you just be normal stuff [ah] five years' time [eh] okay <malay>kalau cakap pasal</malay> goals [eh] (um)
actually
I don't have the urge to buy a car cause I use to own a car and I know how expensive to own a car in singapore and really I I don't see myself like <malay>macam ada</malay> have that kind of materialistic <malay>punya</malay> goals
all I want in five years' time is to have more knowledge
of everything that I'm learning business especially (uh)
money making invention business so basically is
the coding [lah] hopefully in a five years' time right the technology that will come out in five years' time which is maybe
a a new youtube or a new facebook
I'll be the one who invent it or who create it !wah! then I'll be !woo!
<malay>terus jadi</malay> billionaire
I would want to go to that path instead of any of the materialistic thing <malay>macam nak beli rumah besar</malay>
<malay>beli kereta besar</malay> all these I don't want cause <malay>benda-benda gini semua kita hidup dekat</malay> singapore we know that it won't last for cars
ten years
for houses they say lease ninety nine years

[eh] hi
ya
okay which plan
okay
ya
per month
okay
so every month you pay how much
okay
so
(mm)
ya
iphone eleven <malay>dalam</malay> one thousand plus [ah]
so if <malay>kalau tambah</malay> plus <malay>atau yang</malay> [eh] sorry iphone pro [eh] iphone pro <malay>dengan</malay> iphone pro max
<malay>yang tu kena</malay> check <malay>dulu</malay> like <malay>dia punya harga berapa</malay>
ya
the same
have you checked
[oh] so I think <malay>tengok tempat dia</malay> plan [jer] [lah] <malay>tengok macam mana dia punya</malay> plan <malay>dia berapa</malay> gigabyte
<malay>berapa</malay> incoming call free <malay>semua</malay> like
<malay>dia punya</malay> specs [ah]
(hmm) <malay>tengok</malay> benefit benefit <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] okay
ten gigabyte [kan] per month okay
but currently you use what phone currently <malay>pakai</malay> phone <malay>apa</malay>
[oh]
ya ya
(uh)
ya ya our <malay>saudara</malay>
ya around there two thousand sixteen I think ya
four years [eh] but I think you just bought [kan] iphone six plus the new one or you upgrade [eh]
[oh] still iphone [lah]
[oh] but I think recently you bought [kan] a new phone
!alamak! drill [ah] <malay>buto</malay> sorry sorry pause
<malay>yang</malay> iphone eleven <malay>tu</malay> (uh) you plan to take which plan
[oh]
ya
unless you have wifi [lah] at home you already have wifi [kan] or
ya
ya
<malay>tu</malay> full price [ah] no contract [ah]
[oh] actually iphone seven also not bad <malay>tapi</malay> I I would suggest iphone eight [ah] because it's the latest kind of ya it it's the best it's the new iphone [ah]
I think <malay>tu paling terbaik</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau nak nak apa nak fikirkan</malay> iphone eleven is really good enough [ah]
iphone the new one I think is this year early this year twenty twenty
ya so that one that time was during COVID [kan] so <malay>sebab dia orang nak kasih murah sebab</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> COVID [kan] so not to get more consumer to buy the phone [lah] at a cheaper price ya
even [ah] android phone <malay>pun sama</malay> [lah] like google the new google <malay>apa</malay> pixel [kan] they they make it cheaper [lah] but I think the specs wise of course it's a bit <malay>kurang</malay> [lah] compared to the previous one ya
to me it's the same as iphone eight ya it's much similar to iphone eight
have have have iphone eight plus ya the the big one
must check the new iphone right <malay>jap</malay> [eh] let me check [eh]
there's about four point seven inch
it has a better bionic chip the <malay>apa</malay> it's I think it's similar to iphone eight design touch
so I'm not sure if there's a face recognition [ah] I don't think so
ya they are still selling I mean (um) you must check you must check <malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>ustaz tengah</malay> check
<malay>takpe</malay> [ah] <malay>ustaz kena</malay> check <malay>dia punya</malay> iphone <malay>punya</malay> iphone store
let me check
there's no more [ah] sorry they don't sell anymore [ah] iphone eight
so I think they replace with iphone starting from six hundred and forty nine dollars
ya the cheapest
but I I'm currently using iphone eleven [lah] so I think for camera wise if you love the camera [kan] take pictures all I think iphone eleven is good enough [ah] iphone eleven (uh)
not too sure [ah] cause I never use iphone eight before iphone eleven [ah]
iphone X [eh] iphone X <malay>jap jap jap</malay> there's a face iphone
ya !alamak!
who
[oh] our <malay>ni</malay> [eh] parents [eh]
I think <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] mum is sleeping then I think <malay>bapak</malay> baru balik ya and
<malay>siapa</malay>
[ah] <malay>bapak kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>dekat ni</malay> [lah] <malay>iya dia kerja ni</malay> [lah] <malay>hari ni kerja</malay> [pe] <malay>hari ni hari rabu</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think he working three times a week
tuesday wednesday and thursday
ya monday and friday off [ah]
I'm not really looking to job search yet [ah] cause I'm doing freelance [ah] so I have several project to handle for for the app development
I think by end of the year [lah] I try to finish this projects and without expecting much [lah] I think I think the most important thing is experience [ah] and the skills that I will acquire ya
<malay>tu</malay> I think <malay>paling penting</malay> [ah] so like <malay>macam nanti</malay> (um) once I've started working
once I start working [ah] I'm more prepared [ah] prepared than ever
<malay>kalau tak nanti macam</malay> before this <malay>kerja macam tak</malay> prepare <malay>sangat setakat apa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> relax relax <malay>tapi nanti</malay> end up <malay>macam tak belajar apa-apa macam</malay> cause
I think it's a bit hard [ah] because once you already
<malay>apa</malay> start started working [kan] you will forget a lot of things so really technology keeps changing [kan] so you need to
ya you mean like interview is it
ya you really most tech companies they will offer about three to four round of interview so the first step
they really coding test [ah] they would will want to see whether you are
you have the skills [ah] you have the knowledge
for coding [ah] ya so basically it's not that hard [lah] because really we can just (uh) search up in the in the <malay>apa</malay>
in the internet and most of the coding answers are there already
ya
[ah] ya
ya ya some some some <malay>apa</malay> some company [kan] they
they know [ah] whether you you've you search online <malay>ke tak</malay> [lah] cause they cause I think the most important I don't think is the first interviewed I mean the coding test is not really important [ah] it's the second round where most probably is a face to face
and they will ask you like on the spot [lah] like how do you solve this [ah] [ah] this coding test like
like what kind of algorithm do you use what kind of
like what kind of
ya that
like how do you solve the problem [lah] I think that's the most important
then I think it's also not the answer that is (uh) that is important for them I think it's like how you
how would you explain to them [lah]
ya
it's more mostly interview skills [lah] that
if you are not really strong in an interview then you need to practice [ah] you need to really improve on it [ah] then you have higher chance to to be <malay>apa</malay> to be offered [lah] by the company
so what what about you have you
have you been job hunting
[ah] monster ya the recruiter right the recruit company
they want you fast [ah] (mm)
the expected
[oh]
ya
ya
ya if they can't offer you [lah]
[oh]
<malay>jangan kena pijak</malay> [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
I'm not sure like what like what's your expectation depends on the I think to me is the job job position like example if you are like a assistant engineer
ya aviva ya
full time
[oh] okay okay
ya
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> like looking into like contract or <malay>apa</malay>
(uh) full time <malay>ke</malay> part time
ya
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> full time <malay>pun</malay> there's a lot of expectation [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
[oh]
ya
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
<malay>tapi</malay> N level start <malay>sama</malay> time [eh] <malay>dengan</malay> O level
[oh] okay okay
but that enable there's you know there's normal tech and also have a communicated ya ya so
normal acad ya ya
<malay>tapi</malay> [ah] the
ya <malay>tapi</malay> the condition <malay>sekarang</malay> condition <malay>sekarang macam mana dia punya</malay> COVID <malay>dia orang ambil</malay> O level december <malay>apa</malay> this COVID <malay>kat</malay>
[ah] the
<malay>tempat dekat rumah ke dekat examination hall</malay>
ya
(mmhmm)
but <malay>dia orang ambil</malay> same timing <malay>dia orang ada</malay> own shift <malay>ke apa atau</malay> it's just one time
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
microsoft office [ah]
okay okay
[oh] ya correct correct
ya they they are too detailed [ah]
they said okay monday to friday
the timing is (uh) I think
[oh]
(mm)
<malay>faham faham faham</malay>
so you're mostly your job hunting specifically [ah] system engineer [lah] you are looking to that position <malay>atau</malay> you are looking into different role
different roles in terms of <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [lah]
ya over work [ah]
ya
ya
yup understood
<malay>ada macam macam</malay>
software engineer <malay>ke</malay> if
if it involves coding like for example I think most of the data science they need coding [kan] they need like
python or
or
ya I think it's considered high level
ya
ya it's high level ya
low level like I think if you learn like the basics of computer science fundamentals
so mostly it's like S language or like C plus plus
but it's still I think for like C programming is basically is
readable [lah] you can still read the code [ah] like for example I think the lowest like out of the worst I think like S language until
involves like how
what is it
<malay>macam mana nak</malay> spell F O R T L A N
[oh] okay okay [eh] never heard before [eh]
even though I am a computer science
C hash [eh]
I think it's called C sharp [ah]
ya so the hashtag is it ya actually C hash is it is a C sharp
ya so basically all these programming I've learnt before [lah] during my during assignments or project during university when polytechnic
ya so I think in terms of
most companies do have like you need to know [lah] this kind of
<malay>apa</malay> skills [ah] like
mostly low level [lah] like C sharp python [eh] sorry C sharp (uh) what is it called [ah] ya C plus plus
pearl so mostly because I think it's much more stable [ah] than the newer technology like
for example we say like newer language
for example <malay>apa</malay> [eh] okay name like
I think it's like flutter <malay>dia ada</malay> own language which which covered dart [eh] dart ya I think mostly high level also
there's also google language they have their own language which is <malay>apa</malay> go golang [eh] golang
ya golang
ya G O L A N G
golang also is like basically is like
like owned by google [ah] so they they have their own language they make their own <malay>ni</malay> designed by them
so I think mostly the their syntax is like similar to C
ya which is more structural typing [ah] more structured
ya
(mm)
how do you spell logs
[oh] log ya ya ya log in log in ya
error [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya ya
ya
ya
ya
I think
<malay>yang tengah</malay> [ah] <malay>siapa yang tekan biasanya</malay> the manager [kan] the <malay>apa</malay> (uh) the business <malay>punya</malay> side the project manager <malay>dia orang akan tekan</malay> [kan] this <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>faham faham</malay>
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
ya nobody use [eh]
[oh]
(mm)
ya
(mm)
but each country like they have their own server <malay>ke atau</malay> they have their own
means like singapore have one server so <malay>lain negeri ada</malay> their own server <malay>ke</malay>
atau combine <malay>macam</malay> asia
[oh]
[oh] okay
<malay>abeh</malay> sekarang like [ah]
like
you know <malay>macam</malay> COVID <malay>pun</malay> is getting better [kan] singapore
malaysia <malay>pun</malay> like they they do open the border [kan] to singapore [kan] <malay>macam</malay> only for those <malay>yang</malay> business
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah] green lane <malay>semua</malay>
so for the purpose of those <malay>yang ada rumah kat sana</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang boleh</malay> ya for us I think we can't [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> we are going there basically <malay>nak apa</malay>
<malay>nak cuti</malay> [kan]
actually <malay>boleh balik</malay> [ah] because technically she is <malay>ni</malay> [kan] she is not singaporean [kan]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
actually I'm not sure like our cousin <malay>yang</malay> always (uh) who are staying there [kan] who are staying there #syakilah# #iman# do they <malay>dia orang boleh datang sini ke</malay>
unless <malay>dia orang ada</malay> they <malay>ada kerja dekat sini</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang ada kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>atau rumah kat sini</malay> [kan]
#clementi# house
ya because they are
[oh]
ya true true
but you never never contact them
but you haven't contact them [eh] like never contact them
the malaysia people [ah] the [ah] all our <malay>saudara kat sana</malay>
[oh] <malay>cik rozi</malay> <malay>lama tak</malay> call [eh]
yup true true
#alhamdulilah# <malay>dah makan dah</malay> I think
mum cook <malay>apa kari ayam</malay> so we just ate <malay>tu</malay> [lah] we just ate the
(uh) the rice and
<malay>kuah apa kari</malay> [ah] <malay>kuah kari</malay> and I just cook <malay>telur sikit</malay> then <malay>makan</malay>
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah]
I think I need to start learn I need to start to learn cooking [ah]
but it's a bit hard ya it's a bit hard
I prefer to cook alone [ah]
ya
[ah] that one the smell <malay>nanti apa</malay>
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>bau dia</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti tu</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti iya</malay> [lah] <malay>tutup tingkap</malay>
<malay>tutup pintu semua</malay>
but I know [ah] I know how to cook <malay>macam</malay> like simple simple [ah] like usually I cook thai food [ah] sweet and sour fish
and #kai lan# <malay>ikan masin</malay>
baby #kai lan# <malay>ikan masin</malay> so <malay>macam setakat ikut ni</malay> [ah] <malay>ikut</malay> youtube and
ya <malay>kadang-kadang beli kat ni</malay> fairprice
nearby [lah]
giant so just <malay>beli apa</malay>
<malay>barang-barang semua dekat ni</malay> [ah] <malay>barang-barang kat</malay> giant and fairprice
<malay>kalau ada takde</malay> [ah] just find a replacement [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
that time <malay>takde ikan apa</malay> [eh] <malay>ikan tenggiri ke apa</malay> [eh]
so (uh) I replaced it with <malay>ikan apa nama dia</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>nama dia ikan terprau macam ikan masin</malay> [ah] <malay>macam ketul-ketul macam</malay> cube <malay>ikan</malay> cube
throw the like it's just
simple [lah] <malay>dia punya masak</malay> it's not that hard [ah] just <malay>ikut dia punya</malay> youtube <malay>punya</malay> tutorial
ya not much
[ah] boneless and <malay>dia macam</malay> I think it's dried [ah] dried food dried fish
ya <malay>macam</malay> you you <malay>macam</malay> very dried [lah] <malay>dia bukan dekat mana dekat belah apa dekat tempat</malay>
ya it's not in the fridge [ah] it's like dried [ah] dried #ikan bilis#
ya so <malay>macam</malay> like it's in terms in the form of cube [ah] cube then with that cube just [ah] <malay>letak kat kuali isi dengan minyak lepas tu</malay>
once the the fish <malay>dah tu</malay> [kan]
<malay>dah lembut</malay> [ah] <malay>baru tu</malay> [lah] <malay>pecah-pecahkan ikan tu lepas tu letak</malay> baby #kai lan#
<malay>letak kicap</malay> oyster sauce so once <malay>dah</malay>
<malay>dah panaskan</malay> I think like
five to ten minutes <malay>dah siap</malay>
but for fish I think it's a bit troublesome [ah] <malay>kena kena masak ikan dulu kena apa</malay> make sure <malay>letak dengan tepung</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> sauce <malay>senang nak buat</malay> [ah] sweet and sour sauce
ya
ya you you need to get the fish ya fried first [ah]
<malay>dengan tepung</malay>
ya
it's homemade [ah] homemade ya
ya
ya capsicum
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] I think this is like the starting point [ah] <malay>cuma macam</malay> <malay>nak</malay> I think I took me awhile [ah] like I think what I cook at most one hour two hours very tiring <malay>macam</malay> you need to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>potong ni</malay> [lah]
I think the
ya true [ah] <malay>barang-barang dah siap</malay> if someone already did that for me [kan] <malay>senang</malay> [ah] I think my life will be easier
<malay>cuma itulah</malay> you need
ya
but also maid also it's not that cheap [ah]
cannot cannot like that [ah] I think most women nowadays is they prefer to work [ah] [kan] but depends [ah] [eh]
ya
(mm)
ya
(mm)
so take turn [ah]
[oh]
<malay>tapi boleh ke macam tu</malay>
ya
<malay>tapi boleh ke macam tu macam ada ada</malay> agreement <malay>dia</malay> is just one house [kan] the maid
the agreement <malay>biasanya</malay> one maid <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay> one house [kan]
okay
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] of course
ya for weekend [ah]
ya usually once a week [kan] like sunday
[ah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
pause <malay>jap</malay> [eh] pause <malay>jap</malay>
but if the maid <malay>macam</malay> they have their own <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>kerja</malay> timing <malay>dia</malay> [kan]
like
ya sunday off
but for weekday they work like almost the whole day [kan] except <malay>malam</malay> [ah] [kan]
ya
<malay>dah berumur</malay> ya
ya of course
(mmhmm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> fairprice fairprice fairprice <malay>punya</malay> online
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] sometimes I think
that time I saw like <malay>macam halal punya daging</malay> [kan]
ya really <malay>ni</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> which section [eh] the section <malay>yang ada</malay> frozen food
ya it's similar [ah] same as when you go to grocery
ya
actually I saw this youtube video [ah] very interesting <malay>dia macam</malay> <malay>punya</malay> shopping
<malay>tapi</malay> I don't think singapore <malay>ada</malay> [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay> like I think in america <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah] which country <malay>atau</malay> china
ya like you need it it's like the shop the shop [kan] there'll be someone who welcome you <malay>pastu</malay> [ah] you using the [lah] I think it's a like the device [ah] you need to buy the device device
then you are like it's like shopping [ah]
[ah] it's a virtual [ah] everything is virtual
ya you cannot be real [ah] I mean impossible [ah] but its similar [lah] it's almost similar like
ya it's like it's like someone
if if <malay>memang</malay> ya stock finish of course the thing is empty [lah] <malay>dia punya ni</malay> [ah]
it's the same as you are shopping [ah] it's like you you are really shopping
ya virtually [lah]
ya very interesting
<malay>tapi</malay> it's very hard [ah] like I mean the software wise like
ya I think like imagine like walking [ah]
like you are even grabbing food you use your hand to grab [kan]
why
<malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
access to shopping mall [eh] is it
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya
but I'm not sure like like the walking stuff you can just walk but like you don't have to walk literally [ah] I'm not too sure [ah] there's a button to like
move fast forward or what but I never try before [ah] I never try using like I I don't think so I tried before
ya but quite quite interesting
<malay>berapa</malay>
of course [ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> price <malay>mahalnya</malay> it's like you're playing four <malay>punya</malay> <malay>punya tu</malay> [kan] console
(mm)
ya
but I think can be solved [ah] like technology wise <malay>macam</malay> they keep changing [kan] most like it's probably [ah] I feel very interesting like how
like especially this COVID times like how technology they try to change [ah] <malay>macam</malay> in terms of like the new normal
so we are living like like nowadays people are working from home
like <malay>dulu takde</malay> [kan] I think previously my company my former company <malay>dia pernah</malay> offer [ah] work from anywhere so one year <malay>macam</malay> they give like seven days [ah]
ya
<malay>kat rumah</malay> [lah] you can can stay at home or go overseas <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] as long as you do something [lah] usually the manager will <malay>ni</malay> [lah] the
the manager will ask [ah] like what have you done today like it's it's the same it's like the sprint [ah] sprint adjust chrome
where you go everyday task
ya standard meeting ya

you need to be <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] my company former company use zoom for <malay>ni</malay> [lah]
for presentation
ya of course [ah] I think they are going to make one in singapore [kan]
<malay>dia punya</malay>
ya
[ah] but I not too sure [ah] like I heard from the news ya and they were hiring [ah] (mm) I think a lot foreigner [ah]
[oh] ikea [ah] I don't I don't think so actually I don't buy like
<malay>macam</malay> container [ah] <malay>nak letak</malay> something container like small [one] [ah] ya but I think [ah]
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>hari tu</malay> my friend <malay>tanya nak pergi</malay> ikea <malay>ke tak dia ajak</malay>
so maybe I might go with him [lah] I'm not sure when maybe next week
which one the restaurant [ah]
of course [ah] open [lah]
but they limit [ah] they limit like
ya they they limit <malay>ni</malay> [lah] the number of [ah] customer to enter the restaurant they limit like about not too sure <malay>berapa</malay> [ah]
ya they make
one one table [kan] like ya seat of four or seat of two
you cannot sit like you only can like usually people like those <malay>yang</malay> one person [kan] they will sit at the seat of four <malay>kan nanti macam</malay> they don't <malay>apa</malay> utilise the space [ah] they don't make use of the space
then end up <malay>macam</malay> the queue is long sometimes ya most of the time [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> weekend [kan] in #tampines# [kan]
ya the queue <malay>selalu panjang</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> control [eh] ya ya

ya
(mmhmm)
ambassador
ya
[ah] true [ah]
I think just make sure like everyone just follow [ah] cause now nowadays people like
ya [lah] you see like in at <malay>apa</malay> shopping mall like it's those crowded [kan] nowadays <malay>macam susah nak</malay> control [ah]
but but how do you want to like the is it they got come on to let in is it began when it's too many
ya I think they will just monitor [lah] this <malay>apa</malay> maybe there's someone
watching the <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] they have their own
ya maximum occupancy also but I don't think there's sensor there's sensor <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> detect
ya
check out [lah] don't check out [lah] ya it's very difficult to <malay>ni</malay>
to keep track
auto check out
I think possible [lah] just that location wise is a bit some [ah] some ya ya true [ah] some some [ah] some might be insecure a bit [ah] like
to be in track [kan]
trace I think trace together ya trace together ya
trace together
trace together
ya
ya it's good
ya I think it's battery I think a lot complain
about I think regarding the the battery [lah] <malay>dia cepat habis</malay> [ah]
ya definitely [ah] bluetooth ya
through the app
ya I think in the background it's still running [ah] it will still run ya because it need to keep checking [kan]
like the the nearby devices [kan] <malay>siapa yang</malay>
I'm not too sure [ah] I think the the own algorithm algorithm to detect ya it's very hard to minimise [ah] so I think they need like support of
(um) google and apple [kan] to <malay>ni</malay> with the android <malay>dengan</malay> phone
I think so [ah] I think it's just the bluetooth [ah] like because bluetooth will detect the nearby device [kan]
ya this is not this is not easy [ah] because because I think they still updates [ah] they're still updating they are still improving
for apple [kan] and google
are you planning to to switch to android or what cause now you are looking into iphone [kan]
or you still stick with <malay>ni</malay>
Google
[oh]
android
(mm)
[oh] google home ya
ya
ya
who
google home okay
ya
(mmhmm)
yup correct
ya
[ah] ya ya
(mmhmm)
[oh]
[ah]
(mm)
I think so [ah]
I think this is still depends cause google home [kan] they detect <malay>ni</malay> [kan] the surrounding [kan]
the microphone is how far
<malay>berapa jauh</malay>
as long as <malay>jauh</malay> [ah] microphone <malay>dengan</malay> I mean <malay>dia punya</malay> google home [kan] <malay>ada</malay> microphone [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
I'm not too sure [ah] like like what will be the reply like [ah] <malay>macam</malay> default like
[ah] there's something
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya maybe [ah] maybe ya ya the default <malay>punya</malay> default
[oh] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> offline data [lah] persistent storage [ah]
ya
maybe you can try like alexa <malay>ke</malay>
like
ya amazon products
ya
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I I think I not too sure also because never really use these kind of products
<malay>tapi</malay> but then it just think of us like their <malay>lagipun</malay> singapore is moving into smart nation [kan] so at certain points at certain [ah] zone for example I think #punggol# <malay>ke</malay> #sengkang# [eh]
like #punggol# [kan] there's there's a lot of flat [kan] so I think these flats <malay>dia orang ada</malay> their own smart <malay>punya apa</malay> devices [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] smart light smart oven smart like most of the most of the devices in in our in our house is
like smart [lah] basically so <malay>bila macam masuk bilik</malay>
I think not too sure [ah] like they have their own ya they have their own brand [ah] I'm not not sure what brand is that [ah]
maybe maybe they collaborate (hmm)
I think there might be [lah] not too sure like
for example smart light you enter a room [kan] <malay>nanti dia macam</malay> the intensity <malay>akan</malay> increase [ah]
as we walk into <malay>macam tu</malay> example [jer] [lah]
so <malay>tak payah tekan butang ke apa</malay>
I think they have [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
ya <malay>macam ada</malay> sensor [kan]
[ah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah] <malay>iya</malay> [lah]
ya ya ya true true
and also I think most of the things in our house [ah] like or what like
ya
ya because
because now like I think the manually the manual one I think we saw in different country [kan] <malay>dia kat</malay> india [eh]
they use leg
<malay>pakai kaki untuk tekan butang dia</malay>
[ah] pedal pedal ya so they have to use
(uh) our hand [lah] our hand to press the button
ya there's some country use that [ah] <malay>macam</malay> pedal <malay>ke apa</malay>
ya
I think in singapore <malay>ada</malay> some building [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> like if inside the lift <malay>takde</malay> button
only <malay>kat luar</malay> [jer]
#paya lebar# ya I saw I went to #paya lebar#
[oh]
ya ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya ya ya

K
<malay>hari kita nak berbual pasal</malay>
what type of superpowers would you like to have
if you were to have one [lah]
so I think you can start first [ah]
why batman and iron man specifically
so it's not a natural superpower
it's a man-made superpower
okay
no because when people ask me right at what type of superpowers
that I would want to have right
is like
those abilities like <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] kinaesthetic
[ah] kinaesthetic telepathy invisibility [ah]
not those
like
iron man and superman
ya I know I I mean as in like it's a different perspective [lah]
but for me right I've always wanted a superpower that can help others similar to yours <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you want to be superman <malay>atau pun nak jadi</malay>
batman
[oh] bat sorry batman or iron man okay <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> batman or iron man I would also want a superpower <malay>yang</malay>
can help others
but like for me is basically
[oh] so you want to be able to fly
then teleporting is also good
no it's not a
(mm) <malay>dia bukan dia bukan</malay> specifically target a superhero this is just a superpower
[ah] so for me [oh] ya teleporting [eh] didn't actually come across my mind until <malay>tadi sebut</malay> teleporting
(mm) [ah]
ya so
okay
since you talk about teleporting something that I really want than I can teleport to like
any place of the world you [tau] <malay>macam</malay> harry potter
harry potter there's this
(err) magic spell I forgot [lah] <malay>apa</malay> magic spell [ah]
where they they can only
like teleport from one place to another when they come of age
with a superpower I forgot [lah] what's the the magic spell
(mm) [ah] disapparate [ah] <malay>dia orang</malay> disapparating but they can only do that when they come of age [ah]
if not they have to use the port key or something like that
port key harry potter thing (err) port key
like
an object
where you touch and then it will bring you to somewhere else
you watched right goblet of fire the one where they went to the irish (err) irish mountains and then they touch to go to the game
goblet of fire cedric diggory <malay>yang ada siapa tu yang</malay> handsome <malay>tu nama dia</malay> [ah]
robert pattinson
ya that [one]
ya actually superpowers right maybe magical powers [ah] wait wait but I also I I
if if I
ya I know but I want to answer my part of the question first like if I had a superpower
[ah] if I had a superpower
I would want to have telepathy
ya but
the telepathy must be something that I can switch on and switch off like if I want to know what the other person is thinking or if if I want to communicate without talking or gestures to the other person I can like <malay>macam</malay> switch on and off
K but maybe
[ah] specifically to children [ah] because I really want to know
what the children are thinking behind I think it's a occupation hazard [ah]
like
<malay>budak-budak</malay> [kan]
<malay>kadang-kadang budak-budak pun kita</malay>
<malay>tak faham apa yang dia nak</malay>
what is going on their brain
so you I think will be very interesting
for me to <malay>macam tahu</malay> what are they thinking about why are they thinking about
I think also works for [ah]
adults [ah]
(um) but the thing is that's why I say I want a switch on and switch off button
I do not want <malay>macam</malay> to be burdened
by what I hear which people that are reasons why people keep it deep down inside
okay ya so that's why I say I want telepathy but
[ah] <malay>boleh</malay> on and off [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
ya [lah] but
the thing is on and off [lah] I think every superpower <malay>ada</malay> burdensome
telepathy [ah] [eh] sorry <malay>apa</malay>
teleportation [ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
but it saves time it's very quick
<malay>cepat</malay>
(mm)
ya [ah] but the thing is
you are saving time
it depends [lah] whether you have more time the thing is people I think people <malay>nak</malay> this
teleportation
please [lah] don't cut me off [lah] the the thing is people want this teleportation thing to
save time
so that's why people want this [lah] but if you are not the type to save time then better not have it [lah] [ah]
ya okay
so that's teleportation
(err)
(um) if I were any superhero I think I do not want to become any superhero
I think money
burdensome
<malay>macam kalau duit</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> definitely okay
ya
but money to me do it is not everything [ah]
ya but just to me that
wait
but giving away also you can't give away blindly
so that's why right to me do it is not everything to me kindness
helping others because helping others doesn't mean that only do it you can also help others
[ah] your energy your smile and your
<malay>tolong orang</malay>
okay <malay>apa</malay>
superpower <malay>macam</malay> okay teachers are also have superpower that's what I believe [ah]
sorry occupational hazard K [ah] teachers have superpower they help people
they help young kid
you know young to young okay to you it might be nothing like helping a kid fall down or <malay>jaga</malay> or <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak nangis datang kasi peluk</malay> to <malay>orang besar</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> nothing [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
for a kid right
a kid will look up to you and think that you are a superhero
I think you know
how
our son #aydin#
would look up to us
ya
would look up to us if
if we do something for him then
you can really see
in the <malay>mata</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
!wah! you can do this for me
ya
so
do you agree with me
(mm)
(mm)
all
I think maybe because of welfare
unlimited [ah] okay
[orh]
unlimited money unlimited wealth sorry
okay
wait then I have another thing
sociology perspective [eh]
but what if <malay>naik lemak</malay>
like they <malay>dia orang tak nak</malay>
work hard themselves
they just expect to be given [eh] <malay>dia ni</malay> rich <malay>apa</malay> so <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] work hard so we just wait for him <malay>apa</malay> to <malay>durian runtuh</malay>
okay
(mm)
okay
(err) but I okay [lah] maybe for you [kan]
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
it's something that you think of [lah] but I to me I think you know me as a person [kan] I'm not a person that wants unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
K
but I [oh] something came across my mind [lah]
ya I know it's just
a superpower
with unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
ya
(mm)
because [ah] okay the thing is something there <malay>macam</malay>
I cannot get your perspective is because money is the root of all evil that type okay but that <malay>apa</malay> I respect it's just that I'm just
showing
the other side of ya
(mm)
okay
that's you were saying superpower
since you were saying superpower <malay>apa ni</malay> your superpower of unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
I was something came across my mind ways what if
superpower of unlimited
knowledge
(mm)
I will like that I would like to learn everything about the world but again
might be burdensome [lah]
yes no the thing because I was thinking
if there's if that's if there is someone [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
why you until now right you cannot find the perfect
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ubat</malay> for COVID nineteen like the perfect <malay>ubat</malay>
for COVID nineteen like maybe I would want to study <malay>belajar macam mana</malay> like
get the like
bull's eye
of
medicine
so
wouldn't that be interesting
[ah]
[ah] the bull's eye of medicine [ah] [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay>
cure
for different type of diseases you can
cure for
diseases like
cancer aids
diabetes
and such
yes
ya
vaccine
I think you should make it
free only <malay>untuk</malay>
K the thing is I think [kan] <malay>kalau untuk ubat-ubat canggih ni</malay> [kan]
probably free depending on what type of <malay>ubat</malay>
but also
subsidised
(err) like singapore singapore doesn't give <malay>macam</malay> a lot of things <malay>percuma</malay> free
subsidised
then that [one] you have to talk to the experts [ah]
which is probably also the one with the superpower
but the thing is I
I will make things transparent
ya
that's the problem I think now
no the thing is right
[ah] not everyone
I cannot you cannot please anyone everyone <malay>betul tak</malay>
ya you cannot please everyone and ya cannot please everyone that's the moral of the story like you said
<malay>apa</malay> you your superpower that you wanted was
superhero
your superhero power that you wanted was
unlimited <malay>duit</malay>
doesn't resonate with me
I like and I knew when I said that I wanted
unlimited
knowledge you <malay>pun macam</malay> [meh] (uh) <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
okay so
[eh] so that's about superpower [lah]
how about okay
how about we start on magic
okay if magic don't want okay and then what what do you want to talk about
since you are coming about superpower how about
superhero
ya your superhero was batman and I iron man
one superhero that resonate with me
okay and I'm still thinking of which type of superhero that
<malay>macam kena gaya</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> my personality [lah]
[ah]
or do you want to give me a superhero that <malay>macam sama dengan</malay> I wonder woman
or because I can
that is just [lah]
(mm) wonder woman [eh]
is okay wonder
okay can I I I will start with wonder woman woman wonder woman is
wonder woman is just <malay>macam</malay> too feminist [ah]
ya
ya [lah]
so but she can do [oh] she has that lasso of truth
that can
catch people when they
<malay>cakap bohong</malay>
about wonder
[orh]
okay
about wonder woman <malay>agaknya macam</malay> most burdensome to be heard is
just like the movie <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>dia tak boleh</malay>
<malay>tua</malay>
<malay>dia selalu sama umur habis ke</malay>
ya <malay>lambat gila</malay> [lah] <malay>sampai</malay> <malay>kekasih dia</malay>
she had to watch her <malay>kekasih</malay> die
ya
so
but anyway they revive her
him
it is a clone
[oh] it's not him
but the movie is not out yet that's why I do not know
so the villain made the clone
[eh] then that's boring man
[eh] but they are supposed to
I think they will filming [ah] <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> stop <malay>pasal</malay> COVID nineteen [kan]
[oh] <malay>dah habis filem dengan</malay> production [eh]
[oh] because of COVID nineteen then <malay>tak boleh ramai-ramai tengok</malay> [oh]

okay I think we can begin have you played yours
then I clap [eh]
<malay>tepuk tangan</malay>
okay then <malay>nak bual pasal apa</malay>
the first one
<malay>apa</malay> what's the last one
okay we'll do this if you were to eat one dish
for the rest [oh] my god it's so lame you <malay>nak makan apa</malay>
ya actually it's not generic because actually the the other day I was actually talking to my friend
and <malay>dia kata apa</malay> he wanted to eat ya I told him if we get like one thing
to eat
then he was like ya <malay>nasi ayam</malay>
then I'm like !huh!
like isn't that like boring but then again like you think about it ya you have the carbs then you have the meat the protein
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
it depends [ah] maybe can switch in with like the roasted or like the steam one
#mee goreng# but you know me and #mee goreng#
<malay>terberak-berak</malay>
I know but it's so good I don't know why it's just that #mee goreng# taste
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
speaking of <malay>makanan</malay>
I have this so you can
I bought
so my friend bought this you don't mind I don't know if it's halal or not [lah]
which I don't think it is
this is actually #konjac# jelly #konjac# you know C O N J A C
so it's like a shape of a <malay>sotong</malay>
you <malay>tengok</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> you just look at it first you want turn turn on the lights or no
<malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
[ah] have you tried #mala# before
colleague
no K initially I I don't really like the idea of #mala# cause actually I I went to #hai di lao# we this is not halal
but my friend brought me to #hai di lao# and then they had two
they specifically bought like no pork at all [lah]
(uh) because I was around cause I don't eat pork or don't eat beef right then I eat chicken and seafood
and they were like okay you have to try #mala# they so bad you know like you have to try #mala# I was like what this this this big deal about #mala# [sia] everyone's like talking about it
so then I tried and then
I think it's maybe it's too #kaw#
you know #kaw#
yes
like too strong like that
(uh)
it's chilli oil
yes yes exactly it's the same thing so it's it basically like just chilli oil [lah]
ya
K this one you have to eat it on off the bed out off the bed off the bed
because it might spill I or maybe I open for you [ah]
why you moving that thing over all around
okay K #nah#
try not to spill on your shirt cause you're wearing white
[eh] it's delicious <malay>sedap</malay>
ya (err) okay K ya ya (uh) it so it's #konjac# jelly
so it's basically just jelly
it never says that it's halal or not but it's just jelly basically it's just jelly
but is the shape of <malay>sotong</malay>
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] so that is #mala# this is the most spiciest one
you know how I don't like spicy right
so when she gave there was there's a green one there's an orange one
which is less spicy the green one is spicy is is spicy and sour
the orange one is less spicy the red one is super spicy
but I realized about this #mala# taste is like the spicy is like now spicy it doesn't like linger
so the <malay>tak pedas sangat</malay> like
<malay>ada rasa macam dia</malay> then then <malay>dia tak macam meresap</malay> or like or like <malay>lama-lama macam tu</malay>
ya you know like it will stuck then I will be I hate that feeling that's why I don't like spicy food actually
so this is actually kind of perfect
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap</malay> [kan]
so (um) I google and then youtube this thing <malay>cuba tengok dia orang makan macam mana</malay> (um) basically they open like four five packets
<malay>dekat dalam mangkuk</malay> and then <malay>apa</malay>
you just eat it off like that it's actually really delicious [eh]
<malay>sedap</malay> [kan]
you think the conversation is good
like
they will accept this conversation at us <malay>kunyah-kunyah makan-makan</malay>
(mm)
ya you know so my friend was kind enough she bought
two packets for me
ya so there's four packets [ah] the other two is for my other friend
so I brought it home first
but you see the shape of the <malay>sotong</malay> is actually it looks legit <malay>macam sotong</malay>
[oh] my bad <malay>jangan kena baju</malay>
it will really stain <malay>tadi tadi</malay> you drop on my <malay>kasut</malay>
(uh) (uh)
then don't bother <malay>makan dia punya</malay> oil
you can just throw it away
because
stingy [ah]
<malay>macam apa</malay> what's that word [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>rasa dia macam berdesing itu</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(um)
[ah] okay okay so
was it yesterday that I was working
so the day before yesterday
randomly [ah] my friend <malay>dia cakap</malay> (mm)

in building drafting which is architecture
so I'm like
one thing to the other to the other
and then now I was thinking
about psychology a lot lately because initially I wanted to take that but
it wasn't safe [lah] but like now lately with all the mental stress
I was actually thinking <malay>nak ambil atau tidak</malay>
diploma in psychology and
ya I don't know [lah] I was just thinking a lot about it [ah] I don't (uh) it's been about two months already
ever since the lockdown [ah] <malay>itu macam fikir banyak sangat pasal</malay> psychology cause I want to know like
why do you feel like certain way
at a certain time
(um)
more of a selfish thing I want to know about myself not only that
but I want to
I want to know why people react in a way [ah]
because I see people change and I see
like
<malay>perangai semua macam lain</malay> [lah] not not not <malay>perangai semua macam lain</malay> like people
I know like when you look <malay>macam</malay> if you look <malay>dekat</malay> someone [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] he's not like this but
you know a for a fact that <malay>yang dia tak macam ini tetapi</malay>
like after a while you be like [eh] a he's actually a very nice kind of like he or she like is actually a nice person but maybe it's because of COVID
<malay>dia punya perangai macam</malay> [eh] he he's like putting a front or a defense kind of thing
(mm) everyone is so wary dodgy now
sus yes sus
everyone <malay>macam</malay> sus
sus suspicions
what do you think what should I
(err) ya

K yes I was in exhibition line
K it's getting a bit too personal already
yes I was in <malay>apa</malay> exhibition line but
I thought of like changing
changing the career line [lah]
<malay>nak nak setengah jam</malay>
changing the career and instead of
<malay>apa kerja</malay> in exhibition maybe I take something else so that's why I'm like thinking a lot about
this whole cause the whole of (uh) the whole talk of like career switch whatever then I was thinking about it [lah]
maybe I should should I should I or should I not or is it a waste of money
what do you think personally
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) of course [ah] but I'm just thinking like
it's more of a personal thing to be to be honest it's more of a personal I want to know why people act such way and
not only people but myself also [lah]
(mmhmm)
no like just diploma first
of course

we had to buy the because the roads were cordoned off
we didn't know so I went down I was like (um) #sya# was
that's why a lot of things happened
<malay>gigi dia sakit</malay>
then she cannot wake up early then I was like okay I wake up early I just
<malay>tutup dahulu</malay>
okay <malay>kejap ini bising</malay>
so I woke up early just to see
whether we can go to times square cause I
I seriously thought you don't need to pay anything apparently people can queue to get inside the ball drop
but you have to queue like the night before
then the night before we were walking right was empty
so I didn't know you have to queue like we we were home which was about maybe three people start queuing already
and you cannot leave if you leave you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>nak kena</malay>
ya which is
too far they were cordoned off already
like if you leave your spot means you leave your spot so <malay>macam mana nak berak nak kencing nak makan</malay>
like you have to really have to picnic and it's out in the cold it's like winter it's like four degrees
you really have to pack <malay>mesti bau masam</malay> [kan] ya ya
so I went down at about
ten no wait ya
slightly earlier than ten I was like [eh] the roads are closed
the police officer was like no no no enter I was like no I want to buy something he was like no you no then I was like my friend is over there I don't know where I stay
then he was like nope
no excuses turn back so I was like [oh] shoot then I say how do I get in he say you have to purchase a ticket I was like !huh!
so we went I went online
and then found out there is this bar hopping
within that area
is not in in but it's around
around the no not around the area but is like within the ball drop you can see the ball drop the bar hop within the
(uh) <malay>apa</malay> the ball drop [ah]
and it costs five hundred I thought I told you before
(mm)
it costs five hundred so ya I think it that was like
part of the twenty twenty curse a lot of thing really happened
but it didn't felt it it felt much more of an adventure instead of this whole year
ya this whole year was like a lot of slacking actually inside this room
a lot a lot of slacking a lot of <malay>baring</malay> here <malay>baring</malay> there I clean the rooms
<malay>tukar langsir</malay>
<malay>tukar lampu</malay>
carpet [eh] seriously I need to change this carpet
(mmhmm)
see
#alhamdulillah#
but that's good right
I told you right see the positivity
yes manifestation of positivity and who pushed you
who went around
excuse me he died a long time ago
ya he did [what]
exactly a long time ago [what]
yes #samled#
mister #samled#
he passed away he's a good boy
<malay>kesian abang salim</malay>
#samled# mister <malay>abang samled</malay>
mister <malay>abang samled</malay> that's like
codeswitching
mister <malay>abang samled</malay>
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
like towards the end I never expected [eh]
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
ya
the <malay>lorek</malay> version of [ah] [mah]
I didn't feel as sad as I should be
I don't know why
because I wasn't around for the longest time [kan] <malay>tak terasa</malay> but actually I love him so much [eh]
he's been forever [kan]
since you were like four or five
ya four or five [ah]
until you're like what seventeen
sec five
so seventeen
sixteen
ya seventeen minus five is like what
twelve years man that cat
ya ya <malay>dah tua pun dah dah apa</malay>
but ya no [lah] <malay>gigi yang nenek kucing</malay> is like twenty plus <malay>apa</malay>
(mm) no <malay>itu betul-betul menjaga</malay> [seh]
ya
he had no restrictions he could have gone anywhere everywhere but he still remain [orh]
<malay>kesian dia</malay>
mister <malay>soput itu nak kena sebat</malay>
actually I felt like I want to take a pet actually
ya what's the point right
<malay>macam menyeksa</malay>
<malay>kesian dia seorang seorang</malay>
I was really thinking a lot about this during quarantine
ya but during quarantine during
remember
so it's like !wah! <malay>ini kalau</malay> <malay>ada</malay> (uh) ya can always <malay>teman</malay> [what] like someone to talk to
instead of <malay>seorang seorang</malay>
ya exactly then it's going to be <malay>perap</malay> in this whole room
speaking of which rental so my friend was thinking
should we move in together you saw that house
that listing ya
ya that's why
the room is small smaller than this
yes
I no this is to be honest this is actually a perfect size for me
I can fit like this
queen sized bed I still got a
considerable amount of space to <malay>joget-joget</malay>
or like walk around and do my work here or like
move around [lah] at least I got I can have stuff to throw around like <malay>bersepahkan</malay>
yes exactly so like to move to a smaller space I cannot I cannot
downgrade myself
I can upgrade myself but then the thing is everything <malay>semua sekarang tengah mahal</malay> I don't know [ah] like
I have no idea okay [lah] probably yes I have an idea what is is <malay>mahal</malay> now because
everyone needs the money
but
seriously everyone
everyone left already all the expats all left already so like
why is everything still so expensive
like there's a lot of things on the market but everything's expensive
odd right
(mmhmm)
you want to swap
yes I want to swap I'm telling you I want to swap
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
<malay>panasnya</malay> #ya allah#
then that that that's the thing price should be <malay>kurang apa</malay> should be lesser [what]
shouldn't be that expensive [what] to entice people to buy [what] or like rent
downgrade
decrease
(mmhmm)
I hope it will
because that place looks good
but then the thing is really small [lah]
and <malay>nak itu pasang apa</malay>
a false wall
and then have to <malay>pasang</malay> another door it's going to be costly it is going to cost like more then two three hundred dollars already
then like I'm like !huh!
no not only that he say he wants to do like short term like maybe three
or six months then I was like no only if you are doing this [ah]
for one year at least one year I'm looking at one year and above not not at least one year
one year and above
then I can consider moving in with you then he was like [oh] I was looking at maybe like maybe three to six months then I'm like [ah] okay no way
but it's costly [lah]
it's nice [sia] it's nice it is really cozy like with the lights and all [kan] with the window
[oh] ya speaking of which just now I pass by (uh) river valley
so I was looking at that place then I'm like [oh] my god I really miss that place
I really miss that place
!huh! I miss the outside I was like walking through the whole thing
[ah] that
I love the outside I hated my room
it's like porter room so small
river valley
wait where you which one you talking about
#potong pasir#
no
#potong pasir# yes
#potong pasir# I love the room because it was an upgrade
the outside of the house was like <malay>rimas</malay>
they clean once in a while it was nice
then after that <malay>bersepah lagi</malay> then <malay>rimas makin lama makin lama makin rimas</malay>
the room is nonsense but the hall is huge and I'll always sleep slept at the hall
yes
(hmm)
!huh! when
she cook curry
(mm)
!huh! then where was I
[oh] interesting
ya I miss that place because of the hall and then it was overlooking the pool the huge windows I have this thing with windows [ah] <malay>tingkap macam</malay> best
exactly exactly plus the hall was already so huge
so the windows made it look huger
look bigger huger you know make it look
bigger
ya if only the rent there is cheap
yes it's considerably expensive ya of course for myself
no no no no no no no no no rent a proper room this (uh) this time round [lah] but it's still expensive now is too expensive
it's like almost two thousand dollars
[kan] <malay>mahal</malay>
you can do so many things with two thousand dollars
that's the thing about renting you have to really think about it like I told my friend he was like should I move out or should I move in with my brother then I was like (uh)
you <malay>fikir masak-masak dulu</malay> like from now until february because he was thinking of moving in february
then I was like <malay>fikir masak-masak dulu</malay> like if you move in
[eh] no not move in like once you pay rent it feels good for the first month because you are paying for like something that you are staying in
the second month okay still okay the third month onwards is like a bit like a bit ridiculous because you are like you feel like
what am I doing
like why am I putting this amount of money
to rent
(mm)
but then again it is when like you have to pay to stay right

okay can
<malay>kenapa</malay> mama <malay>nak pergi</malay> #kranji# suddenly

ya <malay>nanti</malay> [lah] next time we go over to your house I will ask mama what she wants to do but not this two weeks this two weeks like crazy <malay>gila</malay>
ya coming into december then my parents think about renovation for their house and the renovation is a little bit of a nightmare
not because of the [tau] but because of the house itself you want me tell you the story
no it's not haunted
not son of a peach <malay>punya</malay>
it is our oldest house
(err) block one two eight is near to the swimming pool behind the hill ya so <malay>masa</malay> I <malay>kecil-kecil</malay> there will always be like sounds of dogs howling at night
ya
then there will also be <malay>macam ada bau tak sedap</malay> [ah] but okay my family <malay>tak kena sangat</malay> [ah] but our neighbour <malay>pernah</malay>
<malay>nak dengar</malay> ghost story
so my neighbour I think <malay>tingkat dua</malay> we stay at the fourth floor so at night I think <malay>pukul sepuluh ke apa</malay> there was somebody who came over to their house <malay>macam</malay> you know the <malay>makcik-makcik jual keropok</malay> (err) they went at ten o’clock why do you open the door to a person who selling things right but my neighbour go and open [ah] so it it was a <malay>makcik</malay> selling cake <malay>tunjuk</malay> the cake all that so <malay>macam</malay> my neighbour <malay>kasihan</malay> then my neighbour <malay>pun beli</malay> [lah] the cake
so the <malay>makcik dah</malay> go off I think the next day they open up the cake there was a <malay>batu nisan</malay> inside
(err) I can't recall the exact time the exact year but I think it was when I was in secondary school around there [lah]
mine was like maybe in the early two thousands [ah]
I think mama got tell a little bit of this story before then she like <malay>tersipu-sipu</malay>
K wait let me tell you the story of my parents <malay>punya</malay> renovation so they just got the key on #deepavali# like after like one month of extension then that [one] also like a little bit of a <malay>merepek</malay> [ah] cause the previous tenant they don't want to give the key to the letter box then my parents have to like repeatedly ask for it <malay>sebab dorang dah</malay> change <malay>dorang punya</malay> address
<malay>abeh entah</malay> [lah] like very #niao# [ah] so after that eventually they wanted to give the key on fifteen of november #deepavali# is fourteen but their agreement is only until fourteen of november so obviously my parents not happy it's just one day but then that weekend is a weekend <malay>yang</malay> they wanted to clean up the house cause sixteen november they will start the renovation already
so (err) eventually on fourteen november they got the key then (um) we went to the house the next day #taufik# <malay>pun pergi</malay> the house used to house twenty cats in the master bedroom
it was super smelly then the toilet was also super smelly we wash the master bedroom a few times everytime <malay>cuci</malay> [jer] <malay>keluar</malay> like black black black it's a few times you know then we went to pet store to <malay>beli</malay> the odour eliminator [ah] spray around a few times I think (err) we went on sunday last spray for the things then (err) I went again on monday
the next day [ah] the next day <malay>bau masih tak hilang</malay> [ah] cause twenty cats [seh] so spray spray spray <malay>lagi</malay> still <malay>tak hilang abeh bila</malay> I <malay>balik</malay> I was like having like a huge headache then (err) eventually I call (err) <malay>macam</malay> professional cleaning service
like they really will use an ozone generator to produce ozone to shock the smell and then they will they use a chemical atomiser <malay>juga</malay> so the chemical they break it down into like super super small molecule so that it can go into the porous surfaces [ah] so yesterday the person came the person it's a malay guy then the <malay>masuk</malay> the <malay>nak buat dia</malay> [eh]
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh] <malay>ni ada berapa kucing ni</malay> [seh] <malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> [lah] <malay>ada ada</malay> twenty cats <malay>dia macam</malay> !wah! <malay>teruk</malay> [seh] but he was like telling us that (err) okay [ah] the smell can be removed so he did all the things and then as he was doing it suddenly he went to one of the switch so <malay>dia pergi dekat</malay> switch then he call us [lah] say [eh] I think this house <malay>ada pijat punya</malay> infestation <malay>juga</malay>
because apparently on top of the switch <malay>ada</malay> colour black black black which is actually an indication of <malay>tahi pijat</malay> [ah] so he was like hopefully all the <malay>pijat bila orang tu angkat dah bawa sekali</malay> [ah] the all the bed bugs <malay>semua</malay> but we don't know whether inside the switch plug itself there will be <malay>pijat</malay> or not so yes but yesterday my mum <malay>pergi dah tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> so I guess it worked but
hopefully the smell won't stay [lah]
ya (err) the <malay>pijat</malay> is at the switch so the electrician also came over yesterday was thursday wednesday the electrician came over on wednesday to to to ask what to change [ah] so we are changing the all the switches also just to be safer ya
they when they went <malay>tak ada</malay> the smell <malay>sangat</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay> (um) I think they hide the cats or they spray something on top but <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>macam dua tiga ekor kucing kat</malay> the living room so <malay>macam</malay> we thought it was only two or three cats right so okay [lah] but end up the cause they went again <malay>macam</malay>
after they got the keys then the people ask for extension [kan] so during that period of time they ask whether can go over to the house to like do measurements for the renovation so initially they didn't allow [lah] <malay>dorang tak kasi</malay> then <malay>dah jadi</malay> my parents house <malay>apa</malay> so my parents <malay>pergi tu yang</malay> they were shocked
to see like twenty cats there !oi! <malay>kalau</malay> I think if my parents <malay>tahu pun</malay> they wouldn't have the house [lah] but no <malay>momok</malay> so it's okay
kencing kucing tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>jangan kencing hantu ke apa ke</malay>
ya
<malay>apa bunyi tu</malay>
okay [lah] okay how's your job finding going on
you <malay>cari</malay> you <malay>cari dekat</malay> which what site
serious
have you tried <malay>yang</malay> those the <malay>punya</malay> job fairs <malay>pun tak ada</malay>
okay mendaki
and as in mendaki sense what mendaki sense <malay>pun dorang</malay> will go to like some companies
!aduh! <malay>entah</malay> [lah]
I initially I was also thinking whether I should find a like a full time job cause now mine is adjunct right but then now my adjunct is getting too busy
or not really I mean <malay>tak ada</malay> bonus [ah] and all that <malay>apa</malay> ya as long as still something [ah] like my dad got a job my dad [kan] <malay>masa tu kena</malay> retire he got a job <malay>pun tu tak dapat</malay> bonus <malay>ke apa</malay> so that [one] is that only contract for one year ya
ya hopefully everything get better
[oh] that time my brother my brother is still stuck in qatar right he had to fly back the he had to fly the plane to singapore so he manage to see his family <malay>kat</malay> airport for like one minute to <malay>lambai-lambai</malay> only
ya but (um) he also <malay>kena</malay> so even though they stay at crowne plaza I think all the pilots the flight attendants <malay>semua kena</malay> stay at crowne plaza so ya [lah] they only like <malay>macam</malay> see each other <malay>bila</malay> my brother <malay>keluar dari</malay> the sky train then my sister-in-law and the ya and his (uh) daughter <malay>cuma lambai</malay>
his family had been here since march so my brother has been stuck in qatar for seven months without family
but <malay>tak boleh jumpa</malay> [what] is in different room so what my sister-in-law did was she my my brother <malay>dah lama tak makan makanan melayu</malay> right so
he requested for <malay>nasi lemak</malay> on the first for the breakfast then for lunch he asked for <malay>apa benda tu nasi ambeng</malay> or is it #laksa# one of it [lah] then <malay>malam</malay> he asked for <malay>bandung</malay>
missing all the local food simon to either <malay>macam</malay> like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
(err) they have malaysian restaurant there but then it's still <malay>macam makanan</malay> the variety is not as much [lah] ya
I am not the target audience
what [oh] mama high class you <malay>tak tahu ke</malay>
ya precisely is what five digit figure [eh] I don't know
okay [lah] still not worthy
because ya we are not the target audience
I I was about to ask halal or not halal
mama very particular [what]
ya I agree
ya but mama high class [lah] that time [ah] she was watching her japan show [eh] at at your house [lah] then she texted me (err) #nura# <malay>masa tu kita ada</malay> stay <malay>dekat</malay> hotel #tokyo# one one of the #atas# hotel [lah] then I say no we didn't stay at the #atas# hotel we stayed at another like the same branch but the cheaper version then she was like !wah! <malay>situ ada makanan</malay> halal
<malay>abeh</malay> I said but we also eat <malay>makanan halal apa</malay>
ya [lah] but maybe let mama stay in dorm try
actually if <malay>apa</malay> right if you just go with your parents type or my parents we could have stayed in Airbnb [ah] then can cook and all that
but the thing is mama is not very <malay>macam</malay> open to try food ya it's like <malay>macam</malay> she said like <malay>macam</malay> okay for example like when she went vulcans right I ask her so did you eat like vulcan food then she said actually not really [lah] we just eat like indian food all this thing then I ask mama like what's the point [kan] you're supposed to go like if you go to greece you're supposed to eat greek food you know but then you just go there you end up eating tandoori chicken which you can also eat in singapore
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> #ramen# <malay>tu</malay>
surprisingly she eats #ramen# right but she doesn't eat (um) sushi #sashimi# [kan]
[oh] <malay>kita orang tak bawa pergi</malay> [ah] #sashimi# sushi restaurant that time we ate tempura ya #ramen# #miso# but not sushi she say she [oh] <malay>tak makan</malay> seaweed [kan] so <malay>tak bawa</malay> [ah] but all the rest <malay>dorang makan banyak</malay> obese <malay>apa</malay>
no idea ya like even the (um) <malay>balik punya</malay> flight she was like she said she eat a lot finish up the food all
okay [lah] some aeroplane food is nice
qatar flight food is quite shiok
I agree [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>nasi lemak</malay> I still prefer the silk air <malay>punya</malay> have you tried [ah]
[oh] my god the silk air <malay>punya</malay> is so nice ya [oh] I think out of all the (err) <malay>nasi lemak</malay> okay [ah] not counting like parents masak semua</malay> [kan] silk air <malay>nasi lemak</malay> is like up there ya but you cannot choose [what] so depends on your luck whether you will get the silk air with <malay>nasi lemak</malay> or not
like people say malaysia <malay>punya nasi lemak sedap</malay> [kan] I think silk air [one] that [one] is <malay>sedap</malay>
so I was telling #taufik# like maldives [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> island [kan] like can you open up one island just for singaporeans <malay>untuk</malay> okay [what]
right so like when the flight come like the flight to singapore come so only those who are from that island be at the airport cause to okay [lah] then the singaporeans can go to that island then it helps their economy it sustained from also
ya like that that would benefit both countries hello
I think <malay>ni kena</malay> write in to maldives <malay>nya</malay> government [kan]
(mm) now is hong kong but hong kong got so many riots okay I don't know whether the protest are still ongoing but ya I it's not one of my to go list

<malay>abeh</malay> the later later [one] <malay>banyak</malay> like holiday people ya but qatar <malay>dia punya</malay> border control is still strict not like <malay>macam</malay>
they allow a lot of people to come in [ah] like people they can go to they don't have to quarantine even people from india they can so what I read [lah] on facebook like these indians they want to come to singapore and
and if they come direct they will have to take the COVID test so some of them they go to first they stay there for fourteen days so to <malay>lepaskan</malay> the requirement of the singapore government [ah] <malay>lepas tu baru</malay> they fly to singapore expert
okay [lah] not expert but ya that's what they did I mean I was reading the there's this facebook group called the indians in singapore [ah] like the you know I will read the bangladeshi community in singapore then I read the malaysia singapore malaysians border crosser so recently I venture the indians in singapore so it's like malaysian <malay>punya banyak</malay> like <malay>jiwang-jiwang</malay>
or <malay>rindu</malay> family <malay>cakap dua minggu</malay> [jer] <malay>sekarang dah lapan bulan</malay> that kind of thing then I would say the indians in singapore <malay>banyak</malay> [oh] where is the class for this (err) <malay>ataupun</malay> rented room and talk about how to get to singapore if cannot be direct that kind of thing so ya I find out that they go through

the five year [one] [ah] is one that you can consider <malay>cuma</malay> maybe you have to do the toilet [ah]
our is not cement
no it's homogeneous tiles but somehow when we went that time they were the only company to have this kind of tiles <malay>yang macam</malay> like a little bit <malay>kasar-kasar</malay>
ya but it it feels nice right
ours is not it looks like cement's grey but it's not
skirting I think is necessary [ah]
ya
(mm) should be okay [lah] ya
that [one] I don't know how they do it but it could be because they customise their wardrobe all that that [one] will take a lot of that [one] quite expensive [lah]
ya true ours actually our renovation company is very good <malay>cuma sekarang dah tak ada lagi</malay> I don't know where they go
<malay>apanya</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] like competition
ya ours <malay>macam</malay> the my sister <malay>punya</malay> is like newer <malay>tapi dorang punya barang macam lagi cepat pecah</malay> ours <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> the door [kan] <malay>yang dia punya</malay> handle is quite solid but my sister <malay>punya macam kena picit banyak baru dia buka</malay>
hers was wait [ah] how old is my niece my niece is two years old [kan]
[ah]
two year two years
[ah] she bought it two years ago
[kan] <malay>abeh dia punya tempat masak</malay> the hood <malay>dah jatuh-jatuh</malay>
[ah] the the
ya and the brand is bosch
supposed to be quite #atas# [hor]
and mine is like some cheapo techno brand still going on strong
ya so if you want to buy buy techno <malay>jangan beli</malay> bosch
ya buy cheap or like you have to do your homework [ah] like have to really read up but then again you read up they will say that bosch is good but experience tell me no
[ah] ya ya <malay>kena macam ada</malay> talk forum
ya okay [lah]
then after a few years you <malay>kena tukar</malay> [kan] ya ours is granite but now got a lot of new new types of counter top my parents is using this thing called vulcan I also just first time I heard of it <malay>masa kita orang pergi</malay> that's why it's like (um) it's
(um) it's a little bit more #atas# than quartz and it can go up to the wall also so the <malay>dia punya tu macam</malay> fulfilling <malay>macam</malay> very #atas# kitchen
ya correct
you you can check it out [lah]
okay [lah] I why they didn't choose quartz that time [oh] cause <malay>kita orang pemalas</malay> they say that granite can withhold heat better than quartz <malay>jadi sebab kita nanti</malay> take the pot <malay>terus letak</malay> on the kitchen counter
#taufik# and I are the <malay>pemalas</malay> kind
granite the good thing is ya [lah] if it can withstand heat all that but the porous I think after awhile it will become porous <malay>pastu</malay> (um) <malay>tak banyak</malay> choices as compared to quartz
they say after a few years you <malay>kena buat</malay> sealing <malay>dia</malay> [lah] but <malay>kita orang tak pernah buat</malay> <malay>abeh nampak macam</malay> still okay <malay>apa takyah</malay> [lah] <malay>malas</malay> ya
mama know that you are coming here today
<malay>abeh dia tak cakap nak ikut ke apa ke</malay>
ya [lah] sheng siong more important than us
jcube have one daiso ya
[oh] okay <malay>dekat sini ada</malay> mister but I don't know whether they will have the #washi# tape <malay>ke tidak</malay>

<malay>dorang nak tutup</malay> the temporary interchange to <malay>pindah</malay> to another temporary interchange [kan] did you read
it will be a temporary interchange again <malay>dah</malay> ten years [eh]
I work [oh] wait before I start working or is still the old [one] <malay>pastu</malay> I work the <malay>pindah</malay> to the temporary interchange and then I <malay>dah</malay> quit work <malay>dah</malay> three years with nparks <malay>baru pindah</malay> to another temporary and then last I read another ten years <malay>baru siap</malay>
at the current temporary [one]
so I <malay>cakap</malay> hillion <malay>dah siap dan</malay> #yishun# <malay>punya dah siap</malay> and then [ah] yes correct I think woodlands <malay>punya pun</malay> will be done before the #jurong# [one] will be done who the [ah]
!oi! #arman# what you doing
really [leh] they say and then the science centre they say what twenty twenty will have the new [one] [kan] what happen now
<malay>ada masa</malay> the fifty was it [ah] fifty they say that by the year twenty twenty (err) <malay>apa</malay> they will move the science centre then science centre <malay>masih kat tempat lama</malay> !aduh!
they wanted to move closer to lakeside so apparently it's supposed to be like the jewel of lakeside you know
ya
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] ya I mean I would prefer at #jurong# [lah] cause you got more food choices I mean it's not like I'm working there still but the lakeside apparently it's supposed to be <malay>macam dekat dengan</malay> water feature <malay>entah</malay> [lah] but [oh] they said after that (err) they say that in the twenty twenties they will start breaking the ground (err) ya
until now I don't see any breaking the ground
<malay>abeh</malay> before COVID <malay>kenapa tak nak</malay> start
<malay>apa</malay> [jer] !aduh! well that's #jurong# for you <malay>tapi</malay> #jurong# <malay>punya rumah mahal</malay>
that's why after the news came out then the price went up and then news <malay>kata</malay> that they will no longer do the the price went down again then now might be up again so the price went up again so it all depends whether the is <malay>ada ke tidak</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>beli rumah nak beli kat mana</malay>
but #clementi# is so ex
they will also want you to be nearby
mahal</malay> [seh] the resale can be like four hundred five hundred
!wah! but three fifty will be like the further further areas [kan]
no it's just too expensive actually [kan] #taufik# and I were like looking to upgrade <malay>ke tidak</malay> [tau] cause like we were thinking [lah] that there was a period of time where mama say that she wants to come here stay over [lah] but we don't have any extra room [what] so we were thinking right should we upgrade to four room I mean I don't know whether you notice but we change our fan
ya we changed our fan we (um) clean up the aircon call the air con guys so (err)
ya that that's the most
we we were thinking of that but the thing is <malay>tapi sebab entah</malay> (err) like that [lah] slowly [lah] ya then <malay>apanya</malay>
we like the house <malay>punya</malay> location you know <malay>bawah</malay> there's a direct bus to town then you look over you can see like some greenery <malay>tak</malay> you don't see like into neighbour <malay>punya rumah</malay> so <malay>nak cari</malay> like really our criteria <malay>susah</malay>
like our neighbours are also okay <malay>pastu</malay> we have like area <malay>kat rumah</malay> to plant our garden
the area is in front of our house not in front of their house so <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>dorang pun dapat menikmati</malay> all the <malay>pemandangan-pemandangan</malay> plants <malay>yang</malay> #taufik# <malay>bawa balik</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia pun tengok agaknya dia tengok</malay> our area quite nice <malay>jadi dia takyah tambah dia tengok</malay> !alah! <malay>tak ada pokok besar</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi dia letak satu pokok besar dekat situ</malay>
(mm)
ours is [ah] indonesian the wife is indonesian the husband is singaporean
<malay>ada anak satu</malay>
the (err) primary school
I don't know I don't keep track also (err) too confusing the kid is at primary four or primary five I think
actually I don't [ah] I don't join teaching because I don't want to be under also
that's why I do adjunct
ya the stress I think my friends you know in teaching career okay [lah] actually the the reason why I don't join teaching is because I want my holidays [lah]
no I want my holidays during off peak period
ya holidays during off peak period it's cheaper the places that I went I want to go to <malay>pun tak</malay> crowded then ya then cheap and the <malay>tak</malay> crowded is the most important criteria
[oh] ya <malay>sekarang</malay> parents <malay>semua ada</malay> whatsapp chat right
(mm)
kindergarten
<malay>nak kena cebok</malay>
that day my niece came over but ya she's at the age where she knows how to play already so my neighbours [one] also
<malay>pecah-pecah</malay> but we don't mind [lah] cause we know that you can always put back [what] but those she's always whenever she go to a new place she will become very <malay>pemalu kepala tunduk tak nak tengok orang macam macam</malay> like <malay>perempuan apa melayu terakhir</malay> [eh]
so that's why <malay>bawa dia</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi</malay> wash hands <malay>semua pastu keluar dia nampak</malay> lego [jer] <malay>terus macam</malay> hundred and eighty degrees turn [ah] like (oo) what's this <malay>pastu ambil</malay> then usually for all these kids they will run with my lego they will play with mine because mine is construction set so that it's relatable to them but if they see #taufik# <malay>punya dorang tak faham</malay>
because star wars [kan] so all the (err) <malay>apa</malay> all the vehicles they they don't understand this but my niece she just take [seh] and then one of the transformer cup [ah] you cannot see that it can be open but she knows that you can open it up then she said [oh] what's inside then she actually open up
and <malay>macam</malay> take out all the mini fixed [ah] !aduh! and ya she's also the first one to take thanos we have a thanos mini fix then she take thanos and she was so excited
she is she is two years old <malay>pastu dah dah dah</malay> do a lot of things [lah] then start riding a bicycle [oh] <malay>dah</malay> can understand a lot [ah] [oh] she can <malay>baca ayat kursi</malay> also
ya
ya <malay>kalau dekat</malay> schools <malay>nak</malay> deal with the parents <malay>pastu</malay> to them they will think that it's okay but it it's actually like not okay for other kids you know and then they will learn from each other !wah! <malay>macam mana</malay> [seh] (mm) ya [lah] that [one] is also like my last priority
yes last resort (mm)
I I enjoy teaching when I was like at the science centre
ya there's no stress they enjoy the kids really enjoy what they are doing because for them they are doing experiment [kan] so they don't see it as something that is examinable so they really enjoy what they are learning so I I wanted to find that kind of thing [lah] but imagine teaching the same thing over and over for like seven years
what's that ya for the seven years I <malay>dah tak boleh tahan</malay> [ah] at least this [one] it's a bit different
better to do different different things then my brain <malay>pun tak mendak sangat</malay>
ya to the point where I sometimes will just blurt out whatever is the teaching content without registry registering in my brain
yes correct <malay>dah hafal sangat</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> tuition like
[oh] maybe I just don't handle stress well
[ah] like you have that where you must make sure the kid improve
okay I think I hear too much stories about the second [one] so I got like a bit scared of
ya I teach my mendaki kids before and they were super sweet
[oh] dear actually why they why <malay>madrasah tak ambil</malay> like the (err) trained teachers [ah]
like now they are together under and so by right when they take teachers also they should take those under and they are not fit so that that [one] I you know [lah]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I'm not too sure
and my sis <malay>nak hantar</malay> my niece <malay>masuk madrasah</malay> [tau]
[ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> so next year my niece three years old then <malay>dia nak hantar pergi</malay> those <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>hafal quran punya</malay> classes all that
they have been trained
(mm) so don't know [lah] cause I think my my sis just that she's working in a school ya now also I think she see the school environment she get like a bit scared so <malay>dia kata takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>dia nak hantar</malay> the my niece <malay>pergi masuk madrasah</malay> so let's see how it goes anyway <malay>baru</malay> two years old [seh]
ya amazing
ya <malay>asalkan</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> education you know you get your your cert this that you can use to find a job that's good enough but these people they really <malay>macam</malay> plan out everything for their children
I don't know what kind of parent I will be I but I think #taufik# will be very hands on he will bring the kid to the garden make the kid touch all the plants ya make the kid <malay>apa bau</malay> all the plants also ya I can imagine that
<malay>kenapa tak</malay> botanist [seh]
[eh] <malay>dulu</malay> I <malay>kecil-kecil</malay> [kan] I don't know whether I got tell you before I wanted to be a farmer
[oh] I I really wanted to <malay>jaga</malay> my own <malay>kambing-kambing</malay> like like want to be self-sustainable <malay>gitu</malay> like have my <malay>kambing-kambing</malay> [oh] sheep sheep so I can like (err) <malay>jual dia punya</malay> wool then (um) like <malay>kat</malay> new zealand then <malay>kat</malay> switzerland <malay>ke</malay> then like <malay>macam ada</malay> a small muslim community there so I <malay>boleh buatkan korban</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> their

the world of the marriage
ya I did but I watched halfway only
cause so draggy so boring
I feel like they could have just settled it within like the first five episodes but they drag it all the way
no [lah] I watched until the end [lah] [eh] no I watched until almost the end
but I think I stopped like
I've got like three episodes to go I think
why
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] like draggy right
ya ya the new wife also psycho
no I think I think she like <malay>macam</malay> because her life
got so <malay>susah</malay> [kan] so she want like
she <malay>tak nak tengok dia punya</malay> husband and new wife <malay>hidup senang</malay>
so that's why I only watch I skip until the last episode then I saw the last episode
the new wife left the husband right
ya so I think that's what she wanted [lah] so that the husband <malay>hidup susah juga macam tak</malay> fair <malay>kalau</malay>
ya [lah] because she fell for the psychiatrist right
she fell for the psychiatrist right the colleague
I think she fell in love with the company as in because the guy is always there for her <malay>tapi</malay> cause that's what she's not getting from the husband [what]
I I think the guy like her that's quite obvious [what]
who the <malay>siapa</malay>
(uh huh)
[oh] is it
(mm)
[oh] is it I didn't see that part though I think that's where I skip
(mmhmm)
<malay>dia berapa episode</malay> [ah] sixteen [eh]
I feel like they could have finished in ten episodes
because it's so draggy
ya
but other than that I think <malay>macam</malay> the korean <malay>punya</malay> broadcasting stations all like their (um)
<malay>apa nama dia</malay>
the what they ask for is system set the standard [ah] the standard ya no the standard [lah] because like if you see
on average most of the dramas are sixty episodes [what]
locked can you please lock the door
[ah] no <malay>sebab</malay> [kan]
like the story line [lah]
ya ya I got bored I didn't even want to finish it
ya I still prefer the old dramas like what I'm re-watching the princess hours
did you put that
no I watched there's a few versions right
I think I watched the nineteen ninety seven [eh]
ya I don't know [ah] that [one] also I never finish
it's very rare for me to actually finish a drama I get I get easily bored
no I'm not it's not about being busy it's I just
no I will like I tend to switch over very often
so I hardly ever like really <malay>habis</malay> [kan] any drama
ya but I keep re-watching like
I don't know I find comfort in watching old drama that I've like watched a thousand times before
ya full house also remember
the rain rain right the actor
that was good
(mmhmm)
ya the other day right I went to the clinic at #choa chu kang#
I actually for my migraine [lah] cause my <malay>ubat</malay> migraine finish already
but then at the same time because the doctor was very nice so I ask him [lah] like if he deal with
skin condition if it's like <malay>macam</malay> he can [lah]
then he said is a malay doctor quite young then <malay>dia cakap</malay> can [ah] but
he will prescribe topical or oral <malay>punya ubat</malay> like they don't do aesthetic services [ah]
then I say okay I understand then <malay>lepas tu dia cakap</malay> but if you want I can try to give you like
<malay>macam</malay> the first three months I give you this <malay>ubat</malay>
which contains like vitamin A or something [ah] I forgot what he said current sixty plus
because he said is not [ah] because I I I did ask him is my <malay>macam</malay> I feel like my face is so <malay>macam</malay> #rabak# [ah] then <malay>dia cakap</malay>
[oh] (err) it's not like <malay>macam</malay> really a severe case so I can still <malay>macam</malay> prescribe prescribe
<malay>ubat</malay> for you
but I have cheeks I have like comedonal acne on my cheeks all the all the all the <malay>kecil-kecil punya biji</malay>
but then the thing is I googled right website they handle (err) severe cases
(mmhmm) cystic acne
ya [lah] like <malay>macam</malay> there's no head on top right
[oh] that [one] I don't know
ya
so they referred her
but how's the payment like [ah] I'm on I'm on tight budget [seh]
like I don't <malay>macam</malay> I don't see myself spending
but they they only accept cash [ah] they don't accept like medicine or what
ya but but you don't
but yours is not like <malay>macam</malay> yours is just <malay>macam</malay> white heads kind of
you should
you should wash you should use Cetaphil
[ah] you just get from Cosrx <malay>kat</malay> Watsons <malay>ada</malay>
the exfoliator
why
ya
maybe that's because like <malay>macam</malay> depends on the product [lah]
but this [one] also is because
of last weekend
cause I didn't hydrate myself after drinking
is this [one] is cystic acne then after that it exploded but the ones on my forehead it didn't
haven't yet <malay>macam</malay> usually my cystic acne right other than this [lah]
usually they will just be there no head and then after some time they just gone <malay>gitu</malay> [jer]
ya [lah]
but I also but it's because of period
but my forehead I really don't know
then
then you want me to get married to fix this
ya because your hormones balance off [what]
like <malay>macam</malay> after you get you've after you give birth like <malay>macam</malay>
all your hormonal shit like happens
then what you want me to just to clear my face you want me to get married and give birth is it
and then <malay>apa bekam</malay> [kan] <malay>muka</malay> <malay>ada</malay> mini cups LOL what the heck
I don't [ah] I'm trying this (err)

like the <malay>bekas-bekas</malay>
pimple I hope my kids don't get it
I regret one thing I regret right <malay>macam</malay> in my life
one small thing that I regret is putting on makeup too young
I I mean that even if even though it's poly time right I think I was
the very first time I like literally used
(err) foundation is time
my poly first year seventeen when I <malay>gatal-gatal</malay> you know <malay>bila</malay>
ya [lah] then because you remember you gave me the Kat Von D foundation <malay>dulu</malay>
you use the <malay>macam</malay> the high the heavy duty <malay>punya</malay> Kat Von D <malay>dulu</malay> then
ya then you it didn't work for you [what] so you give me then that was my very first foundation ever in my life
ya it's too thick it's so dirty
no [lah] I'm just saying then I didn't know [what] <malay>macam</malay> I didn't know last time there's lightweight foundation and heavyweight foundation [what] so I just use that every time so <malay>macam</malay> I think that
foundation like required me to use like double cleansing or what but I didn't [what]
I don't think I even had a makeup remover I just washed my face with face wash I think that point of time
but it's so it's not accessible <malay>nak beli</malay>
it's only online [what]
no I never use all I stopped already
that [one] I don't I want to either give my friend or I throw
ya
texture [lah]

I feel like my skin is worse when I constantly use makeup

<malay>kalau pakai</malay> makeup <malay>lebih</malay>
<malay>muka muka lagi</malay> #rabak# even though like <malay>macam</malay> I do the proper cleansing [ah]

[ah] your eyes tell <malay>dia punya</malay> movie is <malay>pasal</malay> is a [ah] japanese movie [lah] so <malay>kita dia punya cerita sedih gila</malay>
so like
I don't know I was just like <malay>tengah nangis-nangis rabak</malay> [lah] but then the <malay>cerita</malay> is about like <malay>satu perempuan ni dah macam dia buta</malay> temporarily
and after that
ya like <malay>tak buta mata</malay> [lah] because like he she was like she got into an accident
and like <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
<malay>macam dekat</malay> part of the story was like the guy that <malay>dia suka</malay> or like <malay>macam jatuh cinta bila dia tengah buta</malay> [kan]
it's actually it was was one of the reason why <malay>dia buta</malay>
ya [ah] because of like when he got when she got into an accident the <malay>lelaki tu macam buat benda yang</malay> like
<malay>tak tak</malay> supposed to <malay>buat</malay> [lah] because you know you know
[ah] then after that like it lead her to <malay>macam buta sekarang tapi dia tak tahu</malay>
then <malay>yang paling sedih</malay> part is actually like <malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>perempuan tu kena</malay> undergo surgery [kan] <malay>pasal boleh</malay> actually <malay>boleh</malay> like <malay>rawat</malay> [lah] like <malay>boleh</malay> get better so that guy <malay>pasal</malay> that guy <malay>macam</malay> very poor <malay>tapi dia dia macam dalam dia tengah kerja kat macam</malay> you know
<malay>kerja cara</malay> wrestling <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>kerja untuk</malay> like because they <malay>macam</malay> [ah] couple [what]
so like that guy <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>kerja sampai dapat duit untuk</malay> undergo for that girl to undergo surgery [ah]
then after and then after that <malay>bila</malay> like (uh)
ya so because of that rant <malay>dia bagi</malay> like <malay>duit</malay> to undergo surgery then when the surgery <malay>tu</malay> was successful
<malay>dia nak tinggalkan perempuan tu</malay> [lah] because he doesn't want to like
<malay>sakitkan hati perempuan tu</malay>
and after that <malay>yang</malay> part <malay>sedih</malay> was that like since like now she can see right but the thing she doesn't know how that guy looks like
so actually she was he was
<malay>dia macam</malay> contact later like contemplating whether he should <malay>jumpa perempuan tu balik</malay> or like
<malay>tinggalkan</malay> so <malay>bila</malay> part like
<malay>bila</malay> part <malay>dia nak pergi kat perempuan tu dia kena</malay> stabbed
behind

get into this K pop style of thing it's like
I will not then after that suddenly like this year look at me now
here ya actually like I mean like what this was like the whole year this year I've been like watching just like K drama everyday even me and <malay>kakak</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> also like watch everyday like at the
and then like at first at first I got like
interested in K drama then after that suddenly now I'm like into K pop [ah] ya I mean
now ya
[eh] but then like thankfully like <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>bapa</malay> is like
they don't really care
no because no that time that time I went home and then
that time I came back home then <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>ibu</malay> was like (um)
what is what is that like at your drawer so <malay>berlambak</malay> album then I'm like what am I supposed to say I thought she was going to scold me then I I was like [ah] <malay>tu</malay> album [ah] then she was like [ah] <malay>duit</malay> birthday <malay>semua pakai</malay>

I bought three album for eight dollar
ya that's so cheap then I'm like okay [lah] might as well then after that go like
my group just come back so I bought
a few only then I'm like I mean okay [lah] it's not that expensive so <malay>ni</malay> [lah] I I don't really care I don't mind I'll just buy it
[oh]
by the way right then this past few days two weeks
I've been going to like cafe events I told you that
then you know last week I went to this like cafes called gather the misfits <malay>dekat</malay>
I don't know where is it but I's near #bencoolen# and it's like [oh] my god like I would like recommend go there like it's ten out of ten to me it's like
the place is so aesthetic
like the place you really like very nice it's built nice then it's like the food is good
and I also like the event was like fun I just had like I had a really good time that day that day ya I mean there's like three places I've went one is like #oma# spoon
<malay>dekat</malay> somerset
it's like #bingsoo# then I went to this like plus eighty two cafe <malay>dekat dengan</malay>
[ah] #dhoby ghaut# there
but then to me like the best is gather the misfits [ah] cause like this like plus eighty two cafe is like very plain but if you see if you go to the gather the misfits right it's cool you know they got like the fan art thing at the cappuccino something there made
ya and also like
ya and to me like those type of cafes I actually expected to like <malay>lebih mahal</malay>
I thought it will be like twenty dollars or fifteen dollar for just a waffle like waffle like sometimes
no but like I went to like #haji lane# before then
ya [lah] so I thought it was gonna be I thought it was gonna be like that but then the waffles are only like seven dollars so it was like affordable to me [lah]
it's not bad the drinks also like okay I see that
no it's not it's near
I forgot what is it called farrer road farrer park is like near the blue line there I don't know what but you have to walk for seven minutes
ya but then the place is like
I don't think like a lot of people know because it's like
around there is like factory something like that [ah] like it's not like
[tau]
it's not it's not like that it's not near town all that so I guess a lot of people
ya
I want then after that I look at the the plus eighty two cafe right then their event like damn boring then I'm like then then I got like a bit motivated I'm like [eh] maybe in the future right I want to like
I'll open my own cafe
ya [lah] maybe maybe maybe like I don't like
bake and all but I would like open a cafe maybe like in the future with my friend
but then my friend would do like all the baking then I'll just like interior the like design
no [lah] like just interior design like design the place and like maybe do like some admin stuff about it
but then like it's I don't know it looks interesting like if I want to like
start a cafe but I know that in singapore is like very <malay>mahal</malay> like like you want to the rent all is like it's not cheap
it's like you know like
it's ya
ya
[a'ah] then <malay>kau kalau</malay> also need to promote then what if like <malay>orang</malay> don't want to come so
ya but then like I like those like aesthetic type of cafes like
cool
<malay>tapi makanan semua nak kena sedap kalau tak sedap</malay> then that was the problem fit in the cafe
[ah] they just go there to take picture <malay>ambil gambar</malay> aesthetic the environment elements
that's why I go that's why I go eighty two <malay>punya ni</malay> like
to me the americano sucks
like it taste sucks man
I don't know maybe I'm just not like coffee type of person [oh] no I don't like bitter bitter stuff so I guess coffee you know like I can drink like coffee much annoy cannot even say ya like the other good [leh] it's like

what if
[eh] what [ah]
ya means can give full bottle already [lah]
I don't know because because only until six months you can give milk then after six months you can give food already
ya
ya but the thing is that then like this [one] is I don't know
ya how [eh] when to increase milk
too much I don't know
you see when should I increase my baby ounce ounce is ounce I don't know
ya most babies are satisfied with ninety to hundred twenty per feeding during the first month and increase that amount by thirty per month
until ya until they reach a maximum of about two ten to two forty ya then they say if your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this discuss this with your pediatrician pediatrician pediatrician
ya then they say
when should I give my baby more milk however most babies will drink more and grow longer between feedings as they can [eh] as they get bigger and the tummy can hold more milk most newborns
they say at about two months of age babies usually take four to five ounces per feeding every three to four hours four to five is about one twenty [ah]
one twenty to one fifty ounce four to five ounces per feeding so when she two months then
so ya [lah] <malay>dia nak masuk</malay> two months already
ya so hundred or hundred hundred twenty can [ah]
ya
[oh] ya I <malay>lupa</malay> I need to call seoul garden <malay>bukan</malay> need to call I want to call seoul garden ya I <malay>lupa abeh dia punya</malay> time <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah]

(mm)
(mm) ya
[oh] okay
[ah] okay [lah]
okay
(oo) ya
[oh]
ya talking about her [ah]
(oo) that day and that time we meet up right
then because she she work at this ya A star right
A star so very funny funny story [ah] because (err)
something about because the way the way they how her work is like she got <malay>dia ada macam beberapa</malay> sample <malay>gitu</malay>
like let's say today can be ten sample so you know you you work from
think there's a timing [lah] but the timing is also like (err) odd timing or like you know when you finish you finish [ah]
you go in at this time but they know it's so called eight to five or what whatever but
but if if you finish early means you finish early [lah] but sometimes
[ah] they go off or sometimes
when you work late [ah] you have to finish late [lah] you can go in like you know I can finish at I go in at eight then by ten I finish then can go back [ah]
not that bad [ah]
or sometimes you need to stay back then you stay back [lah] right
cause got so many samples but her work is like two days work two days off [ah] something like that or
something like that [lah] alternate so we and sometimes weekend she has to work so
what happen is (err) I think
because in her team [kan] <malay>ada macam</malay> leader [tau]
so leader leader <malay>nak kena macam</malay> like
(err) <malay>macam</malay> leader <malay>macam</malay> (uh) if got <malay>macam</malay> the night shift people right never finish right the sample so leader need to come in earlier [lah]
to so called finish up before because like if my batch morning batch right I will just do the morning batch right maybe if morning batch like let's say I cannot finish [ah]
(err) I have to like you know I have to
I have to let the night shift know [lah] and then night shift if cannot finish right the morning have to come in early [lah] to finish
so if this is a <malay>macam</malay> leader <malay>punya</malay> role [lah]
so <malay>tapi macam</malay> this leader there's no everybody got same pay but like you in charge [ah] you team leader
so they <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] got one one time <malay>tu</malay>
[eh] <malay>dia cakap dia</malay> she was in the toilet <malay>sekali ada</malay> this leader
[ah] and another girl inside the cubicle don't know then was talking [ah] talking talking like the leader say ya I want to leave [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> like you know
being a leader then have to come early like that you know and then I never get get like you know extra pay or anything
so <malay>diorang cakap</malay> then the other lady was saying like (err) [eh] then you leave then how [ah]
then she [oh] then this [one] [ah] I will ask #sani# to become
but she was there she hear hear hear hear hear [ah] [kan]
but they don't know that she's there so then after that she come out [ah] then after that she like go out [ah] then she like !alamak! !aiya! I like I also don't want [ah] to be leader you know
cause is like (err) say I also new say <malay>dia cakap</malay> like you know why they want to like you know ask me be leader because her partner that is (uh) this indian lady [lah] older than her like master degree and all
but <malay>tapi dia macam</malay> I think the quiet type [lah] you know and like she like so many years been housewife never work
so I think she's she's like more vocal and everything [lah] [kan]
so among these two is quite obvious that you know
ya
[oh] okay but but I think also based on what she like say her other colleague <malay>pun macam</malay> like [eh]
like maybe those like not not not so vocal very dominant one like you know talk softly maybe you know so <malay>tak</malay> maybe ya I don't know maybe <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> stand out properly I think ya
ya but the thing is I don't know I don't know this [one] because they are like contract [ah]
ya contract not staff
ya but it's it's ya but I think I think I tell her okay <malay>apa</malay> like you know at least you know the next job
you can you can like so called call yourself a leader you know
like like this [lah] you put in extra hours [lah] you know
ya it's a good it's a good thing [lah] it's just it's just that
she's not say she don't want she just like (err) worried that she cannot the perform the job that kind
[ah] ya
ya ya actually but I tell her it's good [what] <malay>kita nak orang orang</malay> ya that's why
ya
ya ya ya
so the thing is like she's not supposed to know
like like like for example ya I want to quit [ah] and then if like okay you quit okay then who want to take over you [ah] #hani# [ah] #hani# can and
[ah] ya I know I know ya
so weird right probably
then like (err)
probably ya
ya ya ya
that's why so it's ya that's what the thing is
so what was the painting <malay>yang</malay> painting <malay>tu dekat mana</malay>
(mm) (mm) (mm)

[oh] ya
ya
(uh)
<malay>sayang</malay>
okay where would they do they wear the the thing on
[oh] #bukit panjang#
moved #bukit panjang#
[oh]
ya [lah] <malay>dengar baik dengar</malay> they they say that now
(err) <malay>apa</malay> [eh] get the <malay>sebab</malay> like
a lot of people looking for like (err) big property that's why I say
like your parents <malay>punya</malay> house probably yes maybe back then it was like that right now you know maybe things have changed
there's the demand and whatever not you know
probably want to look into that [ah] I think but you know but then again (um)
and that's to you and your family [lah] you know
(mm)
ya but I remember that that day she said what and
(um) then the agent that time you say [oh] already see like that so
I'm not sure whether they want to revisit that again and over there
[oh] okay
ya
ya ya ya ya
ya
okay
so <malay>tanya</malay> [ah] your mum <malay>macam mana</malay>
give to
(uh huh)
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay> you not there [what] you should be there I think you should be around [ah] like to hear like you know that time you were around right <malay>mencari</malay> sales whatever whatever right
ya
at least you
ya
ya ya what I'm saying I'm I'm not you know I think the first step what I'm interested in is to know whether the view has changed or not from the last meeting until now whether they are <malay>dah tukar ke belum</malay>
<malay>kalau dia dah tukar</malay> what is changed you know
then from there
ya ya then from there then she <malay>cuma</malay>
like okay the next one okay so now !whoa! really really can sell then if sell then do what you know
(err) at least we know what is the option there [lah]
(mm) so I think what you are concerned that [one] <malay>dah macam</malay> like stage three stage four [lah] to sell like how to like
how fast you can sell that is the different right
now is number one <malay>kita nak tahu</malay> whether <malay>boleh</malay>
ya <malay>boleh boleh jual ke tak boleh jual kita</malay> belief that can <malay>jual</malay> also is is it really makes sense to <malay>jual</malay>
then if <malay>jual</malay> already then after that then
like you know what are you going to do next just gonna like you know (um) checkout or you're just (err) gonna like you know get a new one or what you know
ya I don't know
(mm)
so ya these are the I think the few things that (err) need to know upfront before we can (err)
and like decide on what to do <malay>kalau</malay> it's not doesn't really make sense to sell then why you want to sell right
then
if it's just like [eh] ya you can
<malay>semalam ada dengar yang pasal</malay> news <malay>yang</malay> I think there is another three families <malay>yang dia cakap</malay>

it's like having crumbs all over the place
last time

I think <malay>banyak</malay> government bodies are using raffle's medical for checkup
I I expect you to go to the one at #bugis# the bigger one
[ah] that's

then for your
next check up you still go back to the same place
(oo) that you mean they they give you to the the nearest to the house
government

(oo)
K never mind like I <malay>dekat</malay> I I can't recall
(oo)
you saw him or he told you are
(oo)
what you mean they have different different team [eh]
(err)
okay [lah] think can you can make it [lah]
ya [lah]
[lah] whatever comes first we you I mean you grab first [lah] while waiting for something that you used to do
[lah]
later the zoom
you do alone [eh] I I don't need to join you okay
it's so <malay>leceh</malay>
<malay>malas</malay> [lah] <malay>nak buat</malay> zoom zoom <malay>ni</malay> I'm not comfortable [lah] <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>nanti</malay> I keep looking at the teacher while I <malay>dah tak tahu nak tanya apa lagi dekat</malay> teacher #nadia#
just like sad that her malay teacher <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>cikgu melayu dia cikgu</malay> #hafizah# <malay>dah tak ada</malay> [ah]
I really expect her to stay till she's taking her she's a very good malay teacher
(err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is there [lah] definitely she's
the first to teach (err) #tasha#
but I believe <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# will still teach the lower lower primary because that's how he can
get the malay students to love
malay
like one of the parents was mentioning the other day I say <malay>cikgu</malay> #suhanis# is a good starting point for kids to understand malay and then <malay>cikgu</malay> #iza# make it more interesting
he makes kids love malay through music through fun he make it fun he make it very fun
and
when #nadia# is in P three (err) <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# she's lucky because she knows <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# even before she started
[ah] teaching her so <malay>cikgu</malay> #hafiza# already know what kind of students she is how how she is how determined she is when she want something
so that's why I think it's a great loss (err) and she's there I think according to #tasha# it's like what she's only there for three years
so #tasha# was the first batch that she thought
last time
she's the lucky one [lah]
(uh)
#tasha# is
he six no that was like two years ago no only she's not check three yet no
#tasha# is the first batch she teach three years [lah]
three years [eh] five years
ya initially #tasha# doesn't like her [what]
but in the end
[a'ah] see
her class [what]
almost everybody got A and A star
I only worry is #nadia# she pick and choose
when when the teacher she <malay>tak suka</malay>
it will affect her this what I notice [ah]
see like the I mean not <malay>apa</malay>
(um) <malay>dia punya</malay> prefect <malay>punya tu</malay>
headmistress
she's like
trying to avoid I guess
next year is gonna be heavier for her
ya she needs to move around [lah]
because I think
because of COVID then she cannot join her dance [eh] her dance I think if she started she would enjoy it like how her <malay>kakak</malay>
#tasha# #tasha# also [what]
at first I don't think she would love dancing I mean
the moment she start she cannot stop
at least she got two to her <malay>ni</malay> to her name
which now you don't expect her to dance [lah] she's got no interest already
#nadia# my my worry is what what else other than adventure club if she can't then she is she gonna what stick to they're gonna have this thing like like now
I doubt so right
like sports already can start then I think the rest should start already right
what's the sports that you wanted her to join or her teacher wanted her to join
rugby
what's that (oo) tag rugby
(oo) touch rugby tag rugby
ya <malay>dia suka panjat-panjat</malay> [pe] <malay>banyak</malay> [pe] they go hiking and everything but then <malay>sekarang</malay>
sounds fun
I think that day when she try out the lego not lego [ah] the robotic thing so she she kind of like it right
ya she's she needs to be active [lah] she is like she is active since young so
she's the one <malay>yang</malay> climbing all over the place
she's daring [lah] she she has the confidence
can [lah] let her try [lah]
this cycling also let her
in the store
individual no
I still the store [lah] #tasha# #tasha# hardly use it last time
ya we have a park downstairs to play let her try downstairs [lah]
no need to go so far
there we have grass patch if not
we have the whole set [what] knee pad
elbow pad helmet it is just that I don't know whether the I mean it should still be okay [lah]
it belongs to #tasha# or belongs to her
then it should be able to [lah] and #tasha# use
should be [lah] it's kids size [what]
no not motivated she's more of peer pressure people know how to do she must know
[eh] she's she's that kind of person that
that's why she's in certain class which is I find it's good when her classmates are like that so she put pressure on herself
<malay>tak boleh</malay> loose out <malay>ke dia</malay>
<malay>dia takleh kalah</malay> you understand or not
<malay>dia</malay>
that's why <malay>dia main</malay> game <malay>dia tak boleh kalah dia nak menang</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>dah</malay> I <malay>rasa dah</malay> better [lah] <malay>sekarang dia dah dah dah boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>dulu tak boleh kalah dulu macam</malay> #iman# <malay>main nak menang</malay>
<malay>kalah nangis</malay>
(err) going #bishan# on friday
I need to pass my sister all her stuff

the boys yesterday refuse they took only coco crunch I think they finished up the whole batch [ah]
the whole box
try try not to give so much [ah] they're coughing
#haris# #haris# #haris# coughing
but I think it sounds better to last night I think I didn't hear <malay>sangat</malay>
<malay>semalam</malay> I think <malay>dah kurang</malay> [ah]
<malay>nasib nasib baik dia orang suka minum</malay> they they <malay>dia orang minum air putih</malay>
so I'm not worried they drink a lot of plain water and when they cough they look for water which is good
very discipline very good my boys are good
I just told you to cut down on chocolate you want to give them nutella
up to you [lah] see what they want to eat
he eat breakfast [lah]
don't know why I'm meeting her also I think for her to message I'm meeting her at waterway [lah] but she haven't message me
I think she's coming from #sengkang# I don't know whether she's bringing her son along later <malay>si</malay> #mas# <malay>ni</malay>
#peck seah# P six
so that's why that day she message me asking me when do I start when do we start (err) preparing P six I say when you are in P five the teacher will start torturing the kids to not torture but they start to prepare the kids for P six and P five is the most crucial time [lah] the where all the
a extra classes are and homeworks and homeworks and homeworks
and then up to half a year of P six and then by the time after second half of the year you see the teachers all start to slow down more on motivational motivate motivate the student is more on mind [ah] if you ask me
let them not tell them to relax but
they've prepared so much so half a year later <malay>baru dah</malay> towards the end <malay>nak nak nak</malay> <malay>dah tak tak tak kecoh sangat</malay>
then I told her you want to start having tuition and everything start now
<malay>kalau tak nanti kelam kabut</malay> because <malay>kalau</malay> you start only in in in P six there's too many things to catch up
but they have they have tuition [what]
#amirah's# (err) siblings they have tuition
[ah]
I thought #amirah# go for (err) (oo) visit the youngest one I saw the the grandfather was sending her to
(uh) but math class
my only worry is #nadia's# math I mean ya now she's average [ah] but the only subject that I am I see that she might need
to work on
ya
I thought
because the thing is for me <malay>dia punya</malay> the the the problem sum [lah]
she always
she can easily pick up
but we need she needs guidance
and I I think when the time she's in P four I don't know whether I have the time to teach her so much
and one thing is #tasha# cannot help much also with maths
at least science
(err) english
malay
not so bad
I don't mind [lah]
at least if we start her early because we started #tasha# like only in P five
right started #tasha# with five
(hmm)
or unless get the same tutor as natasha
unless get the same tutor as #tasha#
ya she did
<malay>baik</malay> [lah] as long as it's not so expensive [lah] but I think this teachers are
okay [lah]
okay <malay>boleh</malay>
together
(oo)
K
(um)
okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>banyaknya mesej ya allah</malay>
yup can
god
received the message [eh] the email [tau]
<malay>masih belum dapat lagi</malay>
[ah]
[ah] next time me parents gateway you <malay>kena cepat-cepat kasi</malay> I [tau]
parents gateway <malay>punya</malay> details <malay>nanti kalau</malay> you <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> I <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> [seh]
because I only have class dojo
class dojo is like only
<malay>cikgu melayu pakai</malay>
apa</malay>
the <malay>cikgu</malay> I mean the the and #tasha# #tasha's# teachers are using class dojo
find it weird
duchess soon I think double [lah] when they send you parents gateway then I also got it on class dojo
mister #po# everytime I receive message we said [oh]
so that's why I ask her wait your your teacher never [eh] set one set two same so I don't know where set three is
like your what like what your sister was mentioning [lah] during this COVID it's best that they don't change classes because it's easier for contact tracing it's easier [lah] they don't want to ignore it because if not you have to go back and change back then the thing is our the girl also <malay>pun</malay> what like like #tasha# they she still moved around to
other classes because of subject bending
(mm)
they try to natasha #nadia# also don't have any changes
[eh] but I don't know [lah] [eh]
(hmm)
three and four together correct sorry

right
can
[oh] okay
ya
ya so you basically you don't contact them directly so usually how it works is that
(err) this kind of thing you have to <malay>macam mak bapa</malay> [ah] then sometimes they will advise <malay>biasa</malay> [ah] <malay>macam orang tua</malay> they have their preferred (um) preferred <malay>kadi</malay> of choice <malay>macam</malay> they <malay>dorang</malay> have gone to more weddings that we have
then so they have attended more of the ceremony so sometimes they like the they prefer <malay>tak</malay> [ah] <malay>kadi ni lagi bagus kadi ni lagi dia macam lagi</malay> [ah] <malay>lembut cara dia berbual</malay> that kind of thing [lah] so so usually how it works is that once five months prior five month is it five months ya five months prior to your wedding (err) you go online then your date your wedding date will be available
your wedding date will be available then (um) you can
choose
[eh] I think you want to start back or not cause I just realise I got a lot of red bars
is it
okay so basically (err) when you
when once your date your date is available on on the website then you (err) <malay>boleh</malay> book [ah] then when you go in when you go into the website you can there will be a list of <malay>kadi</malay> available then all the <malay>kadi</malay> then they also show like where the <malay>kadi</malay> lives I think or where they the area where they prefer to where is most comfortable for them [lah] basically ya
can yes no problem ya ya there's no problem with that basically the the way they they put it is that because some people prefer <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>takut kadi</malay> (err) they wanted for morning morning wedding [kan] so <malay>dorangnya</malay> ceremony for the <malay>nikah pagi</malay> so <malay>dorang tak nak macam kadi takut</malay> jam so <malay>kalau katakan</malay> they wanted to have a eight
(um) ceremony [kan] then after that [oh] nine ceremony then <malay>katakan</malay> they scared [oh] if the <malay>kadi tinggal</malay> #pasir ris# then my ceremony is in #jurong# <malay>dorang takut kadi datang</malay> jam you know that kind of thing so sometimes people prefer if they don't have as a preferred (err) they don't have a preferred (err) <malay>kadi</malay> sometimes they prefer to choose someone that lives nearby [ah] so so that that's how some people choose that's why the the where the <malay>kadi punya tak</malay>
what's that called where he lives is also (err) stated on the website ya so but usually what we do is we we you like you can actually go down now you can even go in and then you just choose a a random date
wedding date within the next five months and then you just (um)
look at the <malay>kadi</malay> available
then after that ya you can you can just look at the list of <malay>kadi</malay> available you just choose [ah] say your wedding date is in in two months time then you go in and you see all the <malay>kadi</malay> who are available then you just screenshot then you ask both sides whether okay I choose this [one] you okay you okay okay both sides okay then after that <malay>dah</malay> then you can <malay>boleh masuk</malay> and book the once your date is available you can go and book [lah]
correct yes you cannot do it you cannot book in advance but you can go in and play around in advance [lah] ya
ya you can see how it works so what
you to finalise your booking yes you have to wait until the date the date that you want is available but you can actually do it now as in you you can go in and then you can preempt
like for me
[oh] then okay I don't know whether there's a charge for changing of date
I'm not sure about that but there is [ah] amendment there is [ah] basically (um) when you choose (err) your wedding date then you within you can just go in cause what before you you you press confirm you can actually
change a lot of things [ah]
ya so what I did what I did previously was I went into website than I went to check out the <malay>kadi</malay> available
and then after that <malay>macam</malay>
I screenshot then send to my my my my dad then send to #lina# everything [kan] send to both sides then
haven't ya I I so I went to fill up the entire (um) all the details so that (err) being a typical singaporean [ah] we #kiasu# [one] so (err) once (err) once my date is available straightaway on that day itself I book
ya cause I don't want to like miss out on the <malay>kadi</malay> that I want but eventually on that day itself my <malay>kadi</malay> was busy so I got the I got his back up ya
yup
yup
ya
because if I'm not wrong you also you have to you you also have to book a date
when you want to go down to if I'm not mistaken ya
sought after ya
(err) for me is I I think I did it at one on the day that it was available ya ya I I (err) you can ask #lina# for it when it comes to this kind of things a bit <malay>macam tak sabar</malay> everything I I prefer to do everything early rather than than than late ya correct
is it <malay>kadi kadi</malay> I think there's only three or four
then everything else is <malay>naib kadi</malay> ya
ya is it ten is it [oh] okay
<malay>ni wali punya</malay> thing
okay
your scope ya your scope is is smaller [lah] basically
I don't think anybody does any <malay>kadi</malay> reviews last time of course [lah] ya
ya but nowadays I think no one really
no one really bothered by is it I don't know
he's okay [ah]
(mmhmm) ya you don't want to you don't want to <malay>macam yang</malay> draggy draggy until <malay>macam kasi</malay> trauma that kind of thing [kan]
(mm) sometimes they they they they they drag all the ceremony and everything like then like the thing is like if like I I understand cause <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> the <malay>orang yang datang tak semua</malay> islam
you know [kan] that's that's one thing that for me also cause <malay>macam</malay> my groomsmen I have about four who are non-muslim so like if you were to have a extended (err) <malay>nikah</malay> ceremony with all the <malay>dua</malay> and everything with all the <malay>ceramah</malay> everything and then it makes it uncomfortable for some of them [lah]
that's one thing also but
ya you need like sometimes you want a a good <malay>kadi</malay> but then sometimes you don't want someone who
doesn't know how to read the situation and drags on like you know ya things like that [lah] but
I think I think it doesn't really matter I mean
I think I think the okay when it comes to <malay>kadi</malay> they you won't get in contact with them directly with the person that you choose directly until probably one week before
cause okay
put yourself in their shoes [lah] <malay>macam dorang</malay>
<malay>setiap minggu ada nikah</malay> to do
so if five months out you book then they contact you they have like five times four
times how many weddings in the day you know that kind of thing like (err) like they're they're very busy [lah] so you have too many people to to to contact so but usually one month to two weeks before I think they will contact you
they will message you and then he will they usually the <malay>kadi</malay> will will for what happened to me was he he created a group a WhatsApp group chat
so included me and #alina#
why he did that was basically just to <malay>macam ingatkan</malay> (err) remind you to <malay>bawa</malay> your (err) <malay>bawa</malay> then documents that you need to bring [lah] basically and then (um) some time then (err) he will contact me or give you a he contacted me via WhatsApp [lah] he ask me whether I knew what to say and everything then for me I told him I (um)
I told him I wasn't he ask me whatever I was nervous and whether I know what to say [lah] then I say <malay>tak</malay> [ah] (err) <malay>banyak</malay> members <malay>dah kahwin</malay> then I used to be I I'm their their groomsman and everything so <malay>macam apa nak cakap</malay> and everything all I got it down [lah]
no need to worry but for some of my friends some <malay>kadi</malay> will give you a call the night before then ask you to practise on the phone
what you're supposed to say ya
so
ya <malay>ke</malay> but like what I say when it when it happens to me I think I think you you remember I forgot that there was a reading part
they have to read that the the the script [ah] (err) post post <malay>nikah</malay> ya ya no stress also ya but when I read cause I'm I'm I I I I'm not very fluent in in (err) like when when you're supposed to talk in an extended malay or read an extended malay I I tend to fall back to <malay>baku</malay> ya I I cause we all we all grew up you know secondary school <malay>macam kau</malay> primary school your oral have to be <malay>baku</malay> [kan] ya exactly
ya cause I I grew up in a very english
speaking environment and so ya
with different [lah]
okay so the initial the initial <malay>kadi</malay> that we chose (um) on that day he was unable one month before he said he was unable to come on that weekend because he was he had a family gathering family event so he said he asked his best friend or his his colleague [lah] basically to take over so that colleague was there was when that colleague contacted me two weeks before
ya I've not met that guy before [lah] basically ya ya the <malay>kadi</malay> before but basically then he just give me a call and then ya (um) but when it comes to your situation itself right once you book the <malay>kadi</malay> that you want and then set a date with
then <malay>turun</malay> [ah] <malay>turun</malay> (err) on whichever date that (err) you guys have agreed upon and during the interview itself then you can tell the <malay>kadi</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] (err) <malay>tunang saya bapa bukan</malay> islam then <malay>dia tanya</malay> like things of like how what is what's (err) (um) [lah] what what you do you need to do what are the things that needs to be covered during the ceremony to make it legit [lah] basically ya
yes
ya so basically I say for example today you check right then you check out the
the latest date you can book
then if you want to be safe
you just choose like a random wednesday or thursday [ah] you just click on the website then just click click click click all the way then before submit then you [oh] close the window
ya things like that [lah] but for me is like I just wanted to see what I need
ya there's a submit button ya correct it won't go through yup so basically for me it was because
I wanted to get the <malay>kadi</malay> that I want cause that's one that my dad ask me to get right so
I didn't want to get that time slot lose out that time slot for that one <malay>kadi</malay> that I wanted so I went in and then went to fill up the whole form then after that <malay>macam</malay>
cause I wanted I want to to know what I need ready ya so <malay>macam</malay> on the day itself if you need to do then [oh] <malay>semua dah siap</malay>
(um)
I forgot how it how the time slot is I think it's a two hour time slot if I'm not wrong
if I'm not mistaken it was a two hour time slot so it was it goes like eight to ten ten to twelve
that kind of thing ya
ya hot [lah] ya but for me it was I chose the [eh] no I chose ten to twelve ya
ten to twelve ya
(um) I would say a lot of people <malay>nikah</malay> on saturday
a lot of people actually <malay>nikah</malay> on saturday and then wedding on sunday as in the typical if you want to talk about the people who do separate (err) double weddings I mean now is different but but
when my friends all got married previously all a lot of them got married <malay>nikah</malay> on a saturday and then wedding on a sunday ya
(um) ya so but nowadays people do it all in one day so it's different [ah] (mm) different [ah]
!wah! I don't remember whether there's any charges [eh]
<malay>tak ingat</malay>
okay okay
don't need [one] not necessary [ah] they won't they won't try to pressure you okay okay if
<malay>nak kena faham</malay> I mean from their point of view is necessary [lah] for people to for couples to be <malay>macam</malay> (err) ready I mean all these is like (err) basic <malay>rumahtangga punya</malay> knowledge [ah] right for them to know about like some of my friends went and then they talk about how to manage your finance as a couple what
like what is (um) it's it's I would say it's
maybe twenty percent religious based eighty percent
(um) civics you know like to for you to understand like [oh] if I do this what my in-laws think you know that kind of thing if I if I handle money this way what would my wife think that kind of thing [lah] ya it it it's it's it's more of that and then they have a lot of <malay>macam</malay> very open conversations [lah] but I find it a waste of time for me personally
ya so I told them (err) I I've got work [lah] they will they will still will pressure you then [oh] but we have classes on weekend and I just told them ya I work weekends and weekdays
so okay so when you go in no no it's when you go in then after you do the interview with the the head of
is not with the is not you don't interview with your <malay>kadi</malay> ya you do with with (err) the the head <malay>kadi</malay> who is in charge of everyone so he will interview every single person
ya so then you have
and the <malay>wakil</malay> from the bride
as in not not necessarily <malay>wakil</malay> [lah] as in just a representative for the girl side
so for me is I I brought <malay>mak</malay> [ah]
you can ask the mother
I mean like it will be better [lah] right like you don't need to be it doesn't need to be a guy cause I brought <malay>mak</malay> so ya
ya then you just bring the parents ya
ya ya so that's the one where they will interview basically I guess the point of the interview is to see whether <malay>macam</malay>
whether it's a forced marriage you know that kind of thing ya so he went on to say like are you willing like is this out of willingness what's the purpose of you getting married you know the kind of thing ya (err) then he <malay>banyak soalan juga</malay> they will you're in there for about ten fifteen minutes I would say at least
ya
you don't really you don't have a conversation with <malay>kadi</malay> until like two weeks before your wedding
the head of the guy who is in charge of all the <malay>kadi</malay>
that is after so so basically okay once you reach you have to do registration and everything [kan] submit your papers then they will give you a queue number then once your queue number is ready you go inside this room and then this room is where the the head of (err) the the <malay>ustaz</malay> is there [lah] he will question you some questions whether are you born muslim I think that's a that kind of things [lah] I think those those those are some of the questions that he asked and <malay>lepas tu</malay>
I think he asked <malay>mak</malay> some questions then ask #lina# some questions and then
once it's all that okay and then ya then you go out when you are leaving the room and there will be like two <malay>kakak</malay> there will be asking you <malay>macam awak awak kahwin kahwin kita ada</malay> marriage prep <malay>ni</malay> [eh] (err) <malay>apa</malay> for you to go and then you like [oh] and !alamak! <malay>ni saya bila</malay> [lah] then for me right what happened to me was like <malay>dorang cakap ni awak dengan tunang awak boleh</malay> sign up <malay>ni bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>macam</malay> very informative and everything [lah] they were saying all the like like they a give long speech about it I said I'm too busy [ah] so then after that then they will shut up
I don't know whether it's free or you have to pay I'm not sure is it I don't know so I the thing is I didn't even bother to go because a lot of my colleagues and my even my aunties are telling me it's
not necessary they have not gone before initially I thought was compulsory
cause I got a few friends who went a lot a few or no no no you very long time ago ya I I thought it's quite recent also until my colleague she say <malay>aku dah kahwin lima belas tahun tak pernah pergi</malay> [ah] that's why I thought was compulsory I think is just a exactly so I I think right is all <malay>macam</malay> a propaganda kind of thing like <malay>semua kena pergi</malay> you know like kind of thing <malay>kena pergi</malay> like you know how how the the language malay the malay language is like that where they want you to like you should go they would use the word <malay>kena</malay> you know is like <malay>kau kena pergi</malay>
[ah] you know like like cause like typical (err) like <malay>pasar melayu</malay> they will like say [eh] <malay>kau kena pergi</malay> [tau] <malay>ni</malay>
but that word everybody thinks that [oh] it's compulsory but actually what do they mean by you what they mean is that you should go not you must go that kind of thing ya
but the in malay is both we will usually use the word <malay>kena</malay> anyway ya so I think that's how it it spiral out of control then make a lot people think is compulsory but the thing is it has never been compulsory because it's not part of of (err) islamic laws [what] for you to to go through a course
ya so I did I cause when when it when when it came to my marriage I told #alina# <malay>macam</malay> I want to cut out all a lot of the non compulsory things in in our marriage [lah] I mean to cut down all the cost [lah] basically like I was telling things things like like <malay>dulang</malay> it's not compulsory you know things like that then (um) a lot of the other things [lah] like red wedding cake [lah] the <malay>kompang</malay> [lah] all this kind of thing all not compulsory no didn't have wedding cake
ya
for me it's
ya for me it's not necessary I had the ice cream cake in the end [what] ya ya ya for me it's like cause I I went to my friend's wedding I thought my friend's wedding had wedding cakes
I didn't get to taste like I was the groomsman I was the best man I didn't get to taste the wedding cake you know I I don't even remember they are giving out the cake
that that's the thing
some of them had the three one of my friend had a three tiered cake I don't think I've tried the cake like and and and okay is different like when you have a non a a non traditional malay wedding where the one is seated and if you have a hotel with an itinerary everyone watch [oh] now it's a couple's video like you know if it's if it's if it's a seated wedding a a wedding cake make sense
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>semua orang duduk</malay> [kan] and <malay>semua orang boleh tengok macam</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tengah potong</malay> cake (err)
you know but if you have a typical wedding <malay>macam kita semua macam orang semua tengah ambil makan</malay> buffet [kan] <malay>dorang jalan ambil makan</malay> everything [kan] a lot of the times my friend <malay>potong</malay> cake <malay>orang kat belakang tak tahu</malay> then like for me is that okay for some of them it all depends like I said it all depends on the couple [lah] some couples
is a is a western is a western tradition ya so some people some people say [oh] I don't cut for everybody to say I cut for me and my wife for that special moment I get it <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>aku faham</malay> but for some people they want to make sure that all the guest see you know <malay>macam</malay> if you are if you are the kind of person that you want to have a wedding cake and you want everyone to see cause your wedding cakes are not going to be cheap
wedding cakes is at least at least a few hundred dollars ya so if you want it to to look nice and then everyone see but then like if half of your all your guests don't even see it then what's the point [kan]
(mm) dummy cake ya correct there just like one slice is here but I I would say (err) like
it it defeat to me [lah] it there's no point to the whole to that whole part of it [lah] like even
ya a lot a lot of part of the way cause I I I was the best man for three of my friends wedding
ya cause they know I I am <malay>degil</malay> usually [lah] when it comes to malay weddings right a lot of the time more often than not the <malay>dia punya mak andam suka</malay> control
<malay>mak andam</malay> is the the the the bride's (err) makeup artist [lah] ya okay but when it comes to makeup artist is different [leh] like #lina# makeup artist makeup <malay>jalan mak andam</malay> is the kind who will stick with the bride the whole day that kind so a lot of the my colleagues at my my friend my wife (err) one of them <malay>pakai</malay> scarf so the whole day the <malay>mak andam</malay> there <malay>betulkan</malay> scarf <malay>dia</malay> then the other one (err) what's that called makeup then everything <malay>betulkan</malay> makeup <malay>dia</malay> everything [kan] so
all my all my friends are guys so I'm always on the groom's side
so then the groom's side don't have <malay>pak andam</malay> (err) I don't know I think it's called <malay>pak andam</malay> ya they now now nowadays they have nowadays they they insist
some of them insist then because yes correct so (um) the the girl the they they rent the <malay>baju</malay> [kan] they rent the <malay>baju</malay> then they would they <malay>kain samping</malay> they ask <malay>pak andam</malay> it's all part of money making process [lah]
depends on how many how many how many outfits to change some people change three outfits ya so it all depends [lah] ya so
(err) a lot a lot of times twice I had I met with the same <malay>mak andam</malay>
cause people you know like [oh] <malay>ni mak andam aku bagus</malay> [tau] you know your makeup <malay>dia baik</malay> then they they the same cause it's all within the same clique of friends [one] then always the same <malay>mak andam</malay> cause they will try to <malay>macam</malay>
you understand where they're coming from in a sense of that <malay>macam aku aku</malay> need <malay>satu jam nak tukar</malay> outfit <malay>untuk</malay> (err) <malay>pengantin perempuan nak kena satu jam satu jam setengah tukar rambut dia nak buka nak tukar</malay> makeup <malay>dia tukar baju dia</malay> one and half hour so they always try to dig out as much time as possible so <malay>katakan</malay> all weddings [eh]
all weddings there will be time time time delay
ya whole day so we so basically <malay>katakan lepas nikah</malay> you plan in your itinerary <malay>habis nikah pukul lapan setengah</malay> (err) let's say <malay>sebelas setengah</malay> your <malay>habis nikah sebelas setengah</malay> right but then you think is <malay>sebelas setengah habis</malay> (err) <malay>pukul dua belas tukar baju</malay> for the next half I can bet with you <malay>sebelas setengah nikah belum habis</malay>
ceremony <malay>nikah</malay> might be finished might finish at eleven thirty but the time gone <malay>macam nangis-nangis salam-salam salam-salam ambil gambar ambil gambar</malay> [eh] <malay>dah pukul dua belas</malay>
then like shit I need to go to the room then you will you really lose let's say you lose fifteen minutes here then you every every every other things right you will lose fifteen minutes fifteen minutes ya you want to walk to the room or you want to walk out with <malay>orang nak ambil gambar</malay> every take one picture one picture one picture you know the kind of thing right and then you no matter what every wedding there will be delays
so that's the thing <malay>macam semua semua tak pernah</malay> I went to any wedding where is <malay>macam</malay> on on the dot so it's it's impossible like there's no point of you <malay>macam</malay> [oh] eleven O five you come here like no point [lah] you want to
plus minus fifteen minutes is not bad [lah] you don't you don't <malay>macam</malay> because I've I've a friend who actually plan eleven O five <malay>kita turun bawah</malay> eleven ten must be down here eleven fifteen we move off then I'm like bro by the time we move off twelve o'clock
really
ya like you for the purpose for all those you must be a bit flexible with your timing that's one thing and then and on top of that you must know <malay>mak andam suka macam</malay> they know this cause they they do weddings is their is their living is their work right ya bread and butter they know how it works so they will always try to <malay>selit</malay> as much time as possible so for example
for me [ah] I scold my friends <malay>mak andam</malay> a lot of times already like like I met her I everytime I scold her because she I know what she's doing as she also know what I'm doing [ah] cause basically like say for my friend right
<malay>dia nikah kat masjid</malay> then <malay>lepas nikah ambil gambar ambil gambar ambil gambar</malay>
then after that they said okay we're going to change location to the they did <malay>kat</malay> #simei# <malay>yang makan kat sana lepas tu kat masjid dorang</malay> to move off they want to move off then after that (err) I'm supposed to move off at (err) twelve o'clock so
ceremony there will start at one thirty
so got one and half hours but then now is twelve fifteen [eh] no no now is eleven (err) at that point of time when it happened it was eleven thirty <malay>ke</malay> eleven forty five around there
then she's like I think we should move off now
[kan] then I need one half hours to two hours you know when you signed the contract she'll say I need one and a half hours to change on the day she will say I need two hours to change that is that kind of thing [lah] cause you also want she she also wants to like make the the bride as pretty as possible she doesn't want to rush I understand that but but at the same time on that day for my friend's wedding [eh] eleven thirty she said we should move off now
then after that she went (err) she she went to tell the groom's mum cause that the <malay>nikah kat masjid</malay> is the groom's side
the <malay>makan</malay> at #simei# is the girl is the bride side so he told the grooms she told the groom's mum <malay>kita nak kena jalan sekarang</malay> [tau] then the groom's mum (err) <malay>tapi pengantin belum makan</malay> [tau]
<malay>belum makan</malay> [eh] <malay>lepas nikah</malay> everything <malay>ambil gambar ambil gambar belum makan pengantin belum makan</malay> then she said (err) <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti dorang tukar baju kat sana nanti ada makan juga</malay> [pe]
okay but that is the girl side my friend I'm the groom I'm the best man right my groom my friend
paid for the food at this mosque that he didn't pay for the food at that at that location [what] how would you feel if after your entire wedding you you didn't even get to taste the food that you paid for
exactly right so I knew how he's going to be pissed so I told I told I told her I told her no no no no no no <malay>kita pengantin makan</malay> then I told my friends to go and <malay>siapkan</malay> the food
she went behind my back again she tell the <malay>mak</malay> the <malay>mak</malay> (err) <malay>pengantin</malay> both sides [eh] (err) <malay>tak payah makan</malay> [eh] <malay>kita makan kat sana</malay> [jer] [eh] she thinks she can the parents would override me but because I I knew them since I was young like the my friend's mum knew me since I was wearing shorts in secondary school the that kind of thing like we know each other for for fifteen years that kind already
ya then she she was like (err) (err) <malay>tak tahu awak tanya salam</malay> that kind of thing you know ya so she cause she she know how <malay>degil</malay> and how angry I can get (err) so she's like and she know that I I'm the whole itinerary is is run by me so then the <malay>mak andam</malay> cannot say anything [lah] she cause she want to turn back (err) she know what I'm gonna say already
correct she's not being selfish in on her end
fully [lah] it's selfish to a certain extent but it is more of like it's for the benefit of the bride I get that ya I get that but but at the same time you cannot
forgo what is the rights of the bride and the groom [ah] right [ah] exactly <malay>kita dah</malay> plan <malay>dorang makan apa</malay> you want to tell them <malay>makan makan ala kadar</malay> okay you want to tell them don't eat you go ahead you go to hell ya so that at that point I I she sit at the at the <malay>pengantin</malay> table then she sitting down there
<malay>tak payah tak payah tak payah</malay> like I no [lah] <malay>awak diri awak diri jalan jalan jalan</malay> ya exactly no but some people are pushovers so she would win when people are like okay [lah] okay [lah] you know
there are confirm people there are confirm malay people who are that
ya ya as the as the bride and groom you didn't even get to taste what you what you paid for cause my friend had a live (err) a #chendol# station [ah] everything like in the mosque everything [lah] quite quite nice [lah] he paid for everything
then ya [lor] then he didn't get to eat that's no way man
you know
yes
no cause cause maybe initially her thought is (um) itinerary wise the bride and groom should be eating at eleven fifteen
now is eleven thirty eleven forty five we need to go eleven thirty <malay>dorang belum</malay> start <malay>makan</malay> [tau] that in her mind by the time <malay>dorang</malay> start <malay>makan</malay> by the time <malay>dah gini gini aku tak ada</malay> time <malay>nak betulkan rambut si dia ni</malay> that's how she's thinking yes but for me is like
<malay>jangan kau tak payah kesah kalau</malay> you if you need two hours you will get your two hours that's that's my point like if the bride and groom are supposed to walk in at two on that side what's the difference with two thirty
for me [lah] is I'd rather have them eat their food ya you have to be flexible [lah] in that sense for me like that's the most important you have to be flexible
you know but you cannot be like one or one and half hours that flexible [lah] you cannot be that flexible but at the same time that's why you as the <malay>macam</malay> for me [lah] as the as the the brides (err) [eh] as the best best man I have to <malay>macam</malay> keep everything running [lah] ya
yes transportation is is the problem to me [ah] that's why I wanted everything in one in one place ya it it you waste time in terms of moving from one place to another yes
ya exactly you don't know the traffic yup you don't know yup exactly
ya so those those are the things that for me <malay>macam</malay> important [lah] <malay>nak kena tahu macam</malay>
how no no no no yes they their [eh] they they might be thinking of like I don't want to I don't want to extend one hour so that you have to pay me one hour you know that kind of thing they don't they they probably are thinking that way [lah] you know that they want to save your money and
different person different [lor] ya so usually but most of them have like an eight hour package and then if additional hour you know one hour plus that kind of thing [ah] they won't they ya they won't delay some even would look give the next one hour free
ya because sometimes like my photographers supposed to be (err) end one hour earlier but then cause he had one a two hour break in the middle he <malay>gi makan</malay> #prata# and everything I told him to go eat #prata# [what] [ah] cause as I say no we we keep we reach we reach the hotel will be late at that time
ya so it's like (err) <malay>suka hati dia nak makan</malay> [lah] he was <malay>kat sini ada makan apa</malay> [eh] you are like <malay>kau tanya aku kat</malay> fort canning <malay>mana aku tahu makan apa kau gi makan cari kedai</malay> #prata#
(err) I got one two friends who did photo shoot at fort canning two did at #bedok# reservoir
ya
ya
yes okay and on top of that like things like I say [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you have to also <malay>macam</malay> recce how much are they charging you for rental [lah] because the cost of rental could be a lot more than you making your own <malay>baju</malay>
yes
makeup artiste
but I I guess right that part I will leave it to #dewi#
like for me I leave it to #alina# like for me I leave it to #alina# on how you want to to but the thing is like #alina# also didn't have experience like but she had she has to do her part to do the research [mah]
ya she for me it's like I gave her like I told her <malay>mak andam</malay> makeup artist you handle you pay
I told her <malay>macam</malay> that is all on you
like how much you want to spend I'm not going to like you know you can only spent two hundred like I'm not going to be that kind of person like you want if you think you need five hundred five hundred dollar makeup artist then you go and find the five hundred dollar mark up artist then you go and save yourself
like I'm not going to make you pay for my shoes you know that kind of thing like if I buy a tie if I buy a shoe is like [eh] I cannot be splitting it right down the middle [ah] right plus I don't need makeup but then if I want to cut my hair I want have a fifty dollar haircut then you like [eh] our budget twenty dollar then you will feel like [eh] I want fifty dollar my problem [lah]
I pay myself [what] that kind of thing ya exactly so what you want ya cause it's not a
it's not a <malay>macam</malay> a combined expense like the makeup part is not a combined expense to me so I told her that [one] if you you find yourself you you going and recce yourself because I cannot tell you <malay>macam</malay> maybe some makeup artists [oh] this is hundred dollars that [one] is two hundred dollars but then the hundred dollar one
don't know how to play with your skin tone because maybe she always do malay girls who are darker skin tone then she doesn't know how to do a light the lighter skin tone her her her her makeup box don't have (err) chinese skin tone you know that kind of thing ya then she she she cannot play around with it so ya you cannot really control like that [lah] ya
for me it's like let let them
like let them let her go and search through Instagram
(mm) salons ya can also you mean you can you can do that also but you can also
like I would say
not necessarily there are people who do that actually who do the like even the whole hairdo and everything and and and and do it there you you that is actually a a a decent option
(um)
(mm)
but but sometimes you don't know how how how good they are <malay>sekali</malay> they make you look like a #nyonya# you know that kind of thing you also don't know ya
(mm) ya but but like I say these kind of thing <malay>suruh</malay> #dewi# <malay>pergi</malay> Instagram go and stalk people [lah]
[ah] you can just search makeup artist or <malay>mak andam</malay> then you just search search search or you can even when you look for photographer and they will always tag all the people then you go and check [oh] !wah! her makeup very nice [ah] look very natural and you go see [oh] it's done by this person then you go click her then you go and message ask #dewi# to message her #alina# I think messaged like at least five to six people on on Instagram (err) for for quotations
(mm)
ya not necessary <malay>mak andam</malay> would be worth it if you are planning to rent <malay>baju</malay> I would say
but at the same time sometimes they overcharged because they <malay>macam</malay> [oh] because it's (err) package <malay>dengan empat baju</malay> cause it's (err) bride and groom <malay>tukar dua kali</malay> you know that kind of thing so they got four four sets of <malay>baju</malay>
but then sometimes like I don't buy like I actually only need the <malay>baju kurung</malay> you know that kind of thing I don't need the second part second part I got my own (err) western <malay>baju</malay> for example [kan] then you don't need things like that ya
yes then they always have but the thing is sometimes it's it's smart to do it with them because they have all the connection like if you do it with their friend then you can you know like if you do the photographer with this guy with this <malay>mak andam</malay> then she will give you discounts [ah] that kind of thing [lah] ya they all have like their full package
of course now COVID nineteen you don't get to go to expo to see all the wedding (err) expo and everything [kan] so it's a bit different [ah]
it's up to you I would say okay so that's why okay that's why <malay>macam</malay> your
if you are planning to do a a photoshoot after are you going to <malay>tukar baju</malay> from are you going to change outfit or not change outfit that's one thing and if you are going to change outfit and are you going to reapply makeup not reapply makeup
ya so if you reapply makeup is a whole new cost
ya because they have to wash everything off then put put everything on again ya
that would be your wedding photography [ah] ya because usually people have a package like eight hour package that kind of thing [lah] ya
yes
it's a good go do that
but you also have to see I would say where you want to do it for your photography
okay like where's your location
if you do it at the peranakan house over there first first and foremost
it's on the sunday there's going to be a lot of people walking around that's one thing secondly if it rains
ya
(mmhmm) can do that also
(err) I guess so I don't know different hotel different
ya must sign agreement ya for me when I when I ask for fort canning I sign the agreement
but you don't you you have to ask hotels like some some buildings even if you ask talk about peranakan place [lah] if you want them to cordon of anything some places give it for free some people some places you've you have to pay ya so it it
exactly ya it is it's not raining and if it wet weather is all settled [lah] I would say
can I mean if the hotel has a nice pool you guys can do outdoor that kind of thing nearby the pool
I would say recce the hotel
(mm) can
I will probably be be booking a room at
the
indigo hotel next door
ya I mean like when you the the hotel is peranakan themed
ya so I don't know whether if you if you want to hop over there to take to take picture or whatever it's is fine by it's by us [lah]
ya it is quite nice also over there (um) on the wedding day itself [lah] ya
as in your wedding day [lah] I want to book the indigo room over there [oh] no need [lah] ya we we we we can because I I am a member
ya so I like to I like if if I if I have an opportunity to book hotel with the Holiday Inn group I always book cause can get points [oh] no need [lah] no need no it's okay ya cause my hotel the hotel is going to be just next door anyway is like one street away
ya yours is it the village hotel and the street just before that is the indigo hotel (mm) no need no need no need
I mean if you want to get just get for her parents and <malay>mak</malay> then that's it [lah] for the rest of us all we can can settle ourselves [lah]
(um)
I would say it's
it's very manageable it's it's it's you have to
plan it out well [lah] I would say (err) okay so basically
you have to see
(mm) yes ya so yes so how many tables you have how many guest you have and you must understand the turnover rate
so the good thing was my
me and #alina# did not see that coming like we didn't think about that but my decor
!wah! she the that that that girl is amazing [ah] ya no no no she she she thought about all this she says I you cause okay every table is extra cost
so if you open one more table is another fifty dollars for example like you know the table and the chair and everything so she said okay I'm going to give you about how many chairs extra
just to put at the front so when during <malay>kau nya nikah orang duduk kat depan sana tapi lepas nikah</malay>
<malay>orang makan dah makan dorang boleh duduk</malay> they still have seats to sit around my thinking was after <malay>orang makan</malay> they can go to the park
but
at the same time you cannot expect people <malay>dah makan jalan</malay> [ah] is okay you also cannot expect <malay>dah makan jalan</malay> [lah] you know that kind of thing [ah] [eh] <malay>kau dah makan angkat pinggan mangkuk jalan</malay> [lah] you cannot do that [what] right
ya it's all it's all my cousins [lor] all sit inside ya exactly so but the thing is ya you cannot expect and everyone comes at a certain time at very early [kan] ya
cause it's a three hour wedding then they also [oh] might as well <malay>aku dah datang pukul sebelas</malay> might as well <malay>aku datang pukul sepuluh tengok dorang nikah</malay> you know that kind of thing ya so ya even the <malay>nikah</malay> all the chairs all were filled quite full initially I thought is like I ready at ten then I was like !wah! I didn't expect everybody to reach here by ten
ya a lot of them were my my colleagues [lah] basically my colleagues
but ya
ya so that that is one thing that you have to think about (err) the turnover rate how many tables you have how many sitting how many seats you have for eating and how many guests are you bringing in
ya so that's that's pretty important [lah]
we didn't walk in
ya <malay>nikah</malay> it started off with <malay>nikah</malay> #alina# seated #alina# seated already then after that I I just
sit down there ya cause we got no <malay>kompang</malay> or nothing [what]
(mm) ya <malay>dah habis ambil gambar kita makan</malay> ya
okay
okay I will say I'll put it this way
if your ceremony is three hours book four hours
ya then if you if you if you have a four hour slot make your your entire thing three and half hours or three hours because no matter what there is always going to be delay like no wedding no wedding runs on point ya no wedding runs on point I've I've I've been a best man for so many wedding no wedding run runs on point
<malay>janji melayu mana ada mana</malay>
ya
the <malay>kalau tak nak</malay> stress
let your itinerary be as vague as I won't say as vague as possible [lah] but pretty flexible for changes like for my for my for my itinerary was <malay>nikah</malay>
<malay>makan jalan</malay>
ya so I yes the core concept is there done so anything in between like <malay>kau nak ambil gambar ni tak</malay> [ah] <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>sembarang</malay>
<malay>boleh ambil gambar ni boleh sebarang</malay> [ah] like I for me is like for me is like I don't I don't want it to be <malay>macam</malay> that kind of thing like for me is like I still got time I still got time ya let's go
like for me I I cause I've I've done a wedding where my friend
where the wife is pretty controlling of the entire itinerary the one I told you <malay>macam</malay> he eleven [oh] eleven O five we must leave the house eleven ten <malay>nak kena ke bawah</malay> eleven fifteen you <malay>kita jalan</malay> then like
I was like
<malay>takkan jadi</malay> during the planning I said exactly who exactly who will follow to the letter and first and foremost you do know that your makeup doesn't take <malay>macam</malay> you have to tell the makeup [oh] you have fifteen minutes to put on her makeup there's no way if she needs half an hour she's going take half an hour
ya she don't care she's not going to let you walk out of the room and spoil her reputation you know that kind of thing ya so that's why they're always very pushy in terms of time [lah] from <malay>mak andam</malay> we get I get that and everything but the same time <malay>macam</malay> as a bride and groom to me is like you must be flexible with your time [mah] you cannot be cannot be very fixated on on [oh] this needs to be done by this time this need to be done by this time the eventual
the eventual result is that everything needs to end by twelve thirty then that that is your cut off you know <malay>dua belas tak boleh</malay> [ah] but anything before that you want to change anything <malay>kira</malay> for me is like now you can be flexible
okay then how is it going to be done like what's the transition like
and you must also understand <malay>macam lepas dah nikah</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti ada orang ambil gambar</malay>
then <malay>nak salam</malay> that kind of thing [kan] and <malay>nak orang turun</malay>
<malay>dua orang gi makan dua orang duduk duduk tengok</malay> the tea ceremony
things like that [lah]
okay
(mmhmm) I would say you don't need to worry about the activity [ah] people will just take picture with you [lah]
can
I've been I've been to two weddings already this COVID period no such thing [eh] no one no one cares [lah]
my the recent one with my with my (err) sister in law's brother we did at (err) malay council
you know they walk through the whole restaurant
I mean that is considering is still during this period [ah] I mean yours is going to be five week five months later I don't think it'll be a lot more <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] now it's like so strict I've got I went to two weddings no like no no problem
ya no problem [lah]
<malay>tak</malay> no problem [ah] no problem no problem I think by by by in five months time there shouldn't be a problem [lah]
no need [lah] okay for for my wedding personal okay but the thing is I don't know I didn't do a hotel wedding so I I don't I I don't know [oh] but personally I don't think an emcee is ever required because they don't have a groomsman or a friend who who who can make announcement that's it
that's it you just need one person to make announcement that's it
you know you you have never there was never been a need for you to pay for someone to me [ah] especially I mean unless you are during an event a wedding is something intimate now [tau] <malay>macam yang datang</malay> members members <malay>kau sendiri</malay> then <malay>macam kalau nak ada bayar</malay> I mean you
no but the two weddings I been to also
the emcee the emcee there's no emcee one one of them is just the the they just (err) okay (err) <malay>dia</malay> they just [ah] okay [ah] <malay>keluarga ni ambil gambar keluarga ni ambil gambar</malay> that kind of thing then after that my the my sister-in-law's brother is her uncle okay would like to say thank you for everybody to come <malay>gitu gitu</malay> just someone to make an announcement that's it ya
I've I've I've always <malay>macam</malay> felt that
a wedding emcee unless he's a friend
if you pay a stranger it's !wah! you got a lot money
to me [lah] personally
it's a wedding no one will feel bored I feel
I have never been to a wedding where I'm like [eh] <malay>kau buat apa</malay> I'm like I don't know I I talk a lot I will just mix around I'll mix around with everybody or I will just eat my food you know that kind of thing so personally I I I don't I don't feel the need for a emcee [lah] I've always never listen to a single I usually get irritated by an emcee who talks a lot
cause for me it's like you do know that that that this event is not your event for me [lah] personally
you know the emcee who likes to takeover <malay>macam</malay> [oh] okay <malay>sekarang</malay> groom <malay>awak jumpa dia macam mana</malay> you know that kind of thing like dude dude shut up
exactly so if you want a formal one then all he does is just make announcements [what]
you can just get someone to do it for free you know or maybe you pay fifty dollars instead of you pay like two hundred dollars for a professional announcer you know what I mean
ya I don't find it necessary [lah] I mean unless you what you will have a <malay>macam</malay>
a company's event and then you want to have a emcee then it it's it's different [lah] but <malay>tak tak macam buang duit</malay> [ah]
yes
yup we we make our own [lah] (um) cheaper
a lot cheaper
but if you want to make your own you have to do it early [lah] cause it's it's not fast job [mah]
yes you have to it yup correct
you have to do it like within next few months
yes people do one year in advance
no joke
like not not exaggerated at all people the most okay the way to look at it is right
how do you remember your wedding
photos right photos or videos
you do not want it to be a
half
half
effort you know what I mean ya
like you want it to be like !wow!
you you should look in look up for it a like as soon as possible people book it one one year in advance
(err) my friend got her
not only malay chinese my friend chinese she got her photographer one and a half year in advance
yup some people book the photographer before they book they got their wedding day confirmed
because some some locations like I think we got our photographer before our we got our location confirmed
(mm) but we book them eight months before
we can only book our location six months before
ya but the thing is like you roughly know [one] when's your date but some locations can only book six month out six months out
ya so so a lot people actually book their photographers and their <malay>mak andam</malay> and all this kind of thing wedding decor way before they even get their location
ya you have to do it yes
it's a very #kiasu# game
there's a lot of bridezilla out there
like it's a wedding is a very
female
demanding event I would say like the the brides will the brides will be like like #alina# throughout her entire decor
ya she she drew and coloured her entire decor how she wanted it to be [what] then she give it to the decor person the person you can do this person yes [ah] and okay we take you
but it to me it like it's a day that that they that that girls want want it more than guys I mean like in terms of the looks [lah] the the the
the physical looks of how it how it looks and everything ya so
but ya photography is important [lor]
photography is very important
I would say you I would say okay it comes to wedding photography right (um)
you wouldn't want someone who can take a picture
you want someone who has done wedding photography
to tell you what pose you need to do yes because on that day is first and foremost right you don't want you don't want to be a cliche <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua orang</malay> pose <malay>macam gini</malay> then <malay>kau</malay> pose <malay>macam gini</malay> that kind of thing you want someone who's like <malay>aku ada</malay> idea <malay>aku</malay> last weekend <malay>aku buat macam gini</malay> [tau] <malay>kau nak buat macam gini</malay> you know that kind of thing then like [eh] <malay>kau ambil gambar macam gini korang geng sekarang</malay> in thing in thing <malay>orang semua ambil gambar macam gini</malay>
yes cause is their job is not you want someone who like does this on the side [oh] <malay>macam</malay> okay okay okay <malay>ambil gambar</malay> okay okay <malay>kiri kiri sikit</malay> okay okay then all the pictures will be like like you know
ya that guy but the the younger guy was good ya yes he's very good
the elder one the one the one I got the senior one was a bit too trying too hard to be professional I would say
ya he know he he knows his angles and stuff [lah] I would say but I like him because (err) he listens to what I say
ya cause okay like (um) after the <malay>nikah</malay> I told #alina# I don't want to take pictures first <malay>lepas habis nikah mak bapa dulu</malay> so parents come up here we <malay>salam</malay> then we get take pictures with anybody but then your aunties came up first
so your aunties (err) came up first and then (err) they they came up first then they straight away wanted to take pictures of #alina# and then after that our photographer <malay>macam</malay> ya is ya we I understand all this [ah] they they get super excited <malay>ambil gambar dulu cepat</malay> before anybody because I heard whatever cause I was standing there
then they say <malay>cepat cepat cepat ambil gambar dengan</malay> #lina# <malay>dulu</malay>
then they all rush and took pictures with her then I was standing there that is not going to with me and her you know is just her so I'm standing there then my photographer then I thought <malay>jom ambil gambar</malay>
cause I for me is like at the same I want the sequence of the pictures to be <malay>macam</malay> okay after the ceremony you're gonna take pictures for me (err) <malay>salam</malay> parents you know that kind of thing ya then after that then we take picture ya that that's the the steps [lah]
[ah] then after that then he he so he your when your aunties were up there the husband to take out handphone and take picture cause you know photographer just stand there so that that's the good thing about him being professional [lah] he listens to me [lah] ya
<malay>tak ada</malay>
yup ya so I just walk around [ah] I told him to follow me ya no [lah] I told him to I say I'll I'll just go round to my my side so I went to my side to sit on my place then I asked #lina# to go inside then she like

mango <malay>buah mangga</malay> any thoughts okay so <malay>bila dengar bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] (uh) this word what comes to your mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango [jer] when you hear mango what comes to your mind the first thing <malay>apa</malay> [jer]
okay anything else
okay

I happen to like mango <malay>juga</malay> so (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango [jer] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> !woo! <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] like
<malay>nak</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam nak makan</malay> [jer] mango [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ini pun berbual pasal</malay> mango [jer] <malay>macam nak makan sahaja</malay> so (uh) first [jer] <malay>kita</malay> (uh) <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango
actually <malay>bila</malay> first <malay>dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam rasa</malay>
the first thing that comes to my mind is actually the brand mango
I don't know if you've (uh) I don't I don't know if any of you <malay>dah pernah dengar ke tak</malay> but
the brand mango <malay>ni memang makcik</malay> I <malay>memang suka pakai <malay>baju</malay> mango this T shirt from this brand <malay>nama dia</malay> mango (err) by the way <malay>ini</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> sponsored [lah] [eh] so <malay>kita ya faham-faham</malay> [jer]
okay so what comes to mind <malay>bila dengar</malay> mango kita <malay>dah berbual</malay> okay so now we are proceeding to the shape of the mango so describe the shape of the mango let's go
okay
okay <malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>buah</malay> mango <malay>ini kalau kita berbual</malay> if we talk about the shape we are
it's it's not a definite shape I can say [ah] it's not a definite shape it's not a it's not a a shape that is
is precise or [ah] specific is
it could either be a it it could be it could either be an oval or it could either be I don't know
(um) it's slightly bended it's <malay>bengkok sikit ke dalam</malay> <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tengok betul-betul</malay>
it's it's a shape that is very complicated it's like
something <malay>macam apa benda ya</malay> shape <malay>dia</malay> so
mango <malay>ini memang</malay> interesting <malay>memang</malay> it's
unique
<malay>selain daripada bentuk dia ini</malay>
okay but oddly
when we see when okay when we cut the mango into parts
we can somehow cut it well in a way that <malay>kita boleh makan betul tak</malay>
(mm) so <malay>kita boleh potong belah dua</malay> we can cut it into half and then we can cut it in squares so <malay>dia macam kotak-kotak gitu</malay> so we can we can eat it like that <malay>atau kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kupas kulit dia</malay> and then <malay>kita boleh makan</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) we slice it we we can just slice the
we can just slice the mango
in a way that we could just
eat it like that and it's it's still
and okay shape it's <malay>memang</malay> irregular <malay>tapi dia macam bentuk yang</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak pelik sangat bila kita makan</malay>
anything else you want to say about the shape
okay
(uh) <malay>selain daripada besides the shape
we we all of us know that mango also comes in
about one or two colours so <malay>dia ada</malay> colour yellow <malay>dia ada</malay> colour <malay>oren</malay>
and <malay>dia ada juga</malay> colour <malay>hijau</malay> so <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>hijau itu</malay>
okay <malay>selain hijau</malay> there's also there's also red <malay>betul tak</malay>
okay so (err) these four types <malay>yang paling banyak kita</malay> like the ones that we see a lot
these are
among
all of this the types of mango that we see
like
usually the the ones that we usually see <malay>betul tak</malay> so
(err) <malay>yang paling sedap</malay>
I honestly <malay>tak tahu</malay> <malay>yang mana yang paling sedap</malay> because I've only tried
a few types of mango
and yeah
but honestly mango is my favourite my favourite fruit as well <malay>macam memang I don't know it's it's nice so (uh) the fact that it's both our favourite fruit let's talk about why it's our favourite fruit
I agree like I don't know I've never tried the red one but
if given the chance I would definitely definitely
will go for it no doubt
because mango once again is my favourite my favourite fruit
so ya moving on (err)

<malay>entah</malay> [eh] when okay when the colour the colour of the mango [kan] yellow [kan]
it's
<malay>bila</malay> the first thing when you see
yellow
you will associate it with a lot of good things because the colour is very attractive honestly I think the colour is <malay>betul-betul</malay> attractive

if we're going to talk about <malay>benda-benda yang kita tak boleh tak boleh makan</malay> there's definitely mango as a brand <malay>itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu macam</malay>
it's like a brand
<malay>yang</malay> quite popular and has been around for quite long as well
so
it's
it's interesting that they use a (uh) (err) a fruit name for a brand because
(uh) they
when when you see the logo it looks quite prestigious and all [lah] because you know the way they design the the logo I mean it's just
<malay>cuma</malay> word mango [jer] <malay>kot</malay> I mean nothing interesting about that but
the fact that they could bring it as a brand and could make it something like <malay>macam betul-betul macam</malay> !wah! <malay>nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> !wah!
<malay>macam</malay>
I guess
that's interesting
okay

<malay>betul betul</malay> I feel like [ah] okay but honestly I think (err)

exactly I feel that
sure I mean (uh) that whatever that she said was right because I feel that
ya you can do anything you want <malay>dengan</malay> mango cause I feel that
<malay>entah</malay> [eh]
we don't really think about
the it's interesting that mango is the topic <malay>untuk hari ini pasal kita</malay> actually <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>kita suka makan</malay> mango <malay>tapi kita tak pernah berbual pasal</malay> mango we rarely talk about mango so now that we are talking about it now now we're really really thinking
[oh] my god there's so many things that we eat that consists of mango actually if you think about it besides mango puffs [ah] we there's also
mango pudding we always have mango pudding <malay>dekat mana mana pun mesti nak cari</malay> mango pudding especially <malay>dekat</malay> wedding

process
that's true
because <malay>kita tak pernah</malay> I mean <malay>jarang</malay> [lah] <malay>ya berbual pasal</malay> mango that's what I find it interesting <malay>kalau kita berbual untuk</malay> our first recording <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> I feel like none of us actually think have you ever think
about having mango soda
<malay>tak pernah ada</malay> [kan]
do you have have you had any mango sodas
I really wish <malay>ada</malay> mango soda
(um) that's that's right that's actually quite smart maybe you should try that next time <malay>kot</malay>
okay
(uh) do you know that (uh) in some parts of the world <malay>dekat luar negeri</malay> some parts of the world <malay>dekat tempat lain</malay>
mango is actually called
the king of fruits
that's shocking [kan] (um)
the fact that <malay>dekat</malay> southeast asia <malay>dekat asia tenggara kita</malay> actually the king of fruits <malay>ini</malay>
actually durian I don't know if you guys know durian but that's actually the king of fruits in this region

ya just just <malay>bila dah beli itu</malay> when you
when you

just remember to keep them in a very cool place maybe
(uh) as (uh) your fridge <malay>ke tapi</malay> it doesn't have to be in the fridge also [lah] I mean <malay>orang tiap-tiap orang</malay> it depends right [oh] and (err) talking about experience <malay>dengan</malay> mango I feel that I like to cut up mangoes <malay>macam potong-potong</malay> mango <malay>habis taruh dekat dalam</malay> freezer

semi frozen <malay>macam entah sedap macam</malay> ice you know

exactly <malay>itu pasal</malay> okay like okay let's just talk about it I <malay>suka</malay> mango ice cream <malay>yang dia dekat yang ada macam</malay> popsicle <malay>itu</malay>
(uh)
[oh] my god <malay>bila</malay> you take one bite <malay>dia macam</malay>
!wah! <malay>panas-panas makan itu sedap</malay> [seh] <malay>macam</malay> seriously like that's the best
food that you can have during
really really hot weather
<malay>betul</malay> I don't know
like honestly
<malay>cara</malay> you explain <malay>macam</malay> a bit weird <malay>tapi tak apa</malay> [lah] [eh] I I think we get it so whoever that's going to vet this audio please I apologize <malay>kalau</malay> topic <malay>dia macam</malay> lame <malay>sangat</malay> but we'll try to get better topics in the future definitely
so because this is our first (uh) topic [kan] so
ya no high expectations I'm so sorry
but yes we're trying
okay
now that we (uh) we hit thirty two minutes let's (err) just
take a break from mango topic because (uh) whoever that is going to listen this for one hour <malay>mesti boring gila dengar kita berbual pasal</malay> mango <malay>betul tak</malay> so let's hear about your day what have you done today
thank you for asking I know
question <malay>dia tadi satu</malay> question [eh] <malay>tapi dah melalut</malay> [eh] <malay>tak apa</malay> it's okay
so for my day I today I
okay this week actually is my first week (err) since (err) holiday that school resumes so (err) as per usual I had my class today <malay>tapi</malay> because you know [kan] <malay>sekarang tengah</malay> pandemic <malay>tengah</malay>
<malay>tengah</malay> you know like the the virus is you know <malay>masih dekat</malay> singapore <malay>masih ada</malay> cases [lah] [kan] so today we had
for a month actually we have to be (uh) doing classes online
it's really it it's it's really sad because I see I <malay>pun dah melalut tak apa</malay> it's okay
I mean
we're just talking we're just having a conversation just chilling
okay back to the topic (err) seriously I think quite sad because <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> [seh] <malay>dekat rumah</malay> like
I was hoping that we could go back to school because I really am productive <malay>dekat dekat sekolah</malay> like my brain my work like [ah] I can just think and do work
like
much more than I can do work at home <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh] <malay>macam susah</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kerja dekat rumah</malay> cause you know you have your bed you have your
your I don't know food there's a lot of food so you get distracted easily <malay>dekat rumah</malay> so your productivity level is not as
much as when you're outside
in school especially
I'm sure some of you would feel the same
maybe not maybe some of you all feel that <malay>dekat rumah lagi</malay> (err) productive [lah] but today is (uh)
quite decent for me
nothing too extreme nothing to some <malay>macam</malay> okay okay [jer] [lah] I still managed to get some of my personal time today so that's nice
okay what do you think are you the type of person who would do work or who is more productive <malay>dekat rumah ke</malay> or is more productive <malay>dekat luar</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> exactly
okay so
now that we've (uh) talked about our day
let's talk about okay before we going (err) we're going back to talking about the fruit [lah] [eh] cause
I don't know let's just talk about this it's more casual [lah] [kan] so okay (err) what [eh] what food did you have today
(mm) (mm)
I had <malay>sambal</malay> fish and <malay>sambal</malay> egg
then (err) <malay>ada</malay> this <malay>apa nama dia macam</malay> soup <malay>petola gitu</malay>
dengan <malay>bihun bihun</malay> [eh] <malay>ke suun</malay>
so
I think it's <malay>suun</malay> this <malay>dia macam bihun</malay> but it's like (um)
I don't know it's similar to glass noodles <malay>yang dari</malay> japan so I think that's what it is then <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] (um) ya that's what I had today and I had a sip of tea
today (um) because you know (uh) work's getting really really stressful <malay>jadi macam</malay> you know we just had have a sip of cammomile tea then (err) <malay>lepak lepak [dah] itu</malay> [jer]
then okay let's (uh) start talking about next thing shall we talk about fruits still or shall we move on to another topic
okay if it's up to me I would like to talk about <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>apa yang</malay> best [eh] <malay>nak berbual</malay> okay let's talk about our favorite music
okay what (uh) which artist do you listen to the most
(um) <malay>kalau kita berbual pasal</malay>
artist okay <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> genre first okay we'll talk about genre my favourite genre is very (err) much the same as hers (um) it's very wide I don't have a specific genre
okay but
(um) I wouldn't say okay my favourite song
is in a genre that is not my favourite genre do you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay>
my favourite song is this symphonic song called canon in D I think you all know this song [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay that song is my favourite song
it
just gives me it just brings out a lot of my emotions that I rarely have <malay>jadi macam bila dengar</malay> [jer] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god my emotions <malay>semua keluar</malay> but like
that's just what you feel about it
(err) I rarely talk about emotions so
it's weird that I'm talking about it now
okay so (uh) besides that (err) canon in D [eh] that's one genre that I don't listen all the time but that that's a song that I really really like above all the other songs that I hear
and okay
let's talk about the next genre my next genre <malay>yang</malay> favourite <malay>itu</malay> let's see I think for now I don't have it's a tie between (err) western songs <malay>dengan</malay>
k-pop
they both have very distinct (uh) features they both have
however <malay>macam</malay> similar <malay>dia itu macam sama tapi lain</malay> [lah] you you you get what I mean
<malay>dia punya</malay> upbeat <malay>dia punya</malay> instrumental <malay>semua sama tapi</malay> it's just that the language probably different <malay>kot macam</malay> that's the distinct difference
okay and then (um) my favorite song from western and let's see I think it's <malay>paling banyak lagu-lagu</malay> western <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>kot</malay> that is the one that's very popular
I I would say <malay>lagu</malay> (um)
(uh) <malay>dah lupa tajuk dia</malay>
[ah] I will never let you down by rita ora I think that song is very empowering
besides that okay I I also listen to spanish songs and
[ah] I <malay>tak tahu kalau banyak orang dengar lagu ini</malay> but
it's called #mevoy# M E V O Y <malay>daripada</malay> [eh] the one that is that sang the song is julieta venegas
that song is very nice <malay>dia</malay>
the the background music has this (um) hum
accordion and I don't know it's just it's just very
it's very cute like when you listen to the song you would think of being in the
feel and what not
okay because we're (err) recording at a very late time because my sister just got back from work so please
just
hold on we still have about twenty minutes left like less than twenty minutes left
everything is going great
<malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] [ah] [oh] ya so that song in from spain I don't know if he she's from spain I <malay>main asal asal</malay> [jer]
<malay>sebarang</malay> [ah] <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] okay from korea I guess I would say my favourite song is
<malay>entah banyak</malay> man I have a lot of groups that I like
(err)
I cannot name any of them I'm so sorry
then (err) okay I also because (err) this is my family is an (um) indonesian family so <malay>kita dengar banyak lagu lagu daripada</malay> indonesia <malay>juga</malay> [lah] so (err)
we are actually from
<malay>jawa pulau jawa</malay>

that's where we come from and then <malay>lagu-lagu</malay> from there is <malay>semua</malay>
variety <malay>juga</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> they have (err) songs <malay>yang macam</malay> western western <malay>gitu dia orang pun ada</malay> songs <malay>macam</malay> ballad
<malay>dia ada</malay> genre genre [ah] <malay>koplo</malay> [oh] my god <malay>koplo</malay> my favourite genre
it's <malay>dia macam</malay> traditional <malay>gitu tapi dia campur-campur dengan lagu-lagu lagu-lagu barat</malay>
that's very interesting (uh)
we'll have this (uh) genre thingy conversation in another recording [lah] [eh]

<malay>tadi</malay> a bit fun [lah] okay so
okay let's find
okay
what is the pettiest reason that you would dislike someone
really that's not that petty
okay
I think okay [lah] that's that's not that petty I suppose for me if
petty a petty reason for me to dislike someone would definitely be his his or her <malay>punya</malay> (um)
(uh) the
[oh] the person's friends the or who the person hangs out with
like that's usually how I would end up not not liking a person is is damn petty
but (uh) it's usually how who they choose to hang out with which is very shallow [lah] but
I suppose (um) ya
ya
okay
okay [lah] okay okay okay <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>kalau</malay> say <malay>orang tu nak</malay> hang out <malay>dengan</malay> I right <malay>tapi dia macam</malay>
<malay>kirakan</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak macam kawan dia</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tak dengan</malay> members <malay>dia semua</malay> okay [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
but
still at the back of my mind (um)
I would I will be too aware of it
and it would definitely affect (um) you know the person just because of who their friends are
it judgemental it's not it's not even petty anymore it's it's more
it's more petty is more is more judgemental than petty so
ya it will be difficult [lah] and like and it's it I I know it's it's very sad but yes
ya okay
(uh)
[ha] okay

(uh) <malay>cerita kelakar</malay>
okay actually you know what
you know what I'm gonna do right now I don't wanna talk about I don't want to use this conversation
I wanna talk about something I want to talk about the house

what do you think of the house [ah]
!huh!
ya ya what do think of the house [ah]
(mmhmm)
keep talking [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I mean for me ya [lah] I mean it's I do feel
I mean once in a while like I do feel <malay>macam</malay> a bit <malay>sedih</malay> that
<malay>yang apa ni</malay>
I
I'm a bit far away from from where I'm used to [kan] like I mean like I've always been living in #yishun#
and then now moving to #tampines# so it's a bit
it's a bit different for me [lah] ya
but I guess it's okay
it's fine
one thing about the house that I really I mean do I do I really love is the fact that it's very
us you know
it's something that we both
initially I had no idea that that you were gonna be okay with the designs
you know what I propose for because it was what I like
you know anything I'm just very lucky that like what I like was what was what you like as well
right
I mean certain things you like a bit <malay>sedih</malay> right you know we didn't get to have (um)
for example like I wanted more
more carpentry stuff in the living room you know what that that that whole feature wall thing
but you know it's just too expensive
ya it's just <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah]

your your your your new phone <malay>masih banyak</malay> battery [kan]
you just get <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
(uh) okay you know what I'm gonna go back to the questions [lah] it was a bit it was kind of slightly easier just now
if you had three wishes what would you wish for
(uh huh)
(uh) first one would definitely be wealth
right I want to be not just for me but my entire family you know like want to be
a family that has a lot of wealth property
you know (uh) really high net worth you know a dynasty a business
where our wealth would just go roll and roll and roll
you know that would last generation upon generations
right not just my family but your family as well like like really rich and powerful family that's the that's the first one mine is quite grand [lah]
and then the second
would be obviously
[oh] but back to the first one like the like the wealth that we that we gain is of legal means right in that we are free from any legal trouble
secondly is definitely to have
health
(hmm)
(mm)
will be health <malay>nanti</malay> [lah]
like would be health
(um) you know basically virus free
you know strong right perfect bodies
(uh) and then the third one right
that you know same sex relationship is not a problem at all
so you can basically live together you know

I I had zero expectation of iran in fact I'm not like when you were planning the whole thing I will just like (mm) ya okay and I just
I just wanted to like okay let's try something new
same ya
ya so when we reached there it was it was

[eh] no no no we didn't have #yazd# it's #shiraz# sorry ya

<malay>entah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak tahu nak berbual apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh] I <malay>tangok yang tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] (oo) they got a lot of question
good looks or a fit body what would you prefer
(uh huh)
I think
for me it's the built
first
right I'm okay with looks
ya
I mean I mean of course [lah] it has to be attractive in my way [lah]
right ya
I like the physical appeal first right and then the face
(hmm) and you know the person's kind of vibe [ah] not not not personality or character [lah] because I think that's just a stretch
ya
there's too much to think about the but there has to be like some sort like I'm I'm attracted to I guess to to many kinds of personalities and characters but
you know it's that person's vibe can I
deal with like you know you and I we have very different personalities
right we have quite a opposing personalities and we are quite and we're very very different people but
you know the fact that we actually can
we do have a certain chemistry
I mean we do have chemistry with each other and we we vibe well [ah]
ya
is this is actually very difficult
like this conversation thing to code switch is actually very difficult like I find myself like when I'm very conscious of what I'm speaking that I'm speaking I tend to break out more I mean it it's very natural for me to speak in english
like for me to like suddenly like <malay>tukar</malay> and then <malay>cakap bahasa melayu</malay>
you know <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] but
you know it's not normal it's just not natural for me to be speaking malay all the way <malay>nak cakap melayu</malay> all the way because
even when I'm speaking malay
normally I suppose right I
I often pepper the words with
pepper the sentences with with with english words because sometimes it's just so much easier to express something in english
you know ya because
ya like the word
like for example like to say to express feeling
right is it feels much easier and it feels less awkward
you know than to say the phrase <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay>
ya it just feels much easier it just feels less emotional
you know like <malay>luahkan perasaan</malay> means like I'm about to cry you know like I'm about to
I'm about to really go deep
with my feelings but when I say I'm expressing like I just want to express my thought it can be blunt it can be quick it can be fast you know but when I say I <malay>nak luahkan perasaan kat</malay> you [ah]
<malay>maknanya</malay> I <malay>macam ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak cakap sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>nak nak nak kena nak kena fikirkan nak kena</malay> (uh)
<malay>nak kena fikirkan nak kena luahkan nak kena</malay>
<malay>nak kena cakap</malay> [lah]
then <malay>rasa dia macam</malay> <malay>macam berat sangat</malay>
<malay>macam kelakar pun ada macam janggal</malay> !wah! see
<malay>janggal</malay>
you you <malay>tak tahu makna janggal</malay> you <malay>teka makna janggal apa</malay>
just <malay>teka</malay> [lah]
yes ya
<malay>janggal maknanya</malay> awkward
yes
[eh] no wait we have reached twenty four mark the twenty four the twenty fourth minute mark
wait does it have to be one hour
I suppose so
<malay>jap jap jap jap</malay> let me check <malay>yang ni</malay>
<malay>jap jap jap jap</malay> I reply <malay>kak su jap</malay> [eh]

okay <malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay so that's question okay so let's look at another prompter
you are dining at a new restaurant called karma it doesn't have a menu you simply get what you deserve
what food will you be served
okay okay that's a dumb question (um)
<malay>suatu hari</malay>
<malay>anda bangun dari tidur dan mendapati bahawa anda telah menjadi seorang pelakon</malay>
<malay>siapakah pelakon itu dan mengapa anda memilihnya</malay>
okay
<malay>pelakon</malay>
<malay>yang saya</malay>
(um) <malay>memilih</malay>
[ah] <malay>ialah</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
<malay>siapa yang jadi</malay> spiderman <malay>yang barunya yang</malay> the latest one tom holland ya
<malay>saya ingin menjadi</malay> tom holland <malay>kerana</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) <malay>sungguh</malay> (um)
(uh) talented
I have no idea what talented means (uh) is in in in malay (um)
that <malay>dia muda</malay>
<malay>saya ingin menjadi muda kembali</malay>
(uh)
<malay>muda dan</malay> (uh) <malay>berjaya</malay>
ya tom holland
<malay>bagaimana pula dengan anda</malay>
<malay>pilihan</malay>
<malay>kenapa</malay>
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(uh huh)
actually
(uh huh)
okay <malay>kejap jap jap</malay>
okay (um)
[eh] <malay>jap jap</malay> you know what I want to <malay>tengok</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your brother <malay>hantar</malay>
then <malay>kejap</malay> [eh]
ya <malay>satu jam kena berbual satu jam</malay>
just <malay>berbual</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>satu jam</malay> the no okay the thing is I think what the
I think what this exercise is is trying to trying to
study is how like when you're having a conversation how do we code switch right
because you know we are both singaporeans we both speak the same languages right (um) how
the mastery level
you know our mastery level at the language at at the language is is completely secondary
you know so I think they just want to find out like
I think I think the whole purpose of this is trying to find like is trying to figure out the trigger points
right
and actually collect data
as to when
what like what are the patterns when it comes to code switching like you know like right now I'm speaking in english and then suddenly I <malay>tukar</malay> I <malay>cakap dengan</malay> you <malay>bahasa melayu</malay>
I think <malay>saya rasa diorang nak tahu kenapa bagaimana apabila</malay>
<malay>yang paling mustahak ialah apabila</malay>
<malay>dan kenapa</malay>
<malay>dan dari situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>memberi</malay> (uh)
<malay>kesinambungan</malay>
<malay>bagaimana</malay>
<malay>dan apabila</malay>
(uh) <malay>diorang diorang ingin</malay> (um)
<malay>diorang ingin mengetahui</malay>
<malay>cara-cara</malay>
code switching
ya because
sometimes okay sometimes okay what I find such studies very interesting because they like
such research very interesting
when
no no no you have to you have to you have to understand because
they have to list like an entire conversation right if if we were to speak fifteen minutes there's not enough data there's they can't really detect you know like enough patterns
right if it's just
fifteen seconds it can be a brief conversation you know it's
when you speak to someone for an hour okay yes a force could (um) not force it's a bit forced I get you you know is one hour it's a bit forced
right but it's okay
it's okay
ya
it's okay and but the thing is it's I think they just want to see patterns
you know they want to see patterns and if one hour I suppose give them ample (um) opportunities to mine
you know as much as as much data as they can
ya
the difficulty in us maintaining in this is is actually in in in is actually the maintaining of this conversation
right and consciously trying to code switch
when in normal situation
it's something that we do unconsciously
right we just do it and that it's it's something that we don't really think about our
be be even aware of
you know like
(um)
like when we are with our friends you know then when we talk
when we talk <malay>ni semua</malay> we don't really
I mean we don't really think about and then we just we we either just continue what we're saying in malay or we just continue what we're saying in english you know
I think the difficult part is that whole start stop thing and the fact that they made us watch this video
right
they made a number of us watch this video and then they kinda give guidelines
as to how I hope you're listening to this by the way and they give us guidelines on how to
(um)
on what makes a good code switching or bad code switching and that kinds of kind of like
you know (uh) make us a bit too conscious so I feel that this conversation feels a bit forced and to a certain and to a certain degree (uh) unnatural
you know
I feel that if there was no not much of restriction
right if there was not much restriction where I can just easily go in go out <malay>nak cakap melayu cakap melayu nak cakap</malay> english <malay>cakap</malay> english
and
then <malay>cakap</malay> [lah] but the fact that <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> certain words <malay>macam</malay> like there's a like there's a rule to it
right it's just very it just like <malay>macam</malay> !alah!
ya
ya <malay>macam dia macam tak</malay> natural but okay [lah] not bad
we actually made it to forty minutes you know
ya yes <malay>lagi dua puluh minit sahaja</malay> okay <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I <malay>nak tengok yang</malay> the video <malay>yang</malay> your your brother <malay>hantar tu</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay cleaning done !wah!
okay [lah] I'm glad that they that the <malay>yang</malay> [kan] initially [kan] our flooring we wanted like two different colours
actually I'm kinda glad that
the other colour
ya
<malay>nasib baik tu yang benda tu</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dah habis</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
ya

ya <malay>rumah kita besar</malay> [sia]
yes
[a'ah] <malay>macam lama</malay> [sia]
no [lah] I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> first first christmas
to fully <malay>pindah</malay> but I mean we can slowly live there
my things I'm gonna <malay>letak sikit-sikit</malay> [tau] I'm not gonna like one time go there I'm just gonna put things bit by bit because I <malay>takde kotak</malay>
I probably gonna take a few <malay>kotak</malay> and all that for of course office
<malay>muat ke</malay>
[oh] <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] ya
I really <malay>suka</malay> the <malay>yang kitanya</malay> flooring flooring <malay>kita cantik</malay>
ya
[ah] [oh]
<malay>yang yang kerusi belakang tu kena</malay> screw [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>semua</malay> [ah] <malay>semua kena buat</malay> [ah]

okay so okay
!ee! best [lah] I <malay>tengok</malay> I I I <malay>tengok</malay> the kitchen best [seh] <malay>jap jap jap</malay> [eh]
I think the kitchen <malay>cantik</malay> [ah] like after we <malay>letak</malay> after the <malay>apa ni</malay> the
<malay>dia</malay>
ya
after <malay>dia letak</malay>
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>jap jap</malay>
I think the whole idea <malay>yang</malay> [ah] you know to level up the floor is such a damn good idea
I kinda like it though
<malay>ye ke</malay>
it kinda looks more like (uh) rustic to me
[eh] <malay>ini diorang boleh</malay> spray [eh]
okay
so <malay>yang ni nanti nanti</malay> next few days <malay>baru pasang</malay> [ah]
<malay>kena tunggu benda tu kering</malay> [eh]
actually [kan]
I was imagining the the counter top to be
<malay>besar sikit</malay> [tau] <malay>tebal sikit</malay> actually quite thin [ah]
if you tell me I'm not saying it's not okay it's okay obviously it's okay but I was imagining it to be thinner
[eh] thicker
ya <malay>lebih tebal sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi macam tak</malay> [jer]
ya okay let's let's look at another question it's quite interesting like suddenly [ah]
<malay>jap</malay> [eh]
if were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be [ah] <malay>ni ni</malay> <malay>ni ni soalan</malay> best
no no no one dish
ya
yes
okay
just like you
I have two choices
<malay>pilihan pertama</malay>
<malay>adalah satay</malay>
<malay>satay lembu</malay>
<malay>dua puluh lima cucuk</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketupat sikit</malay>
<malay>tapi kuah satay banyak-banyak banyak letak banyak bawang banyak</malay>

<malay>pilihan kedua</malay>
<malay>seperti anda</malay>
<malay>adalah nasi sambal goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi sambal goreng adalah hidangan</malay>
<malay>yang lengkap</malay>
<malay>dia manis dia pedas ada masin</malay>

<malay>beranak habis</malay> if your if your pain threshold is high
maybe <malay>tak sakit</malay> [lah] <malay>pada kakak</malay> pain threshold <malay>kakak memang</malay> high I got high tolerance for pain so that's why <malay>macam bila beranak macam tak ada apa-apa tak cuma</malay> I think that time <malay>masa</malay> first <malay>punya</malay> pregnancy [kan] <malay>orang mesti cakap sakit sakit</malay> actually <malay>macam tak apa</malay>
it's not really that painful then <malay>orang cakap sakit tak beranak</malay> actually okay [lah] <malay>pada kakak macam macam sakit sembelit nak berak</malay> it's just like <malay>berak-berak macam</malay> constipation that's all (hmm)

[ah]
<malay>dulu masa yang kakak bersalin dulu yang urut pun cakap</malay> (err) <malay>jamu-jamu sekarang banyak yang campur tak</malay> authentic so that's why it's dangerous [ah]
<malay>nak ambil tak boleh ambil banyak-banyak</malay>
because it can affect your internal organs <malay>apa</malay> a
<malay>mak</malay> [lah] <malay>selalu suruh makan kena paksa makan</malay> [lah] then have to eat <malay>habis jamu pakai jamu</malay> pill pill okay [ah] <malay>mak punya</malay> time <malay>lagi teruk jamu macam kena masak punya</malay> [tau]

just now you say what Pan Pacific hotel is it

december [lah] better
so I
[oh] still got school holiday [meh]
[oh] I okay
but I just check the price first just now you say Pan Pacific right

[oh] that [one] that [one] we haven't plan yet
but knowing #angah# I think he wants to eat
malay food like <malay>nasi</malay>
!aww! this [one] is nice
but I think because of the adults <malay>itu</malay> [lah] I think ya
that's why it's expensive
I press wrongly where do I press
okay
and then I show you the Amara hotel [eh]
because the Amara hotel what what my (uh) what I
thought that I
(err) should do right
is I will take two separate room
and then one room is me <malay>kak</malay> #ain# #aryan# and
my younger brother and then another room is for my parents [lah] so they can <malay>apa ni</malay>
at least they can spend the night together
since it's his <malay>hari jadi</malay> also my father
there
<malay>lagi lagi dia</malay> half price [seh] of the Pan Pacific <malay>tapi</malay> like okay [lah] like like we cannot be together in one room [lah]
[oh] they they have the two bedroom apartment
there price for five adults six one seven okay [lah]
let's see the photos
but I know they <malay>baru</malay> recently just renovated [tau]
Amara
!huh! got no plate
Maggi
you know like some hotel <malay>macam</malay> they the shower and everything is in the bathtub right but I don't want that but but I know Amara is not like that
because like how [mah] want to
shower right
like quite difficult
but two bedroom okay [lah] #ilham# can sleep outside
ya
this [one] [oh] okay [dah] I think this is the [one] that I wanted to take
[eh] no <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
okay <malay>ni</malay>
#angah# don't like gardens by the bay he went before and he's like
why am I looking at plants
why am I paying to look at plants
<malay>dia tak suka</malay>
like <malay>dia kata</malay> like very boring [seh]
okay this one is for three adults right
so I was thinking that okay [lah] either way [lah] like if (uh) <malay>adik</malay> want to if my younger want to sleep with
(uh) <malay>ayah</malay> and #ma# then go ahead
they can sleep
on the floor [lah] of course [lah] with the with the mattress right
but two eight zero and then if I times two it's still cheaper
but we will not be in the same room but I don't mind that [lah] as long as you know
it's a staycation then I wanted breakfast also then this one also there
got breakfast
included
not bad right
I guess
I think I will I really think I will <malay>bangun pagi</malay> if
I were I I'm in that kind of mood
the artscience museum <malay>yang dekat</malay> <malay>tak</malay>
is it
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>dia</malay>

can can <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
or the another one is this one also Ascott [oh] the price [oh] my god
[dah] <malay>naik</malay> [seh] price <malay>dia</malay>
actually the the last time I saw it is about five hundred plus
is a apartment also
(mm)
[oh] when are we receiving that [ah]
ya
because it's every tourist attraction place right
ya ya ya ya I think he will appreciate now at this age
[oh] ya [hor]
(mm)(mm)(mm)
I think he will also like I think he will also like (um) <malay>apa tu lagi satu tu</malay>
no another one
ya I think he will like adventure cove also
since he like water
ya
I think so I think if it's like once in a while kind of thing I think he will join in it will be awkward [lah] but I think he
I think he don't mind
need to <malay>jap</malay> [eh]
no [eh] ya ya ya ya ya
ya ya ya ya ya I told you I liked it what
are you the one who told me you don't like it
ya
why [ah] why you don't like it
[oh] is it
what did you have
a a what
[oh]
(mm) okay [lah] I will decide
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm)
<malay>mana</malay> notes [ah]
I also have it every month
(err) <malay>abeh</malay> (um) okay [lah] I will decide
on the itinerary
ya <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tak</malay> (um)
okay for me
for me the most memorable meal that I ever had is when I went to japan
and I eat that (um) indian restaurant
because I seriously I I don't think that
a foreign country
will have
will have like
a nice indian food
you know what you mean I I I I thought like <malay>macam</malay> the culture is
is like a bit weird [lah] so when I taste it [eh] I thought that it's going to be bad but then like [oh] my god it's so nice
(err) I ate the prawn green curry you the #naan#
it's so nice I I I think I still remember the taste until today
ya
no because we (uh) we
(mm) it's too loud (mm)
because we we passed by and then after that we thought [eh]
<malay>macam</malay> [eh] can [ah] like craving something local because like that is how many days already we are there
then every time eat like either fast food or Maggi or like some japanese noodle
so was like okay [lah]
and then I don't really like #udon#
that's why maybe I don't (mm)
your japanese curry curry also I don't like
ya I just feel like that it's like just like a paste
doesn't taste anything
ya so
when I taste it I was like [eh] <malay>sedap</malay> [seh] then like
(err) okay [lah] I mean it's quite expensive
maybe when I convert it into like
singapore dollars like (uh)
seventeen dollars I think per serving
seventeen dollar [tau] for a green prawn curry it's not even with rice it's with
#naan#
okay [lah] it's worthy it's an experience and then I was like okay !wow! I I I don't ever have
<malay>macam</malay> like this kind of food
<malay>bila dekat</malay> singapore
I didn't even taste like any indian food that taste like that
food ya ya ya ya
no
I didn't
but
(mm) (mm) (mm)
they had it they have it in singapore now right is it
nice
four dollar something
(mmhmm)(mm)(mm)(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
ya ya
ya at first I didn't know but then I had it we had it in #bali# remember the the Yoshinoya
the #yakiniku# beef
is it the same thing
[ah]
but then that one the one that I ate also called #yakiniku# beef why
[oh] wait
maybe maybe maybe
[oh] is it
(mm)
what do you think for you because I I might take awhile to think about that
I will definitely okay dish is it okay okay I want
ya I wanted to say rice then I was like okay it's not dish
ya it is
is it not I feel like
ya
ya
you choose #mee soto#
[oh] okay
<malay>susah</malay> [eh]
ya me too
okay if given a choice
I would probably
for me I think it'll be chicken
ya I think
I think it'll be my mum's (err) <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay>
for the rest of my life
or carbonara
it's either one but I don't know [what]
because if I take that <malay>ayam lemak cili padi</malay> then can I can it be served <malay>dengan nasi</malay> or no if no <malay>nasi</malay> then I don't want it
because it need to be with <malay>nasi</malay> [lah] hot piping <malay>nasi</malay>
I think my I think my mum my mum's (err) <malay>nasi goreng</malay>
<malay>nasi goreng daging</malay> is nice also
I mean if a dish that like got everything inside like protein and everything okay [lah] then the <malay>nasi goreng</malay> I think is a good choice
probably I want to add one fried egg on top
<malay>telur mata lembu</malay> on top
the runny one
ya
ya I think it's a dish
I think I want to be rihanna for one day
she
ya she's cool
and then she is very like (um)
independent and then she can do whatever she want
although I know she worked hard for it [lah]
of course right
but like <malay>macam</malay> like when you become her
it's like
you don't even like maybe need to care about
I don't know taking care of
[oh] but she's not an actor she's a singer
if celebrity [ah] rihanna I think I would want to be rihanna for
for for like one day
I wake up and then it's like [oh] my god [oh] my god I'm trapped in rihanna's body
then I can like I think and then during that one day that I'm her
I think I just enjoy life
like all the money she have and then probably I'll grab all her beauty lines
I'm her right by the #wayi# can just like (err) can I
ya can I just like (err) take this home home where
ya
and then I will I will like I don't know
I even though I'm scared to take
(err) helicopter
probably I would for that one day
and then
ya
and then ya
I think it'll be pretty cool to be her
for one day
let's see what kind of life she leads
I think so I think her her house got a lot of you know like those
celebrity house like they stay alone but they got a lot of rooms
I don't know why
<malay>tak tahu</malay> like I really seriously <malay>tak tahu</malay> why they need like <malay>banyak banyak bilik</malay>
like <malay>bilik dorang banyak</malay> [tau] like
like whenever the article came out okay like rihanna room (uh) house is like seven million
(err) with twenty four bedroom
ten toilets (err) attached (uh) with (uh) indoor swimming pool
I was like why
who else stay there rihanna I wanted to ask her
okay maybe if I'm her and I can figure out that who else stays there
in that twenty four
probably
ya man
or <malay>macam main</malay> hide and seek <malay>ke</malay>
scary [siol]
I don't think I can
don't [ah]
will smith
I I hadn't
is it
(ugh)
(mmhmm)
and then they put there as a meme
okay [oh] ya ya ya ya I saw it I saw it like
celebrities like stay home
and then celebrity home is like
that big
ya but like
they have a lot of things to do in their house I don't think they'll be bored they can swim
they can probably play play tennis basketball
and maybe they got like movie like indoor movie ya
and then we we're like okay
<malay>dekat dalam</malay> flat like (err)
buy one get one free
[oh] you mean like okay okay I don't know
(hmm)
I don't think any one for one free deal is
a bad thing
unless if I like cannot choose what is my one for one
for example like okay if you go Starbucks you can
but you know sometimes Starbucks got this day that they have one for one but only for certain drinks
[ah] okay then that kind of deal like okay [lah] [meh] I don't want to buy because maybe the drinks I don't want okay [lah] maybe that one is a bit worse
like !huh! one for one
but I don't get to choose
ya but <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam</malay> let's say they
but usually one for one is like okay the higher price you pay and then the lower
ya okay that one is already (um) <malay>macam</malay>
standard [lah]
ya ya ya ya
actualy ya I mean
good looks or fit body
what would you prefer
because like the body [ah]
[ha]
I think the face you look at it every day like <malay>hari hari tengok</malay>
then can you imagine that you are angry at the person and then like (ugh)
looking at the face is so more annoying because it's like
the face is already annoying
ya ya ya
face
I think it'll be that I think it'll be a bit hard to reconstruct
or like <malay>tukar</malay> the face in like
ya
ya
and ya like imagine
[dah] <malay>sapau sapau muka macam</malay>
I don't even wanna say
I like crime documentaries ya bearing channel is the crime investigation channel makeup to me too
ya me too
me too me too
ya even though like (uh)
okay I like crime and I like law
I think they are two separate things [lah] maybe some law they just deal with like
whatever
ya like court cases or like how lawyers act in general how they
(err)
go all out to save their client even though their clients is wrong
you know they like they just
fight for their clients [eh] no no no (uh) like he or she is not wrong
[ah] no <malay>dia macam dia tak dia tak</malay> murder that person <malay>dia tak</malay> kill that person is it
and everything like that and then
[ah] I like like ya I like (uh) true crime stories
I like like last time I like
like when it
when it shows on channel five
during like I think about nine
after the news nine o'clock news [oh] I like serious I
ya I mean the whole I I don't know whether they are still
around but I don't think they are (um)
that
popular anymore
ya I think the older season is better the miami miami
I think it's one of the
I remember that detective the one that doesn't smile I forgot what's his name
ya
and ya I think okay horror right I think it's
something
if the
if the plot case is good
(uh) or like paranormal activity all these like
(um) (uh) cable (uh) ya
a good movie correct
ya they want to like <malay>macam</malay> [oh] this is we captured it for the camera
you know it happens ya ya ya ya
ya
then
(err) ya ya ya
ya
(mm)
correct correct
ya
ya I like her also I think I watch almost all her videos already
ya ya ya ya ya the Facebook one I already
watch
ya
what [ah]
[ah] chris watts [ah] is it the chris watts
the [one] that she the [one] that the the
ya the [one] that the guy killed the wife and the kids right
ya ya ya
actually the when the chris watts things happened right
(um)
I was pregnant it was in two zero one eight
and then the news came out and then I was thinking I was talking
I was
talking to my colleague like
how can (uh) on earth can anyone do this to their kids and their
and their partner I was like thinking like okay [lah] maybe
the partner is abusive or maybe like you know there's so many maybe's but then when the story came out I was like
you should watch it
no the movie just recently
two zero one two is when the murder happened
so it's just recently only
ya
Netflix the Netflix [one] [eh]
I I think it's badly down because
they didn't show the who story like
I watch the documentary it's like they didn't
like this chris watts
okay he's a narcissist right I think he is a downright narcissist he just didn't know
or he just know but he just
(uh) I mean he's a narcissist what (uh) eventually he will just gonna act that [oh] no it's not my fault you know and things like that
by they in that Netflix documentary I think they did they failed to include a lot of either evidence that was was found like
like the fact that like he had (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> (err) he got a mistress
(err) (uh) okay it's a girlfriend <malay>yang</malay> he knows
about two months prior prior to the wedding [eh] prior to the murder sorry
ya like <malay>macam</malay>
but you should include all these because it's I mean okay they in that documentary
<malay>dorang</malay> actually did include
(err) the girlfriend [lah] but
in some sense they didn't say that okay the girlfriend
actually is the
okay the girlfriend actually did some search on on on
on her Google
asking like that that she was searching things that
a bit suspicious [lah]
and then after that like she know that this guy is
married
with a with a wife that is fifteen weeks pregnant
and then she still you know
ya so I think she's a bit suspicious and
the whole story doesn't add up
but ya you should watch
you should watch soon
if you are given three wishes what would you wish for
what would you wish for
okay
and then
to be honest if I had three wish right I think my wish my first two wish would be
I think I had a few wish when growing up but then it's always the same one
number one is
ya like I never
like I never like (um)
not <malay>kecil</malay> [lah] maybe when I was a teenager
okay when I started working
okay like I was like pre-teen maybe like eighteen like that right I always thought that okay like
I wish that
I wish
my first wish is that
me and whole family can live in a big house
like a landed house and then
and then
and then money will not be a problem that's my first wish
and then my second wish is always the same
like a big house like not castle [lah] like
at least it's a landed landed house especially we stay in singapore you know it's very expensive
ya
ya
ya where my parents can actually like (uh) grow old and they don't need to worry about you know
retirement ya I think that's my wish since ever since I'm I'm I'm I'm quite young
ya then my second wish is okay my second wish is actually the [one] that
I had after I had
#aryan# after I had my first baby
which is I wish that
(uh) healthy okay [lah] healthy is subjective [lah]
but I just wish that he will
be smart
and be loyal
to the people that
love him [ah] like <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>atuk nenek dia punya dia punya</malay>
especially to his <malay>atuk nenek</malay> [lah] because like
this
two people is the [one] <malay>yang apa ni</malay> bring you up
take care of you when you are young [kan] so I think
ya
in the future he needs to
return the favour [lah] I think he really need to <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] [dah] <malay>besar</malay> he will need to realise [oh] [eh] actually I <malay>nak</malay>
I need to (err) <malay>jaga</malay> my <malay>atuk</malay> and <malay>nenek</malay> I need (uh) anything that
(err) they need I have to
do it
for them
[ah] and then my third wish actually
(uh) I don't have a third wish until recently
like I just wish that COVID will end
really I think I think COVID is like one of the worst I mean
I was I was still (uh) I'm already pretty
[oh] I
(err) when SARS happened I mean I I'm quite young
and I know about it happen because <malay>kita kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
we're schooling I think
where are you
I think around I'm in secondary school
(err) (uh) (um) lower secondary
then I think
ya ya ya that that was what (uh) <malay>apa yang</malay> I mean [lah] like
I really think <malay>yang</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> is like
one of the worst things that happened
like
ya
I know right and then and then a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> nothing you know they like have a job and then the next time they don't have
a job and the they are not even prepared for it
<malay>macam</malay> like things happened just like that and there are a lot of people the most
thing the most like <malay>macam paling sedih</malay> that I've heard
is that like
if a country have like
so many thousands of death in one day like indonesia you can go up to like thousand deaths in one day like
who are this one thousand people like how do they get it
I think at the back of my head [kan] I will actually really think like then I was like [eh] like quite sad [lah] like
they are somebody's
(err)
father daughter or like kids
and then they just have to die
due to you know
ya

november
second november
ya ya ya I went I went for medical check-up then after that
(err) actually is is
is just to check whether you done your immunisation [lor]
no because you <malay>nak kena kerja dengan</malay> kids [kan]
then you need to be immunised because they are high
likely to be infected if you have any and then with only one kid
you know like things like chicken pox and all this
but
but
good for me that I've done all the immunisation when I'm young and I already got chicken pox so I no need to take anything
just like x-ray and then there everything is okay already
then ya [lah] I pass
so
you know that day I went for (uh) a a pre-trial
to be a pre
pre-trial teacher
at white lodge which is actually just here only <malay>kat</malay> west coast road
and white lodge is (um)
it's a private (uh) institution
ya it's a private (err) it's a private school [lah] it's not a government it's not a co-education or anything it's just a private on its own
but it's (uh) it's actually
it's as at a landed property
ya
is is ya it's a huge (um)
ya it's a child care it's a huge child care and after that
no go inside go inside
teach
yes yes
yes depends on the group that they in [ah] okay like the the one I went I went (uh) from eight thirty to one
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I have to (um)
I have to (err) assign them to groups
say like okay today this is your group okay they are classmates [lah] but they are they are like
one teacher (err) to a ratio of
no
more fifteen kids one five
depending on the group so <malay>kat</malay> over there the the the smaller the the smallest is three years old
you don't really infant ya this module ya the younger you don't have infant or anything like that
we don't have infant
ya the smallest ya the youngest
we don't have infant or anything like that
then (um)
after that the okay so what I did was like (uh)
I assisted
ya they they are from three
to six
okay so
what I did was
(um) I assisted
the lead teacher
to you know do activities with the children [lah] (um) okay the first half the eight thirty to
eleven twenty <malay>tu yang</malay> before the lunchtime <malay>[kan]</malay> I actually assisted the teachers
(um)
for kids that (uh) the age of three until
four
ya they they are like toddlers they are still toddlers and then but most of them all is all potty trained
that's what I'm amazed and <malay>dorang punya</malay> culture is very diverse because most is all
#ang moh#
and then mixed race like japanese and #ang moh#
like (um) japanese and japanese korean and (uh) sweden
like swedish sweden <malay>pula</malay> (um)
<malay>banyak</malay> [ah] like
okay it's
they talk in english they is hard to get a local [one]
there is one or two local like chinese
there's no malay there's no indian
ya there are more into into international (uh) so the culture and all is different
I guess or maybe because of the location
[orh] ya ya ya ya ya ya is at the west coast area there so is
[ah] <malay>sakit kenapa sakit</malay> (hmm)
eight thirty to five [lah]
office hour then after that saturday sunday we are they they are closed
that's the good thing because (uh) if you go under government
saturday you're (uh) open half day
then you need to alternate working [ah]
on saturdays with you colleagues
but this [one] like saturday sunday you are closed and then [what] I like is that
the parents
usually they are working from home or they are not working
or they have maids so they will not
like pick up the kids l am bet
or anything no such thing
like they actually come on time and so it's half of the kids so in total
(uh) plus <malay>yang</malay> kid <malay>umur</malay>
three to six <malay>dengan</malay>
(err) five to [eh] sorry three to four <malay>dengan</malay> five five to six <malay>tu</malay>
total there will be there is about like forty five kids
and there is like about three lead teacher
so that's why they are actually quite
they they actually need a lot of manpower [lah]
then we bring them to the playground nearby outside before lunch and then
I get to see (uh) what they serve for lunch
like some kids is vegetarian so what do they serve some kids is allergic to peanut what do they serve
some kids is lactose intolerant what do they serve ya ya ya it's actually quite interesting
because they are very like <malay>macam</malay>
colourful
colourful characters [lah] like
(err) and then they
they are very okay
I mean kids will be kids they they are quite naughty but
they will say please most of the time
ya it's quite rare that they will always like can I go to the (uh)
they call me they call me miss
#hu#
because they don't my my name is very long right then like (uh) okay never mind (uh) just okay just call me miss #hu#
okay then after that they
[oh] got one kid say (uh) miss #hu# can I go to the toilet please
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> when when she's done
because I wait for her outside right
then she's done she say
(um) can I get a wet wipes please
like she's everything is all please like thank you
thank you so much like
very polite but then when when she return to her friends
she's like !whoa! [eh]
ya I think she's
ya I think with adults maybe she's trained to be like you know respectful to the adults and and and stuffs like that
and then what's interesting is
(err) <malay>setengah</malay> of the kids like
<malay>setengah</malay> of the forty five kids <malay>yang</malay>
go to school on that day right
<malay>setengah</malay> will go home at one
after they wake up from their nap like twelve
ya
okay sometime they not happy but their mates will take them healthy
so [ah]
[a'ah]
<malay>balik tidur</malay> (uh) no they will they can the parents can only pick them (uh) the parents of the maid [ah]
the the guardian can only pick them up after one
so at least they got
anytime after one before one cannot
they need to be there they need to go through art class
they have an art class in the morning and then after that they have a language class in the morning as well
no they they change the language every day
ya so if if if this (uh) one (um) one
(uh) no that two kids or one kid in that class speak german
and then we'll go through german
like how do you speak at home like okay can we learn something new from you today
so that day when I was there as a trial teacher
(uh) one kid is (err)
half german half japanese actually there's a lot of japanese mix <malay>kat</malay> over there
ya
half german half japanese so
and then (uh) <malay>dia</malay> like
<malay>dia</malay> like literally like
(um)
tell us like okay (uh)
<malay>kat rumah</malay> like this is how I talk to my parents
like
okay I will teach you something today like I he is he is actually a very bright person
like ya at home okay before we eat we will say our prayers like that
like it's usually it's it's like (uh) and then the kids will like [orh] then they will (uh)
try to <malay>macam</malay>
(uh)
attempt to attempt to say the language also [lah]
and then it's very nice and then okay then the most interesting part is
their bath time
if before their shower time right
they okay if they are like
sticky or they like sweaty
the teachers will ask them to shower
but because (uh) the age five and six they're big enough they can shower their own
but boys and boys [lah] girls and girls
and then the three and four
ya after like half an hour before that is like usually
like they go we go outside to the to the playground and then we play there for half an hour
and then after that we come back okay we ask them to drink water first
wipe their sweat and then they will shower quick shower they will change
and then after that they will sleep
they know it's their naptime (uh) they (uh) then after that they had lunch first then they will sleep
and then the lunch
about one hour
twelve o'clock twelve to one
(mm)
before that <malay>dorang makan</malay> so it's like an early lunch like that
<malay>makan</malay> and then
ya
ya the parents have to make sure that before they come to school they already [dah]
feed breakfast [lah]
and then after that when they wake up they still <malay>kasi</malay> snacks
they have like a snack [lah] like sandwich or like biscuit with Milo
ya
and then they'll continue whoever that (uh) doesn't go home
then just continue so like
when I left at one [kan]
I think
I I left half day but I I stay a bit a bit later [lah]
to help them I stay until about one forty five two like that
(err) when I left
actually only left from forty five
only left about twenty kids
ya about twenty kids that the parents bring home or the maid bring back home
ya so it's actually quite it's tiring [lah]
<malay>penat penat gila</malay> I think
ya but the funny the fun thing about
being with them is the time pass by very fast
and they are such that like very
curious soul
they like ask me like where are you from why do you want to be a teacher
why are you here today
like can you help me can you help me to peel the apples please
and then when I said why not you peel it yourself
like okay no (uh) you wash you hands
and you peel it yourself I'll I'll I'll teach you how
okay sure like ya
so there's like [oh] my god (uh) and then like there is one three years old still wearing diapers
and then after that (um) I think he he <malay>apa ni</malay> (um)
ya he's shy with me because he never seen me before

so like I was mentioning just now we have to do it
as soon as possible
(uh) it's like I mentioned just now
you are starting work soon
[ah] kids also starting school soon
(um)
<malay>hari raya</malay> also coming in

because (uh) now I think the cases in singapore is more or less quite stabilised

(mm) <malay>dan</malay> <malay>dan apa itu</malay>
<malay>menggunakan</malay> (uh) vacuum special
I think <malay>beliau bercakap</malay>
<malay>dia cakap memang kotor</malay> [ah] <malay>macam minyak itunya bila dah bersih</malay>
[kan] <malay>air dia</malay> [kan] <malay>warna warna coklat</malay>
<malay>bukan coklat warna hitam</malay>
<malay>warna hitam</malay> [ah] <malay>kotor juga</malay> [lah]
then I <malay>macam</malay> I (uh) <malay>hari itu</malay> I <malay>bilang</malay> you [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>masak</malay>
<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> order <malay>menerusi ruangan yang ruangan lubang itu</malay> [lah]
[ah]
<malay>nanti kalau</malay> I <malay>nak letak loceng</malay>
<malay>jadi bila</malay> I <malay>nak panggil</malay> you <malay>sayang</malay>
I <malay>picit loceng yang itu</malay>
no [lah] you not my waiter <malay>tapi</malay>
you are my (uh) private
cook
ya (uh) I will buy all the ingredient
and then (uh) I will I will choose what menu that I want for the day
breakfast lunch dinner
supper
and ya
but you
because because the my appetite is you know
I need to eat at least three to four times a day because
the the the happiness happiness comes from
the wife's cooking
through the stomach
from the mouth through the stomach
ya
I think I'm I'm okay with the bar top counter (um)
you want a you want to put like a (uh) you have to hack the wall
and put the the glass
and have a a a a a what you call that a hole
it's like a hole in between so that I can order the food from you right and then when there are visitors
(uh) the visitor can sit at the bar top counter and chit chat with you while you are cooking and
can entertain the guest
ya because [ah] ya you are right the
the our kitchen is quite dark so I think if the open concept
more more light can go into the
kitchen
and I think
better [lah] because more more what you call ventilation
because our kitchen tends to get dirty and mouldy easily
because of the probably poor ventilation
and (uh) moist
so with the open open concept I think you will have a better ventilation ya
the hole the hole where I get to order the the food [lah]
ya
and then
ya
so you <malay>hari itu</malay> you <malay>cakap</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>kita kena tengok</malay>
(uh) <malay>harga</malay> quotation <malay>itu berapa</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> within budget I think we can
I don't know whether want to do a partial hack <malay>ke</malay> or
or total hack <malay>ke</malay>
so <malay>itu kita kena tanya</malay>
(uh)
<malay>kita punya</malay> [lah] what will be the quotation
you <malay>cakap</malay> you <malay>nak nak nak</malay> hack certain areas
<malay>dekat</malay> the platform

whether it's whether <malay>kalau</malay> within <malay>kita punya</malay> budget [ah]
ya (uh) ya platform <malay>itu pun dah</malay>
<malay>dah macam teruk sangat</malay>
so <malay>kena tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau kita nak</malay> hack and then <malay>nak pasang</malay> a new
<malay>baru punya</malay> platform
[ah] <malay>berapa</malay> <malay>akan</malay> quote <malay>kita</malay>

<malay>kalau kalau tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>tengok</malay> budget <malay>kalau macam</malay> #terover#
maybe just hack and just <malay>letak</malay> vinyl
[kan] [ah]
<malay>letak</malay> vinyl

(mm) ya I I think you you think that concept
(err) I'm I'm okay with that idea
can hack can hack (uh) (uh) the what you call that the the wall there
(err)
and then you (uh) you you were telling me the other time you want to put the sliding glass
and replace our old windows I think
I think it's a
it's a it's a good idea it's a good idea
[oh] <malay>dekat</malay> (uh)
(uh) <malay>dia ambil dari</malay> <malay>mana</malay>

<malay>bagus juga</malay> [lah] you <malay>ada</malay> survey survey <malay>tengok-tengok jadi</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> idea [lah]
[ah] <malay>nak nak</malay> <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>nak buat</malay> (uh) renovation [lah] <malay>nanti</malay>
ya [lah]
you think because (uh) Facebook and have been
spying spying on your on your your search

very nice <malay>cantik</malay>
you can consider <malay>tapi tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>harga dia berapa</malay>
(mm)
made to measure
ya I think I think ya I think the the the windows wear wear and tear over the years
so I think the there's there's a place for them to go in and out
I think the the the insects and lizard likes to come to our house I think cause
we have a lot of food for them
so I think they like to come to our house despite
(uh) multiple attempt to
(uh) kill them
they (uh) they they insist on coming here which I don't understand why
I don't understand because I've been I've been I've been like you know putting all those
(uh) it (uh) spraying the the lizard repellents (uh) spray all over the window all over the house
I've been killing them one by one and I still don't understand why why they keep on coming
I don't I don't I don't understand why
ya I think I I think so too [lah] the our our house here I think
(uh) the it's there's a lot of (uh) lizards
so like they are just now I try to kill one of the baby lizard but I think they are so fast and so
so so resilient [ah] even though I've tried to to to hit them [ah] is they as they still manage to
you know run away so resilient and
[oh] my god so (uh) I have to kill I have to kill them before they enter to the house
because once they are they they enter the house
very difficult to kill them because they our house got a lot of holes
a lot of places for them to to hide
and then it's so difficult to to kill them and then every night there's like you know like sound like
sometimes even my wife my wife can't sleep in the middle of the night cause of that because of that sound
ya
[ah]
is what <malay>kita kita mungkin dah dah bela dari kecil</malay>
<malay>sampai dia membesar membesar lama jadi dia dah dah dah dah sebati</malay> [ah] <malay>dengan rumah kita macam</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia pandai</malay> [tau] <malay>dia kalau kalau kita ada dia dia tak keluar tapi kalau kita macam tengah tidur atau apa dia senyap-senyap sebab</malay>
<malay>kadang-kadang nampak macam tahi cicak</malay> (err)

<malay>dengan</malay> (err) <malay>apa itu</malay>
<malay>dengan</malay> spray spray <malay>pencuci lantai semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>memang kadang-kadang tu kadang-kadang lepas kerja tu memang kadang memang memang nak memang nak bersihkan</malay>
<malay>tahi-tahi itu tapi kadang-kadang kita pun</malay>
(err) <malay>letih balik kerja satu hari itu kerja kita penat jadi</malay>
<malay>kita kadang-kadang kita tangguh</malay>
<malay>kita tangguh</malay>
time <malay>kita kalau kita tangguh tangguh tangguh sampai</malay>
<malay>berhari-hari sampai berminggu-minggu sampai kadang-kadang</malay> is (err) <malay>isteri</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>isteri kalau</malay>
(uh) <malay>itu dia akan</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] <malay>faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau kita tak tak tak buat itu faham-faham</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti apa isteri akan buat</malay> [kan]
(err)
ya
ya
<malay>memang</malay> (uh) ya [lah] I understand [lah] your your your fear your your concerns so that's that's why we are having this you know
planning to to to have the renovation ya
because it's I think it's about time [lah] it's about time I think the previous owners
I think they I think we are the I think four
fourth owner third fourth I'm not sure fourth or fifth owners (uh) I think the previous owners
did not do much
to change the the the the kitchen the fittings
so I think is it's it disintegrates to a point that we
we have to change it not not that not that
we ya it's it's a necessity [lah] it's a it's a need [lah] more of a need
necessity because everything has (err) you know
wears down you know
and (uh) our our kitchen looks quite dirty and (uh) rundown and (uh)
our our the (uh) you call it the flooring starts to (uh) wears down
[ah] ya
ya so I think it's about time that we we we change it
ya but belinda now seem so so so skinny I'm wondering what did what what did she do she is she on like a a diet or cause her her her face is so so small and so rounded
ya because it's so so much difference from the previous episode
the previous episode she was like more plump and
now she's more thinner and
ya I think I think probably she's on like a diet or something like that ya
ya three D innovation because we we watch quite a a lot of
episodes of renovaid
and (uh) they feature a few (uh) [lah] but (uh) so far three D contractors (uh) in terms of
the the the outcome [ah] it it it suits our taste [ah]
very nice it's very nice as compared to the other
in in some of the episodes ya three D has been consistently
[eh] very nice [lah] we like we like the design we like the the the feel of it
ya
ya but (uh) ya I think we can consider three D
to ask for
quotation
ya actually our kitchen we have replaced the hood we have replaced the stove
we have placed the what you call that (uh)
the kitchen the kitchen <malay>apa itu</malay>
not not not the sink [ah] kitchen tap
quite a few [lah] and then they even even in our two toilets we change the toilet bowls the sink
ya all all in we spend almost
one a K plus [oh] one one K is just for
for engaging the contractor to change all this but I think all in plus
all those things that we have replaced probably it adds up to probably two two K two K plus probably ya
so
ya hopefully we don't get the the contractor that we engaged previously who
who halfway (uh) <malay>merajuk</malay> and don't want to come
to finish off the [ah]
the finish to finish off the the things that
that he have to complete
ya
so
ya
ya
!aiya!
ya [lah] <malay>dia dia ini</malay>
I don't know [lah] it's both it is both (uh) frustrating and funny at the same time [eh]
we are was quite upset because it's
if the outcome is not
what we we we envision
and then is halfway done
and then (err)
ya when we try to follow up with him to complete
it seems like he cause he almost got
like probably nine ninety ninety five percent of the whole thing
so at near at the end I think he like
you know like <malay>malas-malas</malay> to to come
so the last one I think he already he I think he feel the
(uh)
self guilt [lah] I think so I don't know [lah]
so emotional then <malay>merajuk</malay>
ya
cement
[oh]
plaster
is is is is is very is you should say it's a really bad workmanship [lah]
ya
ya the was
(uh) ya it wasn't it wasn't properly installed
in terms of you know they they they overlay the new tiles and then
and then after that they put the but behind the they
I don't know why it's there's like a gaping hole
hollow
and then ya it wasn't supposed to be hollow
was supposed to be a a new tile at the back of the
so when we follow up with him he
I I
I I think he he he he doesn't
rectify the problem
ya
ya I think we ya I think probably it's a cheaper tile
so
and then if it's a cheaper tile then more money will go to him [lah] probably
ya
then that type of tile also very difficult to clean because it's so rough
difficult to maintain [oh] ya it's it's none it's not easy to I mean it's not slippery [lah] but
you want to clean it I think quite
quite difficult ya we should just choose the one that we choose the one that we want
for our tiles
ya
(mm) ya
ya probably ya we might we might see a few of them and
and then we can compare [lah] how
about what what's the what they can offer and how much they quote us and then from there we will see how [lah]
which one we we want to choose
ya <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>bilang</malay> you [lah] (uh) (err) <malay>kita kasi dia orang</malay> arrange
<malay>kita kasi</malay> arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay>
<malay>kita kita pun</malay>
<malay>mungkin</malay> will markup
or work <malay>kita punya</malay> budget so <malay>kita kasi</malay> them
arrange <malay>yang yang rendah sikit</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so
(mm)
ya
actually ya [lah] <malay>macam lampu ini semua kita dah</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita dia punya</malay> cost <malay>itu kita boleh kurang kurangkan lagi</malay> [ah]
(uh) <malay>banyak banyak kirakan banyak juga</malay> [lah] <malay>kita dah tukar yang sikit-sikit ini dah banyak juga</malay>
<malay>tukar lampu</malay>
so I mean <malay>sekarang ini yang</malay> the more <malay>yang lebih</malay>
major major [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana berapa dia orang akan</malay> quote
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) the the other time I I I
I <malay>tanya</malay> quotation ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> toilet <malay>itu kalau dua</malay> toilet
<malay>kurang-kurang pun</malay> at least <malay>satu</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> at least maybe three four K
<malay>dua</malay> toilet is around <malay>lapan</malay> K just toilet
[kan]
one (uh) so one kitchen two toilet
two considered the their package [ah]
[oh]
<malay>itu sekali terus habuk kirakan termasuk</malay> kitchen <malay>dapur bahagian sana</malay> [lah] <malay>sekaligus</malay> [ah]
ya
[kan] might as well [kan]
<malay>nak berhabuk biar berhabuk terus</malay>
<malay>tak yang yang bilik tak yang</malay> master bedroom vinyl <malay>kita</malay> almost thousand
so you then that time you buy over eight hundred around thousand
thousand four thousand [ah] <malay>seribu lima seribu</malay>
roundest I think thousand four or thousand five around there
<malay>datang</malay>
<malay>apa yang bilik bilik</malay> master <malay>kita nak buka</malay>
<malay>nak buka buat apa</malay>
<malay>agaknya</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau nak</malay> ya [lah] <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>memang</malay> I <malay>murah sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I think <malay>leceh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>bayar lebih sikit biar</malay> the <malay>biar yang yang yang</malay> the experts
do it
<malay>nanti minta siapa nanti sendiri yang nanti</malay>
ya <malay>tapi bilik ini dia punya</malay> flooring
<malay>kena tukar juga</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
yes <malay>dia sejuk panas sejuk panas</malay> [ha] <malay>tengok ini dah merekah</malay> [lah]
that <malay>yang yang</malay>
<malay>dia merekah nanti jadi macam</malay> [ah] master bedroom [ah] <malay>sebelum sebelum itu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam masuk air semua</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti itu dah sebab</malay> <malay>sebelah</malay>
<malay>sebelah</malay> toilet <malay>itu yang masuk air semua itu yang sampai terpecah</malay>
<malay>sampai menggelembung</malay> [eh]
<malay>ini ini bukan</malay> ya <malay>ini bukan yang</malay>
I don't think this the <malay>ini</malay> vinyl <malay>yang</malay>
so so so <malay>tengok</malay> [lah]
<malay>kalau</malay> master bedroom we do it around <malay>berapa</malay> [eh] thousand
okay [lah] thousand five [ah] [eh]
so <malay>kalau mungkin dua bilik ini mungkin</malay>
[oh] <malay>mungkin dalam dua ribu ke agaknya</malay> estimate <malay>nya</malay>
ya they can they can they can offer probably a better rate [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>kita pun kita punya</malay> budget <malay>pun tak banyak</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita buat yang yang</malay> urgent <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
<malay>sejuk</malay> [ah]
so I think ya [lah]
for I think for long term
for long term I think ya I think we can overlay with it now so when the tile
in (uh) (uh) in the future we have (uh)
<malay>kalau ada ada</malay> baby <malay>baru ke</malay> so at least
you know by now it it definitely better than the floor cause in terms of safety <malay>dia tak keras sangat</malay>
<malay>kalau jatuh pun</malay> at least <malay>dia ada macam</malay> (uh) cushion this vinyl [kan] underneath <malay>dia ada</malay> cushion [kan]
then <malay>tak sejuk sangat</malay>
overall I I prefer vinyl vinyl vinyl is so far has been
satisfactory for me
[ah]
ya
kitchen <malay>punya</malay> flooring
<malay>yang yang</malay> I I saw one of the picture you send
send me the one
with the kitchen <malay>punya</malay>
the one with the sliding and then that that that picture that video also have like a
like got that type of flooring [ah]
I think that [one] is vinyl I think that type of concept also is nice ya
back ya
that [one] the the more expensive one
(mm)
but have to
you have to ya [lah] everytime you cook have to clean it up
you know ya
water water water sucking what
absorb what suck water absorb
but (uh) ya the one that we saw <malay>kak</malay> #doro# using I think !wah!
if we have the the budget can consider [lah] I think that one's quite expensive is around
!wah! but I find it like very good [leh]
and it's wireless
(mm)
ya I think because after Dyson came out with that thing so a lot of
(uh) brands (uh)
(uh) have that those type of (uh) two in one type of
vacuum plus mop
but I think that [one] very good [ah] (uh) I think
can can consider [lah] if we have the means
but now we !aiya! we see how for now we just use manually first [ah]
use the sucking mop [ah]
ya is now is difficult to find the refill
no
(uh) sometimes they have sometimes they don't have it so
have to have to frequently go there and see if they have stock up
expensive [ah]
ya that [one] really nonsense really nonsense
so difficult to find the the the the refill
so ya
but have you we still have to do our due diligence [ah] because like I told you earlier on
(err) ya they they get through Renopedia and happens that the the contractor I think halfway
they didn't complete the whole project and
they didn't complete and then ya it's a horror
quite quite quite a a sum of money
they they they lost to the
ya they didn't complete the project so have to be still we have still have to do our due diligence [lah]
ya
(mm)
the specific (uh) ya the specific person who is who is overseeing the the whole thing the
ya
[ah] ya ya correct correct see ya sometimes even though you are from the same company but different
you know if you get the the one
the bad ones then
even though you might have the bad one and the good ones in the same company so
ya like like you said you have
is the the I the the who is doing the the the thing have to be really
do our due diligence well [lah]
ya that specific
okay I want okay this person to to oversee the whole thing then
(mm)
ya I think we we ya as as
as the the the thing progresses then we play we pay incrementally [lah] ya I don't think we we we
we have we need
pay the whole lump sum
cause we just we might
ya [lah] like halfway never complete and then money all gone then difficult to get back
get back the money
(mm)
(mm)
(uh) I think this saturday we we settle (uh) #akid's# (uh) school first
cause we need to buy the uniform and
certain things that we have to prepare #akid# (uh) school
on feb
so probably after this week I think we can
ya we can start having appointment with them and discuss
(uh) the the the the renovation [ah]
(mm) so actually we K we we need to ya [lah] we ours we we are the one who should
direct them [oh] we want this we want this we want this
ya it's a collaboration [ah]
ya of of of course they have ideas some maybe some of the things they can do some of the things they cannot do
but [ah] ya we we are the one who should direct
the direction that we want

(mm) just rerun of friends and big bang theory

o
okay [lah] okay I take note [oh] ya by the way then that time (uh) besides from orphan black that time I saw you watching one show at netflix (uh) what were you watching
ppls what's that about
like orange is the new black
is is it a show
[oh] how many season <malay>mampus</malay> okay no thanks
money heist next season coming up by the way season five
like what
[oh] ya kingdom the zombie korean series
really
interesting
maybe later I see (uh) who are the actors
not particular but I know some of them
wouldn't say favourite but I think it's not bad but overall it's overrated
I mean this is just my opinion I think that is the most overrated (uh) hot shit on netflix people are comparing this to breaking bad like seriously
idea like the idea of the heist is pretty good I will give them but the few episode were quite intriguing and that's what got me hooked but it went downhill after few episodes the writing is just I don't know lazy the character development was good but for a few episodes after that it's just like filler afterwards
every character in the show is absolutely stupid even the professor right why would you tell angel where your hangar is
like that was absolutely unnecessary and could have made their operation like better and smoother
in fact every action by the professor was quite
silly why go to the scrap yard and risks being seen by potential witness then could have sent the serbs to burn the car for you why even go talk to the inspector at the cafe in the first place that's just asking for trouble and #raquel# finally puts everything together because she saw a brown strand of hair on the professor suit like really like so many other red flags and the brown strand of hair was what gave him away like really like among all the things like that was the most easiest clue
I mean this is just lazy writing to me but seriously the drama and shit if all the hostages that could have been solved if they offered everyone one million euros from
them to go in return for cooperating but then the cop security guards also locked up in the basement they could just let them go in the beginning
they could've saved oslo and avoided the explosion but everything is just so messy like the only hostage that elevated was the ambassador's daughter anyway I mean this show is overrated and stupid I can see why people compare it to breaking bad they have such bad taste but why need professional critics to the judge of what movie show are good or not I mean ya that's my that's just my [ah] two cents of it
I mean it ended already right or is it still on
I didn't think about it didn't cross my mind but
usually where should I buy I mean if it's a good chop chop sale like which platform is worth seeing like shopee lazada or

[ah] <malay>biar</malay> [lah] <malay>asal dia orang dua bahagia</malay> [lah]
[oh] serious [ah] are you buying
[oh] ya then (uh) #alesya# belated birthday celebration are you getting her anything
first hand
where you going to find it
!huh! but #azam# isn't he too young to ride already
how much is it
okay [lah] if you buying make sure you check everything first before you purchase [ah]
then like that
if you gave him the you going to get him into joined to competition or what [oh]
actually I've been thinking about it but I'm not too sure should I further my studies
really but
but then now times are hard what if I don't get get those kind of job
I will think about it [lah] I mean it's not that cheap it's not expensive but right now I barely will have full time job but
what you say is quite true [lah] degree is important I'll think about it [lah]
but then I don't know asking my friends they say some of them
just (uh) rather just take degree then find a job but nowadays degree (uh) sorry degree holders that just graduate also cannot fine job so I don't think there's a difference between diploma holders and degree
I mean right now times are really bad so actually quite impossible to get
a permanent full time job to me ya
ya like less than ten
and majority of them are just doing full time then only a minority are doing like part time degree while working full time and some of them only one or two because of they are in the uniform group there are in (uh) in there they get the bond and stuff like that
ya I mean like for example my friend work at rolls royce they get sponsored [lah]
like ya first at first paid for his diploma then after his long term contracts and stuff like that he wanted to further studies then because of his good conduct and everything they
able to land him a degree also they willing to pay for your degree then he continue his bond with the company [ah] I mean
(uh) usually been there for at least five years ya his salary bomb went up a lot but I mean considering he (uh) when he joined the company he only got higher NITEC then after that when you join he continue with the bond then they continue his studies with (uh) a part time diploma then he manage to get then he keep increasing so at the same time also his position also went up not too high but above average
(uh) he is under maintenance side and technician (uh) if I'm not wrong (uh) under the engine side
building and you know testing and stuff like that from what I know [lah]
as much as I would but my diploma isn't under engineering mine is under so it's quite off I mean considering most of them
I'm not too sure if they need any specialist or whatever because
the company is quite well known so I'm sure in a way they got
you know like sources to who to hire as ever that I mean considering himself
already sit at the company quite long so I think the people there are quite you know long term service I think
but I don't know [lah] I mean
another friend of mine he signed on as (uh) prison warden ya (uh) he he is he sign on for I think five years five or ten years the bond then
(uh) the benefits you get a house nearby his workplace (uh) at just besides #changi# prison so
in a way beneficial for him [lah] don't need to stress about you know buying bidding and stuff like that so everything's in place [ah] for him
if I'm not wrong [ah]
[oh] (uh) he was my classmate in poly so we both we both have diploma ya he's a guy
ya and if I'm not wrong last I saw him he he rank up again
if I'm not wrong ya but what I heard is that
they can you know they can rent (uh) not sure if they can rent the place or what because I heard some they (uh) they do some investment meaning they stay at the quarters but then they buy flats but then (uh) they rent out so it's either they rent out their quarters or they rented the they they bought if I'm not wrong [lah]
ya if I'm not if if I'm not wrong five or ten years [ah] that one I'm not too sure but I think he is sticking to diploma only we call
ya it seems like it I mean it depends I guess cause even now like you know the brand decathlon ya my friend she works there then (uh) she told me about the benefit (uh) when she just join full time they even (uh) give you (uh) benefits like continuing your studies to pay for it and stuff like that ya even (uh)
another friend of mine (uh) she works at adventure if I'm not wrong it's in charge of those you know rock climbing activities at the new #khatib# home ya she told me about it
they also provide (err) you to you know encourage you to further your studies but
if you have only higher NITEC then you ask you to they will encourage you and it depends on your conduct [lah] but and all ya
(err) adventure no no it's is it's not brand it's more of like a company in-charge of (uh) fitness and wellness something like that like you know the new ya it's not retail ya ya she is going to continue next year ya because she just join the company [eh] not degree diploma sorry if I'm not wrong she told me that (err)
the company will pay until she finish her studies ya but then it's not like a bond but it's something like a bond that means she have to stay under the company until you get a diploma something like that if I'm not wrong in a way I mean it's not that I don't want but ya it's the end of year so it's quite hard for me to get a job
ya I mean it's end of the year so hardly companies are hiring usually they hire like you know the starting of the year so ya ya I'm not
okay I mean ya [lah] just help me out if I need
fourth december he
(uh) fourth december [ha]
ya he replied after you you told me you you send to him already I already texted him saying that I send my resume and he replied saying that he will get back to me by next week so ya that's by via whatsapp
ya
(uh) she told me (err) what she experienced before is that sometimes it takes a while for them to get back ya because (uh) she worked under that company when she was intern and also when she graduated [oh] she also she also has degree by the way
(uh) chemical chemical science meaning I think (err)
quite in that
in terms of chemistry ya (uh) right now she's just like me waiting for but ya she still searching for you but the only cons is that
the only downfall about her is that she graduated earlier this year so it's been quite a while [lah] ya ya because she was look she wants to work in the lab but then most of them offer her like #jurong# island that kind of thing that share more of like
(uh) exposed to outside chemicals she rather do lab testing and stuff like that but then right now I think it's quite strict for them to hire new people because of COVID and stuff
she graduated from if I'm not wrong
ya
okay [lah] anyway
my bike what what you mean
(mm) my plan is I send the cover set to spray to change to be the only colour in singapore and after that
[ah] that one I settled already so next is to
to not say overhaul my engine but
in a way to they call it up spec meaning to make it faster so right now it's still under testing it's already done by there's some a bit of loose ends to need to figure out what's the problem and stuff
ya in a in a way
ya both actually
ya in a way he told me to test drive first then at the same time
(uh) tested but then haven't tested like full on the road like really try to get top speed and stuff like that
ya I plan to use it I hope to get everything done before end of december because I really want to use that bike
and the same time to use it on new year's countdown don't know if there will be a new year's countdown also
no like to see fireworks and stuff but at the same time able to take photo with my bike and with the fireworks at the background but don't even know if there's a
fireworks so
I'm not too sure I I wasn't looking forward to it because when I research online it was not much an option so at same time
with the strictness of COVID going on and stuff so pretty much and I've seen some people who went for staycation [oh] my god the the queue I can't even take it I can't even I can't even be patient when queueing up to enter the mall doing the safe entry what else with me going to staycation I think I'll go bonkers with it
for more than four hours
ya the breakfast they waited so long and they have to queue outside the hotel so you tell me you you think I will want to wait
I saw it on tiktok
someone someone did like a review like
you know is this hotel worth it but then ya so they showed majority of it is at the bad side of it because there's so much people they check in from two it became
up to four so
the queue is like
just to check it itself is really people queuing until outside of the hotel already so that's how bad it is I can't remember I forgot if I'm not wrong was it concord
or something like that
[a'ah] (uh) engineering informatics yes <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> is more on
(uh) engineer <malay>punya</malay> side more on not say maintenance <malay>dia punya</malay> more on testings
his job is basically [ah] what I know is related to his course so for him he has the upper hand mine is more on network and routers and everything like coding programming everything it's basically like how you're using your phone right now [ah] ya I do that kind of job behind the scene
I not too sure because so far not much people joined using background ya but maybe I can try under rovers the one (uh) ya <malay>yang</malay> test <malay>setakat masuk</malay> <malay>setakat duduk</malay> from point A to point B back and forth back and forth for I don't know eight hours but not bad [lah] the pay that's I heard
I mean I don't know but I'm looking forward maybe work like <malay>abang azhar</malay> on hands on stuff on the component and stuff ya or maybe I dunno maybe in charge of there because I have a friend who works at as well [ah] he he works at <malay>dia kerja kat</malay> #jurong# (uh) water catchment area so his job is to keep track of the water level (uh) when it rises when it lowers (err) which areas going into rain whether certain areas flooded or not that kind of thing basically it's like
I wouldn't say call centre is more like a to overview (uh) every (uh) mostly entire of singapore like know the <malay>longkang</malay> and stuff like that
okay [lah] not bad I mean he is considered full time but they call him a intern cause <malay>dia masih dia orang</malay> sponsor <malay>dia orang</malay> sponsor <malay>dia sambung belajar</malay>
[a'ah] <malay>dia tengah ambil</malay> part time diploma
ya <malay>dia tengah ambil kat</malay> (uh) singapore poly because near to his workplace ya <malay>bayar sampai</malay> <malay>bayar sampai habis</malay> (uh) second year <malay>ke atau</malay> I forget I never got
in depth about it
I think should be contract staff ya very beneficial
(um) maybe [lah] I guess see how
but <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
I mean first choice would be
second then third maybe I want to try back my old intern company ya
I'm not too sure but I can maybe ask the cause I still have her contact so maybe I can ask her about it ya ya I think should be the same [lah] but I'm not too sure if the company is still going on or not because they're they're small (uh) company so
but might not know if there still lasting that long or not because they are just basically sub com so ya okay then
I wouldn't mind but I'm not too sure what else because usually people just know (uh) you know they ride by they <malay>saman</malay> people and then some of them is under roadworks they supervise construction site and stuff and some they handle [ah] like one my friend she intan at (uh) hers is under
something to do with like
parking and stuff like that like she's the overview like the eye of it behind all the cameras something like not really I wouldn't want to sit behind a computer for like eight hours and stuff
ya I guess I mean for now might as well just take whatever that's open up for me [lah]
[oh] ya I I wouldn't mind my all my friend work just behind our house and his says just like five minutes away from us ya I mean
(uh) engineer but ya [lah] I mean wouldn't (uh) wouldn't know if the company needs or what but from the look of it for his side under engineer
his working schedule is quite okay there's work life balance there he starts work at six forty five ends at two forty five ya so basically technically you got the whole day to yourself in the end
considering him working there he told me that he can everyday can
(uh) if you want to you can so ya when I heard he
<malay>dia bantai</malay> [jer] <malay>gaji dia besar</malay>
I mean <malay>kalau</malay> <malay>pun</malay> not bad (uh) <malay>dia</malay> <malay>sampai</malay> what two let's say you <malay>habis</malay> two forty five you extend what <malay>pukul lima pukul enam</malay> then after that
it's just another few more hours so okay [what]
ya I think so [oh] ya ya <malay>yang tadi kita berbual-bual</malay>
I'm not too sure considering she's quite picky and she always like to take her brother and sister toy so
ya but I don't know I mean if want to talk about clothes her mother always buy for her lots and lots of clothes I myself also don't know what else to get her
okay
(mmhmm)
[oh] ya by the way that your bike
what you gonna do with it are you gonna change the cover set or are you just gonna leave it like that
X one R
!huh! I thought it's under your name
ya <malay>ke ingat</malay> [oh]
(uh) there are demo too young because

[oh]
[ha] chain
chain adjust
<malay>tak semestinya bising apa ada lagi benda yang</malay> (uh)
<malay>akan</malay>
!huh! <malay>sebab dia bising mungkin kadang-kadang</malay> clutch housing <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> bearing <malay>kat dalam</malay> engine <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> piston <malay>banyak benda yang akan</malay> effect your bike
[oh]
ya [lah] me [lah] I mean [ha] <malay>kalau boleh sebanyak-banyaknya</malay> ya <malay>tapi</malay> the reason I want to use is #ayie's# not say <malay>lumba</malay> your bike considered
<malay>untuk budak-budak</malay> (err) <malay>bawa motor nakal tapi</malay> you <malay>bawak terus jadi</malay> motor <malay>apek</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>kalau gitu</malay> how about <malay>kita</malay> share
<malay>apa</malay> X one <malay>apa</malay> (uh) [oh] [oh] class two A <malay>ke</malay> class two B [oh] two hundred [oh]
!alamak!
<malay>tapi tuan dia sendiri tak duduk bawa buat apa menyemak kat</malay> carpark
<malay>habis</malay>
okay [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> at the same <malay>time nak kata</malay> <malay>nak kata sayang tapi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> boring <malay>ke tak boleh bawa lebih dari enam puluh</malay>
<malay>tapi ni</malay>
<malay>ubah suai ikut</malay>
<malay>kesedapan</malay> at the same time <malay>untuk keselamatan enam puluh bawa</malay> motor <malay>boleh</malay> jam <malay>boleh rosak takde ke fikir macam gitu</malay>
[oh] that time he ask me (err) he he asked me that (uh) how much I earned when I do foodpanda and grab and stuff like that
because he he scheduled somehow
got a bit <malay>lepak</malay> [ah] in a way so he thought want to earn more money
so I told him like roughly [lah] how much I earn then he was shocked I earn sometimes I earned as (uh) much more than his monthly but I told him [lah]
I told him [ah] that time I I hit about (uh) four thousand plus
and he said he was shocked [ah] my pay
was higher than him then tell him [lah] but I work until I want to die like that
then
I told him [lah] the difference between delivery and permanent full time is that we chase for the money
people always think doing delivery easy but it's not necessary so like ya I was telling him the pros and cons some of the venue are very slow then have to you know the weather in singapore is always unpredictable sometime it rains sometimes it's hot sometimes it's both
I told him [lah] to think to think twice but I told him it's okay to do for part time for side income but I tell him [lah]
with his back
she used for it's okay for you to use to to go back and forth for from work
if you want to use for delivery
I'm not too sure [lah] because he's riding a scrambler so you know with back delivery and staff in the height of the bike
you know and ya at the same time scrambler the pick up is very strong so I'm afraid if he and those like soup or anything might spill or what
you know
no he he he was dead serious <malay>dia betul-betul</malay> (uh) dig through everything asking me <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) all three companies had deliveroo foodpanda grab <malay>apa dia punya</malay> benefit <malay>apa dia punya</malay> you know (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> (uh) <malay>akan jadi kalau gini gini semua</malay> so I <malay>ceritakan dia</malay> [lah] I was (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
I <malay>bilang dia macam</malay>
okay <malay>kalau</malay> foodpanda <malay>leceh dia kita kena</malay> book shift <malay>kalau</malay> deliveroo <malay>dengan</malay> grab (uh) anytime <malay>kita boleh</malay> start <malay>boleh</malay> offline
then I told him [lah]
(uh) <malay>antara ni tiga</malay> company <malay>tak semestinya</malay> (uh) <malay>masing-masing ada (uh) <malay>dia punya</malay>
benefit <malay>dia tapi</malay> at the same time ya [lah] he <malay>tak boleh cerewet</malay> [lah] <malay>kita kena banyak sabar</malay> because
I <malay>pernah tunggu</malay> one hour for just one <malay>makanan</malay> so one hour you guys is like you working part time so it's not really worth it man actually I can earn
up to twenty one dollars when I do delivery because like you know per order is less than one hour so
and I told him [ah] I it's not everyday is sunday so he has to be patient with it [lah]
<malay>dia macam dia macam</malay> okay [jer] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi</malay> at the same time <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal motor tu</malay> [kan] <malay>pun</malay> under <malay>ayah</malay>
<malay>pasal dia malas habis dah tahu sekarang barang-barang dah mahal nak cari duit pula</malay> so okay [lah] pros and cons [ah] <malay>siang-siang boleh buat tak nak tapi</malay> understand [lah] maybe back then his workload was too much in a way [lah] <malay>pasal dia kata</malay> (uh)
<malay>ada budak baru masuk</malay> this and that so <malay>macam</malay> workload <malay>dia macam kurang tapi macam</malay> spread (uh) evenly [ah] so <malay>untuk dia</malay>
(uh) advantage [ah] <malay>pasal dia dah tak buat malam punya</malay> shift <malay>lagi dia ada pagi atau petang</malay> so that time <malay>dia pernah tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>dia ada bilang dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>cadangan dia kalau dia buat</malay>
<malay>kalau dia kena pagi punya</malay> shift <malay>lepas habis pagi dia dia</malay> (uh) [ha] <malay>dia buat</malay> delivery <malay>dia dia kayuh daripada</malay>
(uh) <malay>lepas maghrib</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai malam</malay>
<malay>tapi tak tahu dia akan buat ke tak</malay> [lah] <malay>dah cakap dah</malay> (uh) <malay>dia cakap senang</malay> [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> bag <malay>kau abang tak payah beli</malay> so you know [lah] your brother <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
!huh! ya [lah] <malay>dia dia berbual kat orang</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>cakap jangan bilang gitu-gitu tapi tak tahu dia buat ke tak</malay> [lah]
ya <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>dia sendiri</malay> that time <malay>nak pinjam orang duit nak beli motor orang pun terkejut entah kalau tidak dia nak beli</malay> <malay>padahal dulu dia ada</malay> <malay>yang kat yang kat bawah dia tak suka dia cakap banyak</malay> problem this and that so I don't get his point [ah]
ya I'm also confused because
before he rides
extra four hundred which is owned by our dad he already ride so he sold it off then after that our dad pity him and give him one of his bike
but then now he suddenly want to buy his own bike so I'm quite confused
<malay>pasal tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah bertahun-tahun tahun ni juga dia sedar</malay> [oh] <malay>ni motor ayah tak boleh pakai suka-suka</malay> you know <malay>tiba-tiba rasa nak kasih balik tak paham</malay> [ah] <malay>dah banyak dah bawa berapa tahun baru tahun ni juga dia sedar tu bukan motor dia</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> <malay>tak kirakan dia nak kasih balik</malay> motor <malay>bagi kat ayah</malay> so <malay>dia beli</malay> motor <malay>sendiri</malay> after <malay>dah berapa tahun</malay> ya <malay>dah bilang dah dia punya tu tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>mana dia nak ikut minat mana dia nak ikut kerja</malay>
(uh huh) <malay>dia tak tahu bukan nak kata berbual tin kosong berbual tak betul</malay>
<malay>tak pasti</malay> [ah] <malay>tu kena tanya ayah</malay> (mmhmm) <malay>mungkin kot</malay>
then [oh] then that time <malay>apa abang ada tanya</malay>
(err)
(uh) he he <malay>dia tanya akak kerja</malay> grabfood <malay>macam mana</malay> (mmhmm) then I said [lah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> I (uh) I say [lah] the difference between us is that she only work during the peak hour I work almost full shift
then he was he was shocked [lah] I say no [lah] because he didn't thought he would do you would do that kind of job I mean I'm I'm I'm shocked [lah] he he he judge but whatever [lah] I mean
I mean you just want to try try only [what] then and then I told him [lah]
like it's all up to individual [lah] I mean all
I I tell him [what] all your three younger siblings all got do delivery only you never do
you do delivery I think you fight with the customer or the vendor only then then <malay>dia terus bingit</malay> [ah] <malay>dia cakap apa maksud kau cakap memang</malay> [lah] <malay>kau panas baran macam gini macam mana</malay>
<malay>tunggu sikit lambat kau dah maki-maki</malay> how
<malay>tak orang tak takut dia kena buang orang takut dia kena</malay> viral [jer]
ya <malay>ada yang</malay> that time #punggol# <malay>budak-budak</malay> grab <malay>gaduh dengan</malay> vendor <malay>pasal tak tahu sabar</malay> I think it was some promotion [lah] then I think
too many people order online so
ya was it some bubble tea shop
(uh) I told him (uh)
ya <malay>jangan jadi</malay> viral I mean that we do even though people might might not remember
when the video but they can remember your face if people take it closely to your face [lah]
[oh] [oh] ya my friend my friend <malay>kerja</malay> #roo# (uh) this entire week then she managed to earn quite a lot [lah] even though
(uh) was that even though it's raining and stuff now roo
#roo# is is so good because they give without hesitation they know it's been raining they add more additional money like you know per docket (uh) add another three dollars or four dollars ya they add another extra surcharge for you know for riders so to me it's reasonable [lah] because
I mean <malay>kita dah layan hujan habis</malay>
<malay>takkan</malay>
<malay>bayar sikit</malay> [jer] you know so for #roo# to do that I'm very amazed [lah]
[oh] <malay>tak</malay> distance <malay>dia memang dia dia</malay> add on <malay>tapi ni dia tambah lagi</malay> because <malay>dia orang perasan</malay> somehow I think <malay>orang</malay> complain <malay>pasal hujan</malay> then you know safety and stuff so at least
while they ride in the rain
they know that is worth it because the amount they the amount they add on is
worth it and you know <malay>macam berbaloi</malay> [ah]
[oh] okay [lah] maybe I see about that
ya for #roo# <malay>macam kadang-kadang boleh dapat lima belas</malay> so if compared to grab I have to take three orders <malay>tapi</malay> three orders <malay>pun tak semestinya</malay> I can get within less than one hour
ya <malay>waktu</malay>
but okay [lah] I mean I wouldn't complain already [lah] I mean as long as the market is good already [lah] because panda right now sometimes the system cock up they send from one end to another end and then the docket they say
(uh) now (uh) based on distance but the distance still crap and the docket is still crack so I don't get what panda is doing a lot of people are complaining but at they same time
we ya but it's not that we have a choice because even if complain also and of this after that to change the the price
ya because I saw that time when I sent to #hougang# mall
plain clothes the act like they are but actually they are just grab enforcers I don't get
why and while my one of my friend who is a good girl who do grab for fun then I (uh) she she ride but she put under but (err) bicycle ya she did same like you but
I told her [lah] [ah] they there's cons doing that because if you get catched and stuff like that yesterday that you might get banned and stuff then she said you tell me [lah] what's the logic behind this grab enforcers [oh] I mean I'm working [what] but at the same time it doesn't make sense because you catch me you ban me from work but then you never tell me that
when I was applying for it like at the and stuff so
it's like to me it's like you in a way you con people you know like just not wearing a shirt
you can get banned and at the same time if
you are not using the bag you can get somehow like demerit points or something like that so to her she say [lah] like
<malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> no she didn't she wasn't aware until I tell her ya because she works (err) when she wants she was so she's not really depending on grab but she just if you just work for the fun of but ya when I tell her this so for her to do actually heard about this to her she find it like she pity for the other riders who get affected by this [ah] because it's considered their rice work [ah]
[oh] is it like that time came up on strait times the the one fourteen year old fifteen kid call using grab app saying
but that's unfair [what] I mean you already delivered until you take from the shop and then they complain so grab is basically customer service friendly and not rider friendly [ah] !wah! that sucks
okay I'll take note [lah]

start okay okay so
okay start from the
so he stuck at lookout for suspicious character [lah]

<malay>dia dengan budak ashraf ini</malay>

<malay>habis dia tengok macam alim-alim</malay> type <malay>tak</malay>
okay so
[oh] so just the informal ya
<malay>ini lepas si ashraf itu sudah balik</malay> [ah] <malay>habis</malay>

(mm)
[ah]
supporting [lah] ya <malay>dayah yang kena</malay> support [lah]
[ah] <malay>habis apasal</malay> taxi driver
okay
<malay>tapi dayah</malay> but [oh] my lord <malay>macam</malay> like
#dayah# is at the stage of her life that she's driven and <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of aspiration
<malay>habis dengan orang ini walaupun dia</malay> educated <malay>ke atau dia kaya ke</malay> at the end he's just going to be having this (err) aura of like <malay>macam</malay> relax jack and that's not gonna fit well the dynamics
<malay>nanti tahu tahu</malay>
<malay>tahu tahu belakang hari dia yang suruh nanti hidayah</malay> [eh] (uh) <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>berbual pasal ini</malay> okay <malay>lepas itu</malay>
<malay>dia yang nanti belakang hari</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> it's so like you can totally see right away this might go right he'll be the kind of husband <malay>lagi</malay> worse <malay>kalau dia</malay> have this patriarchal kind of stance that he'll ask that he ya worse if you the add up like this particular profile to him like character <malay>ke apa</malay> if he has it okay that <malay>macam</malay> he might ask #dayah# to stop working and things like that [lah]
<malay>habis</malay> so you just say that [ah]
#dayah's# [ah] [ah]
(mm) (mm)
it's about the character the driveness the dynamic of this guy ya <malay>dia nak kena</malay> match that's the thing okay that's the thing I don't understand <malay>pasal</malay>
this whole like family who <malay>yang macam</malay> [oh] <malay>tahu benda orang orang</malay> I don't know family <malay>ke sesiapa</malay> [ah] <malay>yang rasa</malay>
[oh] <malay>lebih baik</malay> (err) <malay>halalkan percepatkan</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> as if <malay>macam itu ikut sunah nabi</malay> okay they take that part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage but the other part of the <malay>sunah nabi</malay> of marriage the that that the prophet also say that you should marry somebody that is of your standing not to say that it's like <malay>macam</malay> your social status your social economic status kind of standing but it's somebody <malay>yang macam</malay> that <malay>macam</malay> is complementary to like your personality
<malay>mana boleh macam</malay> like that [ah] ya you cannot take somebody who is super relax jack (err) <malay>macam</malay> complacent you know that kind of personality plus the a very driven kind of person it will totally clash
ya ya but that don't you see <malay>macam</malay> that is the thing that <malay>orang</malay> just always pick and choose what they want suiting what they want of the religion to suit what they just pick and choose what they want of the religion to suit what they need it to suit you get what I'm saying part part <malay>nak kahwin cepat macam</malay> [oh] [ah] <malay>ikut sunah nabi percepatkan</malay> but part part <malay>lain macam</malay>
to get somebody that is competent with you <malay>ini semua tak tak ambil kira</malay> [ah]
so fed up [ah] this type of thing
<malay>habis zina cakap zina macam mana</malay>
(uh) anyway this boy the call you <malay>abang</malay> or what
he should be comfortable with it [lah] <malay>dia ada kakak apa</malay>
I don't think he even thinks like this [lah]
[oh] so that's when he call you <malay>abang</malay> [ah]
[oh]
foresight [a'ah]
so the conversation <malay>dengan zina</malay> (err) <malay>bila yang ashraf itu sudah keluar</malay> it's more of like what what did you say to <malay>zina pasal yang</malay> the growing up and then <malay>pasal pasal</malay> making a <malay>apa</malay> plan <malay>habis pasal apa lagi</malay> like what else did you address
did you say that did you say
I think you know what you can from now on you can use this card against her every time she like this like this [ah] <malay>kata nak kahwin nak kahwin nak kena</malay> wake up music just just just use this card
<malay>kata nak kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>orang nak kahwin macam gini ke nak cara itu</malay> <malay>tengok sampai perempuan agaknya</malay> she will just be fed up one day <malay>tapi betul apa macam</malay>
what do you expect that's the very doesn't this tell us so much about why
we feel you're not ready about marriage because what do you expect <malay>macam</malay> do you expect it to be something that you will be led by this man who is has her leadership character who's spur and can lead you to be a better muslim blah blah blah
then your life like and then you can just trail along do you really expect that and do you think it's that way really
easy go easy (uh) <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> (uh) [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>itu tak ada pendirian</malay> [lah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
no <malay>macam gini</malay> the thing <malay>yang dia nak kena</malay> differentiate is <malay>ada bezanya</malay> easy-going <malay>dan tak ada haluan</malay> this is the thing #zina# you are which one
easy-going <malay>atau</malay> actually you are directionless
don't confuse don't conflict the two you know
you said that [ah] <malay>untuk si ashraf ini</malay> [ah] <malay>habis ashraf cakap apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>budak ini pun tahu ke tak</malay> the background of #zina#
are you sure or not #salim# I don't think so these two people only get to know each other two years I know you more than two years we've only gotten serious for two years and I know you even before that yet even then
you still there's so much for us to discover
so this easily two years <malay>baru</malay> meet up <malay>tahu</malay>
!haiya!
I mean I !haiya! I don't know what to feel about this
I mean yes <malay>macam</malay> I am thankful and it's nice to know <malay>budak ini budak baik</malay> (err) so like what #izat# say <malay>kau tengok</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>budak baik kau tengok gerak alih dia</malay>
ya [lah] ya <malay>tapi</malay> I don't want after this #izat# say !huh! <malay>kau tengok macam aku cakap</malay>
<malay>dia budak baik</malay> I hope #izat# doesn't go like this [lah] ya but anyway
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] don't know whether he has the mental capacity to differentiate that
ya
send ya
must take this action
<malay>sambil lewa</malay> anyway what I was saying okay
I know continuing from what I I was saying just now I'm I'm thankful and okay good that he's a nice guy
but I don't know I don't know whether (uh) I
I really don't know [lah] this the the dynamics of the relationship how healthy this is but then again I really don't know if this is what it takes <malay>macam</malay> to
push <malay>zina tapi</malay> I don't know if at the end of this product is #zina# will be
pushed or #zina# will be pulled down
you get what I'm saying it can really work both ways ya that's the thing I don't want <malay>macam</malay> at the end of the day not not at the end of the day but at the end of it all #zina# loses <malay>dia punya</malay> identity because this she is she is <malay>macam</malay> dissolving into a very
(err) big personality how to say not big [lah] firm firm firm personality you get what I'm saying right
ya
[ah] it's so it's so possible you know it's so possible <malay>lagi lagi dengan zina macam dia</malay> see that I don't know [lah] sometimes they'll see some examples around the that as if <malay>macam</malay> she and she that makes her think that this is the
ideal way that <malay>macam</malay> you know like [ah] a woman shall be like <malay>macam</malay> be led by a man that kind of thing and
your life will turn out well
[ah]
at because at some point there will be a point that <malay>macam</malay> she will realize that her identity is being consumed if she doesn't
step out step up and out of it and then when this particular point comes
I wouldn't know how it'll she'll be addressed
no it's not say <malay>tak lepas tangan</malay> it's just it's just that
for the fact that she hasn't explored her own identity now and with this incoming overshadowing person it makes it worse <malay>faham</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> because by right this is the age where she should be exploring her identity and she finds herself [tau] this twentieth (uh) twenty some age
I want to wish her well but at the same time I I just feel like I also don't know where this type of relationship dynamics will lead into it can be quite worrying
talk to #dayah#
<malay>tak pernah tanya dia zina tak pernah tanya</malay>
eye to eye
what what do you talk about personal things with #izat#
!huh! you talk about marriage to #izat# like what
this was before [lah]
seriously
but #dayah# said <malay>yang dia berbual dengan zina yang pasal dekat yang</malay> denmark <malay>itu</malay>
so it's okay what no it's not deeply personal I think I think you are getting this wrong
women like when we say personal stuff we really mean deep personal stuff <malay>orang punya</malay> personal is to us superficial
ya but #zina# can also ask you the same then why and why you and #izat# is always at loggerheads
no but I think you between you and you and #izat# are still pretty estranged isn't it
ya [lah]
ya [lah] because also also #dayah# always clamps her down
then you <malay>tak cakap macam dengan zina</malay>
at the end of the day #zina# #dayah# is still your sister <malay>macam</malay> you know she still cares for you [lah] then you know like
maybe she you <malay>tak cakap</malay> [lah] why why didn't you say to <malay>zina tadi</malay> like maybe she doesn't know how to show her care properly but she is concerned for you <malay>tak cakap dengan gitu tak cakap macam gitu</malay>
that's why I don't think she can see that way
so what's your plan
ya [lah]
ya ya
#hidayah# is clamping her down [lah]
ya ya
then <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>cakap pasal yang zina denga dayah ini</malay> mama and <malay>abah</malay> was there <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> you cannot chat <malay>ini</malay>
!huh!
my why is my recoding still (err) okay you continue <malay>kejap kejap</malay> ya my recording is kind of
[ah] [ah] [ah] where
<malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>habis</malay> nevermind <malay>lepas itu</malay> then she say what <malay>dia tak cakap apa-apa</malay>
no but you know why she walk off I think it's not that she she don't she doesn't see your point in this because I think to her like ya she's been close to #izat# ever since <malay>macam</malay> she's been involved with the basic babysitting of the
you said that okay
okay
<malay>habis dia cakap habis dia cakap apa</malay>
and just because #izat# is convenient to the topic that you want to pursue [lah] <malay>cuba kalau</malay> the topic that you want to pursue is actually about further studies <malay>kau rasa kau akan berbual dengan izat kau rasa izat</malay> will be supportive <malay>pasal apa</malay>
like it's still at the end of the day is very skewed to what is your agenda and what is your topic isn't it don't say that <malay>macam</malay> don't say that
you are <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [ah] it's not that she will see all this point
<malay>habis</malay> if I were to ever raise it up of course it will never go down very well in this
you said that [ah] then
<malay>habis cakap</malay> you're close to <malay>izat pergi</malay> [lah] <malay>suruh izat tolong</malay> [ah]
<malay>budak ni segan silu</malay> !wow!
ya
but that's because <malay>dia orang</malay> don't even see that they need work on it so that's why they are not even thinking of approaching you to <malay>tolong</malay> them and like mend this thing you know that because they they are not the point to need or to to work on it [lah]
but it's hard [lah] I mean it's also vary in age age difference <malay>macam</malay> I think if you have if you have not inculcated cultivated the relationship from young also
it's very hard and you will often require a certain (mm)
change of life events or certain
[oh] you also cannot engineer it [what] #salim# like <malay>macam</malay> you cannot be bringing the two of them together
<malay>habis</malay> expect <malay>dia orang macam</malay> (uh) to <malay>boleh berbual</malay> like at a very deep level <malay>mana boleh</malay> like it will also feel it's so <malay>janggal macam</malay> it was so it was just feel so weird [lah]

okay recorded okay
so what was what was it that you wanted to talk about
<malay>siapa</malay> [lah]
[oh] was it with his girlfriend also
serious [oh] is it because of his surprise birthday party (uh)
so what have you decided
[eh] how do you get her number [ah] I know you message her on right
then she gave her gave you her number
!wah! your friend is so going to feel betrayed [sia]
ya don't ever do that bro no no no no my friends should not contact without me
where there's me then <malay>baru ada</malay>
so [dah] decide
(hmm) [dah] <malay>macam</malay> [dah] <malay>macam</malay> project
so what's your plan plan A plan B plan C plan D
(hmm) <malay>tak suka</malay>
[orh]
but you think he okay or not
serious [ah]
I don't know I I don't like it when people give me surprise and don't tell me
I <malay>suka</malay> especially family friends boyfriend girlfriend husband all don't mix together
I don't know I just compartmentalise everything or if there's such a word to begin with ya ya ya that's what happens that's what happens for my life okay so what's your plan B
Pezzo pizza [lah]
(mm)
tourist stuff <malay>dekat</malay> #Sentosa#
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya cable car and
or go
Madame Tussauds that one is it
Tussauds Tussauds whatever [lah]
wait but you [dah] <malay>beli belum dia punya</malay> ticket
<malay>cari</malay> online [ah] I think <malay>ada yang ada</malay> twenty five per cent off [eh]
[oh]
okay
[oh] forty two dollars for two tickets
and you pay forty two
[oh] that's good deal man
[eh] can you share the link with me
it's not so much the beach [lah] because you all are going to <malay>macam tempat tempat</malay> the attraction right
(mm)
that's at Marina Bay <malay>punya tempat</malay>
you know the one <malay>yang kita pergi</malay> Marina Barrage <malay>itu hari</malay> [oh] because you took #Jihan# <malay>punya</malay> car (um)
before you <malay>sampai</malay> Marina Barrage before you turn ya it will be but I also never go to satay satay by the bay before
I wonder if they just sell satay
but expensive price
<malay>ada</malay> air-con <malay>tak</malay>
!alah!
!alah! are you going <malay>malam</malay> or <malay>pagi</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay then the weather won't be so bad
[oh] and fly kite
[oh]
can you please buy a good kite
[oh] ya ya ya ya your friend ya your friend did that right <malay>tapi tu buat sendiri ke atau</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> your own is
[oh] <malay>tak de</malay> tentage [ah]
<malay>sebab kalau nak</malay> tentage you can take mine
I don't know
[oh] but you need to find a good spot man I feel that day
[orh] ya [lah] I mean is at one corner [lah] if that's what you want <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak orang tak kacau</malay> then okay [lah]
but I felt because the
I think there are places which I see right people went right that had not shelter [lah] that had shade
ours was quite open <malay>dia</malay> exposed [ah] so
ya ya ya so that's why I'm saying like
(uh) given the circumstances I think that's not bad [lah] but I think I saw some of them <malay>duduk dekat</malay> nearer to the lift area that one <malay>tak kena panas sangat</malay>
what time you intend to go [ah] that's the point
(mm)
actually that day
<malay>kalau bawa</malay>
(mm)
but <malay>pernah tak</malay>
ya <malay>kalau tak pernah</malay> then better don't
#Seah Im# <malay>kat luar</malay> [lah] park <malay>kat luar</malay>
no no no I think you shouldn't tell him <malay>jangan bawa</malay> <malay>motosikal</malay> because if he doesn't bring his bike then <malay>dia rasa macam</malay>
<malay>asal</malay> [eh] normally we ya
you want to do a surprise you have to
make it blow the pants off like that like you know !fuh!
but <malay>muka</malay> girlfriend <malay>dia muka</malay> poker face <malay>tak</malay> is it she can [ah]
okay actually to me [lah] is the person the person who bring the surprise person right is very important
like #Razi# did very well for me I mean I cannot forget that
yes and you must really go with the flow of the story
actually right there is a possibility on the actual day he also don't want to go to either one of these places [ah] then what happen [ah]
[oh] he will [ah] okay okay (um) because if you have people like me very difficult you have to keep on changing plans
how long have they been together
[oh] okay so there was another birthday that
no because if they are used to you know
following each other's plan can but <malay>kalau</malay> the partner like me like that last minute say don't want [ah] I want today I got I got cramp [ah] I decide not to go to #Sentosa# then <malay>habis</malay>
gone
but ya that's very nice [lah] of the girlfriend
(mm)
no I thought if you got car then you go Marina Barrage
because marina barrage <malay>dia punya</malay> <malay>jauh</malay> [tau]
Marina Bay (uh) Marina Marina Bay [lah] [kan]
Barrage if you got no car you go #Sentosa#
because because #Sentosa# <malay>tak ada kereta senang</malay> that one you just take the monorail pay one entrance fee and you can take
[oh] because no no no no so regardless of where you go before that you still wanna go satay by the bay [lah]
[oh] okay then Marina Barrage makes sense [lah]
yes yes yes
(mm)
ya but do you wanna do you wanna jeopardise the surprise just so that you can have #meriahness# if there is
I mean !aiya! for me as long as you can actually get him to go out already is is good enough and not pick any sign nothing
no no suspicion no no
I seriously think that's a good idea too because #Sentosa# <malay>nak keluar pun leceh</malay>
ya ya actually it's true [lah] I I mean no I personally don't like #Sentosa#
no you wait wait wait you like the activity for #Sentosa#
<malay>apa</malay>
earlier [lah]
[oh] it's a weekend [ah]
[ah]
okay
[oh] ya I forgotten okay
cable car is one of them if I'm not wrong cable car
[orh]
cable car then <malay>yang</malay> Carlsberg <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>yang pusing pusing</malay> the thing that <malay>pusing</malay>
then <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>yang lima</malay>
actually I've never gone to the wax museum before [lah] in Singapore
I went I don't think I've been to the one <malay>yang dekat</malay> Singapore
Hong Kong I went to #Bangkok# <malay>tak salah</malay> [eh] with my husband once
with you once with my girlfriend once but I don't know which country was it
[ah] okay
but ya you share with me [ah] I also want to see [eh] since my staycation [dah] <malay>kena</malay> cancel [kan] so
[ah]
ya then you make him <malay>jalan</malay> also
but I'm pretty sure <malay>dia penat</malay> from going for <malay>kelas mengaji</malay> okay that's wrong but
I'm pretty sure if he's
what to do what time to go out
of course of course he makes his own decision
<malay>dia kat mana dia dekat</malay> <malay> bukan #Tampines#
the birthday boy is gonna be from
#Tampines#
not the other side of the Singapore right
[ah]
because <malay>kalau daripada</malay> #Tampines# actually it's a bit more difficult [lah] <malay>dia kalau daripada west area lagi senang</malay> [kan]
[ah] okay
I see [oh] it's not like she go and <malay>jumpa</malay> him somewhere and then they
wait where she stay again
near my house
[ah] near my friend's place okay okay okay
yeah <malay>ni macam</malay> papa [lah]
come on the shopping mall is next to you like I remember going to Orchard you know from one building to another and we actually take car
[oh] my god
anyway motor is convenient [ah]
but I think
[oh] really
so early [ah] it's indoor [what]
[oh] last entry <malay>dia bukan tutup</malay> last entry
<malay>bukan tutup</malay> so that means (uh) last
last entrance normally <malay>tutup</malay> one hour later [ah]
[oh] you (mm) okay [lah] I mean
get a one slice cake
that one is very
okay [lah]
because the time is going to be wasted there
I don't know I
(uh) I mean you are just the person who is just gonna follow [lah] !huh!
the final say
no she's going to be the one going through the shit
I don't like to be the one who has to surprise the birthday person because <malay>susah</malay> you really have to <malay>macam tak de</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> secrets out
I don't know how I'm gonna surprise people [lah] so I always leave it to other people
[oh] ya yeah
I have come to the age that I
cannot be bothered to do it
ya ya ya
when you reach there yes
you'll be like okay it's just another birthday
you like [ah]
no but seriously if your end your endgame is satay by the bay for dinner then Marina Barrage is better [ah]
food
<malay>berapa orang</malay> [sia]
for eleven that's <malay>mahal</malay> [leh]
okay all growing boys
ya but to me (mm) okay [lah] for occasions I think the place is okay
do they not know you yet
[oh] okay okay okay because she don't know you yet
(mm) then what she say
[oh] my god
(uh) then what did you tell her
ya ya ya ya
not just satay a lot of things that you don't eat
(uh) #mee# tom yum (mm) one of them
(um) <malay>nasi goreng</malay> tom yum
<malay>kat mana</malay>
you have to see you know whether you have to make [oh] but because it's a hawker centre <malay>tak yah buat</malay> reservation [ah]
no because now
[ah]
I won't enjoy it so
you don't eat a lot of thing even that kind of thing you just don't eat
<malay>habis</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>kalau</malay>
the you are going on a weekend right
satay by the bay might be quite packed you know
and you can't make reservation that's the problem it's not about the fact that it's packed it's the fact that you can't make reservations
<malay>korang bawa makanan tak gi sana</malay>
potluck [ah] <malay>macam</malay> picnic style [ah]
okay you have to go with the flow if if for whatever reason [lah] [eh] let's say
ya if satay by the bay let's say <malay>penuh nak</malay> #mams# [kan] then you find in that area <malay>apa lagi kedai makan [ah]</malay>

[oh]
ya [lah]
so you like ya I mean
it makes it less
how to say [ah]
[oh] but I don't like odd numbers I normally don't like odd numbers
so I have a group of friends that is only the three of us only and
sometimes it can be quite
quite quite unpleasant [lah] but okay [lah] I mean
it can be quite unpleasant at times but if you are very very close and there's no reason why two should be and one alone
then is okay
(mm)
but they make you feel included [lah]
I don't know
anyway I don't have a lot of big groups already
now I only have what okay so
my friends is only that #Shiqah# #Ad# #Razi# group
Tasha Cecillia
who else do I go out with I mean #Aidil# they all but I rarely get to meet him [lah] but I still consider him as someone I'm close
ya that's all my friends [sia] [oh] and my colleagues
my current colleague my ex-colleague
my ex-ex-colleague
[ah]
ya that one we got no other [eh] unless you want to bring the the <malay>bapa</malay> and the <malay>anak</malay> and the
but I think two person is much more better [leh] I feel [lah]
don't know [lah] I'm just antisocial in that way
I am
!aiya! but they going week weekend [ah]
actually now now is not a good time to go already in my opinion
you passed the free and easy period already now start to pick up already
that time [ah] I see my friend <malay>pergi</malay>
like (err) <malay>kosong</malay> the whole you know where the
the one that they always do (uh) free dance <malay>dia macam</malay> dance on the road <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>dia ada</malay> the road [ah]
that one <malay>dia pergi kosong</malay> [lah]
[oh] ya ya no I saw that picture first then you told me <malay>dia orang kena buang kerja</malay>
I don't know how you can recognise such faces [seh]
but there are so many foreigners in Singapore
[ah] no no no no it's because you bought a pass there
and you during that time when you had the pass you went like almost every other month or so
yeah
is it at the end of your poly
no third year
I don't know I would never pay for
you give me free ticket I can
for me no
are you serious you took the galactica before
why the blue one more scary [ah]
try [ah]
cannot [ah]
don't know I don't know you pay me also <malay>belum tentu</malay> I <malay>naik</malay>
because at the end of the day I go to to take photo
like you know the restaurant <malay>yang</malay> no the restaurant <malay>yang ada kereta kereta tu</malay> [lah] the vintage car
that one nice and to eat
the churros there very nice
and that that was
I remember going there the first time when I was not like
cannot cannot be I <malay>tak kerja</malay> right I think <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>kerja kot</malay>
I went there share I went with who [ah] I went with my husband is it
back then boyfriend I think
no but that wasn't the first time
ya but the ride I took was quite safe right
it's like kids
was it was it <malay>berapa bulan</malay> [ah]
early part [eh]
[oh] I <malay>belum pakai tudung</malay> so that means yeah ya ya I <malay>belum pakai tudung</malay> so I think it's like the end of two thousand fifteen
and that was probably the end of my first trimester
[oh] crazy man that's like a dangerous period you know
first trimester is supposed to be like (uh) they say what <malay>belum melekat</malay> yet
so you have to be very careful
anyway but it's okay [what]
I mean I
I mean no the the ride was so I think even if you put kids in there also they won't be scared [sia]
their there's no speed
because I didn't take most of the ride
the same ride
what tell her my sister was pregnant and she took it
then nothing
the flower one [dah] <malay>habis</malay>
can you give your bank account to art also
that's money coming in okay
<malay>rezeki</malay> don't <malay>tolak</malay>
yes
<malay>rezeki</malay> [dah] <malay>ketuk kat pintu</malay> knock knock knock open the door and then you're not opening the door
she normally send using her official address
Mindy's right
yeah
[orh] <malay>dia tak kaku dia tak</malay> awkward [lah]
how
wait <malay>dia bukan jumpa kat sekolah</malay>
what
[oh] my god okay
[oh]
I no no no nobody had a pick up line like that to me
then then then
[oh] so it worked
it's a funny but then then then so she plan then they started talking also it worked ya then they met in school I mean they were in the same school
ya but your friend look so
<malay>lurus bendul</malay> [lah] that that long hair guy right I don't know he just give me the vibe that he's or maybe because you influenced my
opinion
not <malay>lurus bendul</malay> I think <malay>dia tak</malay> nonsense [ah]
(uh) <malay>lurus</malay>
ya ya ya ya and he don't give a shit if you
you don't like it means you don't like it if I want to say it I say it
yeah
and that's the reason why <malay>dia kena</malay> avoid <malay>orang orang yang macam</malay> hypocrite
because if he doesn't hide
[ah] he will say
a bit [meh]
a bit [meh] <malay>panas baran</malay>
no no this this is what that <malay>darah muda</malay>
young blood
but I like this kind of people
we always have this one friend who
who makes us proud for he who he or she is
mine would be #Aidil# [lah] up till now
yeah I feel like my son have grown up you know [dah] <malay>besar anak mak</malay>
actually actually is true [eh]
once <malay>dia masuk</malay> primary school [ah]
and then his mum will be left
!aww!
my friend told me you have to you have to engage your son
make sure you have that relationship with him
he's not afraid so that he will willingly
like nature first nature you know to to
to share with your mum this kind of nonsense
ya ya ya
but not for me
[oh] I don't tell her so that (uh) she's not worried that's the point
like because
do you see I was quiet when I was younger
do you think I mind my own business when I was younger
then I talk to who [ah]
[ah] I think I talk to my friend more
ya actually I was I was rebelling man
but come on okay that's what happen when you have age gap like thirteen years apart okay
our life don't cross
yeah
do you know that secondary school is the start of your like
you bloom into somebody okay
you bloom into a <malay>minah</malay> or you bloom into a nerd or you bloom into someone right that's the start of how you dictate what kind of
path you wanna take [ah] I feel
I took the nerd path
ya
yeah I took a nerd path come on then <malay>balik lambat</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> people okay so in general people will think I'm one of those wild student okay <malay>balik lambat pukul tujuh pukul lapan</malay>
but I'm always from school I don't even hang out with my friends
<malay>bila</malay> [sia] the only time I hang out with my friends is I walk from school to from home to school
I remember
I <malay>jumpa kat</malay> #Tampines# mart
you know the McDonald's <malay>punya</malay> carpark <malay>masuk</malay> right ya ya ya ya
#Kartini# will walk there and I walk here and then we will meet there you know
from far I can see if she arrive first she's holding onto a paper
and then I will be holding on to my own paper
and then it's like auto know like the momemt we see each other okay come come <malay>jalan</malay>
then if we are both reading for our test paper
ya and then
wait and then [ah] whether is it or whether is it secondary school it's the same
we always run to the main gate because the side gate got closed
so once we see the moment we reaching the side gate right and we see the teacher closing all of us will start running
and then
no I think the teacher know our face too too many a times already [lah] this one
not like <malay>macam</malay> accident every day also like that that one not accident already
then (uh) I remember [lah] the one in my secondary school is this
(um) very strict indian discipline guy you know
I think he after awhile he gave up on us when he closed the door he <malay>sengaja</malay> he never
we were like
maybe I don't know less than hundred meter away he saw us already he <malay>tutup</malay>
then we run to the main gate <malay>masuk</malay>
I'm your always the one standing at the back of the class
because we can't make it to the front part of the class
yeah
and then
[oh] ya we we I tell you we are nerds [what] we can spend in library from nine [eh] nine in the morning until nine at night
no ten in the morning until nine at night
(um) was I like that for secondary school

ya so I was a geek [lah] we concluded and then recess time is copying homework
not those everyday
everyday so you make sure that the homework that is for subjects before
ya ya that's why I say you cannot let him know my
we even have a <malay>apa</malay>
we have a place in the school that we copy homework
it's called the hut
okay and then we rotate homework
secondary school
we rotate homework so on the table is circle right then people sit all around
then it's like okay (uh)
[oh] in the morning when you come then you ask each other [eh]
[dah] <malay>buat</malay> [dah] <malay>buat</malay> (uh) okay for example there's
geography [lah] geography maths science okay
[dah] <malay>buat</malay> maths [dah] <malay>buat</malay> science [dah] <malay>buat</malay> geography <malay>belum</malay>
art you [dah] okay and then the other person [oh] <malay>aku belum buat ni</malay> okay okay okay okay (uh) it when is your class we copy later then we do rotation [ah]
we sit according to how we want to copy the homework
okay finish now <malay>siapa nak</malay> [dah] <malay>habis siapa nak</malay>
no cause I got no time to do
I can tell you since sec one I told you already what I'm in band one
it's not only certain days almost every day I got
then upper sec I was a debater !huh!
so
debater is even worse I remember the day that I had
final debate and then
so my my debate and my band
band competition is just a few days apart and this is all like national level [ah]
so and I remember my my conductor told me do not let the result of your debate affect your performance in the final
(uh) <malay>apa dorang panggil</malay>
[ah]
[ah] because I think I had a solo part in that in that
then I said no no no it won't
of course I I lost but we got second so it's still not so bad
(uh) yeah
I remember after the competition I went straight to the band room
after school I had the competition after competition I went to the band room to go and practice
so yeah
my life and then I still do dance performances in school
[oh] sports that's the one thing so in all aspects if you talk about like
(uh) arts (uh) sports and
(uh) I don't know geek [lah] I would categorise (uh) debate as geek [lah] I mean
geek being a geek is in my blood [lah] it's just that I'm a cool I'm a cool geek okay I'm not those
I'm not those library geek [lah] okay I'm not a library officer
I'm not those like who join library and all that
I
I'm quite cool [lah] debater [oh] I even join maths club for some competition
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
there is there is I I'm not officially on there but (uh) <malay>apa</malay> I represented
my secondary school to go to for one of the course
why [eh] I did very well in it you know
do you know there's this game (um) minefield
so basically <malay>kat batu dorang buat macam</malay> it's something like chess [ah] <malay>dorang buat ni</malay> yeah
[eh] that one is I tell you [ah]
I didn't know how good I mean
school is just school I always feel that school is
it's not a true test of how a person is actually good in their particular subject [lah]
if you are really good in science you see all your nature around you one shot you can catch [oh]
like how curious a a kid is [oh] why is the ball bouncing
how does why does the ball bounce
and everytime it bounce it gets lower and lower that means the bouncing's gap is getting lower and lower
ya you need that kind of brain then those are the people who are good at science
I go for the [oh] so I went for this maths maths I don't know what they called it
but ya I I [oh] the only reason why I went for that course was because [ah] [ah] ya this geek
we are the people who's always late for school
(uh) who (err) so
we like I say we are like the cool kid we always come to school late (uh) we join dances and all and dance dance competition and all that but
the day the one day that we ran from the side gate to the main gate we couldn't make it
I think the the head prefect really effed up [lah] basically
he must be waking up from the wrong side of the bed or something like that
he didn't allow us to go in <malay>tutup</malay>
he he he the the whole prefect blocked the entrance
[ah]
[eh] come on [lah] I mean
then anyway so we
then the pledge right so we have to stand up all the prefect face the front and took pledge we will all behind the prefect
and then my friend was like
let's go <malay>cabut cabut</malay> come let's
<malay>cabut</malay> I said ya so we took step you know step step by step by step
before the prefect turn we were already running out of the school
the first guy said <malay>naik naik naik naik</malay> we went out
he [hor] we sit at the staircase and wait
after that one of the girl say [eh] you know [ah]
actually the head prefect saw my face already [ah] just now and she is those okay what you call like
truant girl who is in the smart class this girl [ah]
<malay>maju</malay> [lah] she she's
she's the one who's always in the bad company but she's also in the top second top class [lah]
[eh] so and so so and so saw my face already know !wah! if he see that I disappear already [ah] sure he will mark me [one]
and you know what we did
stupid we ran quite far
I think like at least five blocks away cross the road
we actually walked back to school [lah] [sia]
(uh) ya ya ya nevermind so we took our time [lah] since [dah] <malay>kena</malay> marked also right we
we walked to school it was like I think the second last day or the third last day before school closed for the year
I think second last day ya then we walk okay [ah] <malay>kena buat</malay> detention first time in my life [ah] <malay>kena</malay> detention know then I was like
!walao! [eh] this one is gonna spoil my reputation in school I mean I might be the one who copy homework and everything but there's nothing on record okay
then
ya ya ya so my name officially I had to go for detention [lah]
but as we were walking in the school the maths club people went out
and then they say that one of the
one of the person who is actually
who is actually (uh) supposed to go for the
who's supposed to go for the math's club decided that he's going to take for the day
and then it's like
then they say we need a replacement
I volunteer myself [lah]
so in the end
my first and last detention
I didn't have to go because I represented the school for the maths thing
and what what was initially a bad
situation where I had to be under detention
they wiped off my
record of detention
because I actually represented the school for
no [lah] of course it's nothing but you know I like full attendance I like no detention records
[oh]
[a'ah]
what the heck
did the rest run also
are you serious
[oh] my god
[oh] but the discipline master doesn't know you personally [ah]
ya your your class is very the good
is it just
then but your class is the only one who had a history record of how many teacher run walking out
so #pai kia# [ah]
all cannot make it [sia]
[ah]
!huh!
[eh] actually primary school classes are the worst to manage [ah]
you know what my friend say she say half of the primary school they
you know it's very random you know like you'll be talking about let's say maths [ah] okay
one plus one is equal to two then suddenly the kid will be quiet and then like you will ask why why why are you quiet
my uncle just passed away
the student
and then you thought it's something serious right mental health [lah] <malay>kesian budak ni</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila bila</malay>
a few years ago
and then I was like no ya
they are like that [one] especially primary one
if you teach primary one class right you have to be mentally ready they see spirits
ya
so that why I you you teach primary school
you you you have to be capable of managing
but it's fun [lah] they are innocent [ah] so at least no vulgarities or at least most of them no vulgarities
I I prefer secondary school
off can [ah] if ya

<malay>tapi sekarang yang kita dah pernah</malay> go camper van <malay>dekat</malay> <malay>dengan</malay> go
(uh) australia I <malay>rasa kalau kita dapat</malay> camper van <malay>kat</malay> new zealand
confirm <malay>lawa gila</malay> [ah]
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi kalau macam</malay>
<malay>kita punya</malay> camper van <malay>berlubang</malay>
and then I think what was I I I felt what was most memorable probably was
sydney to melbourne compared to tasmania okay [lah] tasmania best [lah] <malay>sebab dapat naik</malay> the ocean liner [kan] travel from melbourne to tasmania <malay>tapi</malay>
(um) sydney <malay>dengan</malay> sydney to melbourne because we had another group another friend
family <malay>yang</malay> follow <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>rasa macam</malay> best [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> you enjoy more with them
there are shared memories together [ah]
[oh] berry van [eh]
ya <malay>lepas tu yang kita</malay> you <malay>makan kat</malay> perfect catch
<malay>tu pun</malay> best [ah] fish and chips by the river power [sia]
I think one of the best memories of fish and chips compared to <malay>punya</malay> fish and chips fish and chips
<malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak sedap</malay>
ya I think I enjoyed fish and chips more with the one in australia compared to ya
ya I went to new zealand <malay>dengan</malay> my aunties [lah] and my cousins
(err) well (uh) <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>pergi dengan</malay> (um) <malay>makcik-makcik</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang punya</malay> level of (err) worry is more because they feel that they are responsible [lah] for you
so I wanted to bungee but my aunties were all making a big fuss out of it
I <malay>tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> you <malay>dah dengan makcik-makcik</malay> I
(err) <malay>dia orang dah</malay> [eh] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah] <malay>tak mahu</malay> [lah]
and ya [lah] so but the irony was amidst all the commotion
there my back then [lah] my uncle who was fifty plus suddenly out of the whole tour group I think he was one of the eldest or one of the oldest
<malay>dia dah pergi</malay> counter <malay>dah pergi bayar</malay>
<malay>alih-alih</malay> he was walking on the platform
yes
and he was the only one in the group
ya (um) and the group had
I think youngsters me included and few others
yup
so he was the only one brave enough
[ah] despite my aunts' protestations
and ya [lah] so he jump [ah] he was the only one who jump smiling
I mean the usual health
declarations apply [lah] [kan] you got there
it must be ticked are you fit <malay>ada sakit apa-apa tak</malay> you got heart disease or not et cetera et cetera <malay>benda-benda macam gini semua biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> fill
and once you are done ya [lah] I mean it is an accomplishment right it is an achievement
so they give you a cert [lah] to say that yes I am brave enough to have attempted this and #nah# <malay>ambil kau punya</malay> cert
ya
actually for new zealand (um)
the year that I went
so <malay>kita dalam kat</malay> new zealand maybe about one or two
can't remember whether one or two nights but I remembered that
the night before
this thing that happened
I was watching the netherlands match [ah] so
my cousin and <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub
<malay>tak tak minum</malay> [ah] [eh] [ah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> pub ordered hot chocolate
<malay>kita pergi</malay> pub <malay>pergi</malay> pub (err) hot chocolate <malay>tengok bola kat luar</malay>
<malay>tapi sejuk malam tu sejuk sebab dia hujan</malay> it was raining
(um) and then <malay>bila esok pagi</malay>
we were supposed to travel somewhere else
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> (um) snow fell
<malay>lepas tu bila</malay> when there was snow (err) we were kind of hold in because the snow was quite heavy
(um) the advisory was <malay>tak boleh</malay> drive on the road <malay>dulu</malay>
and then (um) apparently for that year there was one of the heaviest snow <malay>yang</malay> christchurch (um) felt
after maybe about what eighteen years so <malay>macam lama gila</malay> [ah] <malay>lama tak boleh</malay> snow <malay>macam gitu</malay>
(err)
[eh] did I say two thousand sixteen no not two thousand sixteen sorry sorry sorry it was two thousand and six
sorry sorry it was two thousand and six not two thousand and sixteen two thousand and six
[ah] was that the first time I felt snow
ya <malay>betul</malay> I think that was the first time I <malay>rasa</malay> snow
(err) unique experience [ah] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> snow [kan] so
ya ya ya we <malay>memang kita tahu</malay> it was winter so we brought the I mean for me at least I brought jacket and gloves [lah]
(err)
(err) not for snow but I mean just winter <malay>kita tak tahu pun</malay> there was snow that was gonna happen
but it was the first time experiencing snow so fun [lah]
it was only fun until we realised that we were stuck in christchurch <malay>maksud tak boleh pergi mana-mana</malay>
the tour company decided okay nevermind we (err) board the bus and <malay>lepas tu</malay> drove to another hotel
and (um) ya we basically <malay>tidur kat</malay> hotel <malay>baru</malay>
<malay>tapi yang tak</malay> #bestnya# <malay>pasal</malay> new zealand
is that
the malls closed at five so you imagine [eh]
(um) winter obvious <malay>sejuk lepas tu</malay>
winter <malay>sejuk lepas tu pukul lima petang semua benda dah habis</malay>
<malay>semua benda semua kedai dah tutup</malay> then so it was quite boring [lah] for for us especially us youngsters
and then we realize that !wow! at five I'm back at the hotel doing nothing but <malay>tengok</malay> so it was kind of boring [ah] but fortunately I think we were stuck only for
one one one extra night <malay>ke</malay> two extra night
ya
K [lah] how chocolate is the best [lah]
or coffee but I think back then I wasn't much of a coffee drinker
so hot chocolate [ah] <malay>sedap</malay>
<malay>tu bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> some pumpkin spice [kan]
[ah] apple spice that was the melbourne winter winter festival
<malay>dekat</malay> queen victoria market [kan]
[ah] [eh] <malay>tu biasa pasal kita terus makan</malay> donut <malay>dia kat luar</malay>
!woo! #shiok# [ah]
!wah! camper van experience <malay>lain</malay> [eh] I think
<malay>kat mana</malay>
wilsons promontory
<malay>betul</malay>
dapat
(mm) ya [lah] I think by then <malay>kita orang macam dah penat</malay> I mean we were driving
almost the entire day and then (uh) by the time nightfall <malay>kita dah nak cari tempat saje lepas tu nak nak makan</malay> until we didn't even have time to think about having phones to just snap a photo but that was surreal [lah] having wildlife a wombat <malay>benda yang</malay>
<malay>tak pernah nampak kat</malay> singapore <malay>tiba-tiba nak panjat masuk</malay> camper van
<malay>melampau</malay> [jer]
I'm sure they are adapt
at finding their own food [ah] [kan]
ya <malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah]
ya the the experience I think I think if you will for example to take a tour
<malay>kita tak akan dapat</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda macam ini sebab</malay> tours chances are
will bring you to the more
high level touristy places
(err)
ya
ya and I think (um) partly why I really enjoyed the camper van life <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> your time is yours
(um) you can park up at any place that you want by the beach by by a park
you can sleep over
you can even
(um) you can even decide on the spot that !hey! I want to spend two did two night here instead of only one
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
ya you can get to enjoy and sightsee
I think <malay>yang</malay> even on that trip [lah] <malay>yang</malay> we <malay>kita turun tengok</malay> the river delta [kan] ya
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tak tak sabar tunggu ni</malay> COVID <malay>habis</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> COVID first destination when they say borders are now open first destination [lah] I'm don't even wanna go
I just gonna shoot straight for
ya <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you can fly everybody else also wants to fly and then all the all the
flight tickets are gonna be expensive
<malay>jadi kita kasih</malay> [lah] <malay>orang yang nak</malay> fly fly <malay>dulu lepas tu bila tiket dah murah baru kita pergi</malay>
<malay>kita pergi apa yang kita mampu</malay> [jer] <malay>iaitu</malay> K
<malay>apa</malay>
wanna drive all the way (um)
ya <malay>tapi</malay> okay so there are two ways to go about doing it <malay>biasa orang</malay> drive
what they do is they drive
to #penang#
<malay>lepas tu tidur</malay> rest one night and then <malay>esok pagi</malay> just <malay>sambung pergi</malay> border of thailand
ya that one more relax [ah] <malay>takde kelam kabut takde macam</malay> rushing for time
<malay>kalau nak lagi rilek</malay>
drive <malay>ke</malay> <malay>tidur semalam</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>pergi</malay> #penang#
<malay>nanti</malay> [lah] <malay>belum buka</malay> <malay>tengah tinggi sekarang belum dengar</malay>
#selangor# <malay>tengah</malay> highest for COVID numbers
ya so <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas tu lepas dah tidur</malay> <malay>satu malam pergi</malay> #penang# <malay>satu malam baru pergi</malay> thailand <malay>tapi tu dah kira dua hari</malay> [ah]
<malay>kalau nak cepat</malay> then <malay>tidur</malay> #penang# <malay>satu hari esok kita pergi</malay> thailand <malay>ataupun lagi nak cepat terus</malay> to thailand [ah] <malay>tapi penat</malay> [ah] <malay>badan sebab</malay> it will probably be <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>empat belas jam</malay> on the road [ah] so if you are at fourteen hours on the road you'll be tired [ah]
and then and then you're just crossing into thailand border [oh] you see
so to me
what's your objective is our objective driving to thailand and then back or the objective is to explore the southern part of thailand <malay>kalau</malay> the objective is to explore southern part of thailand
then the other alternative is fly to
#krabi# or fly to #phuket#
<malay>sewa kereta kat sana</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> travel around southern thailand
<malay>kat mana</malay>
(err) I don't know [ah] <malay>tak pernah</malay> try <malay>tapi jangan bawa kereta</malay> [ah] <malay>jangan bawa kereta</malay> in
you <malay>sewa kereta dekat</malay> thailand
ya
<malay>kalau bawa kereta sendiri</malay> then you might as just I mean I don't know just travel all the way but
but it's tiring [lah] so what I want is <malay>kita</malay> save ourselves the trouble of driving all the way from singapore [ah]
<malay>naik kapal terbang nak sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>kapal terbang</malay> [ah] <malay>naik</malay> [ah] <malay>kapal terbang</malay>
ya
true but then I felt that okay [lah] I think after the first
after the first camper van trip sorry after the first time we took the camper van on the ocean liner
and then
I think that was just the experience [lah] of trying to see how you drive onto
the ship [lah] [kan]
okay [lah] <malay>memang</malay> best [lah] <malay>tak cakap tak</malay> best <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] bruny boring [lah] <malay>kirakan macam</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> kecil <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>tu juga</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> bunker [lah] cabin [lah]
cabin cabin
ya
okay [lah] <malay>tapi malam</malay> we <malay>kita tak</malay> travel <malay>malam</malay> so you were travelling at
it wasn't that bad
no [lah] I guess when it got
I mean <malay>bila kita baru-baru masuk</malay> when the boat started to sail
it was still relatively calm
and then by the time we got ourselves ready and prep to go to sleep
by the time <malay>kita dah tertidur</malay> boat <malay>dia</malay> probably
took a slightly more I mean the seas were ruffled [lah] [kan] when I think there were some points in time where we could feel their boat swing but because we were too tired and <malay>dah dah dah tertidur kita pun tak rasa sangat</malay> [lah]
then <malay>bila pagi dah bangun</malay>
ya when the storm or whatever rough seasons pass then
it's all calm [lah]
[ah]
[oh] ya
<malay>tak</malay>
ya I think supermarkets overseas [ah]
<malay>lain</malay> okay [lah] I mean <malay>dia orang jual benda yang ada dekat sini juga tapi</malay> I think because of the space that they have
(um) there are
other things that they have as well
the selection is bigger there's more variety
true
and <malay>harga tak</malay> so <malay>mahal</malay> [lah]
because they are the producers [ah] that's why
[ah] meat so fresh
ya because they are fresh produced [ah] <malay>benda-benda segar tu rasa lebih sedap</malay>
<malay>lagipun bila kita kat sana</malay>
we tend to cook more by ourselves than over here
<malay>memang</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] since
[oh] <malay>dapat dia orang yang</malay> burger <malay>ni macam</malay> best [ah]
true
even the ice cream is different
okay <malay>sabar</malay> which one do you prefer you <malay>lagi suka</malay> van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> ice cream <malay>ke</malay> you <malay>lagi suka</malay> gelato #messina#
van diemen's was ya <malay>betul-betul yang kat situ sebuah</malay> farm
<malay>macam-macam</malay> [ah] gelato #messina# <malay>ada macam-macam</malay> flavour
<malay>tapi yang</malay> #amorino# <malay>punya</malay>
#amorino# <malay>punya</malay> I think <malay>kita makan</malay>
<malay>kejap</malay> I <malay>tak ingat</malay> whether that one were trip <malay>ke</malay>
[ah] <malay>tak salah tu</malay> [ah]
okay
ya I like #messina# better <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay>
ya <malay>tu yang</malay> best <malay>dia</malay> [ah]
because you have a variety to choose from [ah]
because <malay>kalau</malay> you you compare van diemen's van diemen's <malay>punya</malay> flavours are
much more predictable in that sense
it's not anything out of the ordinary [lah] <malay>macam</malay> K you got your vanilla you got your coffee or your chocolate double chocolate kind of thing
and then you got your pepperberries your lemons there is no unique flavor you know like for example lychee rose for example
[kan] <malay>atau</malay>
K [lah] apple cranberry <malay>pun boleh katakan</malay>
quite common
<malay>ada apa yang dekat tu dekat</malay> tom's palette
<malay>dia tak ada ke</malay>
okay tom's palette <malay>ke</malay> gelato #messina#
ya <malay>ke</malay>
but then tom's palette <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
suitable to
okay
farmer's market
(mm) ya
and the best donuts in the world
[eh] do you notice
it could be ya
<malay>tapi</malay> it could also be the fact that
<malay>benda tu kita tak pernah</malay> try [ah] <malay>contoh</malay> [eh] <malay>contoh</malay>
when we went to <malay>borong</malay> market alright K break your head right
we ordered the the bombolinis [lah] the donuts right
I think that was the first time ever that we tried that kind of donut that stuffed donut
kind of
(um)
I I wouldn't say that <malay>sebab dulu</malay> dunkin donut <malay>pernah ada</malay> with their bavarian cream
<malay>tapi</malay> the the ones that dunkin donut <malay>jual tak sesedap</malay> [ah]
and
ya okay so <malay>kalau</malay> you imagine [ah] break your head you <malay>punya</malay> donut the dough is soft
alright then
their
flavours the filling
unique (um) overflowing
<malay>inti dia penuh</malay> [kan]
so they were oozing out and okay [lah] I guess it's it just added to the whole experience
and break your head has boosted their donuts as the best donuts in the world [lah]
which I am inclined to agree <malay>sebab</malay> about I haven't tasted
any other stuffed donut which comes close to that
ya
ya ya
ya [oh] and then when we went to camden market we managed to try that peruvian street food
that was interesting
<malay>tak pada</malay> I <malay>macam lebih pada</malay> okay like
I felt that it was a cross between <malay>lemak cili padi dengan</malay> (uh) <malay>apa</malay> thai green curry
<malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>iras-iras dia</malay>
plantains [eh]
did they grill that one grill [kan]
I think it was grilled and then they put (um) brown sugar or something on top right
ya if I'm not mistaken it was that [ah]
ya that one
[eh] there was something that I thought about (um) [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] [oh] (um) london (um)
the devil brownies [ah]
ya that was a random find [ah] no we went to that
that weekend market
(um) I wouldn't say it's a random find [lah] because we purposefully wanted to go to that market
but the brownies we didn't expect it to be there
[ah] correct
<malay>beutl betul betul</malay>
<malay>dah dah lepas tu</malay> I found out that that lady who sold the brownies she appeared on dragon's den [ah] dragon's den dragon's den is this (uh) british show
where aspiring business owners visit this there (err) these dragons or pitch their ideas to these dragons [ah] so these dragons are
investors <malay>yang ada duit bangsa duit melambak</malay> shark tank [ah] <malay>macam</malay> shark tank [ah]
so dragon's den <malay>dengan</malay> shark tank <malay>lebih kurang</malay> [ah] <malay>sama</malay> [ah]
(um) so ya she pitch her brownies to them [ah]
I I not I can't remember exactly whether they gave her the funding or not [ah] but the fact that you made it to dragon's den and you were shortlisted <malay>kirakan</malay> you <malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
I think I saw that as part of her marketing collateral
(err) she used that as part of her advertisement [lah]
[ah] but I really good are really really good
ya okay think about it [eh] <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>kata</malay> you miss the food overseas
do you miss the food
do you miss singapore food when you are overseas
ya
no [lah] just wondering whether you have because right now when we're here we're we're back in singapore you <malay>cakap</malay> [oh] I miss the food overseas
then I realize that okay [lah] when travel <malay>kita tak selalu makan luar kita selalu masak</malay> most of the time
so when you say you miss the food it's those times that we ate outside for example <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam makan kat</malay> noodle noodle or is it oodle oodle
[ah] noodle oodle (um) that's just
soup [ah]
right like like <malay>mi dengan</malay>
ya so if you were to think about it again <malay>macam</malay> is it really that fantastic
[ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>faham tak</malay>
so
probably
okay but I know definitely for certain
I miss
the
I miss the paskintani fried chicken
but it's different because this this chicken that they make
ya it's the spices <malay>sebab dia orang</malay> okay imagine nandos
K imagine nandos [ah] so the taste is
slightly okay on par or even nicer than nandos
but the price
[ah] the price the price is way cheaper than nandos [ah]
because it's like it's food meant for for the man on the street
it's like fast food you know
so nandos [kan] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>nak kena duduk kat dalam kedai dia macam</malay> up <malay>sikit</malay>
[kan] <malay>ada sudu garfu</malay>
but this pakistani fried chicken or whatever the fried chicken that they sell
it's meant for a quick grab [ah]
and that's nice I miss that cause it's cheap and it's good
[ah] yes
[eh] the pie is nice
ya
ya it wasn't shepherd's pie but it was very nice
ya
what was their name [ah] a pie thing is it
pie face or pie thing
ya but it was nice [ah]
ya what else [ah]
what else was nice that we have
[oh] buffet that that buffet was power
[eh] that was a nice chance upon [ah]
that was not in our initial plan [lah] because our initial plan was
was to do the north coast for five hundred that north
north coast route of scotland
but because of the accident we had to turn back
and then when we turn back
(um) ya some changes to our plans
ya
okay [lah] it's a saving grace [lah]
it's a saving grace because I think
(um) those ya that jacket potato was nice
that thick milkshake <malay>sedap gila</malay>
ya it was milkshake and skittles [ah]
filling in the jacket potato
ya I think it was sour cream
ya
and we didn't eat I mean I didn't of course we didn't eat meat over there so we chose
we always chose a vegetarian option ya or pescatarian [lah] at least [oh] that was some nice jacket potato
<malay>tak boleh</malay> replicate [ah] [eh] so far
and it was a quaint it was a quaint non assuming shop <malay>kita masuk</malay>
K [ah] <malay>penat saje nak duduk</malay>
and baam <malay>sedap gila apa tempat ni</malay>
ya
that's true
<malay>betul juga</malay> okay [lah] maybe I think [oh] what was
was so enjoyable when you shop at the <malay>ni</malay> [lah] factory outlets
[kan]
ya cheaper [lah] ya but I don't understand how people could
spend thousands (err) on prada
understand [ah] it's still thousands [eh]
<malay>tapi tu</malay> bicester village elite [ah] up [ah]
bicester <malay>ke</malay> #bister#
<malay>bukan</malay> bicester [eh]
B I C E S T E R bicester
ya but I think the york <malay>punya</malay> outlets (err) better [ah]
york <malay>yang kita punya kita punya</malay> camper van (um) battery <malay>mati</malay>
yes
<malay>tak yang</malay> job <malay>dia</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita dah</malay>
somewhere near the south
so <malay>kita</malay> travel all the way up <malay>untuk pergi</malay> york
because you girls wanted to shop
at the outlet factory ya
that's true [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> travel <malay>untuk</malay> two hundred plus three hundred plus kilometre just for that <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
<malay>kau orang biar betul</malay>

malaysia nature
okay [lah] I mean
the thing about
the thing about nature in malaysia

so <malay>walaupun masuk hutan</malay> (err) I mean you got your you got your forest cover tree covers and what not
<malay>tapi bila kat dalam panas juga</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab takde angin</malay> [ah]

ya <malay>kalau kalau</malay> travel as a student
(um) I think you really have to plan
how much you are going to spend so <malay>macam</malay> for us while <malay>kita pergi sana</malay> we either just took the
public the bus which brought us with from country to country you you just took the bus so it could be a long ride
<malay>atau kita ambil</malay> (um) <malay>kita ambil apa</malay> the the budget flight [ah]
so I remember there was one (um)
so we were from netherlands <malay>kita</malay> travel to belgium via bus
so when we reach belgium
(um) we thought that the bus station (uh) at that belgium to the airport was quite near [lah]
only for us to realise that actually
<malay>kita dah terlepas</malay> the the public bus which brings us to the airport and that the airport is actually about
<malay>jauh</malay> I think was sixty kilometres away
belgium is belgium [lah] <malay>mana</malay> belgium is germany
so <malay>kita terlepas</malay> so <malay>konon-konon nak naik</malay> taxi [ah] the bus two hundred foreign nightmare thanks [ah] ya
and then and then we were basically poor students today
and then we were
the cab fare was more than one hundred and twenty euros
definitely [ah]
I think the bus was even free to bring you to the airport
ya so we got the wrong airport
we wanted ya we were supposed to catch our flight to porto portuguese not porto portuguese porto portugal
and then we thought that wherever that bus station in belgium was in relation to the supposed airport is near
but apparently the budget terminal was further further further away
(um)
<malay>tak juga</malay> [ah] we were winging it [lah]
ya
[ah] ya so the story is we managed to hail down a cab <malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>kita cakap dengan pakcik ni</malay> [ah] driver we need to get to this airport so <malay>dia kata</malay> that sixty kilometres away
ya so timing we still had I mean like
we still had about at an hour [lah] but sixty kilometres away ya [kan] so it's still quite a distance
at least <malay>macam</malay>
forty five minutes to get there [ah]
so you <malay>macam dah</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] but the worst part is that we will we had no money [ah] there was I think we only had one hundred and twenty euros
this was the start [lah] almost the start I think ya
no <malay>bukan takde duit</malay> [lah] but
not that much cash on hand so if we spend the if we spend the money on this taxi trip that means <malay>untuk benda-benda lain kita kurang</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>habis bila dia nak cakap dengan kita</malay> hundred and this one [ah] more than hundred twenty euro <malay>habis kita dah duit dah sikit</malay> then <malay>kita macam</malay> !alamak! <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
so we negotiated [lah] we said we are students we missed our bus
the taxi driver said okay I tell you what
nevermind [ah] he just so happened that he was also a muslim
and then he said okay nevermind
belgium belgium ya okay so he said okay nevermind (err) I charge you
I forgot a hundred or one hundred and twenty euros [lah] basically
he said okay whatever that money you all got nevermind you all give me but I will switch on my meter and <malay>nanti</malay> I will show you all
<malay>dia saje nak tunjuk dengan kita kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni lagi mahal</malay> [lah]
ya so he switched on his meter
regulation [kan]
ya [lah] I I think <malay>sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam benda ini juga</malay> so <malay>dia</malay> on
<malay>dia</malay> on <malay>dia punya</malay> meter
so he went all the way up up up we haven't still haven't reach but the meter <malay>dah naik</malay> two hundred three hundred and twenty twenty euros
and then by the time we reach there he
(uh) maybe three quarters [ah]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> he said
ya and then <malay>dia kata</malay> okay you look [ah] at the meter
<malay>sekarang dah</malay> hundred three hundred and twenty euro <malay>aku</malay> off K <malay>aku</malay> off
so he accepted the whatever money that that we got [lah] and we managed to catch our flight just in time
before the gate closed [lah] maybe we had like half an hour before the gate close
ya and that was just the start of our journey [ah]
<malay>lepak hidup</malay>
ya starting <malay>tu dah</malay> adventure [ah]
run into I
I think the I won't say highlight [lah] but one of the more memorable thing was
partying in the streets for two hours after spain won against italy
no but I think <malay>kalau</malay> spain <malay>kalah</malay> confirm <malay>raih</malay> [ah]
[ah] but because spain won (err) I think I think through penalties [eh] spain <malay>menang</malay> italy and then [ah] because of that they made it to the final
we watched you watched that so the (um) there was a big screen <malay>dia orang</malay> (err) live telecast
so <malay>kita ramai-ramai</malay> [ah] <malay>kat sana sama tengok</malay> live telecast [lah]
ya and (uh) I mean when you're in a festive mood
the spaniards were quite nice to you [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay>
ya and then I think when when
where we watch I think it was like their
you know sometimes certain cities have that have like their central
central area or you know central parade square or something like that
I think it was something similar to that at madrid [lah] [ah] but from where they were
from where we were going back to our hostel
(err) I think
by by their train it would have taken us about
let me think [ah]
maybe about half an hour or sorts
ya but on that day
the trains <malay>tutup</malay> [sia]
[ah] so [dah] happy happy
<malay>jalan</malay> [ah]
[ah] <malay>jalan</malay> [ah] so <malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid [ah] <malay>ni dah</malay> madrid so madrid <malay>dah macam</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay> portugal so <malay>kita pergi</malay>
so it was netherlands <malay>lepas tu ambil</malay> bus <malay>pergi</malay> belgium belgium flight to portugal portugal <malay>pergi</malay> (um) flight to madrid
ya that was that was an
all the way <malay>makan ni</malay> [ah] <malay>roti dengan</malay> tuna [ah]
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] everyday but basically living frugally [ah]
[oh] I remember there was one there was one instance I think it was
I think this was in madrid
<malay>kita</malay>
(um) my friend and I [lah] <malay>kita dah dah dah lapar</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita turun kat kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni kita kebetulan</malay> found a muslim shop which was nearby
no
you go through your hostel dot com <malay>ke apa</malay> [ah]
ya
so (um) <malay>jumpa</malay> [ah] <malay>kedai kedai</malay> muslim <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>semua</malay> muslim brother <malay>dah masuk kedai dia</malay> apparently <malay>kita ternampak ada</malay> #prata# [ah]
#prata# [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so I don't know whether it was [ah] an instant #prata# or #prata# that they made [ah] <malay>tapi nampak macam</malay> #prata# [ah]
so my friend and I [eh] <malay>baik</malay> [ah] this <malay>harapan</malay> #prata# <malay>puas hati</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tu kita dah tengah lapar</malay> so <malay>kita minta dia enam</malay> [ah] <malay>enam</malay> [eh] <malay>kau tiga aku tiga</malay> [lah] <malay>enam</malay>
<malay>itu tak perasan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab kita dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] and <malay>harga dia harga tak mahal sangat</malay> [lah]
true <malay>dah tengah lapar</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita dah</malay> okay [ah] <malay>enam enam enam sekali pakcik tu tengok kita macam kau orang biar betul enam sabar sabar sabar</malay> and he couldn't speak english
so
[ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>sabar sabar sabar kau ambil dua dulu dua dulu</malay>
then <malay>macam kita cakap tak tak tak enam enam tak tak kau ambil dua dulu kau dengar</malay>
no
apparently <malay>dia orang makan</malay> order #prata# <malay>dengan macam sirap ke gula</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali manis nak mampus</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> I think they <malay>tuang</malay> the sugar on top [ah]
it's like it's soaked
soaked with sugar so one each [ah]
so <malay>kita dua-dua tak habis sebab manis gila nasib baik</malay>
so we were thinking of as I think if it was any other shopkeeper
he probably just asked like six enjoyed and charged us a full price
and basically being dishonest about it [ah]
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ni dia ni kira macam</malay> muslim brother <malay>boleh pakai punya</malay> [ah]
ya
power [ah]
ya that's why
ya
ya
and then (uh) you know how the spaniards pride pride themselves with their siesta ya so there was one day kita <malay>keluar</malay> (um) maybe like after one or after the two
then we realized that all the shops were closed because they were all sleeping
ya like they I think the shops mostly will close like one to four <malay>ke</malay> two to five [ah]
[ah] like they really took their break
yes yes
ya
so it's okay [lah] as in <malay>dia orang tutup sekejap</malay> for them to rest <malay>lepas tu dia orang buka sampai</malay> maybe <malay>sepuluh sebelas</malay>
ya
[ah] yup
true
[oh] (err) in madrid <malay>juga</malay> I where where when we were walking [ah] <malay>masih masih masih</malay>
<malay>sekali tiba-tiba</malay> there was this bangladeshi guy
who came up to us
say #assamualaikum# and started to (err) to talk to us in malay
<malay>kita dah kat</malay> madrid [eh] <malay>dia orang bual bual melayu</malay> [eh] <malay>muka</malay> bangladesh <malay>berbual melayu lepak</malay>
so we talk to him when quite further in he said [oh] actually yes he's bangladeshi
<malay>ada pernah kerja kat</malay> malaysia
for
working [ah] so he was working in malaysia for quite a number of years then I guess he
came back to bangladesh and then (um) you know went back went to spain to work [lah]
I mean if the opportunity presents itself <malay>nak</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>kalau ada kerja yang bagus</malay> okay [ah]
ya working overseas is something
okay [lah] not a lifelong dream but
it is something that I want to at least try once in my life
sometimes only we working overseas then you know whether you will like it or not
ya
the closest I had for staying was
I had six months [ah] of exchange in canada
that was a I wouldn't say there's even that even came close [ah] but
yes
totally
ya or at least the community which I was in made me feel welcome [ah] to the point that I felt that !hey!
this isn't too bad a place if you want to stay here
ya
both [ah]
okay so (um) when when I was at the university at mcgill in montreal
(um) the or the muslim students association they were quite
(um) vibrant and there are very active [lah]
so (um) I decided that okay let's make the best out of my exchange experience and let's join them [lah]
because when I were went there also (um)
it coincided with the fasting month
[ah] <malay>lepas tu dah langgar langgar sana</malay> I mean
<malay>kalau kita kat</malay> singapore <malay>kalau bulan puasa</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tarawih lepas tu</malay>
ya fasting oversea I think that was one of the best experience because fasting hours was short [ah]

okay [ah] first <malay>kita berbual pasal</malay> regarding our hobby [lah] okay [ah] so you can first what is it your hobby
(um)
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay example like <malay>kalau</malay> for me my hobbies is [ah] I like to read books I like to travel I like to
[ah] mostly spend time <malay>dengan kawan-kawan ke apa</malay> [ah] that is my sort of hobbies that I like
[ah] I like to I am more an indoor person I don't really <malay>suka main dekat luar ke pergi pantai</malay> I don't really like it
[ah] so you say you like shopping right so what type of things you like to shop
(uh huh)
so other than
<malay>punya</malay> brand <malay>tak ada</malay> you don't have any other brand <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>suka ke apa ke</malay>
[kan] and I think you also <malay>suka</malay> Coach
you <malay>pun suka</malay>
[ah] quite lately [lah] I think that <malay>daripada dulu pun</malay> you <malay>memang suka</malay> Coach if not just lately
[ah] so <malay>apa lagi yang</malay> you
you <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>minat selain daripada</malay> bags
okay because for me [ah] whatever you cook I'm willing to eat and then the thing is I want you to explore [kan] <malay>pasal daripada dulu kalau nak kata masak</malay>
we <malay>apa</malay> more like
<malay>terkongkong ada orang cakap mesti macam gini mesti macam gitu</malay> [kan] so
when you
[ah] yes so is so now when you see for yourself [eh] actually if I do this way it it also can be done so it's your own way of doing things
important the family <malay>makan</malay> and enjoy and so far you are doing
okay you are not like <malay>macam apa tak tahu masak ke apa</malay> it's edible [lah] <malay>boleh makan</malay> and there times <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>masak pada</malay> I is
(uh) fantastic [lah] it's good <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] I enjoy eating it which is something good [lah] [kan] hopefully
you can cook [ah] more things [lah]
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] the more the more rounder become most to most
[ah] exercise more [ah] exercise more in the imagination [lah] in reality I won't exercise
[ah] yes I like to play football last time and that was last time maybe
[eh] this year what thirty nine
maybe ten years ago I think ya [lah] ten years ago still can play [lah] but now I think it'd be better
to watch football then to play anyway in singapore <malay>nak main bola dah susah</malay> I I try to ask my friends to play all
got injuries there injuries here so don't really got chance to to play [ah] maybe
[ah] if I play football with
with #sharif# if the kid maybe can can be done <malay>ataupun</malay>
[ah] I become a soccer coach
if I did
if I do become [lah]
doubt so [lah] I think I prefer to read up about it
and watch about it [lah] don't want to waste my energy [ah]
during the malaysia cup [ah]
I think in terms <malay>kalau</malay>
the atmosphere to get back to the malaysia cup days is is
is over [lah] first of all is the
priorities
and the lifestyle it has changed
in fact can say the whole
[ah] the whole society <malay>punya</malay> makeup <malay>pun dah</malay> changed I think now we are
mix too much mix
that we don't know who is who
[ah] whom is like
and the passion is just not there [lah] I mean even if
I think even if let's say if singapore is to continue with the malaysia cup until now
I think the interest will also die off
because
think is not of just about the facilities [ah]
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> passion the thing is passion is there
the atmosphere will come
the thing is the passion is not there because of why because of lifestyle last time
<malay>budak-budak tak ada benda lain</malay>
<malay>budak-budak cuma</malay> only have
[ah] football
and basically the basic things to play so basically is
when you play football it's really to
to [ah] play for your country so the feeling the impact of the passion is <malay>lain</malay>
<malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> when people play is
for the money for the fame [kan] then there are
then why you I want to play football in the
[ah] in the basketball court or in the
football court when I can just relax and play at FIFA right
[ah] I can just [ah] imagine myself to be #ronaldo# or #messi#
on the screen
[kan] if I feel like I want to stop a while I just pause
when last time when you play
you imagine yourself so you're moving your body and you know like you can just move at my fingers and all that so that is the difference even if <malay>macam</malay>
now like <malay>dulu kalau kita nak tengok</malay> internet <malay>pakai</malay> computer will really stay in front of the computer
and to or wait for it to fire up then you can go in now basically
you are on the move the internet is all in your fingers [kan]
how come last time when people make appointment only handphone just via phone call or what
or say okay I meet I meet you here at this timing no phone call no nothing
yet we can be on time
<malay>tapi</malay> now even with handphone
you can basically
contact with the with the people
[kan] contact the people <malay>pun</malay>
yet you are late
you can message people yet you cannot find the place you know all this kind of things [ah] (um)
(uh huh)
yes
ya so that is the different [lah] people change
[kan] so maybe certain things will be left behind [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] so the
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] the changes in in time [eh] so in order to survive
we have to be adaptable
try to change
to keep up with the time [lah] [kan] cause if not you are going to have issues if let's say you are going to still be
[ah] mentality <malay>zaman dulu punya</malay> [kan] <malay>tak nak</malay> handphone <malay>tak nak pakai</malay>
[ah] internet [kan] I think <malay>kalau sekarang ni</malay> if now we want to survive without the internet it's almost
[ah] impossible [ah] [kan] [ah]
okay (um)
yes
[ah] I mean even for us as as parents we cannot be <malay>apa terlalu ke belakang</malay> if let's say we are too far
[ah] behind [kan] then our kid will be affected so we have to
we understand that we have to be up to date no need to be so advanced but
[ah] just nice for his [ah]
or his or her development
in the future [lah] even now in school like you have to do
learning at home studying at home using the internet
[ah] [ah]
yes correct
[ah]
(um)
[ah]
ya [lah]
have to have to try [lah] [kan] <malay>tu kadang-kadang</malay> when we try <malay>pun</malay>
<malay>susah juga nak nak</malay> catch up [kan] but we we still have to
to learn to set up and all that [lah] [kan] okay <malay>sekarang nak</malay>
<malay>berbual pasal apa</malay> topic <malay>lain</malay>
the thing that we enjoy
to do together I think we can talk about our travel
[ah]
[ah] but in terms of travelling
<malay>kita takde</malay> [lah] travel <malay>banyak-banyak tempat</malay> [kan] [ah] so for our travel is mostly to
[ah] malaysia [kan]
[ah] [ah] maybe thailand and
indonesia and australia [ah]
hoping to cover all ASEAN countries
but unfortunately because of the COVID
[ah] (um)
[ah] if not we will be like <malay>apa</malay> every year at least [lah]
[ah] favourite place [ah] favourite place
not much changes compared to living in singapore as but of course the price is
much lower okay [lah] our singapore dollar is strong [lah] then
I think <malay>bila kita pergi tu apa boleh</malay>
so hope <malay>macam apa</malay> we can
do our one year shopping of
of clothes maybe [kan]
so <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pergi satu beg balik tiga beg tu biasa</malay> [lah]
but it's a really complete
(uh) shopping [lah]
for the clothes only [lah]
[ah]
[ah]
[ah]
what are the [ah] pattern what is the <malay>perangai yang kita boleh</malay>
[ah] click <malay>atau tak</malay> click what is our
nitty-gritty details
then maybe you are okay I not okay [kan] but of course there is there different [lah] when you go travelling as a honeymoon is is is different because it's still something new [kan] but I think if now we are to go to the same place
the feeling will be different cause the understanding is more
is [ah] is stronger and then I think you will enjoy it more
(err) <malay>kalau bawa</malay>
our kid also will enjoy it more also [lah] [kan]
(uh) but
yes [ah]
[ah] ya [lah] you will set the goal when you go [ah]
[ah] [ah]
[ah] I think it's not only the
prompt reaction part [lah] [kan]
I mean
ya [lah] I think certain things you are more
[ah]
comfortable in handling and
[ah] certain things I am more comfortable in handling [lah] I mean in terms of money I think you are more comfortable and you do the money part
ya for me is I am more comfortable in
[ah] planning
I enjoy the I enjoy planning and seeing that things goes smoothly [ah]
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah] [ah]
ya [lah] [ah] when authoritative-ness then
[ah] <malay>apa</malay>
people don't argue with you
[ah] yes [lah] you can <malay>ke depan</malay> [lah]
but if the other party decide to fight back with you
[ah] then you will go back go back go back and then you won't be in front
[ah]
ya because generally I am not that
picky
I'm not that particular as long as it's okay [lah]
[ah]
<malay>takda</malay> [lah] at least [kan]
we are realistic [lah] [kan] what we what we pay for is what we suppose to get
but sometimes for me it's like
just get things done and over [lah] I don't want to like waste time on
something maybe to me is small [lah] but to you is
I pay for it then I want to get it [kan] so that is the difference
[ah] [ah]
[ah] ya
I think for the #jakarta# [one]
when we reach
there we were like [eh]
first thing is the airport [lah]
very different we feel like am I back in the eighties and looking at the flooring reminds me of
(err) shopping centres (err) in the eighties [kan]
so okay [lah] that is one thing then
the other thing is when we walk
(uh)
[ah]
ya when we first <malay>sampai</malay> the hotel <malay>tu</malay>
I remember when we just came in into the hotel
first is the smell
we feel the it's like the smell of
[ah] something being kept for so long
it's not rotten [ah] it's like the carpet never wash for so long
[ah] [lah]
[kan] <malay>bila kita sampai</malay>
<malay>bilik tu macam</malay> okay everything go like so olden
[kan] [ah] [ah] so after <malay>lepas dah</malay> the <malay>bilik tu</malay> okay [lah] but overall
quite enjoyable [lah] in #jakarta# the
different way of life
[ah]
yes
yes our wedding
[ah] our wedding planner [ah]
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) [ah] yes
yes correct [ah] [ah]
(um) [ah]
[ah] the third
[ah]
hotel
basically is [ah] it's all paid for
the tour is [ah]
the tour is all planned [ah] so the driver the vehicle all all is provided
basically we are just supposed to
be there
and everything is actually planned for us we just follow [eh]
[ah]
testing [ah] [ah]
#tanah abang#
yes
[ah]
so sometimes [kan] you have to buy <malay>kadang-kadang macam apa</malay>
have to buy clothes same pattern but different colours [kan]
just for the sake of
[ah] getting (err)
cheaper cheaper price [ah] [kan]
because [ah] <malay>dorang tak jual</malay>
they don't sell by one piece one piece
they sell by [oh] you must buy at least three must buy at least four and
so that's why <malay>kadang bila kita</malay> when
we went there I think I saw some
some faces which are familiar maybe they are from singapore
(err)
<malay>dorang beli</malay> to sell at their shop <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
is money yes
[ah] [ah] [ah]
[ah]
ask for directions
<malay>nak pergi</malay> [ah]
<malay>itu bukan itu aja</malay> even someone who
open the door for us
just holding the door still will be expecting us to
to <malay>kasi duit</malay>
then <malay>dia hulur tangan dia minta duit ni semua</malay> [kan] [ah]
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] [kan] so other than that
[ah]
ya other than #jakarta# we went to [ah]
[ah] indonesia <malay>juga</malay> #bali# <malay>juga</malay>
is a couple so called couple retreat [ah] two couples [ah]

they like to conserve the old buildings
so <malay>macam kalau apa</malay> even if it's a new shopping centre
but the front part of the building <malay>tu di apa</malay>
they conserve so they make it part of the building [kan] which is [ah] a bit
a bit <malay>macam</malay> odd [lah] something good
but
[kan] <malay>kadang macam nampak sangat beza dia</malay>
conserve for the sake of [ah] conserving [ah] sometimes it doesn't really look
matching
ya but I I respect them [lah] cause they did conserve their [ah]

[ah]
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) yes
family members [ah] [ah]
so other than that for me is (err) [ah]
I got a lot of things to be done
a lot of things need to move on
[ah] maybe some things need to get rid of and move slowly
but I still have to
ya it's going to be a bit
complicated [lah] trying to move a lot of things then we basically our situation we are like
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> tight restrain now if I move my left hand is not only my hand move other people <malay>pun</malay> move other parts of this [one] is other parts of the family so if I move other members of the family <malay>pun</malay> move <malay>kalau kita punya</malay> situation [kan] and got a kid
to <malay>jaga</malay> [kan] to <malay>jaga</malay> we got a special needs <malay>adik</malay> to <malay>jaga</malay> [kan] so but okay [lah] I think it can be done [lah] it will be difficult sacrifice <malay>perlu dibuat</malay> [kan] <malay>cuma</malay> hope to <malay>apa</malay>
hope <malay>lagi banyak benda kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> will work out [lah] [kan]
the vision is clear [kan] [ah] our vision is clear [kan] of course <malay>kalau budak susah nak faham</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>tapi kata orang pun kita</malay> lead we lead [kan] most important is we try to work together to see the situation settle the situation as a family
we try to work things out [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay>
of course [lah] <malay>kadang ada orang</malay> selfish <malay>apa</malay> [kan] so if
that person selfish <malay>tak nak</malay> cooperate [kan]
I will go with the majority [lah] and if let's say out of ten person
then because of you one or two person don't agree I will move on with the eight
the nine and ten person who you want to follow you follow if not if you are in trouble what you have to face it yourself don't like you face you have issue [oh] then you look for me ask me for a solution and all that of course if I am if I can
I will do it [lah] <malay>tapi kalau dah tak boleh</malay> [kan]
<malay>aku dah cakap kau tak nak dengar</malay>
<malay>kau</malay> get into <malay>masalah</malay>
<malay>kau suruh aku</malay> handle <malay>aku</malay> I feel <malay>tak</malay>
<malay>tak ini</malay> [lah] <malay>tak apa tak adil tak adil</malay> [kan] so I will always go for fairness
[ah]
[a'ah]
[ah]
[eh] [lah]
<malay>leher</malay> [ah]
yes the neck <malay>tapi macam</malay> the neck only can show where to turn
[kan] <malay>tapi kepala dia ada kepala otak jadi yang kepala otak tu yang</malay> decide <malay>nak</malay> turn <malay>atau tidak</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
ya [kan] so <malay>sebab itu kita</malay> as a <malay>keluarga</malay> we are as a unit [kan] so we want to move we want to move as a unit
<malay>kalau ada orang tak nak dengar ini</malay> [kan] then <malay>kalau dia dah sampai apa kalau dia tak nak buat</malay>
<malay>dia tak</malay>
affect <malay>tak nyusahkan orang lain tak apa tapi sekarang dia buat dia menyusahkan orang lain dan dia rasa dia tak bersalah</malay> then
really have to <malay>apa</malay> explain and I really have to go
go and settle the issue [lah] [kan] so the issue now is whether <malay>dapat</malay> settle <malay>ke tak</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> hopefully <malay>akan dapat</malay> settle [lah] [kan]
<malay>dia nak hidup sendiri tu dia punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] I don't want to <malay>halang</malay>
<malay>kalau dia nak</malay> [kan] <malay>kita akan</malay> we are
[ah]
in terms of <malay>nak dapat sekolah tu susah nak cakap</malay> [lah] [kan]
[ah] yes
[ah]
[ah]
<malay>ubat</malay>
[ah] yes
[ah] cousin [ah]
<malay>tergantung</malay> it's very <malay>susah</malay> [lah] then
things are moving smoothly if I only can try my best [lah]
I I submit document I submit application
<malay>semua dah buat</malay> [kan]
[ah]
[ah]
the thing is is like that
[kan] <malay>kata orang tu</malay> [kan]
because they are two different
organisation if they are under one
organisation of course it's smoother [lah] [kan]
but now the organisation <malay>bukan satu tempat</malay>
they are two different organisations so <malay>yang ini tempat</malay> check
<malay>yang ini untuk</malay>
[ah] <malay>masa depan</malay>
for future <malay>yang ini untuk apa</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia punya apa bantuan lain bantuan lain</malay> so
have to go through a lot of places [lah]
whether it will improve <malay>ke tak</malay>
the future
<malay>tak juga dia</malay> different criteria [kan] like example <malay>kalau macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> in order to apply for example [ah] to apply for need
[ah] certification that he is autistic then <malay>dah pergi</malay> minds minds <malay>dah</malay> certify <malay>dia dah</malay> [ah] settle
then after that <malay>nak masukkan dia sekolah nak masukkan dia sekolah pula</malay> [oh]
certification from (uh) minds <malay>tak cukup</malay>
you have to go through a certain
[ah] doctor [lah] doctor or hospital or what okay so <malay>pergi</malay> doctor <malay>punya</malay> hospital
happen doctor hospital <malay>tu pun</malay> [ah] okay [lah] willing to help okay he did that part
then after that <malay>bila nak</malay> apply for <malay>apa</malay> for <malay>apa</malay> cash in life for home caregiving [kan] [oh]
cannot we only we only accept those who are <malay>apa</malay>
authorised by us to do the [ah] assessment so go through check up again
so (um) (um)
[ah] [ah]
<malay>risiko</malay> there and the the thing is
okay [lah] <malay>macam cakap macam macam kita ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> for <malay>macam untuk adik ni</malay>
I am willing to <malay>usaha</malay> [kan] and I happen I got a cousin is willing to support [lah]
so <malay>kita kena buat</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi macam</malay> you try imagine
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] all these checks
are done are simplified that means only one time check and then it's done [kan]
settle
but because all the different organisation got different criteria then [ah]
yes correct and the thing is <malay>pula</malay>
<malay>kita pergi</malay> check up <malay>ni bukan</malay> free
everytime <malay>pergi</malay>
[ah] <malay>kena bayar ke apa</malay> [kan] but so far I'm lucky in the sense minds <malay>tolong</malay>
<malay>percuma</malay> free
[ah] even the hospital [one] happen epilepsy <malay>punya</malay> doctor [kan] so there is no extra charges [lah] and
[ah] so <malay>nanti</malay> Q cure <malay>ni kalau macam apa</malay>
in order <malay>dah dapat</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>apa ni semua</malay> cash in life [lah] <malay>pula nak kena</malay> assessment [kan]
and then the assessment <malay>pun</malay> need another set of [ah] check up

<malay>tapi untuk orang lain sekali</malay> [ah] for now

(mm)
(mm) three wishes [eh] okay firstly I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>nak jadi</malay> billionaire
(mm) because
<malay>jadi</malay> billionaire I feel secure
and having a lot of money
can actually solve a lot of problem <malay>macam</malay> if like in case of emergencies like
<malay>macam</malay> accident <malay>ke apa</malay> I have the money already
or like when I want to buy something that I like
I can like feel rich you know like <malay>macam jalan sana jalan sini</malay> [eh] I like this stuff I can just buy I like that stuff I can just buy that kind of thing
then the second one I think I want my own transport
so I want my own transport and <malay>rumah</malay>
so like what you asked right I <malay>rasa</malay> transport I <malay>nak motor ke kereta ke</malay>
[oh] best part is
I <malay>nak</malay> my own private jet so that I can travel everywhere
<malay>tak payah nak tunggu</malay> flights <malay>pun</malay>
like I want to go here and there I can <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sembarang</malay> [eh] <malay>aku nak</malay> flight okay <malay>aku naik aku punya</malay> private jet that kind of thing
like also [kan] <malay>macam bawa orang</malay> [lah] like can bring you and like the other families to go travel all that
ya so <malay>macam tak payah buang duit gitu macam</malay> you know <malay>sekarang kita nak naik</malay> plane <malay>pun nak kena bayar</malay> for the air ticket right
but I since I already
have the private jet why not I just <malay>macam</malay> families let's go like I can
I can <malay>payung</malay> you guys for
the travel you know
transportation [ah] [eh] <malay>tapi duit belanja tak</malay>
ya then the third one
I want to have like
I want to conquer a lot of language so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> skill like that [kan]
like what's you skill [oh] I can speak a lot of language <malay>gitu macam</malay> but I want to speak like the common one [lah] <malay>macam</malay> mandarin (uh) korean it's like
common <malay>sekarang</malay> then
thailand our favourite then
philippines
ya so I felt like
<malay>kalau macam kita dah tahu berbual ni semua macam</malay> nice right like
third wish yes that's my third wish but
I also want to be a certified one
and I felt that
rather than I learn
since it's a wish right <malay>dia macam bukan macam</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> magic <malay>gitu</malay> [kan]
[eh] <malay>sudah aku nak letak</malay> magic I can speak a lot of language and be certified rather than
I want to study don't need [lah] <malay>tak payah</malay>

talking about family gathering
you know about <malay>yang seratus</malay> dollar the one that government wants to like the hundred dollar voucher right
going through by the singpass I read at straits times
so they say you can go for like staycation at hotels
or like amusement park [ah] all that <malay>ada</malay> tourism

I think that one we can make it happen without a wish
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
you want to picnic <malay>ke nak</malay> overnight
that's nice actually we can actually but
we just wait [lah] for the further announcement
if we can
maybe for like one hotel we can use like two names right like mine like for example you and your husband one room right
can use both of your hundred dollars so you guys just need to fork out like what
like forty or thirty dollar more like thirty to forty dollar more only
rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau dia dua ratus lebih</malay> then
you can only use your your own only [kan] <malay>abeh bayar seratus lebih gila</malay>
then
maybe we can picnic <malay>ke apa</malay> right what you said picnic then <malay>kalau kita</malay> picnic <malay>pun kita nak kena keluarkan duit banyak</malay>
then if we picnic
if we cannot use the hundred dollars money we need to fork out our own money it's like

<malay>macam</malay> hotel then chalet <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>untuk</malay> staycation <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] (mm) actually not bad [ah] I think the idea is not bad <malay>abeh kita boleh</malay> barbecue <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kalau kita macam</malay>
chalet
chalet <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> chalet <malay>tu boleh</malay> barbecue [pe]
but then we also need to spend money on the barbecue I mean like food food we always need to spend money on food [lah]
forever food and our transportation
and then <malay>macam rumah</malay> okay <malay>rumah</malay> maybe like <malay>macam</malay> if it's like four hundred we can just
like
share among us
so it's like <malay>satu orang</malay> like <malay>berapa berapa puluh</malay> dollar <malay>gitu</malay> or hundred something like that
then the food also we can ask them to fork out like about twenty dollars or twenty or thirty dollars <malay>gitu</malay>
<malay>untuk makan dengan minum</malay> okay [ah] nice then we can just cook or we can like <malay>macam</malay> chalet or what we <malay>tempat dia boleh masak</malay> [kan] so
we can just buy our groceries <malay>ke apa</malay>
then we <malay>macam simpan dalam</malay> fridge then <malay>esok tu</malay> breakfast <malay>boleh masak</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> then
I think by lunch <malay>gitu</malay> we need to
book out already [kan] so okay [lah]
I think it's nice already such a nice plan but then when you say about the celebration
[kan] celebration also need more money
because right <malay>takkan kita nak buat macam</malay> so called birthday party <malay>tak ada</malay> decoration <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan]
decoration need money also
I mean we can buy <malay>macam dekat</malay> daiso <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] so <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>dua</malay> dollar <malay>murah ataupun kita boleh beli kat</malay> neighbourhood kind of shop [kan]
so it's cheaper but still we still need to fork out our own money
so I'm not sure if <malay>kalau</malay> (mm) but it's a nice idea [lah] to <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> both
party together like that
because we can <malay>macam</malay> save up a bit of money rather than <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>satu</malay> birthday party <malay>lepas tu</malay> birthday party <malay>lagi habis duit</malay> then
(um) you know that a
<malay>tu</malay> confirm confirm <malay>kena bayar lagi</malay> [eh] service <malay>tu</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
(mm)
nice but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> I don't think hotel is a nice choice if you want to do that kind of thing
cause hotel confirm have their own <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know they will have their own kind of rules and regulation <malay>macam</malay> like after this timing that timing you cannot do this kind of thing right
ya
so so I think if we want to do that kind of thing right we should put off the hotel
we should use chalet or something rather than that because <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> rules or regulations <malay>susah</malay> [ah] <malay>kita pun nak buat macam</malay> we want to save
cause <malay>sekali tak</malay> save [eh] (uh) government <malay>pula</malay>
[ah] ya [lah] like some agency <malay>datang ke apa sebab kita buat bising ke apa habis kena bayar lebih</malay> [eh]
ya [lah] marina is nice [lah]
cause the place is big but
at least at least there's this one (uh) one place where I know
(err) <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> rooftop like that [ah]
not not really rooftop <malay>dia macam</malay> not rooftop or shelter <malay>tapi macam</malay> indoor <malay>sikit</malay>
[ah] we can we can find the place around there so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> [kan] <malay>kita tak kena</malay>
because marina west coast east coast <malay>tu semua</malay> is all
outdoor [pe]
so <malay>kalau hujan ke apa</malay> we still <malay>boleh lepak depan situ</malay>
cause that time when I went (uh) to marina
for a picnic with my friends we actually <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I think like halfway halfway through the day it was drizzling
<malay>abeh</malay> okay maybe <malay>kalau kalau macam hujan lebat sudah kita</malay> pack up <malay>sudah hujan lebat</malay> [kan]
but if it's like drizzling we just stay there [ah]
because it's like !alah! <malay>sikit-sikit</malay> [jer] point point point
<malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [kan]
so
we
<malay>pergi cari</malay>
I mean we got the what is called [ah] <malay>yang besar tu</malay> parasol [eh]
parasol whatever [lah]
[ah] <malay>yang payung besar tu</malay>
we brought that also so <malay>kita letak betul-betul kat tepi situ</malay> we <malay>letak</malay> so
[ah] <malay>macam ada</malay> what is it <malay>macam terpercik</malay> [eh] is it <malay>terpercik macam</malay> <malay>hujan kena</malay>
[ah] splash [lah]
like
if we <malay>macam takut hujan</malay> splash on us then we put the (uh) the <malay>payung besar</malay>
(mm) even though we under the <malay>macam</malay> cover [kan] but still [lah] we just
<malay>letak pasal takut kena juga</malay>
but still like nice because
<malay>kita tak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal kita letak payung besar tu</malay>
I think I think our cousin have I think [ah] I don't know if they already throw it away or not but still (uh) that time I remember they have it
but we can just ask
[oh]
<malay>macam</malay> glamping is it <malay>dia macam</malay> wait [ah]
ya ya this one [ah]
(mm) nice we can go this kind
(mm)
but I don't think
our family let us stay until that that night
like very
late night
if we outside there
you understand like
you know how our family is what so
I don't think <malay>dia orang akan macam</malay>
(err) <malay>kau nak</malay> stay <malay>pukul sebelas sebelas lebih dua belas gitu</malay> I don't think
they let us
(mm)
I not sure later after this we can google [ah] whether if we can overnight I think it's a good idea we can just take this one instead
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I think that's good though but rather than <malay>macam</malay> we since we going to overnight or something right I don't think we should
(err) take <malay>macam</malay> morning like that no we should like <malay>macam petang petang gitu</malay>
we should rent from <malay>petang petang</malay>
<malay>sampai ke malam</malay> like that so <malay>sampai esok pagi ke sampai esok petang tu</malay> ya we should rent that kind
so that <malay>macam</malay>
we confirm know we won't sleep [what]
[oh] nice everyone also can cycle right is it
our cousin all can cycle right
it's either the elder or the younger one right that cannot cycle
don't need to cycle [lah]
(mm)
more like a saturday morning
or what
because I think saturday
that's why I say we should rent from evening
then tomorrow morning we go cycle
after the birthday party what nonsense right then we can go cycling
ya
then we go cycle or like
we can cycle from the other side to the other side what you know like got mcdonald's all that so we can just
breakfast
but still it's a
better place I think because there's like a lot of convenience there
actually I want to skate [eh]
but I I don't know <malay>kalau ada macam ada orang lain yang tahu</malay> skate <malay>macam</malay> you don't know how to skate [kan]
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>abeh kalau aku</malay> roller blade <malay>sorang</malay> [eh] <malay>sedih</malay> [sia] <malay>aku orang semua</malay> cycle cycle cycle <malay>aku</malay> [eh] roller blade <malay>dengan aku</malay>
no one will no one wants to roller blade with me
then I feel sad [ah]
I will feel lonely if I only roller blade alone
like but I want to cycle also but I also want to roller blade so it's like
okay
you okay I think I think forget it about roller blade [lah] no one can roller blade with me
it's so sad
why not you roller blade with me I teach you
you want to go snow city I want to go ice rink
but nobody want to go with me
!whoa! okay I think is it is it Snow City can use the hundred dollars
ya
I've never went there before [ah] but still I think you because it's a very cold place right so we need a lot
then you need like a very thick clothes all that
no
(mm)
what about glove
for rental [lah]
(mm)
I don't know I just want to go though I want to feel snow even though it's artificial
but I don't want to eat it
I mean I I felt like eating it but like
everyone say it's dirty so I don't want [ah]
what if people really got like
pee on it or what !eww! but ya still !ee! okay I mean
people won't pee because it's like everyone will see if you pee there
[oh] I remember that time my [eh] my cousin our cousin our cousin said <malay>nak pergi</malay> zoo
<malay>merepek pergi</malay> zoo <malay>pergi</malay> zoo <malay>tengok binatang</malay> [jer]
you want to play with the animal
ya I don't know what what I mean okay maybe our interest like so different like
both of us we don't really like animals <malay>macam</malay> !hey! <malay>kau datang sayang kau tengok-tengok</malay> [jer] <malay>binatang tu</malay>
like
what's more that that you can do over there
maybe <malay>aku tak</malay> appreciate [ah] but
but still I really like that idea of glamping though I want
I seriously want that instead of <malay>macam pergi</malay> to be honest I felt right it's like one of the best choices
<malay>gila</malay> I will just research about it later <malay>lepas tu nanti kita tengok</malay>
how good it is like what's the review and
like how we can book all that
but I think they got to bring their children right
(mm)
that's why I say but okay [ah] okay [ah] it's a nice idea
then we can go for like normal outing also you know I feel like we should just
go out like normally
cause I felt like <malay>kita macam tak</malay> spend <malay>banyak</malay> time
<malay>yang macam</malay> cousins we don't really have much
time to spend together you got like
you working they working
I'm like I'm schooling all that <malay>macam</malay> all our timing clashes so we don't we have the time to <malay>macam jalan-jalan</malay> together

so we need to expect we need to tell them we need like about
six bottles
of drinks six to six to eight bottles because
we are going to like have birthday celebration <malay>ni semua</malay> from

<malay>kita pun</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>beli</malay> a bit of chips chips <malay>yang kita nak</malay> okay maybe the chips that they buy is not the one that we want or we can just discuss what kind of chips that we want [ah]
but then even after we discussing obviously we need to buy the one that <malay>macam semua makan</malay> [pe]
so <malay>macam</malay> if you like <malay>macam</malay> like me
I sometimes feel <malay>macam</malay> [oh] without this I cannot [sia] I need this snack [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [eh]

<malay>sayur-sayur kena</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau kau letak sayur macam dia dah macam-macam pinggan</malay> like that [what] <malay>macam</malay> bowl
so they will put everything inside only [what]
[ah] so I felt that it's more cleaner like that no
okay maybe for us ya but maybe not for them [lah]
(mm)
(mm) (mmhmm)
okay then like that <malay>takpe kita suruh dia orang buat</malay> sandwich <malay>tapi dia macam gini</malay>
<malay>telur suruh dia orang pergi rebus</malay>
<malay>suruh kak wer atau abang rebus</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) the tuna
take out everything
open all the cans put inside one bowl

if we buy the one with the crust then we ask them to cut the crust
ya ya what I mean <malay>dia punya roti</malay>
<malay>roti dia kalau ada</malay> crust <malay>suruh dia orang potong</malay> crust <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> crust <malay>dia</malay> we put inside one of the plastic and then <malay>kita boleh buat</malay>
<malay>roti gula ke apa</malay> with the crust
which is nice [ah]
then
the crust is very easy to do what <malay>setakat</malay>
crust <malay>tu kita setakat</malay> (uh) <malay>letak</malay>
sugar and butter together inside
melted butter
so that it's easier so and then you can (uh) <malay>apa tu masuk dalam</malay> air fryer
<malay>masuk dalam</malay> air fryer <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>jadikan macam</malay> snack <malay>keras keras sikit gitu</malay>

<malay>kalau kalau</malay> glamping <malay>tu mahal sangat</malay>

and before that we also need to talk about and about the gift right
so
(uh) if you want talk about the gift then I think everyone need to fork out about ten to twenty dollars
I don't know I don't know if it's better for us to fork out ten to twenty dollar each
for both of them or it's better to just buy whatever
they need because I think like <malay>macam</malay> whatever they like [ah] or need

okay [ah] nice nice

okay I'm actually very stress [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> the my wedding [lah
I'm planning to lik
two [lah] because the (um) the flat will only be ready in middle twenty not really middle [lah] early twenty twenty three so logically is the year before [lah] [ah
that was the initial plan (err) <malay>tapi entah</malay> the situation can change you kno
(err) so like I mean if I were to move as in just yesterday we were discussing lik
(err) <malay>kalau</malay> we we I moved to his house [kan] at least <malay>nak pindah</malay> to our new house it's <malay>lagi dekat</malay> [lah] I mean you have to you know shuffle between west and east to to move the <malay>barang</malay
(mm) then don't know [lah] to him like if let's say I move to your house as into your parents' house [eh] and then like <malay>rohana</malay> because <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] the the the <malay>budak macam</malay
<malay>tak [kan] nak</malay> share <malay>satu bilik perempuan lelaki</malay> unless they are willing to build (err) bunk bed [lah] which actually they are not sharing a bunk bed (err) we have seen he's not sharing a bunk bed with the brother is two separate bed <malay>cuma</malay> share <malay>bilik saja</malay
so I thinking <malay>kalau</malay> if we move to my parents house the
(err
at least I am staying as in sleeping on my own you know at least <malay>ada bilik</malay> and the house is bigger then <malay>dia pun dia pun cakap</malay> like [oh] ya ya I agree also but then the a bit the cons is that it's all the way to the wes
[ah] <malay>itu dia macam takut</malay> not really <malay>takut</malay> [lah] like you know too [dah] <malay>biasa tinggal kat</malay> east and then you have to come back all the way to the west afterwork y
ya it was to be a combined wedding <malay>tapi</malay> due to budget [lah] [kan] (um
maybe consider to do two separate size [lah] so <malay>cuma</malay> no doubt it will be cheaper but then it will be <malay>leceh</malay> you know because we have to <malay>tak</malay> [kan] I went to do both side at one place so like as in maybe one place to be different are
so it doesn't make sense [lah] to travel from the west to the east the east to the west then after tha
!aiya! ya just basically just a bit <malay>susah</malay> [lah
[ah] the one definite [lah
yes but then <malay>tak semestinya</malay> we have to move in straight away after we get the keys right I mean it definitely there will be something to consider <malay>macam</malay> like like what mother <malay>cakap</malay> is to do renovation for the kitchen you know have to put in cabinets and everythin
so that one will take time definitely don't know how long it take [lah] bu
definitely will have to stay at one place first [lah] it's either my side or his side [lah
[oh] that one I didn't check (err) because the only thing that I check was that if let's say (um) we get married later if let's say I get married in early twenty twenty three and will they still give us like time to turn in the marriage certificate <malay>ke tak</malay
[ah] because (err) I know there are the the protocol is I think if I'm not wrong [lah] six months <malay>atau</malay> three or six months to submit the certificate either before your house already or after that was like <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] s
<malay>entah</malay> but they did say if he cannot commit to that timeline then you can appeal but no guarante
yes yes but then (um) one thing about the the is florida <malay>kasi</malay> ready ready like (err) provide the flooring (err) basically the basic stuff is already there just that of course kitchen is bare [lah
(err) <malay>tapi</malay> I mean because we were so focused on the flat itself we didn't think about before that you know because when we apply [ah] it was actually just for fu
it was just for fun so (err) <malay>tak sangka</malay> that we get an appointment and then w
move forward then after that that's where we started to plan [oh] (uh) wedding <malay>macam mana</malay> (err) how to plan and everything because is like I told you righ
his family is very big bigger than ours so all the <malay>saudara mara</malay> [dah] <malay>besar besar</malay> how about lik
the <malay>budak</malay> the kids confirm like you you send one invitation is not two people come is <malay>satu</malay> famil
so that's why the the the budget is a concern [lah
(um
[oh] it's not like one whole thin
but but then if you do everything at once right it's save time righ
[ah] okay okay but then like going back to the wedding part [eh] for twenty thousand for one thousand person do you think is double <malay>ke tak</malay
I mean with now at this time it was is now twenty twenty to have two years to plan technically we have to already set aside some money because by next year [dah] <malay>kena</malay> deposit you know o
for the location if let's say you want to do for bridal then do photography videograph
!chey!
[ah] okay but then I mean ya [lah] whatever you face last time was it's good to know I mean who knows <malay>sekarang pun</malay> is about the same <malay>tapi</malay> we do have like thoughts abou
<malay>memang</malay> okay <malay>memang</malay> we did consider to do separate which of course yes it may cost less than just do combine but to think of it right i
<malay>kita buat kat bawah</malay> block ya let's say for my side [ah
I <malay>kita buat kat bawah</malay> block you have to consider that [oh] catering and decoration may not be under one (err) one company we may be separate and then (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> like you have to thin
that okay location you have to be one thing one (err) price and then your deco one price okay catering one price and then like <malay>macam</malay> you know that the the fundamentals like you say like compoun
<malay>mak andam</malay> all this separate lik
for me I think like [oh] because <malay>kita buat</malay> combine and it is a location that can provide a lot <malay>macam</malay> for the one at orchard righ
(err) they have catering they have decoration with including the (err) plumbing also and then (err) they include the door gift
and then (err) tables and chairs all set up all the basic everything is there except that the only thing that top up that one is just and
and if you want <malay>kompang</malay> then that one is different thing [lah] then the only thing that I have to worry about is (um) the ride
(uh) the bridal and photography but if let's say we took that away because <malay>kalau boleh</malay> I want t
satisfies satisfy my parents so you know [lah] my dad <malay>punya</malay> thinking i
such old school you have to follow according to what happened last time so we must have everything must have a big wedding so my concern is that if I cannot afford I mean not he cannot afford [lah] if I cannot commit to tha
you know that budget right make it a small <malay>nikah</malay> and then just <malay>makan makan</malay> [lah] after that which actually my mum say oka
but then you know [lah] my father got problem so and <malay>lagi pun</malay
another fact is that I'm the first one I'm the first child so obviously as a father want to show off [mah] so like (err) very proud you know finally you know somebody (err) my my child is getting married or whatever but the
!alah! they don't know the the cost to get tha
good wedding [ah] is really really great [lah] so <malay>macam entah</malay> jus
okay [ah] if let's say we don't do combine we do separately will be it will not be fair to him [lah] because he will definitely have to fork out more first on top of the <malay>duit hantaran</malay> and everything like his family is very big right so you have to cater more peopl
and then also we have to consider vehicle costs (err) to ferry to each other to each side [lah] so at least <malay>kalau macam</malay> at one locatio
(err) there's no need for any vehicle [lah] I mean there's only just need one way [lah] just to do the whatever photo shoot after the weddin
[ah] that's why at least everything will be there so for example if let's say you do at orchard at that hote
at least you know the night before stay one night after that [ah] want to get ready just go dow
of the after that you want to change outfit just go up or this area have like a fitting room whereas for like <malay>kalau buat</malay> two separate locations if let's say you want to change one outfit at thi
site then change another outfit at another sit [kan] <malay>susah</malay> and then <malay>kesian</malay> the <malay>mak andam kadang kadang</malay> I'm not thinking for myself [lah] I am thinking for other people so y
that's why [lah] is really really hard for me to think about this <malay>lagi lagi</malay> two years is actually very fast confirm very fast I don't know how to move from there [lah] from now [lah
I mean I get it [lah] you told me to work on it <malay>tapi</malay> the problem is I have been discussing like
parents [lah] all about these <malay>tapi</malay> I don't know whether he did discuss with his side because lik
<malay>kita banyak</malay> discuss within each other its <malay>tapi entah</malay> [lah] when I told him to go and discuss with his parents then <malay>macam</malay
okay okay <malay>boleh</malay> okay but then like no news you know after that so it's always m
either me contacting her mum (uh) his mum <malay>atau</malay> she contact me to get update because he don't tell her anything so how to work on tha
at least !alah! [dah] <malay>biasa</malay> makeup <malay>sendiri</malay> is best to you know <malay>biar orang kat orang</malay> makeup [kan] <malay>orang</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi pun</malay
burning hair to think of i
ya the <malay>mak andam dia punya</malay> at least they have experience you know in doing wedding make up and then also cannot take it already [lah] [eh] the cost also is a lot but then to me should not eve
I'm not say concern but just <malay>tutup</malay> one eye [lah] for the because like it's for a big day you see so you shouldn't worry about that and <malay>lagi pun</malay
I suggested to my mum [lah] like come [lah] to meet me and give me advice [lah
(uh) <malay>tapi kahwin sekarang</malay>
I don't know like nowadays people like I mean due to this pandemic [kan
so people are starting to to get married now because due to limited in capacity [kan] because my own friend also she's getting married on end of the yea
<malay>itu pun</malay> okay no doubt her big plans changed [ah] but at least they get to save money you know like whatever deposit right it's whatever the (um) th
planner is helping [lah] so like for example their they will supposedly do the combined wedding then it will suppose to make <malay>bawah</malay> block [lah
but because now really very hard right so the (err) <malay>dia</malay> parents <malay>cakap</malay> okay never mind I'll help you find one location they actually recommended hotels [lah
but then because is they have to top up more s
(uh) manage to find at this particular location somewhere in the west [lah] so (uh) it's not a location that is suitable for wedding [lah] it's more to like education wis
[ah] so (err) they had to actually emerged certain rooms to become one big roo
something like you know those typical conference room meeting room right so (um) no not they had to make this type of compromise but at least its it does not affect in a way that they have to top up mor
they are is still within their budget but their problem is right because now you cannot have buffet you have to give bento bo
so her concern is that [eh] bento box <malay>mana cukup</malay> like is a malay wedding [tau] you will tend to eat more tha
usually you do but so you is you limit to one person one bento <malay>macam</malay> is not fair but they still paying the same price as the normal buffet so she was very worried about that [lah] but then because of this [eh] (err) she had actually got enough as i
the balance of the money that supposed to be deposited for the wedding right she actually used to take out one more photographe
[ah] so at least you know you don't have to be stuck with just one so you just two so after that (uh
became because of that also one good thing [lah] I mean not about travel so she splurge out her so called honeymoon in singapore (err
ya [lah] the week after the wedding [lah] she will do that means like I think mayb
within december [lah] she'll she'll do honeymoo
ya of course [lah] you too just want the <malay>nikah</malay> but the
knowing that we're number one in the family so can I live up to certain expectation you see [ah] <malay>lagi</malay> !alah! I think because the his mother also <malay>macam</malay
!alah! <malay>mak pak dia</malay> [dah] <malay>tua</malay> so he she's been trying to push him to get married [lah] so I don't know whether that means that [oh] just <malay>cepat cepat kahwin</malay> then [dah] or just want to make it a big even
because [lah] ya [lah] like you mention that I'm still considered an (uh) outside outsider [kan] so I mean <malay>kalau boleh</malay> I don't want to <malay>masuk campur</malay> [lah] whatever happens because it's not my family ye
<malay>tapi kalau orang tu tak nak bual bual dengan mak pak dia nak buat macam mana</malay> I mean <malay>kalau boleh</malay> I <malay>tak nak masuk campur</malay> bu
if she keeps coming back to me I have to like whatever out of respect what [ah] <malay>sebab ini pun</malay> ya at this time <malay>pun</malay> is good [lah] to get married <malay>cuma</malay
definitely [lah] now you [kan] confirm <malay>ada yang macam kenapa tak jemput</malay> and everything and then they don'
understand that you know it's it's not by choice I mean <malay>tak yah</malay> by choice [lah] but then there's a limit to the choice s
if if <malay>kata</malay> that (err) you want to invite a certain family member <malay>tapi sangat jauh</malay> actually like four hours is like already long [lah] [kan
<malay>kata orang kalau tak jemput tentu telefon kata kenapa tak jemput</malay> [kan] family <malay>jauh tu jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi tetap</malay> i
<malay>jauh</malay> in the sense of distance [lah] not is in terms of family tree so <malay>macam</malay> like there was one example that my friend she just got married like (uh) think two months ag
(err)she was apologising to [ah] <malay>semua</malay> like [ah] sorry ya <malay>tak boleh jemput sebab kita nak</malay> limit <malay>kat</malay> family [jer] then we all <malay>macam</malay> trying to reassure [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita faham</malay
we can just view via zoom [lah] I mean no issue what <malay>tapi</malay> ya <malay>tapi</malay> you all are like my like my friends and also <malay>macam</malay> I feel bad then I was lik
you don't have to feel bad about this you know because you had you are the one who decided to continue this you migrate islam <malay>kalau boleh jangan lama lama</malay> [kan] don't delay right but then !alah! since they actually <malay>tuhan</malay> [dah] [dah] [tau] [eh
so it's not good to delay any further so she is like never mind [lah] just get ready [lah] but (err) but the downside right you cannot go do outside is still <malay>kat rumah</malay> so limited to I think fifty person right <malay>termasuk</malay> her family so she was lik
she was happy to get married but then she is like <malay>macam sedih</malay> because only family is there [ah] no friend so <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't know [lah] whether she still feels bad or not (uh) so she's been trying to like you come [lah] you come over to my house [lah] we will have lik
<malay>makan makan</malay> session or something but then of course due to schedule [lah] we cannot commit to certain times right y
it'll take about like a yea
because we are considered (err) <malay>sekarang</malay> first time righ
so the next one will be second time already which has a lower chance of ballo
alternativ
ya that was the initial plan but you know [lah] as usual pay me but then
ya like like okay [lah] you can like still had ya know <malay>tu</malay> I will have to discuss with my own parents but then he will have to take the effort to discuss with his parents also [lah] and once th
ya you know you we know what we want as [dah] <malay>bilang</malay> the parents then at least <malay>bila</malay> the both sides <malay>nak jumpa</malay> to discuss further at least they know what we want you know and then
I mean other than that the another one's stress factor <malay>yang</malay> for him is the <malay>duit hantaran</malay> actually until now I don't know the difference [oh] <malay>duit hantaran</malay> and <malay>mas kahwin</malay
so that means so that means it's <malay>kalau macam untuk pasal</malay> wedding <malay>ada yang kasi gelang ada yang kasi cincin</malay> that one is okay is i
and then for <malay>hantaran</malay> that one is considered lik
the groom side is giving a gift [lah] to the bride side is i
no no no not the <malay>barang hantaran</malay> but <malay>duit</malay
is it (err) [oh
ya but some people still want to display the notes righ
cheque <malay>kosong</malay> [dah] <malay>melampau kot</malay> actually <malay>kalau</malay> let's sa
ya ya true dare to it y
maybe because of all these (uh) <malay>hantaran</malay> right I didn't actually [eh] one post <malay>kat</malay> Facebook (um) this (err) is like a page [lah] where people can send in their stories anonymously you know like <malay>macam</malay> those magazin
(err) so is there a magazine is through Facebook [lah] so this lady was cheated and (um) you know I jus
got married (um) in iBloom <malay>apa ni belum</malay
as in it's not faded [lah] drag until like <malay>baru baru juga</malay> [lah] and then (um) <malay>bagaimana tahu</malay> that the husband have a lot of <malay>hutang</malay
on top of the wedding [tau] because it seems that for what I read like this couple has been together for so long but nearly ten years so because [dah] <malay>kenal lama</malay
<malay>sejak dulu</malay> so they they feel that okay [lah] since [dah] <malay>kenal lama</malay> [kan] and feels right to move us into to continue with the you know marriage [ah] so maybe because it'
(err) <malay>macam</malay> it's not like they are prepared to go ahead with the marriage is they feels that is the right thing to d
so because of that [kan] <malay>dorang kena ada hutang</malay> and then some more at the same time <malay>dorang nak dapat rumah</malay> which I don't know how [lah] so <malay>macam</malay
the way that she have raised in the story is that <malay>dia macam</malay> stress like <malay>dia yang perlu kahwin tapi</malay> you know a lot of things happening then o
then I just found out also my husband have his own debts you know like (err) <malay>bukan apa ni bukan</malay
(err) loan <malay>daripada</malay> #along# [lah] its like those (err) school <malay>punya</malay> fees then <malay>dia minta</malay> bank loan for study he [eh] from what I read [leh] he the husband did investment so investment <malay>hilang duit</malay
so because <malay>dia tak boleh bayar</malay> I don't know [lah] all this thing I I don't understand [lah] so so she's like was asking <malay>pendapat</malay> [lah] like then I saw a lot of people that why in the first place you go and marry that kin
you know you when you're not ready to so there are like people defending her there are people who are citing her so <malay>macam</malay> to me like I agree with the people who are defending and citing <malay>sama</malay> [kan
[ah] against her or citing her so those <malay>yang</malay> against her right are like <malay>macam</malay> you kno
why you go and marry the guy if you know that you're not ready for it if you're not financially already s
a lot of people <malay>macam kenapa awak kejam kat dia</malay> is her choice whether she wants to go ahead with the marriage and not but to me I personally I feel that if you don't have the money then don't do it [lah
<malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah] <malay>sayang ke kenal lama ke</malay> because I've had (err) friends [eh] who actually <malay>tunang</malay> urgent dating <malay>lama tunang</malay> about two years <malay>tapi</malay> ended they didn't managed to go throug
!wah! that means either like they are not ready financially <malay>atau</malay> just [dah] <malay>tak ada</malay> feeling <malay>lagi</malay> [lah] which <malay>saya macam pelik</malay> [eh] like you <malay>tahan</malay> for so long as in not say <malay>tahan</malay> [lah] dating for so long and the <malay>bila tunang</malay> you just give up [ah
ya [lah] a bit basically that the reason why she wanted to contribute a story is because <malay>dia nak minta pendapat</malay> [eh
correct but then <malay>entah</malay> [lah] I feel like but then to me [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> going back to my friend [eh] (um) together for seven year
and then <malay>tunang</malay> for two years and then you break it off to me is that ya you say got <malay>dugaan</malay> when they <malay>tunang tapi</malay> I feel that i
you are together for seven years you should go the partner already quite well so <malay>apa beza</malay> ya when you <malay>sarung cincin</malay> then [oh] suddenly all the problems come up you kno
that's the thing [lah] and when it comes to this thing as in wedding and marriage it all comes down back to mone
so <malay>macam</malay> that's what makes it stagnant it's not the fact that [oh] okay [ah] <malay>lepas ni</malay> (uh) <malay>nak fikirkan tinggal mana</malay> (uh) <malay>nak duduk mana</malay> but it's the fact that [oh] it'll also that plan you can do i
okay that's the thing that I can already <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] the downside right okay with going back to like just one location or just one combined wedding [eh] is lik
if you they will the basically right their terms like if you have more guests is cheaper so to avoid tha
as in basically [kan] you need to have okay [ah] for example like that that that particular location at orchard (err) it's for one thousand person is about twenty plus plus per perso
then another company is offering that [oh] if let's say you wanted maybe about five hundred people [lah] ya for both side that means two fifty each right then it'll cost about the same pric
or maybe slightly more but of course [lah] about thirty dollar plus plus and then [leh] I compared those tw
the <malay>lauk</malay> is not as much as the one at orchard you know it's lik
(err) if I can remember right the company is only offering five type of <malay>lauk</malay
(uh) the other one is like the basic [lah] got the rice chicken everything even got like fish and then the like <malay>kuih muih</malay> [ah] it's also very limited like some a lot of places are offering ten types righ
they only offering two then drinks also is like [oh] asia's (err) hot tea coffee and then like one cold drin
this this one is the one that another company [lah] not the one at orchard is another company so to me is that ya your food is nice your decoration is very nice we went to th
showcase and is all very nice very tempting and they even offered multiple locations but you offer your location but then you
package is so not good it's difficult you know and then (uh) there was one time (err) the package includes brida
he close bridal <malay>tahu</malay> then I ask the person if let's say I don't want bridal can I change to something else [oh] ya we can offer you th
<malay>kambing golek</malay> for about I think (uh) fifty people or the we'll issue (uh) like one thousand <malay>satay</malay> stick
you compared the price of each [eh] to a brida
(uh) as in (uh) part of the bridal right that means is (uh) <malay>tak salah</malay> it's two outfi
two outfit and then with <malay>mak andam</malay> everything he compared with the price of <malay>kambing</malay> and #satay
who would wanted [seh] and he still want to charge over thirty dollars per person <malay>tahu</malay> and they even dare to say you know (err) because you know [lah] <malay>perangai kita</malay> after every wedding <malay>mesti</malay> will lik
stay we will just stay until until the end even until the end also nobody else will just stay right maybe about ten minutes or s
this one <malay>tahu</malay> they say that you know if let's say there's another event right after your event [lah] we will have to clear ou
before before the end of the event so for example if your wedding <malay>macam pukul dua belas hingga pukul lima</malay> and if there is somebody who actually book that event spac
maybe <malay>pukul enam</malay> ya you have to start clearing by four which to me is not fair I like the one at orchard right the one they really said to me [oh
(um) we will only book one event for one da
so you want to stay as long as you want <malay>tak kisah</malay> do you know <malay>padahal</malay> both of them ar
<malay>kirakan</malay> muslim company you know malay muslim malay companies [lah] basically so <malay>macam</malay> it's not fair you know the way that they trea
who doubt service for the other company is much better <malay>tapi</malay> the

(mm) but I still think like we need
a tuition teacher because my husband feel feel that we should start young [eh] you got any tuition friend or not

maybe about forty to fifty
I want them to come to my house [lah] I don't want to travel out already very tiring you know

(mm)
(mm)
five days
so
[oh]
five days is so long imagine you <malay>sakit</malay> then after that you <malay>kena</malay> five days
!wah!
(hmm)
(mm)
(mm)
[eh] <malay>tapi</malay>
you <malay>pernah kena sakit ke</malay>
(uh huh)
[oh] (mm)
stress at work
(mm)
[ah]
[eh] (mm) now got what exhibition over there
!wow! (mm)
but
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>tak ada</malay> special queue <malay>ke untuk kita</malay>
[ah] <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>bila</malay> my husband on leave cause <malay>ke sebab sekarang</malay> [kan] december holiday [kan]
so a lot of people (uh) take leave
ya that's true so <malay>sebab tu</malay> [lah] then government <malay>baru kasih seratus dolar untuk kita jalan-jalan</malay>
[eh] you redeem already
(hmm)
[oh] go [lah] I see like <malay>ada</malay> staycation then (um) holiday then I saw my friend <malay>kat</malay> facebook [lah] <malay>dia tulis dia cakap dia</malay>
managed to book a few
attraction
so I don't know how it works
for kids one they they get this hundred dollars <malay>ke</malay> you see [lah] I haven't got the chance to redeem it
[orh]
(mm)
ya [lor] <malay>tapi</malay> complain <malay>cakap yang ini mahal</malay> [lah]
because staycation is known to everyone that <malay>memang mahal</malay> but I think
government <malay>dah kasih duit tu</malay> is good enough
ya that's true
!hais! <malay>susah</malay> [lah] I'm waiting for the COVID to go off so I can
go johor
and then I can buy all my baking stuff
ya
but now COVID I don't have you know we we can't travel out and then everything over here is so expensive
so at least when I I get to go #johor# at least I make a bit more profit
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
malaysia <malay>sepatutnya kasih</malay> singaporean <malay>masuk</malay> I think january but I think <malay>sebab</malay> case <malay>dia orang tiba-tiba naik</malay> I don't think it will come that fast [lah]
(mm)
ya that's true [lah] [eh] you know about talking about government [ah] they give the free mask new one I haven't collect yet and then the the best thing is they have the
the mask for kids so just have to measure
how big is your face if I'm not wrong
[ah] then my friend tried it then
the I think the quality got a bit better <malay>tapi</malay> the inside you can actually put the filter
then the <malay>dia punya</malay> outer layer <malay>yang kena mulut tu</malay> is actually very silky so I <malay>tak</malay> sure [lah] <malay>benda tu</malay> really works because ended up my friend felt that it's uncomfortable especially under the hot sun
well
know
ya <malay>tapi</malay> surgical mask need to buy every single time and need to change everyday
ya
[oh] <malay>yang apa tu makan dekat</malay> #seoul# garden <malay>ke apa tu</malay> [eh]
[oh] my that one to bring like what the whole family <malay>macam</malay> reunion dinner
ya [lah] but <malay>tapi orang-orang ni pun kena</malay> [lah] <malay>jaga apa</malay> (um) the
<malay>jaga dia apa tu nama dia tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>asyik lupa</malay> [jer] <malay>apa nak cakap</malay>
(um) <malay>jaga</malay>
whatever the government say <malay>kena ikut</malay> but the problem is I think <malay>kita pun kena faham orang-orang ni semua dah dah terlalu lama dekat rumah</malay>
and then they think it's a good time to actually meet their friends and family and until now phase number three <malay>pun masih belum ada apa-apa</malay> so I really don't know when phase number three is coming up
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya talking about parents [kan] my parent is quite old already so during period I tell you I didn't allow her to go out [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
[kan] the cases just go up and you don't know who is infected
<malay>tapi</malay> the weird thing is everywhere is still crowded
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>lagi kat</malay> got orchard then now what <malay>dia orang punya</malay> christmas period I think <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>mesti orang-orang ni mesti</malay> still have to go to orchard to to buy all these stuff
(mm)
(mm) but I think this year challenging but
something different so meaning we can actually live without
going out of the country [lah] but of course at one point we
we are bored
like my kids keep on asking me when are we going holiday
because we usually go (um)
like malaysia every week every saturday or sunday
but now we're always staying at home you know I have to come up with some activities for them ya
(mm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
I think more for us about
we don't have (um)
enough people it's about
you know <malay>banyak</malay> malaysian <malay>kerja kat sini</malay> [kan]
so most of them are affected and then if you see think my husband said that about the homeless people not homeless [lah]
they don't have any place to sleep over at (uh) singapore <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya [lah] that's true <malay>tapi</malay> at least <malay>dia orang</malay> come up with some (um) <malay>apa tu nama dia</malay> solution for the malaysian [lah] I heard that they give (um)
place to sleep and they even have some like basket food
to to give to the malaysians stranded in singapore
ya
[oh] [eh] you think [ah] the people who come to singapore <malay>yang</malay> malaysia <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>dia orang nak hantar barang</malay> you know like those <malay>barang-barang kita</malay> mostly <malay>datang dari</malay> malaysia [pe]
like the <malay>sayur</malay> like all those foods [lah] you think they have to go swab test every single time or valid for a few weeks or days
daily [ah] (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wah! [eh] you never undergo swab test before right
that's good that's good
(mm) (mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm) [eh] you remember or not <malay>yang masa</malay> the first time <malay>yang</malay> COVID nineteen <malay>ni</malay> (um) <malay>keluar</malay> at news then they were asking for people to be <malay>yang</malay> swabbers
[eh] you have any friends working for that or not <malay>sebab dia orang tak</malay> train [kan]
[ah]
!wah! but I think most of these people <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> swabbers <malay>ni</malay> maybe <malay>dia orang kehilangan kerja</malay> [kan]
(mm)
(hmm)
[oh]
fifteen dollars per hour
then <malay>apa dia</malay> wear those (um) protective gear
(mmhmm)
(hmm)
expose [lah]
[oh]
(mm)
precautionary order at (mm)
!wah! <malay>leceh juga</malay> [eh] but I really pity those <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kena berhenti kerja</malay> then they have like what two three <malay>anak</malay> to feed you see then some of the wife is also like what (um) home
housewife just like me
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(hmm) I think also (um) government is trying their best to curb this issue just that you know [lah] some of us <malay>ni degil tak nak dengar cakap dia orang</malay>
but I feel we should be listening to them at this point of time <malay>sebab</malay>
they know better [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
that's true
[eh] [ah] I wanted to ask you something
your you have any friends who
who sell cheap mask or not
(mmhmm)
!huh!
is
we'll see
(uh huh)
a few cartons
(mm)
ya that's true
then you know kids keep on
like losing their mask so <malay>sepuluh kali bagi sepuluh kali hilang</malay>
(hmm)
ya maybe I should just by those reusable ones
that's why because I feel safer using the surgical mask actually for the kids <malay>tapi</malay> of course it's a added cost [lah] imagine <malay>sekarang berapa</malay> fifteen to eighteen dollars per box
<malay>kalau kita dapat murah tak apa juga ni mahal</malay> [tau]
<malay>satu orang hari-hari pakai satu</malay>
<malay>macam mana tu</malay> very expensive to have a surgical mask
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[eh] so you don't have plans [ah] for the december <malay>tak ambil</malay> leave <malay>ke</malay> maybe plan outing with your family <malay>ke</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
can [lah] if not you can just order in
(mm)
ya that's true
<malay>sebab iya</malay> [lah] special day [kan] <malay>mesti nak duduk luar apa jalan-jalan makan</malay>
but <malay>tu</malay> [lah] COVID [lah] restricted
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] for me <malay>pula tak tanya tapi masih nak bilang</malay> [kan] so for me my family <malay>kita nak pergi</malay> staycation
(mm) but it's quite expensive [lah] but
<malay>kesian budak-budak</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay>
they're at home doing the same thing so I think a staycation would be a good getaway for them
okay <malay>selalunya saya buat kuih-muih melayu</malay> (um) then birthday cake then <malay>kalau saya</malay> time
<malay>bulan puasa tu saya sempat</malay> [lah] <malay>buat kuih raya untuk orang yang</malay> order <malay>tapi saya buat untuk</malay> small scale [jer] [lah] [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> government <malay>pun cuma kasih kita buat untuk</malay> family friends only
[eh]
<malay>kalau masak</malay> usually I will just cook (uh) whatever I have in the fridge so sometimes I make like <malay>mi bandung</malay> (um) <malay>nasi lemak</malay> you know those normal stuff <malay>sampai tak tahu nak masak apa</malay>
<malay>betul juga</malay> (um) before this I realised that after the
everything in the supermarket is like sold out
even the smallest things like what like ketchup or chilli sauce it's very hard to find the brand that you always use
do you agree
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau macam gitu</malay> deprive others [lah] <malay>untuk beli makan tambahan</malay> then you imagine if let's say <malay>gaji belum ada tak teruk orang yang diberhentikan kerja semua tak tak cukup untuk beli keperluan yang sepatutnya</malay>
(mm)
ya <malay>tapi mana</malay> [lah] <malay>orang ni nak ikut undang-undang</malay> so maybe what they can what I heard was they go to one and then they go to another in around the same vicinity so I think people are quite smart but at the end of the day you are depriving the rest [lah]
(mm)
(hmm) ya
[ah] <malay>ni cakap pasal masjid ni saya dah lama tak pergi madrasah di masjid</malay>
<malay>semua sekarang</malay> online
ya that's true but it's not very cheap you know so what I do was I borrowed my brother's laptop for my kids which is a hassle [lah] but lucky he is not using because he's (uh) on the airline industry so he doesn't need the laptop so imagine if I don't have because everyone every single singaporean needs a laptop
(mm)
ya that's true
(hmm)
ya that's true
(mm)
ya
ya
ya very poor thing for those who have been retrenched [lah] I think I would rather have a pay cut
than not having a job
what about you what do you think
having nothing right ya
(hmm)
some of them even went to (uh) try
doing the delivery like grab <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh] deliveroo I mean it's a decent job but
!wah! it's really you have to work extra hard for this (uh)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
that's long
(mm) maybe you you remember that we talked about the swabber he didn't want to try that I mean it's a risk job but at least it's paying (uh) well
(mm)
[oh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I think remember just now we also spoke about the swabbers right
then (um) my friend went for a swab test and apparently
they have a lot of (um) what is a holding area for for them to do swabbing test
then
I see a lot of them so I think most of them are you know they took up that job to just to
to
survive [lah] on a monthly basis
it's not an easy job I must say because you never know who
who you encounter with
especially when
you are so exposed to COVID
and then you never know if the person that you are doing swabbing is actually
(um) having that symptom of COVID nineteen
so I think people with (uh) young kids <malay>sepatutnya</malay> maybe could just do something else [lah]
there are maybe other jobs that community centres give
and then can also go to skill futures
to seek help
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya
you know the other day I heard another friend of mine so about india so india actually came out with a vaccine
but unfortunately when they tried on a person the person went blind and paralysed I'm not so sure how true is the story but if it's true it's quite scary because you really don't know
what kind of vaccine will actually work
for the majority
scary [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya
[eh] <malay>kita ni asyik cakap pasal</malay> government <malay>aje dah</malay> [lah] <malay>kita cakap pasal makanan pula</malay> [lah] (mm) I'm hungry already do you want to eat
(mm) #prata#
ya ya ya that is my favourite too should we go there
(mm)
[ah] okay [eh] that's the shop so come let's take a seat now
okay so I want
(um)
two #prata#
egg
an then
and one what else [ah] just now you recommend what
[ah] maybe I take the #prata# coin instead [lah]
is the curry very nice
[oh]
[ah] okay [lah] then I take one set of that
(uh) [eh] I saw like they have (uh) <malay>kentang</malay>
can buy one plate for me
okay what are you eating
[ah]
(mm)
[orh]
[oh]
maybe I want one
#teh# #peng#
no #teh# with milk and ice
why but it's so hot now I need cold drink to make me feel fresher
[ah]
okay [lah] then I take one mineral water
(mm) no I think that's all for now
[orh]
maybe this will take a bit more time [ah]
[eh] they have this food app that you can order online maybe you can order and then we just sit down and then they will send us the food
have you tried this
(mm)
<malay>betul betul</malay>
okay so you ordering or I order
okay can I will just order point coin #prata#
with <malay>kentang</malay> then yourself is
#briyani# chicken fried one
and then water mineral water also for yourself mineral water
okay settled mineral water
okay so the food will arrive in
!wah! fifteen minutes okay
[oh] no they will send to us
ya so because there's table number indicate over here so I just write down our table number ya
(mm) (mm)
but by having this kind of high tech technology [eh] you see for older generation <malay>yang betul-betul tak tahu pakai</malay> app they have to go a longer way to to even buy food which is a necessity
(hmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[ah]
that's good
so (mm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] so how did you get to know about this like how do you volunteer is it through or because I don't see this anywhere
so people like us cannot cannot set up like cannot help
(mmhmm)
[oh]
cause you imagine <malay>orang-orang tua lagi</malay> they wanted fresh air they just want to go out you know but of course at this time especially the period <malay>dia orang tak boleh keluar tak boleh</malay> you know do the normal stuff like even going down
[lah]
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya that's true
cause I think at their age the more they want to be
<malay>keluar</malay> to be free ya that's true so at least not restricted but now with COVID I think
of course government doesn't encourage [lah] not say that they cannot go out but their immune system is not strong like us [lah] <malay>orang-orang muda macam kita</malay>
(mm) (mmhmm)
(mm)
ya
(mm)
at this point you how do I say [eh] <malay>macam</malay>
you was hoping that your parents or any elderly will know how to use (um) handphone because that is the only communication that you can use especially when you really want to see the other person because but unfortunately most of (um) our parents doesn't know how to use it [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
though
(mm)
(mm) <malay>betul</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay>
<malay>tapi saya rasa kalau</malay> (um) <malay>mereka diberi peluang untuk belajar</malay>
then
then expose <malay>diri dia orang dengan benda-benda macam gini mungkin</malay> #inshallah# <malay>dia orang boleh buat</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>awak pun mungkin mereka akan cuba beli</malay> handphone <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>boleh mereka menggunakan dalam hari-hari yang biasa yang senang untuk</malay>
<malay>mungkin boleh guna</malay> handphone <malay>yang senang untuk pakai macam sekarang ada</malay> handphone ace samsung ace <malay>saya rasa itu senang untuk warga emas menggunakannya</malay> [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm)

requirement is like <malay>kena</malay> male female male female I don't know they have weird

no but
I don't know
it's like we have to
that's what that's what my friend say also
because I like to go to these kind of places [what]
all the haunted places
then that time I I tell I thought I told you before
then I when (um) they say always go in even numbers right went in odd
then I was the only girl and I was having my menses
then <malay>semua kena kacau</malay>
except for me
ya like <malay>kena tarik kaki</malay> then like

then they ask me [eh] <malay>kau pakai barang</malay> [eh] then I was like
<malay>pakai barang apa</malay> [sia]
then after that
<malay>antara kita semua</malay>
high likely <malay>kau yang patut kena kacau asal kita orang pula yang kena</malay>
<malay>kau tak kena langsung</malay> and the thing is while while we were there there's like (um)
a veranda
out on level two or level three then we were just there sitting to smoke first [ah] before going down back because the place was like super horrible with a lot of broken glasses and such
then while sitting there a black figure was
like
you know I can feel all these right
and and the black figure
all of us saw
and it was like literally like just
hung (uh)
hanging like
around me cause we were when I was sitting there at the porch
it's me and another two friend
then the rest was just standing around then <malay>dia dekat atas</malay> like
over over me and my friend so I was like they said <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tu benda kau punya</malay> then I was like

people beside me and
out of out of like
we went <malay>satu dua tiga empat</malay> (uh) five of us right
three of them can see things
then then they saw [ah] they saw <malay>kakak</malay> they saw <malay>itu</malay> they saw <malay>ini</malay>
and one of them also I think the family also practise all these
ya
that his mum [lah] [kan] <malay>nenek bising cakap apa</malay>
I because I also think back like
papa can get so many females swooning over him
that's why I was like
(mm) what so that's why I was like what's so attractive he's personality is like
not even that great
as in he's my dad but still like when when we visit him also you can see like this
keep on <malay>suruh-suruh</malay>
[ah]
then like [eh]
<malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ni</malay> like [eh] if I got a husband
like keep on asking me to <malay>buat tu buat ni buat tu buat ni</malay> and he's just sitting there and smoking like I will fucking slap his face with a broom [sia] and I ask for a divorce
I don't know
should we go to <malay>ustaz</malay> and ask
sometimes I feel like I want to go and ask
<malay>kita memang kena patut pun</malay>
<malay>ustaz kena bayar ke</malay>
not really <malay>salah bawa</malay> [lah]
I feel like I just want to know whether I have something with me or not

ya [lah] <malay>memang si</malay> june
<malay>tak payah</malay> mark <malay>sebab dia tak ada</malay>
ya [lah] we must tell them early so that they can plan
okay so what you want to go from morning until night
ya [lah]
ya so I think what we can do we don't go (uh) we don't go early in the morning like we can we can have a breakfast late
no not late breakfast we can have breakfast around woodlands first then we
ya ya
as usual [lah] we plan for the tickets
can speak in english
okay can
drive in [ah]
otherwise what you what you want to do over there for the
okay [lah] (uh) we can take the the voucher [ah] you want to buy the voucher [ah] meaning we have to go (uh) the
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
(err)
you have to go the four attraction
ya
of course [ah]
no [lah] the following week is the christmas ya
well definitely there will be a lot of people definitely
so if you want we can
then if you want to buy the voucher you have to buy before [what] just like the night safari
the four items [ah] the four D adventure then the luge the
I think the wax museum and one more I can't remember
yes yes correct
ya
(err)
think eleven plus [ah]
[oh] (uh) wait I know is until
nine or ten for the night luge [ah] seven plus to nine
two you (uh) ya the luge is two
two times
okay so the problem is the problem is if we take this [one] right
(uh) we will be
buying for
all five of us
but the luge you are not going [what] you and I not going right
so we are paying forty four dollars
four five of us
because the other three attractions we want to go [lah]
just the luge we don't want to go right
ya can also [lah] can
the three of them
but if #affaf# don't feel like taking another ride then can just pass it to the other two [lah]
then it's two two each
Subway
[oh] over there got <malay>itu apa</malay> Marybrown
(mm) ya
but maybe at the beach a bit tough [lah] don't know ya
have to
is the camera (uh) waterproof
don't have [ah]
can
#affaf# <malay>punya bukan dua lagi tu</malay>
<malay>si</malay> #affaf# <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] because her
her studies finish already [what] her term finish already so she don't have
ya correct
so you just need
to make sure the other
(uh) the other two they don't need to go <malay>pun</malay>
knowing <malay>si apa</malay> knowing <malay>si</malay>
(err)
#affif# I think he doesn't want to go down
[eh] what
twentieth right
the following week [lah] after christmas
can [eh] no cannot
yes (uh) (uh)
cannot
<malay>dia dia yang boleh kita pergi rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
<malay>kalau datang rumah kita tak boleh</malay> if we go out I keep saying to the kids
they can actually plan like for example we can go east coast
then we book a barbecue pit
don't have [ah] not open yet [ah] okay okay fine then just just go for picnic
and we split into two groups [lah] so the kids
all the children
add up (uh)
it's just nice
it's just nice eight eight person the children <malay>saja</malay>
force [lah]
monday
that's why first person to check is #aisyah#
I mean if you don't want to <malay>leceh</malay> then just do it at home [lah] <malay>kat rumah kak</malay> #ogi#
but if you I I don't know whether
(err)
going out is another option cause
okay so I suggest if you
one you contact <malay>kak</malay> #ogi#
then you ask her
then if she what he say [lah] you ask her for her opinion and all
then what what she say [lah] then after that <malay>baru</malay>
get the ball rolling
cause I think for us <malay>kita yang tak jumpa</malay> #aisyah# <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>si kecil tu</malay> at least <malay>kak</malay> #ogi# <malay>jumpa juga</malay> [lah] once and then <malay>ayah tu jumpa</malay> [kan]
<malay>kita langsung tak jumpa</malay>
since
<malay>bila raya</malay> [lah]
<malay>raya dia tunggu kita kita datang lambat kita ingatkan dia balik rupanya dia menunggu kita</malay>
think <malay>raya haji tak salah</malay>
[eh] <malay>buat juga</malay> [lah]
so my family side I can suggest
<malay>macam</malay> okay so it depends
(uh) ya [lah] there is a few suggestion [lah] one is
(uh) because <malay>sekarang ni yang paling ramai</malay> is either #mahir# or #amin#
[kan] <malay>kat rumah yang paling ramai</malay> so we either go to #mahir's# house or #amin's# house
<malay>kalau si</malay> #lina# <malay>dia</malay> happy <malay>kat rumah</malay> #amin# [ah] because it's more <malay>apa orang tu tak ada kucing</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> so <malay>ertinya</malay> we cannot come one time <malay>pun</malay> it's just <malay>macam contoh</malay> [lah] [eh]
(um) we split into two groups
so one group is maybe (uh)
<malay>kita dengan mak</malay>
so <malay>kita bawa mak dengan si</malay> #matin#
<malay>pergi rumah</malay> #amin# so <malay>kita lapan orang</malay> [lah] <malay>kita jumpa</malay> #amin# <malay>dengan budak-budak tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] then second group could be #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir#
<malay>bawa</malay> the children [ah]
[ah] [eh] [eh] <malay>tapi</malay> #andir# <malay>dengan si</malay> #mahir# <malay>dah tak boleh</malay> [eh]
ya
<malay>tak boleh</malay> eight groups is eight groups that's why you cannot that's why <malay>kalau nak jumpa kena macam</malay>
go to the one that is more [lah] [kan]
so <malay>contoh contoh</malay> [eh]
you just want the cousins to meet only so just put the children there [lah]
so #affif# #affaf# #shafie# three
then (uh) maybe #mahir# send his kids but <malay>dah berapa</malay>
seven plus (uh) <malay>si kecil tu</malay> #akil# #akif#
<malay>dah lapan</malay>
<malay>anak</malay> #amin# <malay>kat rumah dia</malay> so already join in [lah]
who which kids
ya because our children have to baby sit
[ah] #adoi# ya [lah] but if <malay>nak</malay> have a cousin gathering then can
and I think they don't mind [lah] because they haven't been
with their cousins
okay we have to ask them then
ya [lah]
but I think if it's like just cousins
get together before <malay>ini</malay> I think maybe okay [lah] <malay>tapi kalau</malay> let say it is (um)
so (uh) <malay>apa</malay> all the cousins meet one time
then okay <malay>balik</malay>
then
<malay>tapi kesian juga kalau macam gitu</malay> okay <malay>kalau macam gitu</malay>
<malay>anak-anak saudara</malay> [jer]
you have how many (uh) eight plus four twelve
twelve children
so they can't sit together <malay>pun</malay> I mean they won't sit together <malay>pun</malay>
correct <malay>kalau dekat rumah</malay> #amin# <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia orang bermain</malay>
they all together can play on whatever it is you know
he wants to host I think that's why I have to in it I mean we are brainstorming right now
cannot
yes
eight people can visit you
so if you're in the house eight people can come in
so to me <malay>biar anak-anak saudara ni semua</malay> all the children can come down at one time
then they
(mm) <malay>asyik datang rumah dia dia pun penat dia pun nak makan angin juga nak jalan-jalan sikit</malay>
<malay>kita biar budak-budak semua pergi</malay> #amin# you handle the kids
<malay>kita</malay> (uh) adults alright bye bye <malay>kita</malay> go for our
K if it's a red line [ah] and it's too (um)
too loud
K
K so yes what what is it you said
sorry again
[ah]
#amin# I mean we all have been coming over
we [ah] #mahir# because the other time his family come over #amin# come over #amin# the whole family his whole family come over
so and then #andir# <malay>selalu</malay> [kan] <malay>tu</malay>
so it's not like <malay>ini</malay> [lah] it's the together <malay>ramai-ramai yang tak ada</malay>
okay do how [ah]
(uh)
ya [lah] (uh) we can give suggestions and then let them think
so one of my suggestion is that [lah] (uh) let the kids all <malay>kumpul kat rumah si</malay> #amin# so at least the kids
<malay>cari penyakit tu namanya</malay>
okay so we need to
ya we can suggest #amin# would you like to
host the kids then at least the cousins get to meet
(uh) at one time at one go
and then (err)
and then he is if he is okay with it then
then okay [lah] then after that
of course [lah]
they will have to be in the house
no once you are you step out of the house then that eight group
[ah] apply
once you step out the house <malay>tak boleh</malay>
okay other than that then they all meet at <malay>tu</malay> their <malay>ayah teh</malay> house
<malay>ayah teh</malay> will be very happy all come come come
just that maybe #amin# (uh) only
the two older [eh] #umar# also not sure whether he will join in
no I think they are okay with the cats it's just that I don't
know if #umar# is sporting enough to want to be left at
to be left at
at this house
you know what we haven't met them
for so long
<malay>abang</malay> is stress with his schoolwork already so we have to see how it's going to be
K so
(mm)
right okay so what else [ah] do you want to talk about (um)
if we go outing how eight person meaning it's just our family
ya [lah]
very difficult
ya cannot [one]
the night safari
how and what else can we do with <malay>mama</malay>
the only either way is just ask
our family of five
then we <malay>ajak mak</malay>
twenty
that weekend [ah] the christmas weekend twenty six <malay>ke</malay> twenty seven
why
marina
the good thing about marina there is the wheelchair
so if let's say you want to <malay>pergi pun boleh pakai</malay> wheelchair <malay>kat situ</malay>
or jewel
jewel [kan] <malay>dia ada</malay> all those (uh) tours right
<malay>pergi jalan</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> waterfall [lah]
the the <malay>apa</malay> the <malay>atas tu ada</malay> the the <malay>apa</malay>
the
ya
we we also haven't gone [what] we don't know what it is
you don't like the kids like
ya
can have that kind of options [lah] so we we bring them over then we tell them okay you all go around with
schedule
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia ada cakap apa semalam</malay> wasn't supposed to be the timing to do homework
<malay>dia ada dia punya</malay> own timing
not today is tomorrow <malay>kakak dia ajak</malay> tomorrow
he he say he doesn't want <malay>memang</malay> he already say he (uh) a lot of his friends ask he all he told all of them
no
so okay [lah] at least he knows his priority
ya okay the thing is if she go for the course that she likes
under northumbria they don't offer full time
they may or may not offer part time
but that's the one that she most likely will do well in
and it's something that she may one day want that [one]
no the problem is
all others in singapore [lah] unless you want her to go overseas
ya
kaplan is one ya
ya we have been to [what]
academy all those are ya they are all different
so she have gone to all
the only one that seems to be
something that she may enjoy is at
ya that's why that's why I say so <malay>lepas ni</malay> she have to go to <malay>apa ni</malay>
she have to go to the other place to the other places to see
because I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay>
(um) the problem with all other (uh) uni they don't
have the coursework
even if it's (uh) and her lecturer one whom she took the last course [kan]
that lecturer <malay>yang</malay> quite good [lah] she talk to him quite a bit
then she the lecturer actually say (um)
that
if you he teach at these two uni <malay>dua-dua</malay> uni <malay>dia ajar</malay>
murdoch [ah] <malay>dengan</malay> northumbria so <malay>dia ajar</malay>
a topic module not on in these two uni [lah]
so <malay>dia kata memang kat</malay> northumbria
your work is mainly the work that you do so you do you you do your work you present
and it is based on hundred percent what you submit
whereas <malay>dekat</malay> murdoch
you <malay>dah buat</malay> all those work you submit on top of that you have to take up another
(err) coursework [lah] another <malay>apa</malay> testing test
you have to write [ah] [ah] correct
so she's (uh) worried about the that part [lah] that's why
no she already <malay>memang</malay> in this line
<malay>dia dah memang buat</malay> communication so she can
(uh huh) ya and I don't think she wants to do early childhood ya I know I know
ya [lah]
they actually have it [leh] the last time she say they the
officers came into the class and <malay>dah</malay> explain <malay>pun</malay> everything <malay>tapi</malay> (uh)
so from what the persons have been talking
to the group
even that <malay>wira</malay> guy is telling her that northumbria is the one to go [lah]
but northumbria if you want to take full time
the course that they offer is not what she wants [ah]
ya
course
they switch it to part time
so apparently I I suspect
(err)
(mm) more working people are opting for that course more working people [tau] meaning people who are
let's say they (uh) they want to do a studies part time so they opt for this course
okay problem with part time is that
if she sign up for a part time course
for us [lah] she (uh) or in the government's eye she is no longer a student
a full time student [ah] so she will be like considered as an adult already [lah]
so if she is a full time student
so in terms of say (uh)
(err) income tax then for us she's considered as one one child non non-working child
[ah] but actually that [one] not much [lah]
of course [lah] because she is [ah]
ya but then kaplan is private so they consider as
(uh) adult already <malay>cuma</malay> I don't know in terms of
(uh)
ya [lah]
like that [lah]
actually I don't know whether has she tried out
the james james cook open uni and all that you know they have (uh) all these other
unis [ah] which
I think
this is bridging for kaplan
[oh] my god that's why I was
ya [lah] because when when we took up this program
at that point in time the
programme was offering so that's why it was like an okay let's do it
and then now they tell us <malay>dah tak ada</malay> (uh) two time
it's very frustrating [lah]
ya so that [one] actually I thought (uh) I want to sit down with her and go through all the
all [ah] all of the <malay>ni</malay> ya
ya [lah]
ya correct correct so we ask her to arrange one day
where we can bring her to all the different places
explore wherever there is is it
ya [lah] so for example the other time <malay>dia pergi</malay> M
<malay>tu</malay> actually not bad and I saw the programme <malay>pun macam bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>dia ada</malay> sound recording space
all those things [lah] so and she went in they were all telling her [oh] you know (uh) this place is blah blah blah
okay the reason why we didn't go ahead with that
is because the university ranking is very much lower than northumbria
so because of that I was like #affaf# are you sure
new ones ya that's why that's why
either that or due to COVID everything stop (uh)
K so
we need another
ya we need another (uh)
round of her checking [lah] ya for her to check
<malay>mana kawan dia</malay> <malay>atau</malay> overseas actually going overseas
so unless you want to open up [lah] and say okay go maybe australia <malay>ke mana</malay>
practise <malay>apa maksudnya</malay>
that's why okay another option is <malay>tengok dekat</malay> malaysia
because malaysia <malay>pun banyak</malay> twinning programme
and twinning programme <malay>dia pun</malay> not bad quite good
<malay>anak ustaz</malay> [ah]
ya
ya correct
then maybe malaysia okay
[ah] so actually we just limit it to singapore <malay>cuma masalahnya sekarang dia ambil</malay> kaplan
so with that diploma <malay>kalau dia masuk kat tempat lain</malay>
one more year <malay>tapi</malay> it's just one more year ya [lah]
ya [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> ya [lah] <malay>dia</malay> at the end of the day <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>budak ni nak buat</malay> #shafie# <malay>mati-mati nak buat</malay> photography right he wants to be a photographer
that's what he wants to do
so
ya [lah] she
[lah]
you go into that
then there will be
ya but it's a skill-based [lah] so it's more about skills
maybe he might want to learn
more about how a camera works
so he's not just during photography photography but learning about lenses and all that
physics [lah] right that's physics right
so more about physics
[ah] so you learn how to make
the (uh) you learn what is the because
#shafie# <malay>dia</malay> once he is focused on
doing it he will
he wants to make sure that it's all correct you know
so that part is good [lah] he <malay>kalau betul-betul</malay> interested he will read up he will find out he will follow and all that
and it must be something that he wants if we tell him to do
ya [lah] you need to do your calculations has to be correct
your angles your whatever whatever right so those things are all things that he needs to be able to do
seems like it
okay
(um)
ya let's talk about SAM
I have an application (uh) by this person
who wants to (uh) (uh) okay because I put up (uh) a post
[ah] resale
ya okay so two [ah] one is about the
(um) recruitment
(uh) I put
teacher coach (uh) at SAM [lah]
so so far
(uh)
two person submit one is a malay girl who
<malay>bukan yang dia</malay> she's actually a football coach
she is literally a football coach so when I saw that I was like !huh! <malay>apa kejadah ni</malay> so she apply K
the other one is an indian lady
(uh) <malay>anak tiga ke apa tak tahu</malay> she is she used to teach in preschool
used to teach english
so she (uh) she apply but we are maths [kan] so she apply so I was like
maybe I can so if if let's say we are continuing
then maybe we should already consider opening for english
[ah] that's why yes ya ya I think is under one
ya so I will tell because
because (uh) we already signed up [what] it's for free at that point in time [lah]
(uh) when we agree to do it
so I thought
if let's say (uh) this in I haven't contact
I haven't I haven't contacted this
samuel I haven't contacted the indian lady who submitted her resume
(uh) about it but I will explore because if she is interested to teach english
then
I have to write a letter to all parents this thursday
we are considering to offer
[ah]
ya so if this lady she is okay to doing english and maths then that's where we can <malay>macam</malay>
switch her [lah]
ya
ya [lah] paying the teacher only
correct [lah]
ya [lah] I mean that is not the whole idea <malay>pun</malay> the whole idea is we want to use
up two classes so that we can earn the money right so <malay>kalau</malay> let's say we just use up one class then it's a waste of
resources <malay>pun</malay>
so okay [lah] so what I'll do next is first ask samuel
about the
the fees franchise fees and then second we ask the
(um) a teacher
no you ask the the students the parents
and then ask the teacher
what's wrong
you you go and pause <malay>ke apa</malay>
[oh] my god
<malay>putus</malay>
no [lah] <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tekan</malay> the other side [oh] my god [oh] my god okay
okay back to what was what was what I was saying
english and maths
ya
the chinese boy
ya
[oh] he he message he say <malay>kak</malay> I cannot get a staff so I regret to inform that I cannot do it
so I just
okay
the thing is if let's say we can continue to get the numbers
and then let's say this teacher come in
can run [ah] let it run [ah]
but if if if cannot get the numbers <malay>itu yang ini</malay> [kan]
so the partnership confirm don't want [ah] so I will message to say don't want [ah]
ya okay
ya
take all
ya
ya [lah] the good thing is like people just
come and just sign up you know without having to go for the diagnostic
session <malay>tu yang</malay> I told #ira# #ira# <malay>kalau</malay> let's say parents <malay>datang</malay> they already want to sign up you don't have to send them for the diagnostic session [ah] I <malay>cakap</malay>
because you can still do the assessment on the first day <malay>dia datang tu</malay> you can do
[ah]
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> let's say <malay>dia</malay>
because we also you know even no matter what also we still have to let the child start at the correct year
so <malay>dia</malay> accept <malay>dia</malay> P three still have to give the
the worksheets for P three right [ah]
if ya so on the first day <malay>dia datang</malay>
<malay>dia buat</malay> the assessment <malay>dulu</malay> that assessment shouldn't take fifteen fifteen minutes should be finish
so let the fella do that while the rest of them are doing their corrections then
continue [lah] from there [kan]
so #ira# <malay>angguk-angguk</malay> don't whether she <malay>faham ke</malay> she agree <malay>ke</malay> will do <malay>ke tak tahu</malay>
okay so
progress report I told #ira# to do that already
I <malay>cakap dengan dia</malay> print the progress report do the <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] the letter I have to do I have to do the latter
so that tomorrow we print out <malay>semua</malay> all one time [lah] so that's why I want to know what is it
that's what you said to #ira# right you ask her to do it through WhatsApp
in front of #ira# you said to #ira# directly
I was there so I think it's okay [lah] let her settle that portion
so we don't have to figure those portion out [lah]
but I think more important is the the letter to all parents
I don't know [eh] to me <malay>macam</malay> it's okay [lah] you just print out <malay>pun</malay> okay black and white <malay>apa</malay>
can't be bothered to
don't have to <malay>turun</malay> you have to pass to the children
and then we message the parents we have passed the
(uh) final <malay>apa</malay> the progress report whatever whatever we can still give the soft copy to them
but we give the hard copy so it's a it's a proof you see otherwise
<malay>kita tak kasi apa yang sepatutnya kita kasi</malay> on in june
july right we're supposed to give (uh) first week july then we didn't give
so this [one] at least we give [lah] everybody so everyone gets to see
everyone will know what it is
but that's for six months only right
ya [lor]
but then
buy over then he buy over [lah]
whether he can get people or not then he said
okay he what he said is
after going for the franchise talk
with Kumon which is similar to what
SAM say for
samuel say for SAM
then it is better for him
(uh) for (uh) the person who takes over is a full time
owner
[tau] so he was saying
(uh) Kumon <malay>pun cakap</malay> the same thing
so he the new centre <malay>yang dia nak</malay> run (uh) a franchise <malay>tu</malay>
it cannot be just he run and then he just close one eye and move on
he still have to be very much involved [lah]
(uh) in
ya sort of like that [lah] ya correct
but I was thinking actually no [lah] (uh) #yang# was thinking of
employing someone
to do the marketing to talk and all that russell is very interested he wants to do that
he messaged me again to ask
how the full time would you what what are you offering and all that
because his his photo looks clean cut [lah] so I think he can
ya [lah] he cannot speak the funny thing is okay I asked him so you can't you can't speak chinese at all mandarin you can't speak mandarin at all
then he say no I can't can you then I I said [lah] a bit
you know I said (uh) (uh) in in chinese a little bit then he laugh then he say
it cannot [ah] then I say during and all ya ya ya
(uh) I'm a bit I can speak a bit of malay a bit only [ah] I can understand a bit but
(uh) chinese not at all
then he ask why is it important I say [oh] because
(uh) nearby our place (uh) it this in this location there is a
international school GEMS international school
so (uh) a lot of (uh)
(uh)
are staying around our area and sending the child at that international school
[ah]
then then (uh) because of that
(um) we do need someone who can converse in mandarin because when the parents come to sign up
they cannot speak english and they don't understand
so when we are trying to speak to them it's very difficult so you know what he say
[oh] okay okay but now got Google translate [what]
can just (uh) tape and then listen and then we talk and then translate then let them hear [lah]
then I look at him
it's not accurate right then he say ya ya I know
ya
then he say [oh] but the children can speak english [what] so the children can explain I say yes
(um) we have done that
ya but I think parents want to hear directly from the teachers from the from the space
the place so it's not going to be easy
then even like the last time we had (uh) chinese teacher right who speak to them
also still it wasn't
wasn't that easy [lah]
so okay so he was trying to convince me nevermind nevermind got the app I think we can we can work around it
then I just [oh] okay
[ah] [ah]
[ah] that's why he said if you are paying him thirty dollars
for only two and a half hour he don't want
because he said the travelling the parking all is not worth it
correct [lah] ya so for him it is not worth it
so that's why he say if it is thirty dollars for two and a half hour he don't want
but if it is for four hours four thirty to eight thirty yes he will take it up
for thirty dollars yes
so he only wants it if it is four hours
okay so he has been teaching when he was in (um) school <malay>dulu dia mengajar</malay>
(uh) part time part time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (uh) he take up one or two (uh) students that kind of thing
then actually he is in insurance line so he used to be (uh) with Prudential
then he say he has a team he leads the team so on and so forth for a few years already
then he say there's some changes so that's why he stopped Prudential he move over to
[ah] banking <malay>dia</malay> banking so he was already working in
(uh) (uh) he's a graduate
[ah]
so he was working
(uh) but it was only for a few months and then COVID
so <malay>kena</malay> lay-off
last to come it first to go
okay <malay>dia dia</malay>
but he has always been doing tuition <malay>macam</malay> his part time [lah] and all
sorry
ya he's singaporean ya
<malay>orang</malay> #serani# so he he used that word you know he say <malay>saya orang</malay> #serani# he say like that I was like [ah]
[oh] okay okay and just and okay
so
maybe [lah]
but he and he has mild dyslexia
so he said he he had difficulty
understanding at first so he learnt how to overcome it right so that's why he say now he can <malay>macam</malay>
correct that's why he wants a full time
he looks like he is the type that's why I told him I like to use things and all that so he was like [oh] okay okay then I say about the training so he's also okay one thing is that you do is
then I say about the training so he's also okay
okay so that's why this this chinese boy that we are seeing tomorrow
he
seems to be a better (uh) candidate he's currently doing degree in maths
or engineering one of those
[ah] so
then he was sharing in his resume
that he used to fail maths in primary school or something like that so he used to
(err) do badly at one point in time and then he overcome it
and then he can do well (uh) and and starts in his course [lah] so he was saying
he understand children (uh) who have difficulty in maths [lah] he can he can relate so he knows (uh)
(mm)

something along that line [lah] so they play at the you know the youth park
at behind orchard road there so they play at the youth park and then they
they jam one or two or three songs and then after that
that's it then that's their limelight [lah]
after that
most probably they just go back to their normal job [lah]

but
(err) but ya [lah] I mean
unlike those in america or maybe I don't know europe they usually they usually put the put at lot
(mmhmm)

(mm)
ya
our our comedian the the malay comedian are okay [lah] but not too
not fantastic but I I sometimes they they can be funny but I think
(err) the jokes are more for singapore centric [lah] not
not really not really you know malaysia because I see that some of the malaysian jokes are
ya script okay it's not spontaneous but the thing is some no some of some some of the jokes also are really are really you know you can see that [eh] maybe singaporeans understand but malaysian they don't really understand
some of the linguistic they say
(mm)
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] I I mean because they are more exposed
most of the singaporean singaporean comedian they are not exposed or they they have expose but
[ah] but they don't have that that that talent because #suhaimi# also can speak a bit of <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
ya and then they no [lah] they I think they they have training they have been doing it so
ya [lah] but you don't you don't do it one you do it maybe once in a once in a few months [what]
so you can't but for them they have been training this
I think they just go into their mode you know they can just do it
talent show <malay>hidup</malay>

ya [lah] I mean I mean he was trying to find
the what he wants to do in life I guess
ya but now look at him again [ah] where is he
after that that that competition can you
is he in any other the talent show or judge or see he's disappeared again
so then you mean what he wants to join competition every two or three years then no point also [what]
they should start singing or get album I don't know you know
zoe #tay# is from my alma mater [eh] she was from #yuan ching# secondary

but now COVID don't have already [lah]
ya we'll it'll be nice to go back to old school most of the teachers are no more there already [lah]
think that's like right what
twenty years twenty years ago
no [lah] most of them are retired already
the malay teacher [ah] <malay>cikgu</malay>
<malay>cikgu ahmad suki</malay> [eh]
[eh] <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
[ah] so <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay>
I think somebody which
I think later I show you I think I have a picture no no not really <malay>botak botak</malay>
he's a bit a bit bald
but now as age catch up you don't really recognize him until somebody pointed out then [eh] isn't that (err) <malay>cikgu ahmad said</malay> then [eh]
[eh] ya
you know they are already old
most of them are in their sixties right
ya
why I mean that's natural progression [lah] I mean
they they have to retire [what] once they they hit their sixties
have the energy [lah]
professorship
ya [lah] I mean at that age you still have to keep up keep up with all this new generation of kids
ya the what now now gen Z already know now no more millennials
millennials are already hitting twenty seven years old means
<malay>sayang</malay> we are the millennials <malay>sayang</malay>
yes
<malay>sayang</malay> millennials starts
yes I'm millennial [ah]
nineteen eighty one is millennial start
so I'm like the first batch [lah]
[ah]
[ah] [ah]
even my brother is millennial
my brother #naz#
so #naz# is is considered millennial and me so we are within the one generation [lah]
no she she got (uh) she got an asset
but the thing is maybe is not a good time to sell so
so the asset is consider a lot [lah] but
but if she can if she can you know (err) ride through this
this time this bad time then if the property appreciate
ya [lah] but that one is that one is her finance
she did make some calculation [lah] I mean there is some days and so on
but the thing is she definitely made made (err)
make a profit [lah] but the thing is if she
ya [lah] about one point one million [lah] but
she can still make money like cause I think now property
(mm)
how much she bought it
but her one is at #simei# right
during that time
you can get that that kind of house for
nine hundred thousand (uh)
thirteen years ago
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] okay
I thought you she said she liked cycling
then
how how how old is the
how old is the property
so she buy second hand [lah]
!huh!
so just just
(uh) amber road
[ah]
you said just start paying so it means that
the the condo just
so she bought it second hand
at this time maybe she's
she get a good deal [lah] because (err)
[oh] so new [lah]
well that's a risk
development
(mmhmm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
ya [lah]
but her place second floor
what one point
[oh]
her main bedroom
[oh] cause so it's quite big [lah]
ya okay but
(uh huh)
okay
but why she why she lives in a condo
#dasha# when she can save more money right
(mmhmm)
ya but it's it's expensive I think rent rental for
how many people
because if it's a three bedroom she I doubt I doubt she share
her bedroom with another person [what]
right so still
so the the rent can be as high as thousand five
so that doesn't make sense thousand five
she can get a or full
three room
(mm)
(mm) [ah]
I mean actually
ya true but I mean you can always travel you can always travel take bus take train
ya I so it doesn't make I mean it just you can save more [what] if you go go on the outskirt
if he is sponsored
unless he's sponsored [lah] then if sponsored is a different story sponsored means (err) in the embassy one is paying for her living space [eh] if it doesn't then
it doesn't make sense to
ya
ya [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I mean [kan] <malay>ini duit</malay> I mean <malay>kalau</malay>
I mean now okay [lah] maybe now times are bad a bit difficult but they should be savvy right they should they come all the way from from russia to singapore
to earn money she
ya [lah] but
ya but she's spending on the she's spending on the luxury (uh) apartment
like you know it doesn't make sense [what]
two of them in the room
okay
okay nevermind
for six people [lah]
say about thousand plus [ah] ya maybe [ah]
okay
if six person ya [lah] if let's say the rent is five thousand divide by six and ya [lah] make sense [lah]
but then still expensive
ya maybe they want privacy [lah] one thing about condo is that they can have their privacy (err) is a bit difficult to have that privacy especially if you're russian and if you're not a local you don't look chinese you don't look asian confirmed there's a lot of stare a lot of people
be talking about them not so ya [lah] I think that's one of the things that that they can get away when they have
they live in condo [lah] so that
they are being sheltered [lah]
fixed condo
[ah]
[ah]
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm) (mm) ya
ya
ya social social class
and then how ya and how they how they (uh) being brought up so they a different kind of
mindset and
a different kind of thinking
so but (err) when they are young
it can you can see the vast difference [ah] cause
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya they they they have the advantage I mean you have to see that they do have advantage they have the resources they have resources
because sometimes
ya but sometimes they need the drive sometimes sometimes (err) what drives what drives people
(mm)
okay
ya but travel agent company last time yes they they do make a lot of profit
but nowadays is very difficult because there's a lot of disruption
disruption to the to the travel industry then people book
(err) flights all by themselves hotel by themselves
tours now even even like expedia
they have they have their own you know experience
(mmhmm)
how much
ya that's quite a lot
[oh] [eh] so he's the degree [lah]
during degree his taking tuition when his have doing his degree
(uh huh)
[oh] okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(uh huh)
#eton# what's a #eton#
for who what what
so it's in not in not in singapore [lah]
[oh]
depend on the area [lah] depend on the area if if they if you ask the vietnamese [leh]
the vietnamese might like my friend the <malay>tuan</malay> the guy
he's (err) he knows (err) he was
he study certain in ukraine so he speak russian so he learned russian a lot of vietnamese (err) they they have influence
by russian so so it depends on the area [lah] maybe singapore because we are called colonized by by the british and the so we have that the influence [ah]
(mm)
!huh! russia
I know a few I know a few malaysian but they they study in scotland [ah] <malay>yang irfan punya kawan</malay> scotland scotland
but is it recognized or not in singapore
(uh huh)
but then how do they convert
how do they how do they convert how do they convert the
the no the what
the recognition you know like <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] malaysian malaysia hospital [lah]
[oh] okay and then then okay [lah]
because if not wasted [kan] <malay>kalau tak</malay> recognize and then after all the effort
[ah]
[oh] why [ah]
wasted [kan]
medicine also medicine [what]
[oh]
[oh] okay
[eh] [oh] (err) #rundy# #rundy#
#rundy# #rundy#
(uh) ireland or scotland [ah]
ya
one of the
ya so
I think that one cost cost them about four hundred thousand [ah]
four hundred thousand
(mm)
ya
(mm)
ya most I suggest
most of them they they love like all my army friends army friends (uh) <malay>nama dia</malay> #kartik#
#kartik# <malay>dia</malay> just I just saw from facebook he
he just got promoted to become a a principal or deputy principal
so after like wait [ah] can remain thirteen fourteen
after fourteen years <malay>dah bukan jadi</malay> principal
most of my friends
in singapore
(mm)
I think the highest I heard is [jer] [lah]
so not not easy
but in in in
<malay>macam</malay> australian <malay>ni semua</malay> I think it's I wouldn't say it's it's easier
but I think
not much competition or either that or they are more
laidback [ah]
(uh)
ya
no it'll be different but ya
so
if the children
if the children want to go
aboard to study ya
that will be some challenge [ah]
(uh huh)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh)
I think ya [lah] because the the guys are not
are not <malay>madrasah</malay> train so they have more
no no the the
#adi# is secular #adi# is <malay>madrasah</malay> then after that he went to secular but for no #ahmad# is (err) all the way is
(err) secular
so that that's why he I think he took chemical engineering or something like that
so so he he kind of like you know engineering so there's a lot of option in singapore
so <malay>macam</malay> like for
for the girls they
they're they're
[ah] because they think because they take the A level right like what we did mention right cause there's no science there's no
in A level so they take the languages
so in uni they're being offered
literature they are being offered
languages right which which [ah] no so so socio sociology right
sociology social sciences [ah]
ya so the thing is the options are limited so that's why they they they think they're going to
for overseas means they have more option so that's why they take the overseas option

<malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan] so cannot really meet each other that much <malay>apa</malay>
[oh] but how frequently <malay>tu</malay>
twice a week
[ah] not bad [lah]
but like for me I remember <malay>bila</malay> I was dating [kan] (uh) we meet everyday <malay>sebab sama sekolah apa</malay> so <malay>kita orang sekolah sama kerja sama</malay> in the weekends so <malay>hari-hari dah tengok sama punya muka</malay> so <malay>bila kahwin</malay> I also know that <malay>takkan jelak</malay> [ah]

[oh] you met the the mum
okay
[eh] <malay>panggil dia apa makcik cik</malay>
ya [lah]
<malay>lepas tu makcik tu cakap apa</malay>
<malay>apa-apa</malay> [jer] <malay>jumpa dia kat mana kat rumah dia</malay>
[oh] <malay>tapi dah</malay> it's like coincidence <malay>ke atau memang nak jumpa dia</malay>
(uh)
(mm)
<malay>bapa dia tak kasi untuk dia mak dia tak kasi dia keluar atau</malay> like <malay>atau tak kasi dia jumpa</malay> you
[eh]
[oh] ya ya ya [oh] <malay>dia tak tahu</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> [jer] <malay>tahu</malay> [ah]
[oh] <malay>asal dia tak bilang</malay>
right
ya <malay>macam</malay> why he why he like want to like keep it secret [seh]
[oh] okay is he the youngest
second child
same as you [ah]
okay so do you guys like <malay>macam</malay>
but you guys haven't fought right okay [lah]
cause they say like you know
if your oldest you usually will mix with the youngest then <malay>kalau</malay> like the youngest hang out with oldest middle child I don't know [ah] middle chair honestly I don't know
but I'm not sure if like they'll be a
problem with that so far <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] K wait so what's your what's your horoscope and zodiac like what are you guys
[oh] [eh] <malay>apa bara api tu</malay> scary <malay>juga tu nanti kalau</malay> like if one of you all like <malay>marah habis</malay> [sia] <malay>dua-dua</malay> volcano [seh]
[oh]
so like your chinese [one] your you you're what [ah] tiger right ya tiger <malay>memang</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> [a'ah] <malay>bara api gitu</malay> tiger fierce
<malay>tapi belum belum belum apa apa apa</malay> so <malay>baru tiga bulan</malay> so you don't know [lah] like
I think it will take a while [lah]
one year
K [lah]
(um) I think one year okay maybe six months [ah]
but then also it depends on how much you see each other
so if you see each other twice a week then ya maybe one year
cause for me and my husband <malay>kalau kita kita dah jumpa</malay> everyday monday to sunday
so we dated six months <malay>kita macam dah tahu</malay> each other <malay>gitu</malay> [ah] so we hardly like ever fight cause we kinda know before we
like
fight that okay I did something wrong then <malay>kita orang cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>kita mesti cakap</malay> [ah] like must communicate and talk ya
then for you guys <malay>dia sekarang sekolah</malay> right so he <malay>berapa tahun lagi</malay> [eh]
right ya so he is
[oh] he's just a normal [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> honours [lah]
okay okay cause I think honours is like five years <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) four years so <malay>dia macam</malay>
okay <malay>dia</malay> start <malay>dia belajar apa</malay>
<malay>gitu-gitu</malay> [ah]
ya
like but why did he choose electrical engineering then
(mm)
[oh] first year already <malay>tak</malay> surviving [oh] <malay>rabak hancur</malay> [seh]
exam exam [ah] okay so <malay>dia sekarang</malay> end of the first year
(mm) so
if he <malay>pergi</malay> counselling the course counselling he might have to restart [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
three four more years with something you don't like [kan] <malay>lagi</malay> exams means you have to study for it
(mm)
[oh]
<malay>tu</malay> [ah] and he's still so young he's like what twenty five [kan] so so I feel like he still got a long way to go like doesn't really matter [ah] ya cause like in the end if you take this kind of degree then what if you have to pursue that kind of career then <malay>lagi rabak</malay> then his whole life will be electrical engineering which is like
probably horrible for him
ya so I think
I think <malay>macam dia kena fikir betul-betul</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau dia kalau dia nak</malay> continue <malay>ke atau dia nak</malay>
like <malay>tukar ke</malay> because like one year is still okay <malay>tapi bila dah</malay> two years <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] then I think that's when it's (err) there's more at stake because you're gonna waste about two years ya but first year still okay [lah] <malay>kalau nak tukar</malay> right ya and I think it's quite easy to actually switch switch like courses switch like your degree in the school
no no like in for example like <malay>kalau</malay> in in so actually <malay>kalau</malay> some people right they will (uh) come to the school to a course they don't want and then after that they spend one year there and they will switch to a different course a course that they want even though they weren't they didn't qualify at first <malay>sebab lagi senang</malay> but you waste one year [lah] but you get to go to the course you actually want ya
(uh) (uh) so like <malay>macam gitu pun boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if you want because a lot of people <malay>kat</malay> poly also they do that so like my friend they sometimes do that like it will just go in to like (err) some course that they don't like like engineering <malay>gitu</malay> then past one year in they get good results and then they try to muscle another like a different completely different diploma <malay>yang dorang nak</malay> and then after <malay>dorang masuk</malay> then they get to go [ah] so it for them is like (um) ya you you sacrifice one year [ah] to do what you want then so you can think of it like that <malay>gitu</malay>
but does he know what he want to do
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
okay so <malay>dia dah tapi dia</malay> electrical engineering before that
diploma okay so that means at least he has a diploma in game design and stuff <malay>asal dia tak pergi</malay> digipen
(mm)
ya difficult is difficult but digipen is like quite renowned ya it's really it's very renowned
(mm)
ya I mean take a risk [ah] if you fail then
it's okay then go electrical engineering
[kan] I mean that's what I would do [lah]
like I'll I'll go for the one that I think I cannot reach first then I'll try my hardest but then <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> you know that you tried your best then you go to something that you feel that you can manage or you can handle ya because you know that at least you tried your best [lah]
then (um) okay but he's in which uni again
okay so I don't know whether
has any of that kind of [ah]
degrees ya so if he wants to like
transfer to a different course in he has to think properly [lah] what kind of course he wants cause like
I don't think there's a lot of choices creatively at least for <malay>ada</malay> [tau] art design on media that [one] at least [ah] there's some form of creative output but for I really don't know
(mm)
ya
but you want to go uni right actually you were saying that time
but where do you want to go
what
[oh] okay okay
there's a master's in (uh) lasalle
(uh) (err) east asian studies
ya so like <malay>macam</malay> my teacher in lasalle the one I'm doing degree that [one] that time <malay>[kan]</malay> she's actually teaching for that and then she ask us whether we want to pursue in masters in that topic I I didn't want [lah] so [eh] I mean I feel like
(um) I'm okay <malay>tapi</malay> I feel like I gone I got degree already so I want to at least do something about it I don't want to like
like completely like go through masters and everything ya you know like
you think I'm like by the time I graduated I was already what twenty five ya so <malay>macam</malay> I felt like I needed to work or at least do something [ah] like not school for once <malay>gitu</malay>
ya pretty much even though like <malay>kat</malay> uni I I took a two year break to to like venture into like my like entrepreneur stuff <malay>tapi</malay> then I went back so ya then I think
I think that it's okay [lah] like
cause if you just study [jer] [kan]
then you still remember how to study and still remember how to like
you know do all that research and but after you work for awhile right (um) what I heard from my classmates [ah] <malay>yang dah dorang bekerja</malay> [kan] then <malay>dorang dah bekerja berapa tahun</malay> [ah] at the most <malay>sepuluh tahun gitu</malay> then <malay>dorang</malay> come back to like get just get a degree <malay>dorang betul-betul lupa macam mana nak belajar macam mana nak tulis</malay> like an essay like how to write essay all that <malay>dorang dah lupa</malay>
ya so (um) that was one of the reasons why I wanted to like just continue cause I scared that I will like lose the the hang of it <malay>gitu</malay>
ya then I'll forget how to write an essay and then uni in uni you need to write a thesis so it's like just words and words and words <malay>apa</malay>
ya so it's it's it's it's not easy [ah]
but like wait like you graduated in diploma
<malay>berapa tahun</malay> [eh] <malay>berapa tahun</malay>
(mm)
[oh] <malay>satu</malay> [eh]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
okay two years [ah]
so <malay>kalau</malay> you want to really go into uni like where when are you thinking
when
ya
<malay>lepas kahwin</malay> <malay>betul-betul nak kahwin dulu</malay> [eh]
[oh] is there a reason why you want to like <malay>kahwin</malay> first
don't stress
but what I can tell you is like
(um) in terms of stress [kan] <malay>lepas kahwin</malay> [eh] you'll get less stress about the things that you feel are very stressful for you cause like you know before I <malay>kahwin</malay> and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like I felt very
(um) stressed out <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>nak</malay> our our mum she [ah] she like makes all the decisions I have to respect her I've to respect the decision and <malay>ayah</malay> decision and it is very difficult because they sometimes they don't understand but now after I married I'm like my
the guardianship sort of is under my husband so he's more understanding and he's more like my way of thinking <malay>gitu</malay> so I feel definitely less stressed you know like I I
sleep like whenever I want
and and things like that [lah] I do pretty much almost whatever I want now
<malay>tapi takde apa-apa</malay> [ah] because [ah] <malay>kalau orang tanya pun</malay> I will just say [oh] my husband he's okay with <malay>apa</malay> so in the end religiously (uh) culturally it's okay ya that that's what I think [ah] so
<malay>kau siapa</malay> [seh]
so my <malay>suami</malay> is super like easy going <malay>dia faham</malay> everything I'm very honest to him
<malay>kalau</malay> I'm going to this place <malay>ke apa</malay> I'm going to overnight there I'll tell him [lah] I'm going to overnight <malay>kat tempat ni</malay> with my friends we just wanna chill <malay>kalau nak ikut ikut</malay> [ah] like like that's what I'm like with him so and that's what I'm like with that's why he's like with me also so <malay>kalau dia nak keluar ke apa</malay> with his friends I'm also okay like I think must have that kind of understanding [lah] so I don't have the stress and pressure that I had when I was under my parents
so I think that's one thing that
is good
ya
so
ya I think ya good planning if you want to do it after your
if you have to do it like after your (um)
<malay>kahwin</malay> ya
ya but you don't know when you wanna get married yet [ah]
but for you
(mm)
(uh)
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah]
ya and then if you are getting married at the non COVID
period
ya it's super like expensive [kan] then you have to like you have to think about how many people you wanna invite
and who you're gonna invite and everything
so like you have to prepare [ah]
<malay>macam dorang punya gitu macam majlis dorang gitu</malay>
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I feel like you're going to have to go through a wedding that you don't actually want
<malay>malangnya</malay> I think you want like my kind of wedding
<malay>kampung</malay>
<malay>ulam</malay> [seh] <malay>kampung kat mana ni kampung apa</malay> malaysia

ya I mean if you're up for #pulau tekong# [kan]
like I'm if you're if you're up for #pulau tekong# you're up for pretty much anywhere [seh] but I think you don't want #sentosa# right #sentosa# is too touristy for me
is like you only go there <malay>kalau nak</malay> show off
[kan] like if you just want to show off <malay>cakap</malay> like you like you got a lot of money then okay [lah] #sentosa# [lah] but if not then why why there right there's so many other places in singapore <malay>yang</malay> you can actually get
ya and you don't have to spend so much also
pay for everyone's ferries still will save money <malay>gitu</malay>
[oh] ya you just book the cruise [lah] you just get one cruise (uh) (uh)
then you get married in the on the water
(uh)
(uh) <malay>tapi ada</malay> timer [ah] <malay>dah</malay> reach <malay>dah</malay> reach harbourfront okay <malay>habis</malay> wedding <malay>habis</malay>
(uh) (uh) (uh) unless if unless if like you [ah] <malay>ambil</malay> the cruise ship <malay>yang pergi</malay> #batam# and back [ah] then okay got time <malay>tapi ada</malay> cruise <malay>yang sekarang</malay> they just like just float float float around then come back you know they hardly go and anyway and then by the end of the day you you reach the place ya and which is harbourfront and back [lah] so <malay>kalau macam gitu susah sikit</malay> [ah]
and <malay>orang tak boleh datang</malay> like wherever they want they have to come <malay>bila bila</malay> cruise <malay>dia dah nak</malay> ship off <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
[a'ah] <malay>ambil kapal sendiri kalau tak kau kau ambil</malay> [lah] <malay>sampan kau bawa sampan kau</malay> <malay>kelakar</malay> [seh] <malay>nanti dorang dayung sampan</malay>
<malay>mesti makcik-makcik semua bising bila datang dorang cakap</malay>
!alamak! <malay>susahnya nak datang aku tempat ni ya allah</malay>
(uh) (uh) [seh]
I think at night [lah] we should do that like in the day we can keep it like very civil very like you know then <malay>bila dah malam</malay> [kan] then we say [oh] (uh) all the <malay>makcik pergi tidur</malay> and stuff and then <malay>terus</malay> we got to the club and then <malay>terus</malay>
like like go all out [lah]
ya but it's just going to be a halal party though
I mean like no alcohol and stuff
but I mean like are you gonna like invite your chinese friends you know

buffet [jer] buffet [lah] buffet <malay>dia</malay> halal [lah]
(mm)
okay [lah] best [lah]
[oh] chilli crab <malay>pun ada</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
then you barbecue yourself or what
[oh] K
[oh] K K ya [lah] like buffet [lah] then you can omelette like you can ask what kind you want
(mm) ya ya ya
[eh] but no barbecue pineapple is nice
[oh]
[oh] because barbecue pineapples are like they are like caramelised so they quite sweet and sour at the same time but they're not too sweet
if barbecued properly [lah] I don't know whether they barbecued them properly or what
!aww! it tasted like meat ya
(mm)
right I think ya we should go for like those staycations where we have buffets
right
ya like I I want to go on staycation but I don't know whether you guys want or not
ya like
if you have a staycation then we got like swimming pool and then we can like enjoy like we get the ones <malay>yang macam</malay> the one I went that time the intercontinental like intercontinental had like is the swimming pool and gym had like yoga room so like they we had a lot of places to go [ah] even if it's just the hotel alone ya so even when it was like (um)
even when it was (um)
during the COVID but it was it was okay it was fun ya
ya cause like there were so many things you can try ya and then like it's not just a place to sleep in
and they had the capsule coffee thing
but they had all the flavors I didn't like
ya so I tried one and it was so bad it was for the like hardcore people is super like is like [eh] is not even like espresso it's worse than espresso ya so <malay>rabak</malay> so I didn't even K I didn't even like
take them afterwards after the first [one]
(uh) (uh) but okay [lah] it was fun [lah] it was for once you get to feel like <malay>macam orang kaya gitu</malay> (uh) <malay>tapi</malay> like ya that's it [lah] but I don't know [lah] like
<malay>kalau korang nak</malay> (um) <malay>pergi</malay> staycation <malay>ke tak</malay>
I know the <malay>kalau</malay> if the #d'kranji# here is
(um)
clean certified clean certified then maybe <malay>kita boleh pergi sana</malay>
cause there is like very secluded [kan] so it's a different experience <malay>gitu</malay> like out of city life
(uh) <malay>tapi</malay> I you still don't know what you want to spend right with your hundred
[ah] [seh] or you can go with us [lah] like me and (uh) me and #hafiz# so you as in
(uh) you and me will have this share the room and then he and <malay>abang</malay> #hafiz# will share [lah]
(uh) so <malay>kita halalkan</malay> [lah]
ya
I think they'll be fine wait is he like
[oh] so <malay>susah tu</malay> but no if they like
quietness then maybe they will be they will like the serenity and the tranquilness
I think we will end up making fun of them the whole way
right or maybe we can get the boys also [lah] then at least there's some a bit of
(uh) (uh) a bit of conversation to starter someone who can start a conversation at least cause <malay>kalau</malay> if it's two #hafizes# I mean both <malay>tak boleh</malay> [seh]
(uh) (uh) so I think <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] like we we can do that but it depends [ah] like cause I really want to like staycation but the thing is I don't know who wants to go and where we go things like that I'm like
I'm begging and like desperately wanting one like get away <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
(mm) january <malay>gitu</malay> okay
(mm)
ya [lah] but I mean okay [lah] we can we can always go <malay>tapi</malay> the thing is like you said [ah] must plan [lah] ya
(mm)
then is school is probably just gonna require the gonna like resume right as per normal in january
and like
okay [lah] so it won't be any different
I want to go like staycation in will be nice
I mean ya if the COVID situation weren't like that [lah] obviously
really [ah]
like
how how bad is it
it is
[oh] ya the one you told me <malay>yang dia</malay>
they had like the music
(err) show and then he had he was positive but he wasn't wearing mask or anything right
(mm)
(mm)
(uh)
I mean <malay>dorang pun macam orang melayu</malay> [lah] you have to understand [lah] <malay>kita orang pun macam</malay> everything also <malay>macam</malay> relax <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>kita macam tak</malay>
<malay>tak ikut sangat</malay> [ah] but
that's like unfortunate you know
ya cause
if like that then how are they gonna recover [seh]
like even
if they they recover like if #johor# is not gonna recover their
their economies going to suffer
ya so I feel like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> it will be really <malay>susah</malay> for them to
to get back up
ya
and indonesia <malay>pun teruk teruk</malay> [seh]
like indonesia is <malay>teruk</malay>
<malay>kalau tengok dia punya</malay> cases
if
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
ya like I think like
indonesia is also like quite high death rate [kan] death percentage considering like when you compare it with everyone else <malay>gitu</malay>
so this is very scary [ah] like <malay>lagi dorang pun</malay> I don't think they care then they are so dense <malay>gitu</malay> the the country
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya
ya ya ya like even for ours like we have all the preventive measures [kan] (err) then (err) but for them <malay>dorang tak ada pun</malay> I mean <malay>kita bila</malay> we needed the extra space <malay>terus kita pergi tukar</malay> expo [lah] <malay>tukar</malay> all the places that we already have <malay>tapi tak pakai apa</malay> because COVID [kan] so we use that place to (um) immediately make it a space for the COVID nineteen patients
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> indonesia I think <malay>susah</malay> because [kan] singapore [kan] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>asyik</malay> #kiasu# [kan] <malay>kita semua mesti buat cepat cepat cepat tapi kalau</malay> indonesia <malay>semua</malay> relax
<malay>dorang</malay> relax [jer] <malay>kita</malay> [kan] #kiasu# everything must be like a bit too much and then because of that it helps us also to be overly prepared but for indonesia I doubt that they are actually prepared because
like from what it looks they are not
(mm) (uh) <malay>dorang pun macam kalau mati mati</malay> [lah] <malay>dah sakit</malay> that's their thinking [ah] <malay>dah sakit apa sakit</malay> so <malay>kalau mati sakit apa nak jadi</malay>
so <malay>dorang tak macam fikir macam betul-betul gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang tak fikir masak-masak macam kenapa macam mana boleh</malay> (uh) manage [kan] all these things [ah] so it's very hard for them [ah] like india also is very very very bad
ya india is like one of the worst I think
ya ya ya <malay>yang teruknya</malay> [kan] a lot of the old people are dying and there's this like thinking saying like a rumour [ah] saying that it's
kind of on purpose because india is an ageing population and their old people are not dying
(uh) (uh)
that's like some of the people that they are like talking about it [lah]
[a'ah] but like I feel like it's somewhat true because <malay>dorang</malay> really <malay>tak kesah</malay> for the for the old people
[ah] then like <malay>dorang macam</malay> they will only like take in like patients <malay>yang</malay> have a chance of survival
so if you have no chance of survivor then good luck [ah] [ah] cause like what what what's the point of me trying to save you if there's a higher chance of saving this other person
that's that's how bad their their condition is it's like <malay>dulu punya</malay> america
ya during (um) last time when america was quite bad [kan] I mean now it's still bad but last time when it was really really bad they also had to had made the kind of decision like who has a better rate of survival then they will help that person so <malay>macam kesian</malay> [ah] but in india it's like that every day now
(mm)
ya
ya
ya I I feel like ya but I mean the government can do much more <malay>tapi</malay> they don't so there must be a reason why why they're doing it like you know
ya I mean even singapore we are an ageing population but we don't do that <malay>kita cakap lepas tu kita bilang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang orang-orang tua jangan keluar jangan</malay> like
don't mess [lah] don't mess with other don't go meet with other people all that <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
ya <malay>tapi orang-orang tua dorang</malay> [kan] (uh) <malay>tak nak memang tak nak dorang sendiri tak nak tu dorang punya pasal</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>kita orang dah cakap pakai</malay> mask and <malay>jangan</malay> (uh) <malay>jangan keluar-keluar banyak sangat tapi dorang</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau nak keluar keluar</malay> [lah] <malay>apa nak jadi</malay>
(uh) (uh)
ya ya ya
(mm)
ya ya ya
ya you want to pay for my fine
ya exactly then is like and the thing is right we have this like culture where we do we can't talk back to them
because they are older right so we have to respect them so even if we don't want to ya so <malay>macam</malay> (um) there was this <malay>atuk</malay> not <malay>atuk</malay> #ah pek# in the bus and he wasn't wearing mask you know and he was coughing and everyone was just like [oh] no but we can't say anything to him so we were just like
ya that was ya that was the whole atmosphere of the whole bus
like we will just like !huh! like what what are we supposed to do you know [ah] but like <malay>kita tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> cause he's just like he is obviously looks like he doesn't wanna talk to anyone he doesn't want anyone to approach him about it also so I'm like okay
ya so it was in the bus
ya so that was like quite bad [ah]
ya
ya I was in the bus and I was sitting opposite him
ya ya
[ah] luck luckily like (mm) I alighted much like (err) quite fast [lah] so so I I like okay it's not so bad ya but like
in the place that I stay at got a lot of old people like that
<malay>orang tak suka pakai</malay> mask and they will like meet up you know like they will meet up in the void deck so a couple of
#ah pek# together <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> more than five people and then they will like they will just talk talk talk <malay>macam biasa</malay> [lah] <malay>macam tak ada</malay> COVID <malay>gitu tapi kita orang tak boleh buat apa-apa kita orang</malay> just <malay>biarkan</malay> [jer] [ah]
(uh)
(uh huh)
ya
ya
(mm)
ya
(uh)
ya ya ya ya like the do not
sit (uh)
(uh)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(uh)
correct the security guard I think trying to find something to do [lah] <malay>dia dah dia dah</malay> like bored [lah] I think
okay
(uh)
(uh) and just be aunties [lah]
ya ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(uh) (uh) [seh]
(uh) (uh)
ya
ya that's why some some guards are like like they really got nothing better to do some guards cannot be bothered like you know the are some like those like people like sitting there <malay>dorang tak tengok pun</malay> [tau] <malay>kalau kalau kau</malay> scan <malay>ke kau tak</malay> scan <malay>ke dorang</malay> just <malay>masuk dia kasi masuk</malay> [jer] <malay>dorang tak kesah</malay> [kan] ya so it's like it's so like (uh) jarring you know sometimes ya but I feel like at least okay [lah] singapore got like precautions to keep everything like safe you know like safe and stuff like that because if not [ah] I think it will be bad because we are so dense we are such a dense so densely populated like island ya like
(um) but because everyone has to wear mask so <malay>tak tak boleh buat apa-apa</malay> so it's that's why <malay>tak ada macam</malay> transmission not so much of transmission [ah] ya
(mm)
[ah] ya ya correct correct correct because we are so like [oh] my god so close to each other but because we are wearing mask even though we are very close to each other it's very hard to [ah] ya and then we already have the thing like myself if you will and what if you are having any flu like symptoms or what and then you try not
to go out or go to see the doctor when you go see the doctor don't take bus take the take the private take Grab or something like that [kan] so (err) it's it's like already in our we already know you know like (um) the social way to like <malay>macam</malay> social responsibility [lah] ya ya like so like we are now it's like like second nature already cause <malay>dah berapa lama</malay> [seh] <malay>dah berapa bulan</malay> going to one year I feel
ya december twenty nineteen
(mm)
that's why then I'm like also like
quite surprised that we had to spend a whole year or twenty twenty in a pandemic but it's not as bad as what I thought it was going to be luckily because we're here <malay>sebab</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau kalau negara lain negeri lain</malay> is like !wow! <malay>betul-betul rabak</malay> like but <malay>kat</malay> singapore they handled it quite well especially for the foreign worker <malay>punya</malay> time that time <malay>bila dorang hari-hari berapa ratus</malay> [seh] ya
ya
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) how how their conditions were right
[oh] my god ya true
ya and I think people are actually like using their hand sanitisers and stuff I mean like at least now people are washing their hands
with soap like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>siapa nak cuci tangan dengan</malay> soap I ask you like <malay>tak ada</malay> [seh] all the aunty [ah] wash hand only wash water can already [lah] <malay>dorang memang mesti tak pakai</malay> soap <malay>punya mana ada pakai</malay> soap [seh]
(uh)
(uh)
(uh)
now now they don't now they're like [ah] ya <malay>kalau</malay> tak wash <malay>nanti</malay> [eh] you never wash you never like use the soap [ah] then <malay>lepas tu baru dorang</malay>
you you really <malay>pakai</malay> the soap ya
(mm)
good things comes of it (uh) come out from it [lah] ya ya ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] like I think it's (um) inevitable [lah] like we have to learn it the hard way also ya but because of that we are much cleaner society like you know our toilets are cleaner
like I realise that ya because they they have to clean it more
so the toilets are generally cleaner [ah] so like okay [ah] it's not bad [ah] (um) mean at least now we are not like confine you know lockdown [kan] and know france [kan] <malay>dah</malay> second lockdown
ya so they had to go back in because it was so bad
ya so we are now living like normally pretty much ya so we have lot things to be grateful for I think
ya just that we can't like travel
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) cause it's not a law is it
cause it's not a law is it
okay it's not like singapore where where they have where we have like the ambassadors you know
ya I know right I mean we we just have to suck thumb suck thumb [jer] [ah] cause no choice [kan] ya but in the end we realise it's better that way actually
ya rather than <malay>macam kat</malay> sweden where it's like free and easy and then !wow! the death rates are like crazy [seh]
ya so I think that there is that needs to be some
order [ah] law and like you know some order in the country
if not it's really goes out of control ya
I heard japan also is quite bad it's going nuts are getting worse
and they had like a campaign to travel you know go to travel and then (err) some people made a a like sarcastic kind of (err) remark it's like (err) go to hospital
go to heaven ya this this [one] they say go to hospital because they found out like
the there's a lot more cases actually then now it's quite bad <malay>kat</malay> japan [lah] <malay>so dorang kena mula balik</malay> [ah] everything [lah] have to go back the mask and all that (err) I mean for mask I think they're okay ya but social distancing all that stuff [lah] ya I think everywhere is still quite bad [eh] but not only some of the other countries some very very few countries that are having it controlled even for us we had that one of the guy at seoul garden [kan] <malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
<malay>tapi</malay> for me I <malay>kesian dia dia macam aku nak makan kat</malay> seoul garden <malay>sekali dengan kawan-kawan keluarga-keluarga aku terus terkena tu</malay> [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kesian</malay> [seh] [ah] <malay>nasib baik dia pergi</malay> doctor
[ah] <malay>naisb baik dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>lepas tu</malay> you know it can be people can get detected and stuff so it's it's still not so bad ya and is only one guy right for that day only one guy but he had a big group ya [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] so
I mean I think <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> he got more hate than
what he should have gotten <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no <malay>dorang</malay> three tables (uh)
so there were still like <malay>macam</malay> #bergroup# <malay>tapi</malay> (err) it was distance distance three distance tables but I think they got mix around [lah] <malay>macam kadang-kadang dorang</malay> mix like you sit here I sit there <malay>ke apa</malay> mix food (err) so maybe have that kind of thing ya so there's the (um) the fear that they have [lah]
ya so <malay>kesian</malay> [ah]
(uh)
(uh)
that time [ah]
ya ya
and <malay>dia dia sakit</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pergi</malay> doctor then <malay>bila dah kena</malay> COVID and the check up [oh] at least I was with twelve other people
even though we actually followed [lah] the rules and stuff <malay>kat sini</malay> seoul garden [ah] if me I think I wouldn't say so much [seh] I <malay>diam diam</malay> [jer] <malay>tak</malay> [lah] but like I feel like <malay>macam</malay> why get myself into more trouble than than what I have already [kan] ya so I feel like (um) he's actually good part [ah] for him to be really responsible also
ya
like for now because like when you eat and drink you don't really
like it's almost like normal
ya
ya
ya exactly cause it's like we're trying to get back to norm and then you know the japanese he's he actually recommended (err) people to wear mask even when we're eating I don't know when we're eating or drinking then I'm like I saw the headline then I was like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
like what the hell does that even mean <malay>gitu</malay> (uh) (uh) so I I was like !wow! this prime minister really wants to like (err) reduce the number of COVID but I have no idea how he plans to do that
(uh) (uh) I think it was like you know you like open a bit from the bottom then you <malay>makan</malay> then I'm like but it's so like
inconvenient and I don't think it's going to work anyway
like what my what this centre does some this centre that I go to
they have like the glass thing so it's like a circle it's a circle table but there and then there's four chairs but they have the glass thing so we can eat with other people but we they have the glass so we that it's like (err) you you don't you can't transmit anything [lah] so I think that's fine but if you're talking about wearing a mask to and and eating the same time I don't know how that's going to work [seh]
that's why I don't know what the prime minister is thinking even
like it became headline some more [leh] then I'm like [oh] my goodness
(uh)
this kind of like way to combat right (uh) (uh) it's like I read it I cannot forget [seh] then I keep telling people then people like
how then I'm like I don't know like that's it's ridiculous but he said it in national so (err) ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> like I don't even I I I don't know how he's going to do it don't know how the japanese people are gonna do it [ah] <malay>bagus</malay> [ah] <malay>dorang habis</malay> [ah] [a'ah] <malay>tu</malay> [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> it's
it it's already a bad situation as it is and then he's trying to make it even more ridiculous
ya ya ya he's just like [ah] give up [lah] <malay>dah mengaku kalah</malay>
ya they are do trying to do that they have a lot of small initiative to <malay>macam</malay> (err) cheer up the community <malay>gitu</malay> (um) it doesn't evade the fact that they're going through a difficult time [lah]

I've been doing well [lah] actually what about you
!wah! actually it was not bad [leh] like (uh) at first
(uh) I thought like I'll have a lot of problems but actually it was quite smooth
then <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>nak masuk sekolah pun senang /malay>
[oh] in Australia <malay>belajar macam</malay> basics like Mathematics English
(err) <malay>habis tu</malay> I also <malay>belajar macam</malay>
Law and Literature so ya very interesting
(oo) my most favorite [ah] is definitely (um) <malay>belajar apa ni</malay> Law because it's very interesting [lah] like I get to learn about you know Australian law and it's (uh) it's a it's a subject that you know you don't learn

ya and (err) this course is like it appeals to me [lah] because I also I really love designing ya and the coding coding element is also like quite interesting so and I
feel like it might help me in the future when I look out for jobs cause now <malay>macam</malay> (um) <malay>banyak benda</malay> is like about technology [kan] so ya I feel like this course (uh) actually benefit me [lah] in the future
(mm)
(oo) so

ideation so <malay>macam kita belajar macam mana nak</malay> (uh) brainstorm ideas (uh) for a project and it helps us in our like design thinking
so (uh) for you [ah] you said you were in like (um) marine engineering right so what like what what are the the modules <malay>yang kau</malay> enjoy
(oo) that's not bad

[oh]
!wah!
I can't I can't imagine myself in that situation <malay>macam nanti</malay>if if I were to be in that situation confirm I I would panic
so <malay>susah tak macam kerja</malay> like in a like a team
like during that that test
[oh] right
(mm)
[oh]
that's that's interesting I think you will do very well [lah]
yeah
don't worry I think with all the skills you are equipped with confirm you
<malay>boleh boleh buat kerja</malay>
then (uh) (uh) besides <malay>sekolah</malay> [kan] like what what do you like to do <malay>macam</malay> do you have <malay>macam</malay> other hobby <malay>ke</malay> or <malay>apa apa benda</malay> [lah]
[ah]
(mm)
ya I I know how you feel like during secondary school <malay>pastu ada apa</malay> O level <malay>abeh</malay> stress <malay>takle fikir</malay> yeah
[oh] during my free time I <malay>suka</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam</malay> (uh) draw I also like to (err) <malay>tengok apa ni</malay>
[ah] anime ya that's my favourite but I haven't really been doing so because <malay>takde</malay> time [kan] poly <malay>dalam</malay> I'm in a design course so I don't really have much time to (uh) do my hobbies which is kind of (uh) <malay>macam sedih</malay> but yeah so
now that I'm having my semester break I can finally (uh) do (uh) my hobbies
yeah
yep
actually <malay>ada banyak</malay> plan but like the thing is that I just like I'm just I'm too scared to
go for the trials (err) because I (um) I'm actually afraid of rejection
but (um) I'll probably you know I just want to like build up confidence in myself first then (um) maybe in (uh) (um) year two then I will start <malay>macam</malay> join like start trying out for [ah] I've actually picked
<malay>macam</malay> a few is (err) firstly is [ah] floorball like (um) <malay>aku kata tadi</malay> [kan] as I've mentioned (uh) floorball and then second was silat
and then third is <malay>dikir barat</malay> ya but
I I'm actually having a hard time trying to decide which I wanna join so what do you think
yeah
true
who knows
ya it is it is that's why <malay>macam</malay> I'm like a bit <malay>takut</malay> to (um) you know join their team because (err) <malay>macam dorang nya</malay> expectations like a bit high you know so I'm I'm I'm afraid like tak boleh meet <malay>dorang nya</malay> expectations
yes I have like a few months to think about it so ya then (um) so okay we talking about poly and stuff so like today what did you do today
!wah! how was it
but I think right I think confirm <malay>boleh</malay> pass <malay>punya</malay> confirm
yeah
[oh] for what
[oh] <malay>mesti sakit</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa tu</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
<malay>banyak</malay>
[ah]
yeah
(mm)
then the the surgery <malay>bila</malay>
[oh]
!wow!
ya man I can't imagine myself
!wah! all the best for that for that surgery you you will get through it
it's okay it my my my mum my mum has been through the same thing then <malay>dia</malay> <malay>dia kata</malay> like
(um) it's actually not that painful [lah] because like you know they put you in (uh) on sleep right so like you won't feel anything like you only feel it like once you <malay>bangun</malay> so I don't think it's that bad ya so you don't have to worry you know
and anyways it's for the better also so I think [ah] after if I think it's better to get like the surgery done like as soon as possible because you know you <malay>tak nak</malay> any <malay>macam</malay> side effects [kan] so ya
then
(uh) other than
then right you you said that you had your I mean you're gonna have like a surgery right
so (uh) how
how how how would you feel like <malay>macam</malay> you know before you enter the the room like what do you think like <malay>macam</malay> like your feeling
[oh]
yeah
(uh) I've never I've never <malay>apa ni</malay> had any surgeries before
I
I can't imagine the <malay>macam dia nya</malay> sakit
[eh] then [oh]
[eh] you go first
ya
yeah
yeah
[ah] small business
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I never say
no no no you you meant [ah] calligraphy is it
[oh] yeah yeah
ya ya ya so <malay>macam</malay> during my free time cause [ah]
<malay>apa ni</malay> I I love doing calligraphy right so I like <malay>macam</malay> I have I have like a mini business where
I (uh) <malay>buat</malay> calligraphy on <malay>orang punya macam</malay> notebooks and stuff then I sell it for like (um) quite a reasonable price [lah] so it's affordable to everyone and I also like playing with colours and
(uh) I like !aiya! basically like (um) doing calligraphy calligraphy so ya that's why I decided to <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>buat</malay> this business because
cause a lot of people [kan] you know singaporeans [kan] <malay>diorang suka macam</malay> study [kan] then <malay>banyak orang suka buat macam</malay> notebook <malay>diorang macam cantik cantik</malay> so yeah that's why I I thought like why not you know just like
decorate their their notebooks and stuff so that <malay>diorang ada macam</malay> motivation to <malay>belajar</malay>
yeah [eh]
[kan] <malay>sekarang</malay> COVID [kan] so like (uh) <malay>kat dalam rumah</malay> what do you do
(mmhmm)
ih
(oo)
!wah! !wah! tell me more
ya ya is good because like you know now COVID like a lot of like businesses are like affected right so I think this online business thing is also <malay>macam</malay> a good way [lah] for <malay>orang</malay> to you know <malay>macam</malay> get that extra cash
then like after after <malay>macam</malay> COVID [kan]
you where's where's the first place <malay>yang</malay> you want to travel
yup
list them all
[oh]
[oh]
ya ya Gold Coast was very fun the beach was very memorable also
and remember <malay>yang kita semua jatuh sakit</malay> after we played at the beach
true
ya
it was actually quite funny because like everyone who swam at the the beach <malay>semua kena apa ni jatuh sakit</malay>
yeah hopefully once like <malay>macam</malay> the border [dah] <malay>buka</malay> then we can go
ya
ya true true
!wah! for me right
after <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation I think the first place I want to travel to is (uh) <malay>mana ni</malay> Japan
yes
I've been there <malay>bila</malay> when I was like I think five years old
I was very young so <malay>macam tak ingat</malay> (uh) I don't really remember a lot of things ya so that's why I wanna <malay>macam</malay> go there again and then <malay>macam</malay> like immerse in the culture and stuff
ya I I mean Japan also <malay>macam</malay> if it's like an interesting country [ah] <malay>macam menarik</malay> you know <malay>pasal</malay>
like because (uh) I told you before I'm an anime lover right so like I want to go there <malay>macam</malay> collect <malay>diorang nya apa ni</malay> figurine because like <malay>banyak orang kata macam</malay>
is <malay>macam</malay> quite cheap [ah] so I was like okay [ah] then I I think if if cause I like to collect
figurine so I was like you know why not just go japan and then like buy more figurines
yeah
!wah! I tell you I'm biggest procrastinator [eh] with the biggest of the biggest procrastinator I I like let's say like
the the work is <malay>macam</malay> due next week [kan] then I would only do it like <malay>macam tiga hari</malay> before the the due date
ya because I don't know sometimes I'm just too <malay>macam penat nak buat buat</malay> the assignment so that's why I keep you know pushing back the assignment ya what about you
[oh]
(mm)
ya (uh) me also like most of the time is always like cause I
always use my I'm on my handphone <malay>asyik tengok</malay> Instagram <malay>semua</malay> then it's like I don't realize like the time has passed and then when it's like already ten o'clock I'm like [oh] [dah] <malay>lambat</malay> [ah] just <malay>tidur</malay> [lah] <malay>besok boleh buat</malay>
the homework ya that's like the biggest problem I face since secondary school
it's it's hard to overcome procrastination
yeah
(uh) it can be done but it's just very hard
<malay>macam</malay> like group projects [eh]
[oh] recently I I <malay>ada macam</malay> this one (err) group project like I just finished <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>dua</malay> weeks <malay>lepas</malay> is <malay>apa</malay> it's called studio project so it's basically like because (uh)
my course is interaction design [kan] so we do we have to like be in a group and then we have to brainstorm (uh) ideas together and then come up with like (uh) a story
so with this story we have to like make it as interesting [lah] because interaction design is all about user experience how to you know
(uh) how to attract users so that they they like like our product and stuff
so my group <malay>kita buat</malay> we did this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> is like a E storybook kind of thing and then we drew our own characters and <malay>macam</malay> the setting all also we we draw ourselves using Photoshop Photoshop is is a very <malay>susah</malay> app
to <malay>pakai</malay> because ya it's only my first year and then is also my <malay>macam</malay> my first time [ah] <malay>pakai</malay> then it's like <malay>susah</malay> [ah] then like all my other friends <malay>macam</malay> they are like quite experienced in it because some of them are from ya
so so for the past two weeks we've been trying to make the story <malay>macam</malay> interesting [ah] so like when users (uh) see the story then they can like
interact with the the book by clicking like <malay>macam</malay> arrows and it will lead them to it will lead them to like the next (uh) page or something so that's like <malay>macam</malay> there's an interaction there
ya that's about it
for you [eh]
(mm)
why kay you tell me
how #rabak#
!wah! I legit also don't like this type of people [leh] like they really make my blood go up [eh] like like they already like I mean when we assign them task already right then after that they don't want to do their own work then after that like we we
have to [ah] take their workload and then after that do their own
work which is like I feel like it's not fair then at the end of the day they they probably will also get the same mark as us and it's like not fair but that's how poly works [lah]
(mm)
[oh]
[oh] I know what you mean
hanoi
that's good ya
ya
[oh]
[oh] that's interesting
[ah] ya ya
(mm)
[oh] that's good that's good
yeah
[oh]
ya
I think I think it's a it's a good app [ah] because in
like this should be you know we should raise
more awareness in our Singaporean society cause like I feel like not many people you know know about these things so it it's a good (um) for me I think your app is very beneficial [lah] for people yeah
(oo) that's good
ya ya ya very interesting [eh]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
yeah I've heard of Fun Run before I actually played that game
!wah!
that's cool
Animal Crossing is a very in game now [eh] a lot of people have been playing it I'm also very curious <malay>macam banyak orang</malay> like <malay>semua main</malay> [ah] then I was I'm also like quite interested to know like what's so you know special about this game
(mm)
!wah!
ya ya ya very interesting
<malay>macam</malay> look forward to [ah]
!wah! that that's quite a handful you got you got <malay>banyak</malay> project to <malay>apa ni buat</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
yeah it's good also because like [kan] year three we <malay>ada</malay> internship right I and I also heard like before you start your internship you have to actually go for an interview for (um) <malay>untuk</malay> like the company before <malay>diorang</malay> accept you in
I I actually I didn't know that like I thought internship like <malay>diorang</malay> we're just like straight away <malay>masukkan</malay> you inside there but I didn't know like you have to <malay>macam</malay> go through an interview so I think <malay>macam</malay> it's quite it's quite beneficial [lah] like <malay>apa diorang</malay>
<malay>ajar</malay> teach <malay>kat dalam</malay> yeah
ya
(mm)
(mm)
ya ya
(mm)
I also had like a similar a similar module I did <malay>apa ni</malay> (uh) previously
where also same it's called (uh) effective effective (err) communication skill so <malay>diorang ajar macam mana</malay>
<malay>nak</malay> you know (err) if (err) communicate effectively and how to like you know gain (uh) confidence
and what are some of the
the like
powerful words I guess you can use during your interview so like to <malay>macam macam</malay> you like sell yourself so
ya I I actually find that module actually quite interesting [ah] but <malay>macam sedih</malay> [ah] because like it was only for a semester I wish it was longer because it really it really helped me [ah] from someone who is actually <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam takut</malay> to like you know stand in like to talk during a presentation to someone I am now who (err) is (uh) confident enough [ah] to present and actually ya it has really helped me in my presentation
[oh] ya
ya
!wah! actually I make friends very instantly [eh] it's like ya because (err) okay the good thing about technology is that (err)
like you you can connect easily with people so like there's this app called Telegram so they had this channel for my school [lah] so anyone who goes to the school they can just join this channel and then after that they will start talking to one another
and <malay>macam</malay> it's like quite cool [lah] because like then you can <malay>macam cari orang</malay> in the same course as you then after that you can make friends from there like for me (err) there's this <malay>macam ada</malay> this (uh) girl that she came up I mean she texted me then she was like [eh] I heard you're in the in the same course
then (uh) she's like (uh) let's be friends [ah] then from there (uh) we started being friends [ah] then (err) when during poly because (err) mostly it was on Zoom right because of <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation <malay>semua</malay> so everything <malay>macam</malay> is online
ya so it's also good like easier to communicate online
ya so (err) ya then (err) in school like when we <malay>macam jumpa</malay>
face to face it was actually not bad ya we we we we acted like we we've known each other for <malay>macam</malay> many years
ya so it was like quite easy [lah] in terms of like making new friends yeah but I think now the only thing <malay>macam susah</malay> is that (uh) is like the modules [ah] because ya I mean like some of the modules it's like I've never <malay>macam</malay> done before
or I have no interest in and then ya like for example coding I've never done <malay>tak pernah buat</malay> coding before so yeah I I get to learn like new things and stuff
ya
you [eh] what about you
ya
ya from secondary school then to poly
!wah! my one don't have [eh] cause COVID then no orientation very damn sad [leh]
I was going to cry you know cause no orientation then you know my school got this like <malay>macam</malay> party for the for the freshman then don't have cause COVID
[oh]
!huh! really [ah]
[oh]
[oh] I see I see
[oh] I think I think flag day is not bad to be honest it's it's just the the weather that is like you know kind of makes everything <malay>macam</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
I I think not bad [leh] the one that there was one time
I also did flag day it was eight hours it was very hot yes it was eight hours because last time (um) my I had I had this (uh) program called like so basically like you have to do like volunteer jobs and then you have to like count in the hours [lah] then you will get the
<malay>macam</malay> the badge <malay>gitu</malay> so yeah so I went for the eight hours shift [one] [ah] so it's not bad [ah] <malay>tapi panas gila</malay>
it was so hot
and the and the worst thing [kan] towards the is <malay>tengah puasa</malay> you know <malay>tengah puasa</malay> then like me and my friend <malay>macam</malay> like [eh] <malay>nak batal ke nak nak batal ke tak nak batal ke tak</malay>
then we then <malay>kita</malay> almost <malay>batal</malay> [lah] my then my friend [dah] <malay>tak boleh</malay> take it [kan] then she was like [ah] <malay>batal</malay> [jer] [lah]
ya
eight hours was (uh) painful [lah] then <malay>kita jalan jalan</malay>
ya we we we we walked around the whole of #Tampines# ya but it was very very rewarding <malay>pasal</malay> (uh) at the end of the day <malay>kita dapat banyak</malay> donation
ya
(mm)
!huh! <malay>biar betul</malay>
right
!wah!
kay [lah] not bad you know at least you all <malay>macam</malay> you know like put money inside [lah] donate also
ya
but if you were to do <malay>macam</malay> flag day again would you do it
really ya it is
[oh] ya ya I've done the morning shift [one] before it's very very tiring
<malay>penat</malay> I couldn't <malay>macam buka my mata</malay>
ya it was during <malay>bulan puasa</malay>
ya
ya cause we had to stay under the sun because like a lot of the <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>tempat yang ada</malay> shade [kan] already [dah] <malay>ada orang</malay> so me and my friend like <malay>macam terpaksa</malay> [ah] <malay>kita stand</malay>
under the hot sun then collect [lor] but that spot was the best cause <malay>banyak orang lalu sana</malay> so ya so we got a lot of donations there then after that we told our other friends then they start coming then after that we were like !alamak! shouldn't have told them
[oh] maybe in the future maybe they have more fun orientation we don't know
ya ya ya
ya ya my school my school my school got night party but too bad [lah] this COVID there [ah] spoil all the plan [eh] then like legit man then [ah] spoil then like I can't even like
like meet my friends right regularly in school have to do Zoom Zoom is also very hard you know it's hard to concentrate but the good thing is like can wake up late
ya true hopefully [lah] I I I really wish <malay>macam</malay> this COVID situation will <malay>macam</malay> die down [ah] because it really affects [ah] <malay>kita punya</malay> life
(mm)
ya thanks for the talk it was was good nice meeting you

okay
[a'ah] so <malay>kita kena bual bual macam untuk satu jam kena cakap</malay> like in both like <malay>melayu dengan</malay> english so <malay>boleh tak</malay>
so
okay maybe <malay>kita nak cakap pasal</malay> like <malay>kita punya</malay> favourite show <malay>boleh tak</malay>
ya I think movie also can so should be okay
[oh] movie <malay>apa</malay>
okay
why it is sad like
wait like <malay>buta</malay> like like how <malay>buta hati atau</malay> like you know
like [ah] okay
[oh]
wait cause the the guy was the cause of like <malay>kenapa dia buta</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh</malay> then after that
[ah]
wait <malay>tapi</malay> the guy know <malay>yang</malay> like like
the guy is <malay>dia apa tu yang punca yang</malay> the girl <malay>punya</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
[ah] [oh]
!wah!
but then how [ah] like
<malay>lelaki tu</malay> !wah!
ya
why so weird
<malay>memang macam</malay> like I don't know like cannot like straightforward you know
ya [lah] but like <malay>macam</malay> it's so coincidental you know like <malay>macam</malay> the girl <malay>dengan</malay> the guy is like
you know always meeting is it like fate but I know that's what korean drama always like
[oh]
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
<malay>kedai</malay> ya
what
but <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense like
ya ya I think <malay>kena tengok</malay> right
but that's really your favourite movie
your <malay>abang</malay> is my <malay>adik</malay>
!wah!
(err)
okay okay actually like
nah I like to watch a lot of show [oh] then [ah] my favourite show is like the big bang theory I don't know whether you heard of it ya netflix but then
I think it's kind of <malay>takde lagi</malay> is it
<malay>pasal dia</malay> ya <malay>dia orang dah</malay> remove then it's the show's about you now like scientist like geeks
and then like they they are very awkward with like <malay>perempuan</malay> you know like the girls and then like [eh] like <malay>macam</malay> like when I watch it I was like [oh] my god that's like so me you know like I like to like you know (uh) <malay>macam baca buku</malay> all that thing and then like won't interact with other people then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like
(um) they suddenly
(um)
how to say like they get they become less awkward over the seasons
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he I think <malay>dia orang ada</malay> like <malay>sepuluh</malay> seasons and then like it's all started off when they were still like young like I think like twenty years old and all that <malay>lepas tu dia orang dah besar sampai</malay> like <malay>dia orang</malay> like <malay>tiga puluh lebih</malay> and until like
all of them I think almost all of them get married
and then it's like I think is it is interesting because like you actually you watch the seasons like you actually like following their life and like you know like you <malay>tengok</malay> like <malay>macam dia orang</malay> like grow to become like a better person
so <malay>macam</malay> damn cool because I also because like <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam banyak orang ingatkan</malay> like <malay>orang yang suka</malay> science <malay>semua ni dia orang semua macam apa tu ganjil</malay> like very awkward right like they feel like they <malay>macam</malay> cannot fit into the society
ya
socially less awkward and also because like <malay>macam</malay> if you realize it's also about our life where like when you are younger you tend to feel like you cannot fit in but you don't need to change for anyone
[kan] like it's like sometimes you just have to like accept the fact that who like who you are
as a person doesn't affect like what people think of you or what people perceive of you
because like I remember one episode [kan] like <malay>macam</malay> young sheldon is like the most awkward there's this guy <malay>nama</malay> sheldon
but he's like super smart like super genius and like when he when he was still young [lah] so the thing is like he's (err) like professor in this like
school like not really a professor [lah] by research scientists and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like (um) <malay>banyak orang ingatkan dia macam tak boleh</malay> fit in
but then over the years <malay>apa dia dia dia cuba</malay> like fit in to like parties <malay>macam</malay> because <malay>ada seorang perempuan</malay> popular <malay>ni</malay> neighbour <malay>dia</malay>
[kan] and then like (um) <malay>dia</malay> like invited them like this clique of like nerds to like the party then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they will they will feeling very awkward because <malay>dia orang dia orang</malay> like <malay>cuba</malay> to interact with like the rest
ya <malay>dia orang semua ingatkan dia</malay> weird <malay>sebab</malay> like <malay>dia datang pun</malay> like <malay>dengan baju tak senonoh</malay>
until the party and cannot fit in [lah] but then <malay>lepas tu</malay> then he realise that [oh] my god
like (um) over the years [kan] they create their own party with their own like so called clique and like all the cool people come in like the movie star like [ah] people who are like basically like
<malay>apa tu daripada dia ni kecil sebab dia ada tengok</malay> show <malay>ni daripada kecil</malay> call doctor something so it's like a show about like doing experiment like science fair then that guy become like movie star or something like that
and that guy actually come to her his party instead
so like he was saying like
but then he realise that like people will love him for him
not because like he have to change for people to love him
ya so it's quite a good show like and that's not the only thing [lah] because like <malay>dia dia dia pun</malay> like was single all the way then <malay>lepas tu dia orang ingatkan takkan</malay> [ah] <malay>kahwin</malay> then ya because a lot of people think he's weird then <malay>tak</malay> he still have friends but then he realise that
he realise that (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> to like
he in the end find out that there's someone that is just like him that he can click with ya so then it is this person is called amy which is like he's she's even awkward
like more awkward than him and then like they met [ah] through like this like you know for us it's like tinder and all that but when they were filming the show no tinder or this is starting it's just currently like quite new so like they put them in the show then it shows that you know you can actually meet anyone from any like anywhere
like you don't have to like meet someone from your group of friends or what like anybody can be suited for you so they work things out like I think for four years they didn't even touch each other
ya because sheldon is weird
like it's very awkward all the way but then they realised that sometimes right in relationship or in life you have to compromise <malay>betul tak</malay> like he cannot like
(um) you know like straightaway
like realise [eh] tomorrow you gonna get married this person
ya so they actually show us <malay>yang macam</malay> love
have to be built upon it like it cannot like
<malay>terus</malay> jump to it
so same as like there's another example where like there's two another couple where they get married
like
without thinking
it compared to like them right so it's like a contrast [kan] <malay>dia orang</malay> carry <malay>macam</malay> opposite of each other
ya so <malay>dia orang</malay> cuddle cuddle <malay>dia macam</malay> like [eh] let's get married today you know
and like and then like there's also another couple there then they always have like intimacy <malay>macam dia orang selalu buat benda tu</malay> then like
then it it just shows that there's different type of people in this world [lor]
so but both relationship works out in the end they are both happy you know so that's a good thing [lah] that's why I love that show because it shows the true
like meaning of life like the true perception of life ya
cool [kan] I feel like it's damn cool ya
ya I know because like all the korean craze japanese craze or the circuit breaker [lah] don't know why
then look at you now look at you now look at me
then ya like all of you are addicted except for me
so weird it's like you start small then it's like big now
ya
why they had never cared
[oh] because you <malay>pakai</malay> like all the <malay>duit</malay> birthday for all this
[oh]
[oh] ya you told me [what]
[oh] ya ya the cafe thing then
[oh] ya ya ya ya ya
I know you said you show me the photos [mah] and then <malay>macam</malay> it's damn nice [what]
[oh]
!wah!
#oma# spoon okay
ya I I know what you mean is the the drawing right
ya it's latte art ya
ya but
no [lah] but waffle [kan] <malay>macam murah takkan</malay> they will charge you [lah]
okay but #haji# lane is overpriced <malay>sebab tu</malay> [lah] you cannot compare
ya seven dollar is is actually <malay>murah</malay> ya but it's at where somerset
farrer park ya but the thing is
that means like <malay>macam kalau</malay> they are not like at the central area of singapore [kan] it's usually cheaper
very circular
ya [lah] that's why it's cheaper [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> if it if it's at town right confirm <malay>mahal</malay>
actually ya
(uh huh)
what no [lah] but <malay>tu untuk buka</malay> like cafe in singapore quite
like tough [what]
so you become like <malay>ibu</malay>
but you know
design the place itself [kan] <malay>macam</malay> they will just you just need to hire a person to do it then after that you just forget about that person you don't need to be part of the cafe
ya but it's not
it's not it's very <malay>mahal</malay> and like ya
it's like <malay>macam</malay> you know like we we it's like our like previous <malay>kedai</malay> [lor]
ya it's like you need to know <malay>makanan apa sedap</malay> and then like sometimes [kan] you hire the chef and the <malay>dia tak tahu masak</malay>
ya
no but actually <malay>makanan tak sedap pun tak apa</malay> [tau] cause like sometimes some people they just go there ya enjoy the aesthetic and like the ambience
ya the ambience of like the whole cafe and like <malay>macam</malay> it's cool [lah] like
you know like your <malay>makanan</malay> K cause your <malay>makanan tak sedap</malay> [kan] at least your coffee <malay>sedap</malay> or like you get like some unique like latte art like what you say
[eh]
ya
maybe you are just like picky
ya ya [lah] you see I love coffee you know like I can drink like coffee <malay>macam tak ada gula</malay>
ya like <malay>takde gula</malay> is like totally fine with me ya
tea without sugar can but coffee [oh] because of the bitterness [kan]
it's just weird
K [lah] okay so okay so we talk about that then okay
actually I want to ask you [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like K this is a weird question because I just see at the prompts (um) if you have like <malay>tiga</malay> like wish that you wanna wanna
you can fulfil [lah] okay which one you think you would would would it be
like like three wish that you can have
the three wishes
ya like okay like <malay>kalau tak ada macam</malay> K if like there's no boundaries because you know like <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay> aladdin all that right it's like you cannot kill anyone you cannot love and you can't make anyone fall for you or you cannot
make you fall for anyone and then I think I forgot to tell you cannot bring people up raise people out from the date
like you can ya resurrection ya so you can't like make them like
bring them back to life so (um) out of these three [kan] like for me I feel like
let's say like we cannot bring back if you can't bring people back to life okay K that one is out so
you can make people fall for you let's you can they can be part of your three wishes though and then the last one is like you cannot be a you cannot be rich right
okay [lah] have ya it ya you can I think think you cannot like like have money ya
#lee kuan yew# no [ah] is it you can be rich I can't remember
okay let's make it like you cannot be because like you know it'll be more interesting because like you wish for for example like [oh] I wish that I have my own restaurant but it's not monetary like [kan] like <malay>duit apa tu apa tu</malay> it's just ya cause if you just say like I have a million dollar [kan] <malay>tak</malay> fun
because everybody everybody wants that ya everyone's and then if you already have one million dollar like maybe like your three wish like that for me actually my three wish I know [what]
what
okay I think that's a bit far [oh]
okay okay so your wish is to pass A level
okay
what
okay then the other two
okay how about you okay you say your first wish first then I say my first wish K because like I feel like you would are looking more at the short term first right then long term
setting my short term wish now right is
to find
something that I like in life
cause like I feel like I'm <malay>macam sangat</malay> lost
ya because like I don't really know what I want
ya
not purpose I already know what's my purpose in life
(mmhmm)
ya
no because like I think is about in singapore right compared to other countries like in singapore you are spoilt for choice
there's too many like <malay>macam</malay> like direction that you can go like because you imagine <malay>kalau</malay> you stay in malaysia then like ya <malay>tak banyak</malay> ya like I think you will only get like
like [kan] <malay>siapa</malay> like most people will go either retail and then like or office world [lah] because in singapore we <malay>kita kita</malay> believe in like equality right
so like everybody can be whatever they want ya
ya I think it's also because I think we are more advanced
compared to like other other countries [lah] our neighbouring countries [lah]
so ya like you know like
I see like in other countries [lah] if you are rich you will have better opportunities like in singapore [ah] no matter what if you are rich or poor ya it's based on your hard work
ya
so that's why I like I like the so for me <malay>macam</malay> like I'm so spoilt for choice like even after working [kan] like I don't know whether that's the thing that I really want
like you know
even though I know it pays well like <malay>gaji besar</malay> but like you know like we we it's tiring and then like it's <malay>penat</malay> and then like you gonna remember you have to going to spend like maybe like thirty years of your life doing the same thing all over again
ya but the thing is like if even if you want to do something more fun [kan]
like sometimes it's not stable because like you want to start your own family or like
ya so like you have to choose you have to either choose like whether you want like flexibility or you want to choose you want money like like I don't think like you can okay [lah] maybe you <malay>kalau</malay> you start your own business you can be have you can have stability like in the future but at the start <malay>macam betul susah</malay>
ya money is very important now
ya
ya it's zero already ya community case [lah]
ya <malay>bukan</malay> like the
ya
like malaysia
ya
I know what you mean
then
hotspot [lah] hotpot is the food
are you thinking about food right now
railway
what no the whole stretch you mean
national railway railway is [eh] you know the train [one]
[oh] my god
ya
I know the whole railway right
ya but okay [lah] (um)
I think like maybe because they are so used you know back in their country that they are not they don't mind congestion
ya cause you know like if you go #jakarta# like I don't know you wait did go #batam# ya you went #batam# before right and you know like <malay>macam</malay> some places are very crowded then you know they don't care [one] ya
no but maybe maybe because like
they do though because that time I went national gallery then <malay>dia orang semua duduk dekat</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang semua</malay> loiter <malay>dekat</malay> you know that there's this like footpaths
ya and then he shouted it's like a way the way to national gallery then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maids are all group like crowding there like there's like more than five people crowding
and then <malay>kena pekik</malay> [sia] they were like !oi! is you new like why
what you doing there !huh! (uh) you never read the sign is it
and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the maid then after that the maid was one of them was stood out and then I was like they talk back to the person then I was like with my friend [lah] then I was like [oh] my god what's this maid doing [ah]
[eh] ya and then okay but I feel like both parties at wrong because the guy don't need to shout
can say nicely right but it could be also like maybe that guy already warn them and then they didn't want to listen then they just stay there so one of them speak up and then the guy was like
I call your employer right now okay I call employer right now then then after that the maid was like [oh] my god
like [ah] like the maid was shocked [lah] when I was in then after that before they even like I don't know I don't know what happen there that's why I don't and before anything else happen
I walk off already because you know me
I don't I don't care
ya I <malay>tak kisah</malay> so I just like walk away and then <malay>lepas tu</malay> they were like I I don't even know what happened next but I just saw the last part was that the maid was keeping quiet
ya because it's okay [lah] but I know what you mean like I don't mean
but maybe but we don't know the story you know
ya
so okay your second wish
or no more wish she already have whatever you want in your life right now
that's not a wish you can
that's a dream
because okay there's a difference between a wish and a dream for me because a wish is something that you think is like impossible but there's still a chance that
it can be achieved through hard work
but you wish it because it's the easier way it's the easy way out
ya but a goal or like a dream is something that you can achieve
<malay>tapi</malay> like
(um) you need to
like you can achieve now [lah] I think I'm sure you can achieve
to travel around the world what it's like it's not that difficult of a dream
ya cause like in singapore so easy [lah] to just travel
you've been to like what so many places already
ya a few already like at your age you know how most people right they like thirty plus or forty plus when they can travel
ya
you are just lucky cause like in singapore <malay>macam</malay> even when you are younger like they will bring you to overseas already like you have a chance to go like china ya school trips or that school overseas trip
!huh!
primary school
ya but mine is only malaysia
ya mine is secondary school is china
and (uh) cambodia and
I forget one more wait china cambodia [ah] and malaysia also port dickson
ya
cause ya
ya [lah] but I think they they will have more opportunities when they go poly cause poly you actually can travel a lot it's just whether you have the money
you can use the account I think
ya ya your edusave account
post secondary [ah]
ya so you use
so it's not the school is that account
ya so we all ya I think singapore <malay>bagi kita</malay> like money to like spend for all these trips [sia] so I think it's like I think that's a good thing [eh]
ya
so can use that
(err) if it there's one country my wish list [lah]
I've already went to that country though
I actually wanted to like when I was younger since young [lah] I always wanted to go japan
cause like when I was younger you know like I don't know I like to watch like #naruto# like you know like
you know they started to have those like anime cris because last time don't have this kind of thing [lah] last time you just spongebob fairy odd parents
ya then slowly #naruto# come in ya [ah] pokemon all this you know and then I was like
[oh] my god
I always wanted to go japan like I see the temple see the ninja and then I was like
!wah!
I'm like it's so nice then you know I got a chance to go
japan for like four months
<malay>dia</malay> sounds like internship [kan] then I was like !wah!
I'm like so lucky cause like that one I think I I spend like two weeks travelling around japan I don't know whether I got tell you
ya so I went like #osaka# #kyoto# #tokyo#
and I when #nara# I went like #kanazawa# then I
ya I went like so many places and like you know every part of japan
no [lah] I went with my friend but I went (um) I think I went #hiroshima# alone
ya
K I don't think you know but it is like mountains and all that then ya and then
it's famous I think it's famous for their ice cream
ya
no it depends because during that time I went was autumn slash winter [eh] wait
is it autumn slash winter ya autumn slash winter so it was only snowing like the last few days but then when you go to the mountain site it's already snowing
ya cause it's it's near the mountain ya the terrain and all that
and then remember like turkey we went it wasn't snowing below but it was snowing upstairs ya it's the same thing [lor]
so like and then like certain place is like quite warm ya
like you know like #tokyo# and #osaka# they rarely snow I think
#tokyo# ya #tokyo# rarely snow
it's just cool ya but the cold is I thought it wasn't it was bearable because usually go this kind of places like K I been to korea right ya what do you mean really
the competition
entrepreneurship competition
[oh] you didn't know I went korea [oh] my god
I showed you ya
[oh] my god you didn't know I went korea
for the competition the
ya
you know do you realize like all the mug that I bought is only [ah] it's like for for all the countries that I've been except for when I was younger
so like china cambodia what do I have [ah] thailand
twenty sixteen
how can you not know
no [lah] I went for like five days only
there
I went to this
#wei# you didn't know I went korea
ya
there are friends I made
ya <malay>macam</malay> like people from korea guam that's why
they know how to speak english
you know all it's the entrepreneur leadership competition they can't speak english they can't join the competition [mah]
ya
no [lah] (um) I think K because
<malay>macam</malay> like <malay>banyak orang</malay> that like
most of them [lah] actually they are all like
english international speaker
so like I mean they are from international school basically so (uh) it's their first language [lah] english is their first language
ya like they use that okay it's not really first language but it's like so called
their communication language their first communication language so they have to speak in english no matter what
ya but korea was fun so I went to
(um) you know the #seoul# tower
I went to wait that lotte world
ya it's damn nice ya #wei# you didn't know I went all these !wah! it's damn nice it's like and you know what everything is paid for
ya
I don't need to pay a single cent
ya
but it's a competition also [lah] that means I have to present
I won third place
I was in the newspaper [what]
ya that is from korea
then microsoft ya then ya for in #temasek# my microsoft
korea bought my bags [mah]
ya that is korea then japan is internship then germany is cause of the competition also
no it's not school
ya and they they wanted to sell the bag but I I stepped out of it cause I don't have the time
than I want to focus on my career and studies rather than doing business cause like even though I think like business <malay>macam</malay> it's easy to
okay [lah] it's not easy it's like is feasible but some you can I can do it but like <malay>macam</malay> I don't feel like I want to pursue it cause I want something to like fall back on like a safety net
ya
[oh] you so you don't know I went korea so sad
ya there's so many places I've been do you know that
ya
korea is fun
really I went there during winter
!huh!
you should go with <malay>afal adik</malay>
I feel like going with your friend [kan]
and going with your family members is different
like going with your friend you have to compromise a lot like you may be good friends
like if like ya during the trip ya you can really see their true colour because like there's how they are at home
like I have a friend that I'm very close with then I went
I I wait
I went #batam# with him like my best friend then I think you know right I remember got one time ya ya so
then then that's why now we are not best friend anymore
ya because of that trip
cause I thought he was okay and all that but then I realise that I go with him right I realize how spoilt he is
like [oh] no I cannot eat it's [oh] no like this place is
like just you know like our family so used to like eating like those kind of like you know <malay>macam tempat</malay>
<malay>tak bersih sangat</malay> [lah] also it's okay ya ya they don't care [one]

hotel supposed to smell that way you know
and then we went massage right ya like yes then he was like why is the machine like so weak
I'm like
if you are not paying for that full package you know you are paying like twenty dollars for that you know
no I guess not I think
[oh] ya
ya
no but he was okay with like the rock you know the they have the hot stones for that he was okay I think the leg scrub all okay I think he wasn't okay with the body massage [lah]
ya cause I think it's different
ya but he's expecting like a five star you know like like treatment for like a one star payment (err) one star price then I was like
!alamak! why you like that
and then (um)
then then I was like
ya then okay

like what
[oh] you <malay>nenek</malay> say that

I like beef boat noodles
[oh] ya we've been to thailand also

ya
I also never tried before
no but you have to know that they are old
you know like they don't
like cheese I don't understand yes <malay>ibu</malay> also don't like but <malay>ibu</malay> okay with it you know why
cause she likes spicy then K fry also spicy

#mukshidonna#
[oh] ya I I have [leh]

nonsense [lah]
okay so
ya
K K K
then last okay okay it's like [oh] my god it's almost like one hour [eh] K maybe okay we ask one last question K one last question time to sleep
ya
but okay okay let's let me think of a good question to ask (mm)
if you were born rich okay if you were born rich singapore
then okay what question you wanna ask do you have any question you wanna ask
ya
what that's so random
no [ah] we're talking [what]
you know what but it you cannot do like it's in singlish ya that's why then confirm fail [what] if you do this kind ya
so it's different ya
so okay okay come on come on the last feedback ya
anything
ya I know
I know
ya
interesting [lah]
like ya
but I think podcast by itself is really interesting cause you just listen to people talking ya they just talking to each other [kan]
ya
ya but I feel like this can be a podcast also like what you said right
like <malay>selamat datang ke</malay> podcast <malay>saya</malay>
ya but I don't think <malay>macam</malay> like podcast [kan] <malay>ada</malay>
they will either speak in either english straight or like malay straight like there's no like in between [kan] ya
(mmhmm)
ya I saw my friend is in a drama
ya
people don't watch them anymore that's why they want to stay relevant but now it's very easy to be a #suria# actor now compared to last time like last time you must be born like with your family of actors ya but now is like
cast needed like everywhere they are looking for casts I think
ya
life
(mmhmm)
so many things like we thought was relevant then it's no longer relevant now
no [lah] like last time you know radio you know newspaper was popular then you know everybody use ya E news no one like subscribe the last time you need to subscribe every month ya it's like damn morning thing
ya but then after that radio become popular then now radio not really no but they they still are relevant because people drive listen to radio ya but then the problem is that podcast is taking over radio cause we fly it's like that's why <malay>bapa</malay> all listening to podcast now
ya
ya I didn't expect
him
except for me
I never use
ya
the only time I actually use that day was to watch

I think so ya <malay>dia dekat dengan</malay> #sungei buloh# all the way [sia] I check on Google
actually I solve that problem already like yesterday (um) I went to research more [lah] like the the reviews of this place so I saw on tripadvisor that they spend like three hundred and eighty five dollars for one villa for one night it was very expensive and they said the place is so rundown <malay>abeh macam tak ada makanan</malay> and stuff like that [ah]
then there was another review I showed mama that this family had to spend like close to six hundred dollars because there was no food there so they have to go out and buy the barbecue <malay>nya barang</malay> barbecue over there so ya the review was like all one star one star one star those were pretty recent like ya yesterday it was seventeen eighteen november [kan] the review was on sixteen november just two days before
I told her fairmont is cheaper fairmont is only three hundred dollars per night then might as well go there then you have a halal food there also

then mama <malay>tengah kat</malay> living room I open the door mama straight away jump up and then she started screaming like <malay>adik adik</malay> then the <malay>bibik kasihan</malay> [tau] the <malay>bibik</malay> was like <malay>saya bukan hantu saya bukan hantu saya betul-betul benar-benar mahu jual keropok gitu</malay>
then I was like I !alamak! <malay>mak aku tak baik</malay> [seh] <malay>dia terus</malay> panic <malay>gabrah depan depan bibik tu</malay> but I ended up buying a few <malay>keropok</malay> [lah] cause <malay>kasihan</malay>

<malay>sana tak ada macam</malay> like a singaporean community like that where you can find malay food
okay question what are your thoughts about the #changi# <malay>punya</malay> restaurant a three eighty thing where you pay money to eat the first class food in the airplane
mama wants to go for that actually
when the news came out she ask me <malay>adik</malay> do you want to go and eat at the airport the aeroplane there the first class mama <malay>nak</malay> try <malay>makan</malay> first class <malay>tak pernah duduk</malay> !alah! <malay>tak boleh</malay> fly [kan] <malay>duduk kat dalam</malay> aeroplane <malay>dapat makan pun jadi</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> so I told mama for the price that you pay [ah] I would rather save up the money and actually fly first class to somewhere than just sit there and eat
it was a couple of hundred
ya not worthy
ya and it's like when I look at the I watch videos of people who paid for it and go for it's like if you eat halal food you really waste your money because you are not gonna drink all the what dom perignon and all that
never let old people spend too much time on facebook and this is what happen
I remember like I I did say that out (um) mama did say that she want me to <malay>macam</malay> take them go <malay>jalan-jalan lain kali</malay> #daya# <malay>bawa pula</malay> [lah] because like the last time she went japan <malay>macam korang bawa dia</malay> [kan] so she said to me <malay>lain kali</malay> #daya# <malay>bawa</malay> [lah] <malay>kita jalan-jalan</malay> so I told mama
<malay>cara</malay> I <malay>jalan-jalan</malay> later you all don't like one good thing is I very relax so some days you can don't go out if you are tired but another good thing is I like to backpack and all these things stay in dorm you all must hotel then how ya
I was thinking of that too you know because dorm can cook [mah] mama can cook
but <malay>penat</malay> [seh] <malay>masa tu kita pergi</malay> japan <malay>banyak jalan</malay> so I don't think they would want to cook also I also don't want to cook the japan food very nice
but she eat #ramen# all that
<malay>sedap</malay> but the <malay>sedap</malay> is what the cook is malaysian cook [ah] or japanese cook
cause the food nice mama is one of the few people I know who likes aeroplane food
no for me personally I the only airplane food that is nice is like the qatar flight that's it the rest
we had a question what is what was the most memorable meal you've had and where did you have it sad to say it was on the qatar flight I agree
I never try <malay>nasi lemak</malay> on airplane before
really okay I should try
[oh] K K K ya
things to note <malay>nak kena</malay> try <malay>nasi lemak kat</malay> silk air important question <malay>nak</malay> fly <malay>tu bila tu</malay> !aiya! I hope they can find a cure for this COVID [seh]
sure can [lah] you know why not
<malay>betul punya</malay> travel bubble [eh] from one island to another island
that's a good idea write in [lah] write in to #lee hsien loong# [ah]
they got power [mah] he can phone call to the maldives government [what]
ya it's not mine also
(mm) okay
is it kenya
safari kenya tanzania [lah]
I think it's tanzania because of #serengeti# national park so that's tanzania but also can [what] because you just travel south kenya on top tanzania below [mah] I think I can take qatar then I will fly to qatar and then go down
there got flight
good [lah] I don't have qatar membership
leverage on your brother
he still very lucky [eh] he still like employed like
only flights to europe still ongoing that's what that's what I heard [lah] for for middle east to europe still ongoing like ya but reduce flights [ah] number of flights
[oh] ya [a'ah] <malay>orang semua nak balik negeri</malay>
<malay>dah</malay> relax <malay>dah</malay> [kan]
they're very smart
[oh] <malay>dah</malay> thirty minutes already
talking about our own life [eh]
[a'ah] still a lot of things <malay>juga</malay>
what's the name
#darwin# interiors
cheap
[eh] that's not bad
what what size resale
four room three room
[eh] not bad twenty six K
[eh] then they hack it out then outside is what <malay>kosong</malay> [jer] [oh]
<malay>aku yang tak ada rumah aku dah bilang pasal rumah aku</malay>
five more years but like a lot of things need to be done I realise [ah] like like you need to think about okay when you want to get your loan blah blah blah cause for me I don't think I want to buy a resale [lah] I want to get a because I like the flats but then the thing is I cannot get those I have to like find sale of balance
ya then I have to think about K sale of balance cause sale of balance usually <malay>macam</malay> reject reject <malay>punya kalau orang tak suka</malay> the areas [ah] the units [ah]
the units [ah] units
[ah] <malay>atas tong sampah gitu</malay> [ah] <malay>ada orang tak suka tempat tong sampah atau rumah punya</malay> fengshui <malay>tak bagus ke</malay> yang at least the good thing is <malay>tak ada momok</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> resale [kan]
<malay>yang tengah yang tengah</malay> have [lah] <malay>tengah</malay> have
ya actually ya I would so I was thinking of that also <malay>macam</malay> cause I saw like
on property property ninety nine I think ninety nine dot com the app <malay>tu</malay> [kan] so people who live in like edgefield plains <malay>kat kawasan</malay> #sengkang# they are pretty new and they were selling the house although house is quite cheap the house is actually still in good condition ya [ah] <malay>macam kau masuk terus dah siap</malay>
[oh] for sure
I want like <malay>macam</malay> cement floor <malay>macam gini</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> cement floor
yours is yours is porcelain tile [ah]
it look like <malay>macam</malay> cement <malay>gitu</malay> like concrete <malay>gitu</malay>
so I was thinking of something like this [lah] <malay>macam yang penting</malay> colour grey <malay>bawah tu</malay> look a bit like cement
<malay>korang ada</malay> skirting <malay>tak kita letak</malay> skirting <malay>juga</malay> [lah]
[oh]
because I was thinking that <malay>kalau</malay> if I move out to my own place I think I need to bring pluto along with me I told about mama papa I don't want to live alone so I confirm <malay>nanti bawa</malay> pluto <malay>sekali</malay> [lah] so I also think about [oh] if you want to have a house <malay>nanti</malay> pluto need her own cat tree [lah] you need to #catify# the house <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
so that's why I'm like thinking about what I want to do to the house and how much I must save there are people who spend like eighty thousand dollars on renovation <malay>abeh rumah dia macam</malay> minimalist <malay>gitu</malay> and it's eighty thousand dollars
cause I I don't want to like <malay>macam</malay> have a lot of build in I was thinking of just by IKEA furniture
<malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>si kecil tu dekat rumah cekau-cekau</malay> [jer] now the <malay>kayu-kayu semua nak terkopek</malay> so that's why I'm thinking like that [ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>beli mahal-mahal beli macam murah kayu</malay> simple simple then IKEA [kan] <malay>macam batau</malay> furniture then after five years can throw already
they <malay>katuk</malay> very fast [eh]
a lot of <malay>macam</malay> renovation company <malay>mcam dorang katuk</malay> very fast
[oh] and she bought it when

the good thing is that's why I thinking you buy cheap right so is like the thing about appliances nowadays they five years then okay must throw already or new technology already so I think buy cheap ya buy cheap or like you you have to do your homework [ah]

<malay>tak dengar bunyi budak-budak</malay>
[oh] <malay>dorang</malay> alternate [kan]
try teaching [ah] <malay>macam mana nak</malay> teaching I like teaching I don't like you heard that I like teaching I don't like
but that's the fun part
teaching don't get holidays [meh]
[oh] okay okay okay <malay>faham faham</malay>
(mm) true [lah] then you don't have to contend with parents in whatsapp chat groups
that's why I really <malay>macam tabik</malay> [ah] those people who go teaching cause you you don't even have time to teach you spend more time on <malay>benda-benda remeh-remeh semua layankan</malay> parent <malay>layankan</malay> principal
kindergarten no I got no patience with <malay>yang kecil-kecil yang masih berak dalam seluar</malay>
<malay>yang kat luar tu semua habis</malay> [ah] <malay>pecah-pecah</malay>
[eh] <malay>bijak</malay> [eh] <malay>dia bijak</malay>
[oh] okay
that's cool
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau anak saudara sendiri</malay> okay <malay>tapi kalau jaga anak orang lain</malay> like in a school setting is different the kids have different values they come from different backgrounds <malay>kalau anak saudara</malay> at least the values are still similar you know <malay>kalau budak tu ada</malay> problem can always easy for you to speak to the parents
last resort
actually I do like teaching [ah] I mean I was giving tuition for like what almost a decade already then I realise that I do enjoy it [lah] I I enjoyed teaching when I was like at the science centre
different [lah] from a classroom environment [kan]
each project different different thing
that's a sad thing [lah] you still have to teach like the same content
<malay>dah hafal</malay> script [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
for me tuition was different okay like <malay>macam</malay> I know that the syllabus are <malay>ajar macam gini</malay> [kan] but with each kid they are at different at how should I say different <malay>macam</malay> not say education level like <malay>macam tahap kefahaman dorang</malay> is different so <malay>macam</malay> maybe in class the teacher already <malay>dah</malay> start on algebra but the kids <malay>punya</malay> foundation is still very weak so although <malay>dorang dah</malay> sec one and they are already doing algebra their understanding of maths is still <malay>macam</malay> at primary four primary five ya so
is a bit interesting [lah] for me like every single student is like a project different materials different way of teaching [ah] <malay>ada budak macam</malay> they really need [ah] physical experiment to really understand mathematical concept I mean as adults right when we look at maths we think <malay>macam</malay> is very straightforward one plus one equals to two but to a kid who has no understanding of what is maths at all [kan]
they will be like <malay>apa tu</malay> one <malay>kenapa</malay> one <malay>kenapa</malay> one plus one <malay>kenapa tak boleh</malay> one and that kind of thing
it's not stressful [leh] it's it's fun
actually it's not that hard I realise okay [lah] because for me (um) I teach budget tuition and I teach <malay>orang kita orang kita mak-mak dorang macam</malay> more or less <malay>macam</malay> [ah] relax [jer] <malay>kau datang</malay> class [kan] <malay>dia kasi epok-epok</malay> [lah] <malay>dia sibuk kasi kau makan dulu</malay> for them is I just want you to sit next to my kid and make sure my kid does his work
<malay>tu dorang punya</malay> (um) general generally [lah] most of them <malay>dorang punya</malay> mindset is like that there are a few <malay>macam</malay> one or two who come and they say like [oh] I want my kids to get A <malay>padahal</malay> the kid is already a B student so for me <malay>macam</malay> when I come in actually there's not so much work on my part it's just that I want the kid to be interested in learning once the kid <malay>dah</malay> interested in learning automatic <malay>terus dorang</malay> A <malay>sendiri</malay> so <malay>jadi tak</malay> stress <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> stress is when you haven't start the parent <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>kepoh kepoh</malay> [lah] like you can you go through this for my kid can you look can you go through that for my kid [ah] <malay>macam gitu tu leceh sikit</malay>
<malay>ajar budak-budak madrasah</malay> [ah] <malay>madrasah</malay> kids were very very nice
but I feel so sad for them because when they share with me the school <malay>punya</malay> how the school life is right then I realise the quality of education is very different ya I had one like this student everytime I read it so one year is one older than the other take three the other one take two
so he was sharing that their maths teacher is the same teacher I think science teacher was the same teacher the teacher is like some <malay>makcik</malay> like very old lady who in the class will just sit down and talk talk talk talk talk talk so they don't understand what's going on in the lesson
I because <malay>madrasah</malay> under private school [kan]
but the kids are amazing nineteen subjects [eh] for O levels one nine
okay [what] <malay>al al-irsyad</malay> [ah] [eh] but <malay>al-irsyad susah nak masuk</malay> [eh]
<malay>sekolah tahfiz</malay> [ah]
[eh] but it's good you know because like I see like a lot of people who graduate from <malay>madrasah</malay> like [oh] my god they have like masters and double masters because nineteen subject for O levels is nothing you know they are doing two masters at university level is nothing is a longer route for them but even at thirty years old they're still doing like all these ya this is like nothing for them
[a'ah] [seh]
okay [mah] <malay>tak salah</malay> [pe] but I notice this trend [tau] <malay>macam</malay> my friends who are in education or their wife who are in education !wah! they really start planning the education route early on baby <malay>masih dalam perut dah</malay> planning [tau] <malay>nak hantar</malay> childcare <malay>ni lepas umur ni pergi</malay> this school <malay>nanti pastu hantar ni</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> we all <malay>orang biasa</malay> relax [ah] <malay>pergi sekolah</malay> good enough already [ah]
ya
like if I have kids it's just gonna be like just relax I will be like the general singaporean like your cert [ah] doesn't necessarily mean that you going to get a job that's very good I will be that kind of parent focus on the other things [ah]

and after that I finally <malay>masuk</malay> then I was like okay
ya I was thinking like I'll I'll I saved up enough money
already like I think <malay>tiga tahun</malay> in I saved up enough money then I was like [ah] I I cannot [lah] later I go later they throw me into like mono intake infantry or something cause I got tattoo so I wait first
then <malay>masuk</malay> then I like cannot do [ah] later must take

<malay>nanti kat atas</malay> it's a dragon <malay>tapi</malay> usually <malay>dia orang tak ada duit nak habiskan</malay> the dragon so it's just a koi fish at the forearm
seriously I
I kena like <malay>tiga orang</malay> who have the exact same tattoo and they stop at the exact same spot

because when you do like that kind of like hand
hand gun one right I'm sure it's gonna hurt a lot more than when you use a gun
cause the gun is going in and out it's very fast so you <malay>tak rasa sangat</malay>
or like you <malay>rasa</malay> for a shorter amount of time cause it's <malay>masuk keluar masuk keluar</malay>
well with the hand [one] it's like the person <malay>cucuk</malay> one by one slowly I'm sure it's gonna hurt more
I mean as compared to a
machine gun like a machine electronic machine
I'm sure it's not that fast [lah]

<malay>baik hati</malay> [ah]
<malay>merepek</malay> [sia]
what time you <malay>balik</malay>
<malay>apa</malay>
[ah]
ya okay [lah] that's not too bad that time my last reservist cycle fell like <malay>turun</malay>
hand over shift
<malay>tujuh setengah</malay> [kan]
and then after that I I didn't turn out for call I <malay>malas</malay> so I <malay>tidur</malay> I <malay>tidur</malay> in like the they have like a mass hall but <malay>atas</malay> [ah] on the second floor then the office on the first floor
so every all the everybody else <malay>tidur</malay> on the first floor and then I <malay>tidur</malay> on the second floor
<malay>habis naik atas</malay> like <malay>pukul satu pagi</malay> then I was like [eh] ma'am I I go sleep first [ah] then she like [oh] K K I see you upstairs
<malay>habis tidur</malay>
<malay>bangun pukul sembilan pagi</malay> [sia]

<malay>habis dia nya</malay>
night shift <malay>nya semua</malay> paramedics [dah] <malay>balik</malay> then I was like [eh] <malay>encik macam mana</malay> [sia] then he's like [ah] never mind I sign for you I sign for you
reservist
<malay>takkan nak begitu</malay> [sia] [lah]
<malay>balik</malay> on the dot [sia]
actually not really [lah] I used to stick around a lot also
ya
okay I'll
(mm)
(mm)
night shift I wasn't like that [ah] because yours is twenty four hour shift so you always finish in the morning [kan]
for me if I night shift then I finished in the morning [kan]
<malay>dulu</malay>
[orh] me and my friends <malay>selalu keluar</malay> eat breakfast [lah] so we leave we leave late but it's because we wait for the rest of the medics <malay>balik</malay> station [ah]
ya
last time my rota quite bonded [ah]
one time we <malay>naik basikal</malay>
and then after that my friend like we all cycled halfway already <malay>pergi entah mana nak makan</malay> [lah] or something then my friend <malay>kata</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>aku tertinggal aku ni barang</malay> [ah]
then after that we cycled back and then we <malay>masuk</malay> the station like bicyle then we parked the bicycle outside the paramedic office beside the pumper <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>habis dia orang keluar</malay> then after that the #suay suay# the is like !oi! bicycle <malay>siapa ni</malay> then I was like <malay>encik encik bukan saya punya</malay> bicycle
[ah] that's like fucking eight bicycle [sia]
eight bicycles like parked beside the <malay>siapa tak bingit</malay> [sia]
<malay>nasib baik dia orang tak kena</malay>
(mm)
[oh] ya how was it cardiac arrest right
[ah]
cannot [sia]
(mm)
[dah] expect [ah]
(mm)
fuck
ya that's quite rare
I think for the most part my my cardiac arrest
think like only like
twenty percent a quarter of them [ah] <malay>dapat</malay> shock
[ah]
(mm) depends [ah] depends on how far the hospital is depends how fast we reach
ya
<malay>kadang kadang</malay>
no most of the time if <malay>dapat</malay> shock it's usually on scene and then it continue in the ambulance
[oh]
so the pulse [dah] <malay>balik</malay> [ah]
like
when when was the last time they saw him
when was the last time he was seen like healthy
like when was that
no no when was the last time the patient like <malay>dia orang sampai dia</malay> [dah] [dah] gone [kan] so like how long before that did they last see him
[orh] like <malay>depan mata</malay> [ah]
[oh]
why [sia]
ya ya ya
<malay>kadang</malay> [eh] the
when I went back reservist the medic told me <malay>sekarang</malay> they make it compulsory [sia]
all medics
<malay>kena</malay> like you you have to have the my responder app
my time it was like optional
then after that <malay>sekarang dia orang</malay> enforce like you have to download
then after that if you <malay>dapat</malay> the notification <malay>kena pergi</malay> [ah] I mean if you <malay>tak nampak</malay> then #bo pian# [lah] but
they expect you to go
(mm)
[ah]
that's cool
<malay>apa dia orang dapat</malay>
<malay>apa lagi</malay> case (err) the community responder was
the this captain from
(err) division #yishun#
<malay>habis</malay> the this the this captain the the <malay>dia dulu macam</malay> medical officer
so he cover my station sometimes when the paramedics on leave or what
<malay>habis</malay> my my <malay>kawan nampak dia tengah belakang</malay> was like <malay>belakang selalu macam lepak lepak</malay> [ah]
then after that <malay>dia nampak</malay> the captain <malay>dia terus</malay> [eh] [sia] [lah]
my the the responder is captain [ah] then after that he told us <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> take charge of the scenes <malay>semua</malay> then I was like [eh] [sia] [lah] <malay>uar uar</malay> [sia] <malay>aku</malay> give <malay>kau</malay> lesson <malay>engkau buat bodoh</malay> [jer] <malay>macam tu</malay>
so ya
[oh] ya my last
you know my (err) last duty
one of my last few duties [ah] like my (err) the most recent cycle I also got a cardiac arrest and then after that the like we managed to resuscitate [sia] resuscitate the patient <malay>dapat</malay> we gave like I think three or four shocks
[eh] no three shocks then the pulse came back
yeah
ya
that one also quite surprising so
but the <malay>nyonya</malay> was quite <malay>tua</malay> already
then they but the I think it's because
the <malay>dia orang</malay> [dah] <malay>tolong</malay> this <malay>nyonya</malay> out of the toilet then she <malay>terus</malay> collapse so like right from the <malay>mata</malay> [ah] then they immediately call
[eh] usually cardiac arrest <malay>kalau pagi pagi</malay> [kan] it's usually a <malay>macam orang baru bangun baru bangun</malay> then they <malay>jumpa</malay> the body then it's like [dah] <malay>beberap jam</malay> [ah] so that one
like the body without oxygen like after three or four minutes it's like permanently brain dead like let alone like how many hours right so that's why most of the time when you <malay>dapat</malay> cardiac arrest
<malay>tak boleh</malay> save [ah]
ya it's like
pretty much [lah] but most of the time we still try [ah] just to
at least
put in effort
ya
but usually it's very rare [ah] unless like the patient collapse in front of
like
like patient collapse then they straight away call
and start doing [lah]
and <malay>kena buat</malay> <malay>betul betul</malay> [lah] that time <malay>apa lagi</malay>
(err) my last duty in like my last duty ever <malay>kena dapat</malay> call the this #ah pek# he cardiac arrest at a foodcourt
and then after that we <malay>sampai</malay> and then we saw the doctor there was a there was a clinic in front of the food court [ah]
and then after that like a the the passerby called the doctor then the doctor <malay>datang</malay> so when we reached the doctor was doing then the doctor <malay>buat</malay> you know like got a there's a pace [one] when you do it's like one and two and three there's there's like a certain pace you have to follow
to do that kind
ya
then doctor <malay>buat macam macam</malay> jackhammer [sia] don't know [what]
<malay>macam begitu</malay> then after that <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>pukimak ini apa</malay> [sia] <malay>ini</malay> rabbit [pe] and then after that my paramedic my paramedic <malay>tengah jalan</malay>
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> he he stopped walking then he turned he turned around he looked at me then he was like
[sia] [lah] <malay>dia buat apa</malay> [sia] then I was like <malay>betul</malay> in public K <malay>buat betul betul</malay>
the doctor the doctor <malay>buat</malay> <malay>sembarang</malay> then we after that we all like what the fuck [sia] the doctor you know
then he was like like
that's why like <malay>tak tahu malu ke</malay> like
you fucking terrible at until like an has to take over you
and like the that take over wasn't even me it was like I had to ask my junior to do cause I to set up the other equipment
ya so I asked my junior about the physical
why okay [what] actually last time medic
like if you turn out for a cardiac arrest then you get like got two medics in the crew [kan] you will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
cause if you do C
everybody wants to do
cause you do is like brainless you just equal the rhythm you keep up the right pressure okay already
[ah]
you if you not doing means you have to set up all the equipment so you <malay>kena letak</malay> the [lah] the set up the set <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> the adrenaline <malay>kasi</malay> the normal saline then like all the small small stuff and then after that if you <malay>buat salah</malay> you <malay>kelam kabut</malay> you don't give it to the paramedic on time <malay>kena maki</malay>
so like everybody will <malay>gaduh</malay> over who gets to do
except for me I I don't like doing so I <malay>penat</malay>
ya
(err) they started right after I
I know my <malay>encik</malay> was the one who came up with the vehicles [sia] there like that was his project
as in
ya that's true
I think ya <malay>tak salah</malay> I heard they got the thing for <malay>macam orang</malay> morbidly obese
like like there's there's stretcher they put inside is so they can convey those kind of patients also
ya
ya
cause the normal the normal alpha <malay>sekarang</malay> is fucking <malay>kecil</malay> [sia] like the old one like the box alpha you you remember right I think your time got the box alpha right
(mm) the ugly one but got a lot of space so that one like you put inside a fucking obese person also <malay>boleh</malay>
<malay>boleh muat</malay>
the new alpha is freaking <malay>sempit</malay> [sia] like a normal sized patient already like a slightly heavy normal size patient is already quite <malay>sempit</malay> already
so I think like the
plus the <malay>dengan</malay> the stretcher [kan]
like you don't need to <malay>angkat</malay> the stretcher like you just <malay>picik</malay> the thing then it's like mechanical then the the legs go up by themselves <malay>bodoh tak nak taruh</malay> in ambulance when we actually convey patients <malay>ke mana yang sedia</malay>
<malay>rabak</malay> [sia]
wait the the guy also a medic [ah] <malay>tu</malay>
[orh] firefighter
[orh] then turn out for
[orh]
ya
actually [ah] the my last cardiac arrest case like <malay>bila balik</malay> reservist <malay>ni</malay> we also turn out with and then after that I <malay>nampak</malay> [kan]
so far <malay>dia orang asyik suruh</malay> the boy <malay>yang buat</malay> then after that <malay>yang lain semua diri kat keluar kesian</malay> [sia]
the firefighting [ah]
so like the so when comes the the ambulance crew like <malay>tak</malay>
like <malay>lepas tangan</malay> so we do all the other stuff like the medical the medical equipment [ah] like we put in the <malay>apa</malay> tubing <malay>semua</malay>
and then after that so like free up free our hands [lah] so the crew <malay>yang buat</malay>
and then after that like I <malay>tak pernah nampak</malay> anyone wearing orange bunker gear <malay>buat</malay> so far is <malay>selalu</malay> the firefighter
like the the green the green one
[ah] [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah]
T shirt [sia]
what you all turn out <malay>pakai</malay> bunker gear [pe]
[ah] [ah] ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya ya ya
ya that's what I saw also [ah] when I turn out with them
but fun right
<malay>tak</malay> stress [ah]
(mm)
[eh] wait so were you were you the covering sec com
[oh] then <malay>nasib baik</malay> [sia] <malay>nasib baik ada</malay> the fire fight
[orh] so even then like if even if you turn out the will take charge [lah]
[ah] so so if anything like the will take charge of the call [lah]
what
[ah] ya
<malay>sekarang</malay> it's that's damn short [sia] so <malay>dulu dulu</malay> during my time [kan] the attachment was like two <malay>dua tiga tahun begitu</malay>
[oh] then
[ah] I see I see
ya
[orh] they want to put people into the
[ah]
[eh] but actually now also turn out for
also turn out for cardiac arrest right
ya got some some new thing called
high high intensity or something like that
I don't know what the hell it is [ah] high intensity
ya let me google [ah] high intensity
high performance high performance
so it's like a
it's like a new protocol
so it's like
eight eight people do
ya so it's it says here
eight member crew recalled an incident when they had to do high performance to resuscitate a patient
so like basically the whole and then <malay>semua turun</malay> then after that they take turns doing I don't know what the the the protocol is [ah] like I'm sure there's like some
like procedure like
like a flow to it
to make it more like
<malay>apa</malay>

!wah! then how the hell you survive your [sia]
weren't you in the sun every day in bunker gear
[oh]

so what netflix shows are you currently watching now
[oh] have you watched orphan black
it's actually a canadian dramatic conspiracy thriller and science fiction [lah] television series that have like around five seasons the show is actually about a set of clones I think there's more than eight
there's sarah who is a pair of twin she's british in the show
(uh) the other twin his ukrainian
(um) she grew up in a church and seems like she's a nutcase and she's raised she raised (uh) she was raised by the nuns and she was trained by this group they call themselves prolethean who was again science
so the series stars this actress (uh) tatiana maslany
as sarah
a woman who steals the identity of these like suicide victim
(um) (uh) who is one of the clones [lah]
then she always (uh) live like an outsider and she
she was like an orphan
ya so that's pretty much it I mean they show isn't perfect the plot lines are sometimes ludicrous and season three was pretty underwhelming (uh) compared to season two and season four
(mm) I don't feel so emotionally attached to a show in years but this concept about one person playing all the clones (uh) usually could be quite can be a quite disastrous right but this one they have really good writers because and also I think mainly because they have this tatiana this actress right they made the show ten times better than what it should have been so because of her it became like this really masterful performance and then she also won emmy last last year so hopefully because of this shows you we can rise up the back of this [lah]
and beyond that the supporting characters also not bad so there's art donnie felix missus S scott ferdinand what I can remember [lah] because this is the current show I'm watching now
(um)
it's really good and then that there's there's always action in every episode but the thing is this style isn't for everyone but I love it [lah] so you won't get (err) you won't be bored with all the twists and turns and then the scene right between sarah and this clone I will not spoil [lah] because there's a lot of clones in the show in the final episode right is one of my favourite scene in the show so it's quite emotional or can make you cry and I like the way it ended (uh) without spoiling it for you
(err) I think
the tone is what it is but it's something you get used to especially as they dig into the characters more
which is where the show really shines I will give it a few more episodes (uh) actually episode six in season one right is over the top but it's also where a lot of people fell in love with the show if it does nothing for you right it's (uh) probably safe to check out [ah] because if you don't like the first three episode I don't think you are going to like the show because five season is really long for someone to get invested so you can choose to check it out
foodpanda <malay>dah takde agaknya asal nak</malay>
[oh] you mean that time (uh) <malay>masa masa</malay> (uh) <malay>masa</malay> collect that time [eh] <malay>takde</malay> that time when I collect [kan] <malay>takde orang pun dah habis dah dia orang cakap ada seribu</malay> [jer] helmet

I think you can google but I can help you [lah] I can send you the link later you should also start to set aside your (uh) interview outfit
(um) don't need tie [ah] I guess (err) maybe just a formal wear including (uh) smart shoes formal shoes
okay

[oh] I was watching wentworth
it's about it's a women's prison show yes but it's [ah] creepier and more real it's (um) it's not is not a comedy like orange orange [kan] orange is more to comedy drama this one is quite violent [ah] ya no it's aussie
nine I know
yes got alot of show I'm waiting for (uh) (uh) why you like
[oh] (um) I mean for me (err) I'm waiting for money heist (uh) wentworth ozark dead to me kingdom so those are coming up with new seasons [ah]
ya [ah] ya you know right they going to do a korean remake on money heist
ya (uh) my friends are all waiting for it because they all enjoy korean show (uh) I don't really like remakes though
you watch korean shows
okay so you like money heist is it your favourite
why
[oh] ya
(mm)
ya ya
[oh] so you think you like a professional critic [ah]
ya ya ya I think it would be more stupid and unrealistic if let's say there's there were no idiotic actions I think a whole lot of the idiot idiot decisions you are talking about (uh) about the the gang right and the professor being overconfident (uh) #raquel# losing her shit because of a crush on the profeesor and so on but I think you just make it more real [lah] if not if not it's like a show that nothing goes wrong I don't like the second season (uh) but it was very entertaining to me [ah] also quite compelling and way better in spanish (um) ya
so but breaking bad is also a show where who brisk and also the overconfidence drive much of what the characters do except
(uh) (uh) the other character is a perfect hero and what he does for most of the story like walter white makes no mistake and then horribly effect or matter to him so damaging to everyone else at what he does I enjoy the professor in this (uh) money heist because he seems like a brilliant dude who makes no mistakes but some of it are impulsive decision and when various things went wrong sometimes really really wrong because of his actions
ya so I guess we can have different opinions [ah] but it's not bad but maybe you are right it's a bit too overrated [lah] anyway so today is twelve twelve (uh) sale so are you buying anything
I think for the next forty five minutes still have but I think it's going to extend until the next full (uh) a couple of days normally it's like that
usually
(mm) I think maybe you can try shopee first and then after that you can take a look at (uh) ASOS or maybe sports they got a lot of (uh) sneakers on sale
(mm)

[a'ah] <malay>sebelum hujan</malay>
<malay>cuci</malay> carburetor [jer]
[oh] full service <malay>dah cakap dah dah tanya dia dia cakap boleh buat sendiri</malay> !huh!
[ah] <malay>tak pasti mungkin kot pasal abang ayie dah</malay> pass two A [kan] so <malay>dia nak bawa motor tu</malay> [kan]
(uh) ya by the way [kan] <malay>tadi kita berbual pasal dua belas dua belas</malay> (uh) actually you can also buy grab vouchers or cinema voucher in shopee [tau] it's a good deal <malay>macam</malay> you just pay five dollars but the cinema voucher is worth nine dollars
[ah] see how [lah] if got stock maybe I will buy some of the grab vouchers <malay>ke</malay> or I will buy the cinema vouchers
no I'm busy (mm) I'd or not I don't as of now I don't have any plans to buy her anything quite busy finding [ah] strider balance bike for #azam#
second
(uh) carousell so I found one (uh) (uh) that can deal at #buangkok# but (uh) he didn't reply so I'm still searching for it
[oh] okay [lah] why not it's a balanced bike not a bicycle so should be okay [lah] firsthand is hundred eighty because of the brand (uh) second hand if in luck we can get fifty dollars
you know
ya I need to get properly the other time when I check they sell forty dollars but (uh) the tire had cannot see the thread and then it's rusty so I need to check properly [lah]
it depends on his father's (uh) interests and free time
ya so have you thought about #azri's# suggestion about you continuing studies to get a degree
(uh) if you ask me I think so because diploma is pretty much nothing now it's more important to get a degree so I think if you land a job in (uh) government sector uniform group like (uh) prison service (uh) (um) I think there will be scholarship that you can apply to study part time degree
ya they're quite supportive [eh] but you need to read more [lah] you need to do more research (uh) but there's bond [lah] I think (err) since I think they going to pay for your study so confirm got bond
but then
you mean like this (uh) uniform group then you should (uh) still think of enrolling yourself for a part time degree by yourself [ah] that means you should set up save up because I think this is a good investment for yourself
(uh) I think you will thank yourself in future
ya okay
ya (mm)
doesn't
do you know a lot of people who has a degree
[oh] so like you you mentioned just now so they they basically
(uh) their degree are sponsored by the company [ah] ya I mean like for example (um)
(mm)
so rolls royce pay for his degree
[oh] that's good so (uh) as he get as he [ah] got the degree right so did his salary also (uh) goes up went up
[oh] okay that's good can I ask what is his position
[oh] okay five years [eh] (mm) so how come you don't asked to apply there to get his (uh) recommendation do you don't you want to work there

[oh] because it's much easier [ah]
nowadays <malay>macam</malay> actually <malay>banyak</malay> like really a lot of things <malay>dia orang nak tukar</malay>
<malay>jadi macam</malay> manufacturing [kan] even <malay>macam sekarang</malay>
like now my workplace <malay>macam</malay> construction [ah] <malay>pun semua pun dia orang nak tukar jadi macam</malay> manufacturing
(mm)
ya ya ya ya actually true [ah] so <malay>macam dia orang</malay> [ah] actually <malay>dia orang nak buat</malay> [kan] <malay>benda tu</malay> [ah] <malay>datang</malay> [jer] [kan]
<malay>terus terus</malay> in place and then they tie something and then that's it finish [ah]
<malay>ayah rasa</malay> the houses [eh] because now they actually want to do a house
[ah] <malay>yang pagar kayu tahu</malay> the whole you imagine [eh] <malay>macam</malay> the whole building
<malay>dia semua pakai kayu ayah rasa ayah ayah tinggal tak kat tempat tu</malay>
so so you it really depends (uh) [ah]
(mm) actually <malay>kalau macam</malay> they use wood [kan] <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> [ah] it's supposed to be cheaper because ya
because like (uh) the wood <malay>banyak tapi macam macam</malay> (uh) the <malay>besi</malay> is steel [kan] <malay>dia orang kena</malay> mine
[ah] so that's why like (uh) <malay>kalau kayu</malay> [kan] <malay>senang dia</malay> chop [jer] <malay>lepas tu dia dia</malay> process
[kan] <malay>cepat habis dia punya</malay> plank <malay>tu banyak</malay>
[ah]
<malay>sekarang macam dekat dalam</malay> news [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>ada banyak cerita macam</malay> climate change <malay>ayah dengar tak cerita ni</malay>
<malay>macam dia cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia ada [ah] <malay>perubahan alam</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia ada tukar macam</malay> [oh] <malay>ada tempat ni kadang kadang mula mula</malay> [ah] you know there's a lot of snow then suddenly [eh] <malay>tempat tu tak banyak</malay> snow
[oh] <malay>yang itu ada</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kalau macam ayah</malay>
<malay>ayah rasa yang ada perubahan tak</malay> over the years [eh] <malay>yang</malay> in singapore do you feel any changes or not
in the <malay>udara ke</malay> or anything like that
so <malay>ayah rasa macam tak apa</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau dia lagi banyak</malay> shopping centre then
this climate change <malay>tu kira</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh boleh</malay> adapt [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> [ah] so far [ah] <malay>ayah tak tahu</malay> anybody <malay>yang</malay> got this COVID right
(mm)
so [ah] <malay>pada ayah macam yang</malay> this [ah] COVID <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>ayah</malay> think will last how long
<malay>tapi dia orang cakap</malay> (mm) <malay>dia orang cakap mula mula</malay> it comes from china [kan] because like <malay>dia punya</malay> china <malay>tu dekat situ</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia orang ada dia orang</malay> they like to eat a lot of like <malay>macam</malay> weird weird <malay>punya</malay> animal <malay>tahu</malay>
[oh]
[oh] so <malay>macam ayah fikir</malay> actually what the government want is to make to ensure that people will continue working
(mm)
<malay>ayah baca tak yang</malay> there's this (uh) group of people [kan] <malay>yang dia orang</malay> army plane <malay>habis lepas tu dia orang</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia orang fikir</malay> [oh] never mind [lah] because it's a private plane <malay>habis dia orang turun</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas tu yang eropah punya</malay>
the europe <malay>punya</malay> people say [eh] [ah] don't come because you're from [ah] please go home
[ah] <malay>ayah baca tak</malay>
[oh] ya <malay>dekat dekat</malay> [eh] the inside of the dormitory [kan] it's really (uh) it
according to my workers [ah] <malay>dia orang cakap kalau kau daripada</malay> [ah] but unfortunately [lah] <malay>kirakan kalau</malay> you're from china [eh] <malay>yang</malay> the
bangladeshi and the indian worker right don't want to mix <malay>dengan yang</malay> chinese because <malay>dia orang cakap tapi memang betul dia punya</malay> hygiene level is very low so
they try to okay I want to stick to only my people ya <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> is like <malay>tapi</malay> of course in the news I think singapore they don't want to say which
place or which type of which race is the one that is get a lot of the (uh) sickness because if not then people will be very <malay>macam macam</malay> racist [kan] <malay>dengan dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal tu dia orang pun tak nak</malay> [ah] actually
[a'ah]
do you remember the SARS actually not so bad [kan] <malay>macam aku</malay> I I I don't remember cause I I was actually in like early like secondary school and then ya
[oh] is it <malay>abang abang punya</malay> party
which one is this [eh]
[oh] the the <malay>khatam quran</malay> party is it
[oh] I don't remember <malay>kena</malay> check temperature actually
[oh] <malay>dah boleh</malay> clear [ah]
mineral water [jer] [eh]
<malay>tapi ayah rasa</malay> like is this COVID right is it the worst thing that happened to singapore or actually ada <malay>benda lain</malay> in <malay>yang ayah ingat</malay> [ah] that is the worst thing than this COVID
so (uh) <malay>apa tu jadi</malay> if now [eh] <malay>bila ayah tengok macam</malay> movie movie <malay>macam</malay> zombie zombie [kan]
[ah] <malay>ayah</malay> continue <malay>tak tengok cerita macam itu sekarang</malay> [kan] now you feel like you're already in the movie
ada cerita yang paling takut tak</malay> what story is like super <malay>takut yang ayah ingat sampai sekarang</malay> [ah]
[oh] like like cannibalism
<malay>tapi</malay> that cannibalism is not even fake [seh] it's not it's not like zombie
but in the story [kan] <malay>dia orang macam cepat gila</malay> [kan] like the they the they run you know
<malay>orang hantu apa</malay> [seh] <malay>itu</malay>
human that
[oh] so you're actually like actually the actual human <malay>yang</malay> human <malay>yang betul lagi lagi takut daripada</malay>
so <malay>macam hantu biasa macam</malay> [ah] you can just
walk away [ah] <malay>katakan</malay>
<malay>tapi kirakan sekarang ayah dah</malay> retire [kan] so <malay>ayah rasa</malay> freedom <malay>tak macam</malay>
I I don't need to care about like all this you know <malay>hantu</malay> or all these you people
so like you don't even need to think about like the basically no stress at all [lah]
so [ah] <malay>apa tu jadi bila ayah dah</malay> retire so after <malay>dah</malay> you retire you feel like
do I really need to go back to work [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
so [ah] <malay>apa itu bila dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>ayah</malay>
(um) <malay>mula mula</malay> start <malay>kerja</malay> then you said that the [kan] <malay>ayah ada kerja kat tempat</malay> glass [kan]

<malay>dia dia</malay> announcement <malay>ke apa</malay>
is it an announcement on
so it was actually <malay>senang gila</malay> [seh]
immigration centre [ah]
[oh] so actually you got lucky [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
so actually <malay>macam ayah pun tak</malay> march <malay>sangat</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
[oh]
actually <malay>dulu pun</malay> like when I first (err) <malay>fikir</malay> [kan] like what to do [kan] actually I also wanted to join (uh) the army
because like the army <malay>macam</malay> to me <malay>macam dia semua macam</malay> easy [ah] [kan]
[ah] then <malay>lepas tu</malay> you you you can rise up the rank and then <malay>kerja dia macam</malay> not so bad [lah]
<malay>tapi aku tengok macam orang kat dalam</malay> army <malay>pun macam apa tu</malay> stoning [kan] <malay>dia orang ikut</malay> the rules and then
marching what's the point [sia] ya
!huh!
[ah] <malay>macam pelik</malay> [kan] it's like what what what's it for [ah] but I mean I can maybe understand [lah] <malay>dia orang semua nak untuk buat</malay>
like you're disciplined <malay>tapi</malay> there must be other ways to be disciplined also right
[ah]
<malay>macam</malay> somehow <malay>dah kau dah kau dah tak dekat dengan situasi itu</malay> suddenly everything <malay>macam</malay> not so bad
quite positive [kan] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> [oh] you can remember the good times [ah]
[ah] it it like life is like that [kan] <malay>macam dulu</malay> like <malay>apa tu</malay> (err) that time when the <malay>adik dalam</malay> police [eh] [oh] my god [sia]
like so hot and then <malay>lepas tu dia punya</malay> push up don't say [ah]
[ah] <malay>dia punya</malay> push up <malay>dah apa tu</malay> !wah! <malay>sekarang sekarang nak buat</malay> push up <malay>macam gitu pun tak boleh</malay> [seh] <malay>tapi dulu</malay> !wah! you know so good you know
ya
[ah] and then <malay>lepas tu dia orang</malay> and then <malay>dia punya</malay> army officer <malay>semua cara dia sama</malay> [kan]
[ah] <malay>dia</malay>
<malay>muka kirakan semua macam yang itu</malay> [ah] yang <malay>kak</malay> #inah# tak minat
[oh] ya ya ya that guy is also before army right ya ya ya ya
so <malay>macam dia orang semua nak kena</malay> they have this <malay>macam angkuh punya muka</malay> [ah] [eh]
[ah] <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [ah] maybe it's just not fated [ah] that I you know that I didn't join the army [ah] forget it [sia] <malay>tengok</malay>
[a'ah]
[a'ah] <malay>tapi bagus juga</malay> [seh] <malay>kalau hari hari pakai</malay> uniform <malay>senang</malay> [seh] like you don't need to think you wake up
ya ya ya ya ya
[ah] so <malay>macam kawan adik sekarang dia dalam</malay> MINDEF [kan] so like although he's in construction [eh]
<malay>dia</malay> nothing to do with him you know [eh] whatever that happen outside [eh] <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] okay
<malay>macam</malay> MINDEF [kan] is very big so <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> if there's anything [eh] <malay>dia orang nak kena buat</malay>
[ah] in within the MINDEF itself ya <malay>dia orang mesti nak ada</malay> manager <malay>yang kat dalam yang boleh buat</malay> construction
so he's the construction manager for MINDEF [lah]
like [oh] I got no feeling #liao# no work no work also everyday I will come to work [lor]
<malay>macam</malay> ya like no feeling to scared <malay>ke takut ke kena buang kerja</malay> nothing ya
[ah]
<malay>tapi ayah dah (err) I mean like I you speak to them <malay>sekali sekala</malay> [ah] at least
[oh]
<malay>apa sal ada banyak</malay> secret <malay>ke</malay>
so <malay>mesti kerja yang rabak rabak punya</malay> then (uh) too bad [lah] because like you're in warehouse [pe]
actually <malay>ayah dulu ada</malay> license <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
<malay>ayah ada</malay> license forklift [kan]
ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> wasted money [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> call crane
[ah] [lah] <malay>pasal macam sama</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> construction <malay>kalau ada</malay> crane <malay>masuk</malay> [kan] it's like [oh] my god [seh]
like <malay>dia orang semua</malay> like you cannot even walk there and then ya
[ah] actually servicing <malay>kebanyakannya</malay> is really <malay>buang habuk</malay>
<malay>dia dia buang habuk</malay> [jer] <malay>lepas tu nanti</malay> is if if really something wrong [kan]
[ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] change part [jer] [ah] <malay>semua</malay>
ya ya ya ya it's true [ah]
maybe <malay>pun tak gerak</malay> [seh] <malay>pasal</malay> there's not much things [kan] <malay>sekarang</malay>
!huh!
ya so <malay>sekarang macam</malay> the situation <malay>dengan si</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> is a bit weird [kan] <malay>pasal banyak benda macam</malay> just stop
<malay>pun pun tak ada banyak orang pakai apa sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>ke apa tu yang</malay> the funny thing is that <malay>yang adik berbual dengan kawan adik</malay> [ah] <malay>habis kawan adik cakap buat apa nak beli baju baru</malay> [seh]
[ah] is <malay>aku</malay> I don't even use the <malay>baju</malay> half of the time in pyjamas <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>pergi kerja pun</malay> pyjamas [ha]
<malay>dulu kirakan macam</malay> so <malay>bila ayah dah masuk</malay> warehousing <malay>tu</malay> then <malay>lepas tu</malay> like you didn't bother to go back to the shipyard [lah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
(mm)
<malay>ayah tak pakai itu ke</malay> umbrella
[oh] ya [ah]
!huh!
so it's like <malay>macam</malay> after you get out [kan] <malay>macam lain gila</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>itu</malay> [ah] <malay>kerja</malay> actually <malay>macam</malay> technical officer is actually pretty [ah] dia dia</malay> actually quite <malay>senang</malay>
[a'ah] so <malay>itu</malay> [ah] so <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] maybe <malay>adik pun</malay> will just become a technical officer [ah]
<malay>pasal kau</malay> if like you <malay>kerja</malay> all the way construction
is like <malay>lagi senang nak</malay> check <malay>orang punya kerja</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada nak buat</malay> you <malay>punya kerja sendiri</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tapi</malay> actually <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] <malay>dia orang banyak yang</malay> [ah] <malay>banyak</malay>

(um) <malay>teknologi boleh menjadi</malay> (err) <malay>boleh ada faedah dan juga tidak berfaedah</malay> (err) <malay>yang faedah dia</malay>
(um)
<malay>macam dalam pelajaran</malay> (uh) (um) <malay>cikgu boleh memberi</malay> assignment <malay>kepada murid-murid</malay> (um) (err) <malay>contohnya kalau ada</malay> E learning
(um) <malay>anak-anak muda</malay> (um)
<malay>murid</malay> (um) <malay>dari dari</malay> (um) <malay>muda mereka senang untuk</malay> catch up (um) their skills especially in technology

(uh)
<malay>dan mereka juga boleh</malay> (err) learn new skills from the internet because (um) but
<malay>banyak perkara yang baik dalam menggunakan teknologi jika digunakan dengan cara betul</malay>
(um)
<malay>yang keburukan teknologi pada anak-anak muda ini</malay> (err) <malay>ialah</malay> social media (um) <malay>mereka boleh terpengaruh dengan</malay>
(err) <malay>perkara yang di luar yang</malay> trend <malay>yang</malay> <malay>yang mungkin boleh membahayakan diri</malay>

<malay>dan ingin dia yang ingin</malay>
<malay>ingin menunjuk-nunjuk kepada rakan rakannya lalu melakukannya</malay> (um) <malay>tetapi ia boleh wujud juga membahayakan dirinya</malay>
(err) <malay>dengan itu saya rasa</malay> social media (err) technology <malay>haruslah digunakan dengan sebaik mungkin</malay>
[ah] <malay>untuk anak-anak muda jika mereka tahu cara untuk mengguna</malay> technology <malay>dengan baik mereka</malay> (uh) (uh) techonology <malay>ialah perkara</malay> (um) it's a safe platform for them

[ah] ya
yes true
yes
yes it was a very memorable experience
yup our childhood cartoon
yes it was good days good old times
yup
yup I agree
[oh] yes I remembered about my first phone I was so I was so happy at first because I always get (um)
second hand phone from you and <malay>ayah</malay> and
but and ya I was happy to have my first personal phone but I'm sad (err) cause I wish I could have took care of it properly as you can see I'm a clumsy person sometimes
ya but it was nice having a first personal phone that's how you feel you you just have your own item your your personal only item and you don't have to share with anyone yup that feeling
well for me personally it depends only the individual
if you are the type of person who prefer to like have your personal phone they don't want to have like second hand phone then it's up to them as if they are able to afford it (um) ya it's their choice I for me I for me it's like
(uh) any phone is fine as long as I can use it it's like because I don't really care I'm not gonna do like do crazy things with my phones I'm not gonna show off ya unless I'm a person who works with phones and have to use advanced technology phones but
ya but (um)
last time the past our phones with the camera with there was no tapping we I mean like no selfie you know in ya the first
the latest the old phones will like nokia why I like if like nokia there was games like snake and I think most of us know and then there were buttons that we had to press and click
and we had to message back (uh) just like that but now the phone is
easy you can type your phone you can ya it (um) even the old the elderly they can they also learn how to use these phones but it can be a struggle for them also because like
they are not used to this type of phones but (um) maybe slowly learn they are able to know how to use it so ya there's a lot of things you can use now with our with the phones
you can watch online stuff learn what and and learn things online you can listen to music upload music take pictures take videos memories yup and download games
a lot of games you can download yup
yup
well for me where
I'm okay with any phone but I I for me I'm like a cheapskate I don't really like expensive phone as long like it can it's functional and able to
give me (err) excellent service and I I'm able to use it well I mean that ya if it's very useful and can function why not (um) just buy (err) knowledge and
no need I don't really need a very expensive phone ya (err) just like latest model phone will be alright ya
ya I kind of agree yup having a phone that (um) which can't last long for the battery is actually no because sometimes we travelled or work (um) then like we sometimes use our phones then
then sometimes [ah] okay example you use a a phone that the battery does not last long and then (uh) you are on the way back home and you want to update your family saying that you're on the way home but
you don't want to make them worry but in the end your phone died and let's say you don't have a charger it's hard so like you won't like it you make yourself
you will make your family worried you and they will be wondering where were you where where when you are trying to say (err) when you yourself actually is alright but ya because ya sometimes you need to contact your families for important stuff ya
yes I agree
ya if if your phone die during overseas and you don't have let's say you have a charger that will be very hard so
ensure you always have a charger with you or portable charger will be nice nowadays we use portable charger right ya then we when we go public and places that we find a plug we just like go charge our phone there ya I mean I mean the phone will be charged at there itself ya
yes I really miss #johor# so much our old house ya but now it's (um) make it we made it into a rented house but it's nice cause our old house is like a not a bungalow terrace what is it [ah] #abu#
[oh] it's a terrace [oh] okay
yup because [ah] it has I like how the house is I mean it's it's like two stories but nothing much but I why I like is about echo like we can echo our voices and (err) I I kinda like how neat is it neat it is
but ya name but
I wish that the the staircase cause I remember because our staircase is like made of wood and like there were termites eating those woods that which cause our staircase to like break so it's not fun [lah] ya why do you why do you think about the termites at the staircase #abu#
sticky #sambal# I mean like definitely miss woodhouse no old your whole house but ya the termites fallen was really I mean to be fair it's not really on main house so we don't live there and given that it's empty right so that's probably where the termites governments it's honestly quite sad ya
ya I agree
ya but I think it's (uh) it's whatever happens (um)
we can learn from it actually and I mean like in the future if you want a house and then you can decide the flooring what kind of flooring type you want so like like you won't easily get damaged you know like that
yup
ya I really agree
I agree
yup
well (um) where we go malaysia I really like us going trip at where is it <malay>adik</malay> (uh) wherever we travel malaysia is a a fun place but most of the time we went to #johor# (um) just for shopping you know going to giant
(um) because when you go when singaporeans go to malaysia where they buy stuff it's actually cheaper [what] I most of it I like is the malaysia food it's tasty especially the burger #ramly# burger #ramly# that I miss the most yup and the abalone
ya I know right it's so <malay>sedap</malay> I really miss malaysia food but too bad now is COVID nineteen we had to wait until (um) alright everything goes smoothly (um) but I really miss malaysia a lot it's amazing experience
going holidays on malaysia was awesome you know with family and you guys spend a lot of (err) cheap stuff you know yup travel and save money at the same time
yes it's very it's very sad yes I really miss going to cause
yup (err) sometimes we went to the website one motoring dot com to like every time when we're at our father ask who wants to go #johor# and he ask like
ask to check at the website if it's there's traffic jam at the causeway you know you remember that #abu#
and just enjoy the scenery of malaysia
(mm) I think so
(um) [ah] we went to cycling (um)
[ah] we went to the you know the playground there maybe you can climb the building not buildings like an obstacle course it was scary because it's very
it's very high and I was afraid to cross over the bridge (err) you had to climb it's like you have to climb from below and climb up there's a ladder I was afraid because I was afraid of heights when I was young but after trying or we went there for several times and we
[ah] and we tried (um) tried their [ah] that big obstacle for several times and after getting used to it (uh) you like the fear of height it has been reduced and it's actually fine when you going up when you're going up
and the height
you know you look up I mean you climb up on a high
I don't know how to say #abu# like you look high up and you look at the scenery ya it's actually nice you know you can see everything from the top
ya
so they have much experience with high element obstacle course
(um) yes because I was (um) for my I was from
and we had to go to camp in sec two in sec three I can't remember
(um) I think it's
also known as survival training camp when I was in secondary three and and then one of the activities we had to do was high elements
[oh] wait I can't (um)
[oh] actually I think I didn't went (um)
I think rock climbing actually I also had it or (uh) high elements in (um) school camps too yup okay one of it was rock climbing
rock climbing
okay rock climbing was I I did check for the first time okay (um) my camp was at the #pulau ubin# there ya
(um) I remember I think secondary two as the first time I went for the rock climbing is that I climb for the first time I couldn't reach to the top I think I already reached for the (uh) I already get to climb for first second because I was
I my body couldn't manage to like climb up anymore (um) ya but after the following year I I was able to make I was managed to (um) rock climbing till the top so it was a great achievement ya it was a very great achievement cause like
(um) you know first time you climb halfway you can reach to the top
ya like like you did you did not manage to reach your goal but you try again for the next time and ya it was fun rock climbing even my sister is a rock climber
cause she like to do sports stuff so ya ya high elements really taught us how to be
how to not be afraid be confident just try your best and you have fun at the same time you know face your fear and come out from your comfort zone and be adventurous yup
well there's there was a lot actually
(um) I remember (um)
I can't (um) in secondary school we did a lot of things
(um) like (uh) like camps mostly camps
(err) give I remember (um) chinese new year hamper wrapping ya we eat at the class
then national days (uh) and then what else [oh] (err) it was sad because you know every year racial harmony day example in primary school you're able to wear like your traditional clothes you know
ya but last time (uh) in our secondary school (um) we didn't get it for my school which is evergreen secondary school we ain't got a chance to wear traditional clothes but like last year
(um) cause we had we change our principal I (um) our principal allow us to wear traditional clothes ya then yup I decide I did wear it once only
and then in school we also had charity bazaar is where students from I think secondary two
in each individual class will have to plan and organize they have to organize and plan to like their booth
and what do you want to do you do it do they want is actually I think yes ya they separated into two teams like one they (uh) do (uh) about
food and beverages like what food or drinks they want to serve and another team was like what items they want to do they want to do photography booth or like I don't know they want to add handicraft stuff booth
(um) ya
and all of them all of these charities (err) will be donated to the (uh) respective
respective people like maybe for those who are for those in needs [lah] for the for the less fortunate people ya so like how it works is
like you have to buy a coupon is that (uh) you have to buy with your money you have to buy coupon and exchange with the coupon to buy (err) to go to the booths and enjoy but charity bazaar was a nice experience too ya I spent like
first firstly I spend ten dollars then I was like I need more cause it was amazing cause I want to try more like the food the games [ah] and then there's also game booths and I did won I mean you (err) I mean I did won some merchandise you know but ya it was a good experience
yup it was a very fun experience and you know you get to see like creative ideas like how the secondary two secondary two students like example the food and drink booth the learn how to
(uh) plan like who's going to do this and that and like what kind of drinks do you want to do ya it's like they
they are they are very creative you know and the food how they gonna handle it who's gonna do this and that the way it's cooked yup and it's very good it's a really good opportunity for them to learn how to handle a and organize a booth yup and in secondary schools
(mm) ya and we have a lot of programmes [lah] actually I remember participating in english fortnight programme (um) like I have to I think I can't remember was I chosen or
I don't know because my classmate encourage me to join I think then we'd we had to play a like you know hangman
but guess the word and it was very fun and I get to meet students from different classes too and I'm very impressed (um) how the way how they speak
we and their english [ah] the way they speak is very fluent and I really admire that (um) I could say that
they have been reading a lot of maybe news or read a lot of books books yup (err) from there I I I should also learn how to
read more books because it also it can also help to improve in my vocabulary as can see my vocabulary is not that strong and I don't really use very strong vocabulary ya and there's a lot I can learn from them [lah] ya
well like after secondary school it's like study I was actually happy that I finish study because I really there's like studying is not
my it's not my type [lah] actually (um) but [ah] for me
I was like you're after secondary school like you had a choice you (err) like example for me (uh) I was given a choice to go to I I did wish to go to poly but ya is also like poly but
(err)
like I in is like you get a lot of an opportunity to learn from a teacher like (um) ya (um)
it's like school also but no [ah] I mean like there's teachers in charge who will be taking care of you and look out for you but ya it's the life is different because like it's in
in secondary school there is like rules and teachers who will always be with you but in or like poly it's like all of your time will be on your own and with your classmates and then you just comfort plus you know ya but in
there's a lot okay there's a lot of course now like engineering there's hospitality there is
(um)
sports there's a lot [ah] actually ya and yup [oh] to apply for the course you have to apply online and then go for the interview and then
ya you make a resume of yourself and then ya they went for interview and if
you do well and everything's fine you get chosen yup and I really ya I like in a variety like in school is I had made a lot of friends and we get live for each other and our teacher was very caring they already took
they really look out for each of their students and we learn like life skills lesson and we also have pre lesson life skills lesson is like
it's like for like what we what we will learn for ourselves [lah] like how to improve our communication skills that all but we have a long assignments to the projects that need to be completed
yup but for me like
(um) doing projects with classmates sometimes can be very hard because they don't want to communicate or maybe because I prefer to do my own I prefer to do like individual cause like I know what to do ya and
and like I really learn a lot of video editing like for myself because project we have to take video right and then you have to present you know and then we learned how to use I learned how to use I mean my (err) using my skills I learned how to use microsoft word
like for my project and microsoft powerpoint like but I I it's it's good that in secondary school (uh) we didn't have like workshops and we learn how to use it ya
and because like are maybe some jobs or I think most jobs [lah] like you have to make (err) you need to make a proposal example or like a review you have to use your skills and do it online with microsoft word
microsoft office basically (err) and
for me like my course I choose pastry and baking (um)
because I I cause why I choose that course is (um) I I I want to learn how to (uh) bake things and like learn new recipes and I also
wish that I could be I could like make my own
(um) pastries and all and then I can like sell it like I it's fun [lah] to bake for people you know for your loved ones and they enjoy eating it so ya it's nice to like bake stuff bake delicious desserts and all ya
[oh] (um) okay there's a lot of things I learn during my course like last year
here we did a lot (um) okay like I remember we made a fruit tart and then we made (um) I think lemon meringue tart and then we made madeleine
or financier focaccia and it's a great (um)
then we make sourdough and and then what else we made (err) the pizza it (um) and we also make cakes (um) black forest cake and I think strawberry shortcake or is it vanilla sponge cake I I yup something like that but like
but I wish I could (err) redo my cake like I redo how I decorate because I was not experienced on decorating it
ya it was hard to make sure to cake is like
like if [ah] even you know like how I cut it cause like you know when you bake a cake there's like (uh) you have to cut it into threes (uh) three parts or what cause you want to stack it and then like filling with it and ya you have to make sure
when you after you bake it right you must make sure you cool down the cake
and then chill it in the fridge
then after chilling it and (err) after (err) the cake is chilled and then you can like decorate your cake so and the filling
cause if if you try to like put the filling (err) at the cake when the cake is hot the filling will melt you know
so like ya you did cake while it's cold it is nice actually ya
so like what are some of the recipes that you found difficult to do or like you struggled a little bit
[oh] okay I remember (um) we didn't make okay (err) I didn't make cream puff before and then in the you know like the dough name is #pate choux# in french and then you know (uh) we had to do eclaire #choux# so it's basically the eclaire dough like the the
the dough right it's like the same like (uh) cream puff is actually the exactly the same you know it's just the way you pipe it
so I was I tried to after my (err) my class advisor though
(um) my sir showed us (uh) a cake chef show us how how to demonstrate for the practical the eclaire then when it was time for practical for me to do I didn't know why but I tried doing my eclaire and the
the dough this thus call the dough consistency was very runny I don't know why but I repeated like I think I repeated two or three times
then after that I was like okay I'm done so in the end I did try to help my coursemate cause I saw my classmate struggling to so I tried to assist to and see and observe what can improve and all ya
but I get when I see my other classmates who (uh) they're also very creative and innovative innovative people the way they decorate it and do very
passionate and I'm amazed [lah] like they have really nice talents to (um) which I can also learn from them
ya
[oh] my lecturer name my (err) we call him sir jeremy
ya he's really (err) sir jeremy is a very nice (uh) teacher he
the (uh) he always tried to make class fun him he make us like one of his like his children his kids and then like
he's our he's like our (uh) parent like a a a father to us yup
and like if when he joked with us we can also joke him but when it comes to assignments and attendance and attitude is we have to ensure that is we have
to you know be punctual and all don't cause any trouble when we cause trouble to him (uh) he will be very disappointed and you wouldn't want that and who (err)
which teacher doesn't want to see their children (uh) their I mean their kids the students to you know do well in their studies and succeed you know I mean like
cause like you teach your student and then you make them when you see them succeed you feel very like a proud like a very proud like (err) like proud parent you know like like you teach your kid how to
how to you know be independent and all yup I think being a teacher is very hard sometimes
but but it's also a very like you have to share your experience like your life experience and then like your students can learn from you at same time and you know and ya learn from one and another yup
(um)
do you mean during COVID nineteen
(um) I don't know I I
ya actually I all I want is to go to malaysia you know just go to malaysia go shopping and all but it's ya it's so sad that COVID nineteen happens you know ya and we have to wear mask nowadays and hand sanitizers but
(um) this COVID nineteen really showed us a lot like
like shows (err) appreciation to our loved ones cause like
like example does (uh) when first week COVID nineteen happened like those foreigners like working in a foreigner country couldn't go back to their own country cause (uh) because of COVID nineteen cause cause of work right and then they can't really they
couldn't see their family for I think for a lot for more than one month I I can't remember how much I think more than six months and it's very sad you know but you're doing this for your family you know working in a foreign country
be separated with family but you're still able to contact with them video call with you know
ya it's very sad but it's really I mean you you're sacrificing
everyone is sacrificing for the family you have to work you know for your family you know your children
yup well COVID nineteen also show us like to like you know have a safe distancing like don't like you have to take care of your hygiene you know hygiene is really important because example [lah] like (um)
example people who use the toilet our public toilet after using the toilet you don't really wash their hands and that's really not a good thing I mean it's gross [lah]
then like you you don't wash your hand and then you touch things here there and then like the next person who touch the items will can get effected you know
so like
COVID nineteen has tweak up a lot people about hygiene wash your hands with soap
yup and and like you know (err) in restaurants last time was like (uh) you already allow I think three people per table I think
and then they put the (um) the cross X tape at the chair which is sad you know because like like you are used to eating with with a lot of people but then after that like you need to minimize the amount of people eating at per table it is like
so like ya
but it's great that the then like the national day even this national day
like (um) (um)
like those who are involved in the parade also have to wear a mask which is
which can be a struggle you know like cause wearing a mask
(um) I know wearing a mask it will it will helps (um) to ensure that people are safe
from spreading virus and germs while wearing a mask also is a struggle like for me cause like you know sometimes it's hard to breathe it's hard to talk with your friends
can't hear what you're saying cause sometimes I try to talk also and then like my this in my voice is soft and I try to repeat and it's still soft and then I have to take off my mask to speak yup it's very it's very tiring to talk with a mask sometimes
but ya wearing a mask for me
like for my for my face [lah] example like I have mask acne like ya it can
pimples can grow at my face when I wear masks which are it's scary not I mean like having break out when we because of the mask is not a good thing which we ya I have to take care of my skincare routine and ya but we all need to (um) get used to wearing masks
yup and we must enjoy is as a singaporean we have to enjoy cause we are working as a
as a citizen
to ensure COVID nineteen (uh) to keep out take our part and ensure that all of us are safe from COVID nineteen as we and we follow the rules and regulation everything will be alright
and like (um) it's good at the government give us
I think some
income right I think for most I think for low incomes for for those who lose their jobs during COVID nineteen yup and and ya we got hand sanitizers now we're used to hand sanitizers you know

(uh)
[oh] like I say you shouldn't have these kind of feeling why when you hear this kind of thing you should be like !hey! I can do it you know like you're gonna do it if you're gonna start primary school with this kind of like !huh! maths
then how are you going to get better how are you going to do well
then <malay>baru dia</malay> like

I thought that was under you [what]
timetable [kan]
I never teach her timetable [lah] I always subtraction <malay>dengan</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> count backwards
<malay>dengan tu</malay>
like like she can even ask me like when I said
like <malay>apa</malay> (um)
you have one dollar and then you buy this
then
[eh] (err) one dollar and then you buy this for like seventy cents like that
then she will ask me (err) is it (err) minus or plus
you get I mean is like what do you do you buy something you still get more money [ah] or you lose money or you take away and she go [oh] <malay>duit</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> no I find <malay>dia tak</malay> grasp the concept <malay>betul betul</malay>
<malay>dia cuma</malay> like [oh] I get it but it's not hundred percent it's like maybe seventy percent [ah]
ya ya ya that kind of thing
like #ilan# is some one <malay>senang nak tangkap sebab dia</malay>
he knows the basic very well
you know that kind of thing for like
simple stuff [lah]
but for her <malay>dia punya</malay> ya the concept
she needs to understand why we do that
so I was like telling her [ah]

ya

hello <malay>mas apa khabar</malay>
I'm fine thank you
how's your family
[ah]
ya second one is a boy right
[oh] I'm still looking for someone
I'm only twenty plus
it's okay <malay>macam melayu cakap kalau jodoh tak ke mana</malay> (mm) so what are your plans for this weekend
[oh]
(uh) I'm not sure but I'm going to meet some friends would you like to join us
I think it (um) you might know them because some of them are our former [ah] schoolmates
[oh] yes #ahmad# is there (uh) <malay>dia sekarang dah kahwin dia ada</malay> (uh) think four or five kids
no [lah] it's okay [ah] <malay>rezeki masing-masing</malay> [ah] so are you not going out with your family today
[oh] you're into baking now !wah! that's nice !wah! must try some of your cake soon [ah]
okay sure but what are we going to do this weekend
[ah] movie but [ah] during this pandemic kind of hard [lah] because I think with the crowd control and all
!wah! netflix and chill [ah]
(err) I don't know (uh) only so far only a few have confirmed but (uh)
I will update you [ah] on the rest maybe about four five of us
ya that would be a good idea
can [lah] (uh)
will update you later so
what how
so how are your kids at school
[ah]
(um) but is it too young for them to start
(um) going to tuition at this age she's only six years old [kan]
ya
think the education system in singapore is such that (err) everyone is competing (uh) so
it's
it has its pros and cons [ah] like to prepare your kids but for them to
be stressed at such an early age
like <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
ya but
slowly [lah] but surely (uh) I think if your kids just study hard and
show you and your husband that
they become
this do well in school I think it's important [lah] they just try their best [lah]
and
I I do have other maybe (uh) I think I can ask them but I don't know how much their rates are
[oh] [oh]
[orh] okay okay I understand I can ask for you [lah] then
(err) we'll see what we can arrange
(err)
!wah! you sit down at coffeeshop [ah] I thought you #atas# [one]
[oh] you you full time housewife [ah]
<malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>tu boleh jaga anak-anak</malay>
good [lah]
actually it's better for to me [lah] personally I think it's good that you are taking care of your kids rather than
(um) like hiring a maid or something
because some I've heard of cases where maid like don't really do their job I don't know
ya I think it's costly to to get a maid to have a maid in singapore (err) I think (err)
they have levy
then when you first
I think it's quite
expensive [ah] then must add into your income I don't know
then I think they should also have a rest day (uh) some owners also like abuse their maid [lah] so that's not right [lah] I feel
ya there's (uh) the other few cases in singapore about maid abuse [ah] think they accuse maid of stealing
and some even like pour boiling water at the maid
ya I think it's on the news [lah] but you just have to be updated [lah] now with the
COVID nineteen [ah] I think a lot of us are restricted in so many ways
can can
can engage maid but I think it'll be the price will be higher because I think your maid have to go for check the swab test all that [lah] before they are cleared to do cleaning [oh] (mm)
<malay>bagus</malay> [seh] <malay>masak untuk</malay> husband all
[oh] must take care of your health now [lah]
like but I think if now if you go to any
(uh) I think if your doctor if you have a slight fever or cough or sneeze think they will give you like five days and ask you to monitor
ya [lah] for those who are working [lah] they will give you like
to check on yourself
(err) so that that because they don't want this to spread
around right
ya but <malay>ni adalah satu</malay> (uh) precaution for us to take ya so <malay>kita perlu berhati-hati</malay> [lah]
[ah]
so <malay>penyakit ni boleh jangkit siapa-siapa pun tak kira muda atau tua tapi bila dah sakit nanti susah pula tak boleh keluar kerja tak boleh jumpa kawan-kawan duduk rumah</malay> [jer]
(uh) #alhamdulilah# so far
I'm okay [lah] maybe
got
headache
migraine maybe because insufficient rest (uh) because of work [ah]
ya [lah] stress [lah] at work <malay>macam-macam</malay>
(um) politic [lah] then you got a lot of new things and we have to do the what (uh)
safety measure measurement at work (mm) cause yes
now currently we have this installation (uh) of #doraemon# at the national museum it's interesting [lah] but
since it's the holidays [kan] <malay>banyak orang-orang datang</malay> (uh) visit museum
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak datang dengan</malay> family <malay>nak kena datang</malay> on weekdays
(uh) weekend <malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal terlalu ramai</malay>
(uh) until <malay>nak</malay> queue under the hot sun <malay>pengsan pula</malay>
(um) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>semua kena</malay> queue <malay>macam biasa</malay>
unless I'm there [lah] then I can maybe give you special
special queue
ya december holidays
ya so ya [lah] kind of sad <malay>pasal tengah</malay> holiday <malay>sekarang</malay> but we have nowhere to go
[ah]
[oh] ya ya I've read about it but <malay>belum ada</malay> time [lah] to redeem tour voucher
(uh)
[oh] I don't think <malay>ada</malay>
for kids <malay>ada tu</malay> vouchers I think it's only for adults ya then I think you can
(uh) claim it
online [ah] so it's not that bad [lah] hundred dollars <malay>pun jadi</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>biasa</malay> [lah] singaporean <malay>bila yang dia orang tak</malay> complain
[oh] usually you go to #johor# [ah] and do your shopping
(mm) understand ya I think (uh) COVID nineteen <malay>ni menjejas banyak</malay> singaporean
then ya [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh keluar rumah tak boleh keluar negeri susah</malay> [ah] <malay>nak pergi</malay> holiday <malay>pun tak boleh kesian tapi itu</malay> [lah]
it's like they say prevention is better than cure ya so <malay>pasal</malay> I think malaysia <malay>pun sekarang masih ada banyak</malay> case [ah] so it's still unstable [lah]
I think so far our government has done well [lah] to control ya ya cause if not think like in the like getting worse
(mm)
[oh]
I think (uh) ya ya I saw that I think my friend a colleague of mine also <malay>ada bilang juga</malay>
[ah] so it's like
(uh) they have different sizes [lah] and
(uh) they cater also for kids
(mm)
[ah] no [lah] I think it's just protection the mask think surgical mask <malay>pun</malay> can do its job [lah]
(mm)
ya true
ya [lah] <malay>sekarang pun yang baru-baru</malay> case <malay>dekat</malay> tampines mall <malay>tu</malay> !wah!
because I was there then I think a few days I think one day later think they announced that there's a case of COVID nineteen at tampines mall <malay>terperanjat</malay> [seh]
ya
ya but surprisingly
(uh) so far <malay>tak ada pula</malay> case <malay>yang lain-lain</malay>
I mean <malay>yang</malay> in the community [lah]
I think they are currently
preparing [ah] for phase three to roll out but ya [lah] depends also on I think
as singaporeans
to be on alert [lah] it's important [lah] for us to be on alert
[ah] because you will never know [seh] who <malay>yang ada penyakit ni</malay> then <malay>kita pun senang jangkit</malay> especially <malay>dengan macam</malay>
<malay>warga emas dengan kita punya</malay> parents <malay>nak kena jaga-jaga</malay>
ya I think <malay>baru semalam</malay> news (uh) that people are queuing over at <malay>mana</malay> [eh]
[ah] foot locker to buy some adidas shoe that was launched ya I don't know that if there was a
crowd control measurement that
in place [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] from the look of the photos <malay>tak ada</malay> [jer] think these people sometimes are just trying I don't know
(mm)
ya [lah] that's where the christmas light up is <malay>lagi</malay> so this year has been a challenging year [lah] [ah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
<malay>ada bagus juga</malay> [lah] that you
<malay>tak ni</malay> [lah] but ya I think it affects everyone like even most singaporeans who used to frequent to <malay>ke</malay> malaysia <malay>ke</malay> I think it's affecting business everywhere (uh) <malay>kedai-kedai tutup ada orang kena buang kerja kesian</malay> [kan]
I think (mm) <malay>mana-mana</malay> affected
you know
(mm) ya [lah] but I think the singapore government is like allowing people to come in for work for business [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> are required to have the mandatory swab test then (uh) like
stay home notice ya
and I think (uh) for those who are coming in I think
(uh) they need to do the swab test daily I'm not sure [ah] I'm not sure how it works exactly ya but they are required [lah] [eh] even when they come in they have to do the swab test [lah]
[ah]
ya thankfully
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] so I I <malay>dengar daripada kawan-kawan yang kena</malay> swab test <malay>yang</malay>
(uh) <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau dibuat dengan betul tak</malay> [lah] <malay>rasa sakitnya kalau orang baru</malay> or trainee <malay>yang buat</malay> !wah! <malay>rasa</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal dia orang cucuk dalam sekali</malay>
a
(mm) yes yes
(uh) I think the hired or those who were inexperienced or did not have
proper work
can undergo training before they can do the (uh) the conduct the test
ya I think I even my friend <malay>yang</malay>
was (mm) asked to leave I think he got a job as a security [lah] (err) and considered is also a high risk because (err) he's taking care
of
those who are
quarantined in the dorm (uh)
but actually they're paying quite
high [lah] is about fifteen dollars per hour
ya
ya I think
ya they have to put on the the personal protective equipment which consists of the gown the mask the goggles all that [lah] because they don't want to
be in contact [ah] ya don't want to be exposed to this (uh) and even when he he's finished his job think he ask (uh) his family to prepare like a bucket of water with soap so that he can (uh) remove his clothes outside his house (uh) ya
but actually before he go back so he already shower at the at his workplace [lah] so it's just an
additional steps [ah] precaution ya
[ah]
ya you see
ya actually quite <malay>kesian</malay> [ah] in this situation <malay>macam banyak orang ada</malay> family but
<malay>kena berhenti kerja</malay> business <malay>tutup</malay>
[ah] so it's not easy [ah] it's quite
twenty twenty has been (uh) ya [lah] like I said a challenge [lah] <malay>untuk kita semua mudah-mudahan dipermudahkan</malay> [lah]
ya I think ya the government
our government has taken like
measure steps [ah] I think which is quite good [lah] for all [lah] even though maybe some of us feel that we are restricted <malay>tak boleh keluar ke apa</malay> but still it's for our own good [lah]
[oh] I do actually (err) I think he pre-ordered the mask even before COVID ya I think I think he's the type like [ah] so he and his wife <malay>dah beli</malay>
a few cartons [eh] I think at home then now they are like selling the mask
but sometimes I think ya
it's best to be safe [lah]
got some quality is not that good [ah]
ya but for kids you can actually buy for them
the specially designed mask [ah]
think they will if they like something they will probably wear it longer
ya but I don't know how <malay>berapa bagus yang</malay> reusable <malay>punya</malay> mask
ya but
no [lah] I think you should the government issuing masks for
the ones that are washable I think still can still can last [lah] (err) for a few months then but you have to
wash [lah] I think you have a few and the ones that recyclable then just are reuse [lah]
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] because (uh)
<malay>bulan</malay> december (err) think my mother's birthday is coming so maybe <malay>nak ajak makan</malay> [lah] but
(err) according to the
safety measurement I think
!wah! only can <malay>keluar</malay> (um) five <malay>lima orang sahaja</malay>
(mm)
ya can okay [lah] that's an idea but
think <malay>kalau</malay> the atmosphere is different [lah] when you dining outside (err) <malay>dengan makan kat rumah</malay> [kan]
ya with this COVID I think
you just need to
take care of ourselves [lah] think the celebration is is actually <malay>pasal kita nak kena</malay>
<malay>jaga diri sendiri</malay>
<malay>janji kita sihat</malay>
(mm) <malay>mana kita berhenti tadi</malay>
(um) [ah] <malay>awak</malay>
<malay>seorang</malay> baker <malay>awak suka masak apa</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> family
(mm)
<malay>pandai juga awak</malay> baking [eh] <malay>abeh kalau masak masak apa</malay>
[oh] <malay>untuk</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>suami awak</malay> family <malay>awak makan yang sedap-sedap pasal sekarang kat luar pun banyak kedai makan yang tutup pasal</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay>
(mm) <malay>mungkin pasal orang dah</malay> stock up <malay>ke</malay> (uh) <malay>iya</malay> [lah] singaporean [kan] <malay>macam saya cakap</malay> #kiasu# <malay>dia orang suka benar simpan</malay>
[oh] <malay>beli barang banyak-banyak rakan kerja saya pun ada nasi</malay> (uh) three or four packets for a family of
[ah] three [kan] (mm)
ya [lah] <malay>kesian yang orang-orang yang ya</malay> [lah] <malay>tak ada pendapatan</malay> (mm) <malay>tapi saya rasa</malay> <malay>ada juga</malay> restriction on every household that can buy certain like rice like maybe two packets of rice per household
(mm) ya [lah] <malay>saya pun kesian juga orang yang tak ada rumah tak ada tempat tinggal mana agaknya dulu kalau masjid buka boleh juga orang tidur dekat masjid sekarang saya rasa lagi susah</malay> [lah] <malay>mana dia orang pergi</malay>
(mm) <malay>betul tu</malay> (uh) there's a lot of platform <malay>yang</malay> go digital so I think (uh) everyone every household actually needs like a smartphone like a laptop [ah] these are now necessities
(mmhmm)
(mm)
ya I think (uh) a lot of companies are like working from home and stay at home when they can [lah] so it's best they do so [lah] during this period but then your brother is from the airline industry airline industry I think is badly affected [seh] ya I think my friends either <malay>yang kena</malay> retrenched at an early age [eh]
feels also quite sad [lah] for those who have a family like they suddenly like thought that the airline industry is like like iron fist or something [ah] but now look what happened
ya I think
ya having a pay cut
it's also bad [lah] but it's better than not having no job and all [lah] ya because you still have a family have bills to pay ya
ya [lah]
ya [lah] it's tiring [lah] even my friend who used to work at the museum he's now (uh) doing grab but grab is also affected (err) think there was once during the circuit breaker period I think he
send the car back because he couldn't pay the rental only after phase two only he (uh) took back the car ya but still it's not doing well [lah] he has to work about fourteen to fifteen hours to cover rental (uh)
ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
I think <malay>dia tak akan</malay> take the swabber paying job [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> I think he has more kids at home <malay>kesian takut</malay> he'll be affected [lah] even though he'll be (uh) think
he has his reasons [lah] for not doing that kind even though it's (uh) <malay>gaji tinggi</malay> but still <malay>dia tak kalau boleh tak mahu dedahkan</malay> (uh)
to the family [lah]
(mm) true [lah] I think
the government implementing a lot of (err) help for those
need them [ah] they also I think they have set up this (um) united where they can have families the elderlies and those who are you need [lah] ya
because I think
quite a lot of singaporeans affected by this and like
think since march [ah] I think know and now it's like coming to the end of the year and we haven't like got a proper vaccine to counter this ya you know the other day and another friend of mine about india india actually came up with a vaccine
ya it's quite scary but hopefully ya [lah] things will get better [lah] think I think for singaporean [ah] they the
this is still contained and hopefully there won't be anymore new cases [ah] that can affect us
ya where should we go to <malay>makan</malay> what is your favourite food
#prata#
(uh) there's a #prata# at #sin ming# I think it's quite nice it's run by a family (uh) father and a son
can can (um)
can [ah] maybe I want to try eat the #briyani# [ah]
the #briyani# is quite nice [ah] I think the chicken
very soft very tender ya I think compared
to other places I think that's one of the best [ah]
(err) what do you want to order I help you order
the #briyani# or the #prata# coin is also nice
yes the curry is (uh) <malay>sedap</malay>
and it's
<malay>tak pedas sangat</malay>
I think just the right
taste [ah]
can
(uh) I think I eat #briyani# with (uh) fried chicken [lah] (mm) because the chicken today they fry just nice to my liking [ah]
then what drinks do you want
#teh# #peng# #teh# #peng#
#teh# with ice [eh]
ya but I think is not that good to always drink #teh# with ice ice
then you can just order mineral water think it's better [lah] at this I think for us at this times we must really take care of our health (err) and also see what eat we eat
[ah] and also see what we eat
okay
can
(uh)
anything else
!wah! there's a lot of people in the queue

[ah] yes
[oh] so we have to pick up or
[oh] okay [oh] that's
!wah! see <malay>sekarang semua dah</malay> high tech
order <malay>makan pun boleh</malay>
ya I understand but (err) I volunteered with (err) an organisation that is helping the elderly like to buy food (err) to buy groceries so that they will minimize (err) their movement outside [ah] so they can actually (err) contact us and have like medication
(uh) you can buy for them and then send it to their homes (um)
ya [lah] I think it's a long way to help our seniors (uh)
because I think if they are exposed to this I think (um) probably they're they're prone because their immune system not as strong as before
no this is (uh) I think done by government agencies [ah] they they set up to help out the elderly the seniors (uh) so that they will not be exposed much [ah] so as and when they need help they just contact the agencies [ah] then we will be there to send groceries medication (uh) food
ya I think is yup
I think you can volunteer [lah] through the organisation I will give you a contact person so that maybe can ask [eh] for more information [lah] ya
ya at this point <malay>memang</malay> [ah] it's not
(um)
not right to be walking on their own <malay>tapi ia untuk kebaikan dia orang pasal kalau dia orang dah</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>ni</malay> I think it will take <malay>masa yang panjang untuk dia orang</malay> to recover to get well [ah] <malay>kesian</malay> I'm looking at my mother who's asthmatic [kan] <malay>macam</malay> I try not to let her out of the house as much but sometimes you know they want to go out have fresh air ya <malay>kesian</malay> [kan]
free [ah]
(mm) <malay>betul tu abeh lagi</malay> cause my parents are staying on their own <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] we don't get to meet them as much <malay>abeh ada</malay> some old folks <malay>tak tahu pakai</malay> smartphone so <malay>lagi tak jumpa anak-anak cucu-cucu</malay> so <malay>kesian dia orang</malay> so <malay>masa-masa gini</malay> [lah] <malay>kita patut berwaspada</malay> even though it's sad but we have to follow [lah]
(mm)
ya
ya [lah] <malay>yang generasi yang</malay>
<malay>lama mereka tak</malay> #terexpose# <malay>dengan</malay> internet <malay>macam kita sekarang</malay> so with this technology I think <malay>dia orang</malay> will
[ah] <malay>ambil masa untuk</malay>
<malay>mempelajari semua abeh kalau kita</malay>
<malay>tak ada di sana</malay>
<malay>makin susah</malay>
so <malay>kesian</malay> so
communication

but the ugly is like damn ugly
like
K [lah] I feel so bad for saying people ugly
but like the eyes like
<malay>satu ke tepi abeh macam</malay> lazy eye and then the
the distance between each eyes is like right
why do you care about his perspective when you're the one who has to look at him so <malay>mata dia jauh gila</malay>

would you rather
have one million dollars

and meet your friends at work
okay [lah] one million dollars is
not a lot
in today's context
!huh!
!huh!
<malay>tak faham</malay>
so <malay>kau nak jadi</malay> tour guide
I don't understand
<malay>ada ke kerja macam gitu</malay>
(mm)
(mm) I rather get the money
and then the money I will invest and then I will roll it
and then I can do what I want
which is to save all the cats in the world no [lah] in singapore first [lah]
that is not boring
I want to save all the cats in singapore
and then I'm gonna set up a cat cafe then you can make it like it's also the same as if your job is to save cats they will be looking forward for ingredients is not a job you can volunteer hit a jaw all the money you use would be for the cats and basically you don't get any money most of the cat's rescue work you don't get money ya [lah] what I mean is
saving cats is not a job most if it is volunteering
no the money you use will be
for the cats and (uh) basically you don't get any money
most the cats rescue work you don't get money cause the money
ya [lah] with the money then I will do that [lah]
I need that one million dollar first so that I can set up this cat cafe
what kind of organisation it's not a work it's not a job these
places are rescue works you don't earn anything then I don't need to live I don't need to pay bills
need to pay bills [what] and then the cats I rescue them and then [what] feed them [what]
ya
so I need the money so I can open up a cat cafe the people will come
and eat and drink and all the money will be given to the cats for their food
and the the unique
selling point of this cat cafe is that all the cats are
stray cats
fat why
ya [lah]
cause I will invest also [what] so my my money will come from my investment
then the remaining will be for the cats
and then the people who will work at a cafe
are those people from the low income family
your head
<malay>tak itu</malay> those like kittens and <malay>semua</malay> is like
a non-profit organisation
!huh!
(uh) (uh) I cannot [lah]
volunteer [ah]
then you get to play with the cats [sia] so cute
bring [lah]
no you must keep
you know the cats so cute over there most of them are like abandoned cats
ya [sia] like
I am saving bubbles
for like a kitten that
or a cat that's abandoned outside

(mm)
odd weeks you mean what alternate weeks [ah] basically
[eh] why are we talking about this
[eh] but I have always had this like
(err)
thinking
!wah! I I've never believe in all these nonsense [sia] until like
like she told me about the possibility of the
the family using all of these but to me this is all <malay>merepek</malay> and like <malay>syirik</malay>
ya but I I really don't believe until like it it's like closer to me now !alamak! mama <malay>balik pula</malay>
okay (err)
okay nevermind let's switch topic first since like
we cannot talk about it now
(um)
(mm)
but what
[oh] ya I wanted to say
I feel like
papa has sense like
<malay>macam pelindung</malay> for like all of us
!huh! your friend can see
what kind of places
no
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>kena kacau macam mana</malay> at the place
<malay>hantu tu takut dengan kau</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
you saw
then
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
!huh! <malay>kau punya</malay> like yours
and then
and that's why I thought I said that
I somehow feel like papa send like <malay>pelindung</malay> for us
cause his family also like
<malay>macam orang-orang boyan</malay> and then after that come from the indonesia also [what]
his side
if I'm not wrong
ya [lah]
why do you think <malay>nenek</malay> and <malay>atuk</malay> keep saying that (uh) <malay>mesti bapa kau pakai benda untuk mak kau</malay> and everything which I find like <malay>macam merepek</malay> [sia] <malay>apa</malay> [sia] <malay>kau percaya benda merepek ni semua</malay> but
when I as I grow up and then I try to understand all these different cultural practices then I'm like ya
we cannot be like so dismissive
when there is a possibility of it
(mm)
ya you'll never know [sia]
and he's not that like great also
and then the wife like <malay>macam tunduk dekat dia</malay>
no but I really think that he did send something for us since he like cannot be around us
and then this <malay>pelindung</malay> is fighting with #etol's# thing so that's why I still can think rationally like no I don't want this marriage but that thing also is like playing around and say no you want this marriage
I think
I think
I think
I think these are all signs of
delusion
I think <malay>kita pergi</malay> <malay>sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>abeh ustaz ustaz ni ustaz ustaz ni semua berapa</malay> [ah] <malay>kena bayar islam punya</malay>

<malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] <malay>ni pelindung</malay> if only I can talk to my <malay>pelindung</malay> please do your job you didn't really save me from
making some decisions that I will regret
[ah] then after that he will <malay>jampi</malay> even stronger <malay>jampi</malay> [lah]

ya
okay for myself [lah] [eh] <malay>apa yang</malay> I wish for is
the first thing I'm thinking about being rich of course everybody think about being rich right
because being rich you don't need to even think about like (uh)
you got momey problem anything right because you already rich [what]
you if you like like what you say become a billionaire right once I become a billionaire I'm also going to buy a house a car
for (um)

so whenever <malay>kita ada kita punya</malay> own car
<malay>ke kita nak beli</malay> grocery <malay>nak pergi</malay> shopping at least we got our own car
so we can bring whole family go shopping together [ha]
since we got a big family right [ah] okay [lah] <malay>kita ada</malay> car so
car is actually benefit for us to go everywhere [lah]
when you got a big family right it's much easier
[ah] rather than now that we having difficulties okay like emergency we want to go
anywhere also we need to book a grab at least if we got our own car at least we can drive
straightaway and bring
I mean like something happen (uh) we can bring our parents or maybe we can bring our siblings or
touch wood [lah] [eh] if anybody
[ah] emergency at least we got car
we can drive straightaway to the hospital
[ah] so we can save for the ambulance money so we don't need to pay the ambulance at least we save the money so once you think about money [ha]
everything about money [lah] [eh]
because although once you being rich you still think about money [ah] that is why
then after I bought everything then after everything stable then my second wish is I want to have a baby
(uh) I want to have a baby [lah] at least <malay>kalau ada</malay>
stable <malay>punya ni</malay>
(uh) stable financial [eh]
(uh) at least <malay>dah boleh ada anak</malay>
<malay>pasal ada anak banyak pakai duit nak beli</malay> pampers <malay>nak beli susu</malay> everything [kan]
[ah] so <malay>aku rasa</malay>
<malay>lebih baik</malay> (uh)
<malay>dah ada</malay> stable <malay>semua</malay> financial <malay>baru ada</malay> baby [ah] <malay>kalau tak</malay> stable <malay>nanti anak nak makan apa</malay> [kan]
<malay>takkan nak kebulur makan pasir</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>jadi</malay> at least <malay>kalau kita dah ada duit</malay> [ah] at least we also
<malay>sebelum jadi</malay> richest <malay>pun kita nak kena pandai</malay> save <malay>duit</malay>
[ah] save <malay>duit</malay> you need to have plan about money [ha]
<malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>kalau kau dah</malay> plan [ah] <malay>semua jadi</malay> at least <malay>bila kau ada anak</malay>
<malay>nak hantar anak kau pergi sekolah sekarang sekolah bukan</malay> cheap [eh]

(mm)
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(um) you know that (uh)
that's why I suggest if we book hotel we can ask the hotel management
to do the birthday party for us
because later they they will tell us how much everything altogether
[ah] they will serve okay you having what event right then you say like birthday party it's just a small birthday party
you can say if not like
you just say it's a surprise birthday party so they will create for you so you no need to deco they will deco for you [lah]
so at least from they maybe we save up or if you really think that it's not save so you
you suggest (uh) maybe we like what you suggest just now you say what
we buy at daiso [kan]
so maybe <malay>barang-barang yang kita beli kat</malay> daiso <malay>tu kita boleh buat sendiri</malay> [lah] <malay>tampal sendiri</malay>
tapi apa yang <malay>aku rasa lagi</malay> save is <malay>macam hari ni</malay> birthday our cousin [kan] then the next day birthday <malay>abang</malay> [kan]
my husband [eh] <malay>jadi</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>buat macam mana jadi pukul dua belas</malay>
(uh) <malay>macam kita buat macam</malay>
(uh) eleven plus <malay>gitu nak dekat pukul dua belas</malay> so at least <malay>kita</malay> celebrate
<malay>satu kali jalan</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [kan] so it's better right
so at least time <malay>kita</malay> celebrate okay (uh) <malay>kita dah</malay>
<malay>tiup tiup tiup</malay> [oh] okay okay <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] <malay>kira macam satu</malay> cake
[ah] then <malay>kita</malay> celebrate <malay>untuk hari ni dengan esok gitu</malay>
(mm) so like that better right
(mm)
ya ya correct correct
they have they do have
why not
(uh) <malay>kita</malay> picnic <malay>kat</malay> west coast <malay>ke</malay> east coast <malay>ke</malay>
marina <malay>ke</malay>
(err)
ya [lah] marina is nice [ah]
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(err) whatsoever [lah] <malay>payung besar sudah</malay>
(mmhmm)
splash
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
actually right I got saw that time inside a website [ah] I not sure is it at west coast <malay>ke</malay> east coast
<malay>yang dia orang ada buka macam khemah besar</malay> [tau]
<malay>macam khemah kat dalam ada</malay> sofa <malay>ada macam</malay> I think it's sofa ya
I think that one is quite cheap also
because (um) that time I saw a youtuber
<malay>dia orang buat</malay> (uh) <malay>ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira macam tempat murah-murah</malay> [lah] <malay>kat macam</malay>
<malay>yang kau boleh ni</malay> [ah] <malay>kira boleh</malay> chill chill <malay>dia orang cakap</malay>
<malay>sekali aku tengok</malay> [eh]
<malay>aku cakap</malay> [eh] not bad <malay>siak dalam ada ni</malay> [eh]
<malay>kira macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>ni</malay> [ah] <malay>dia orang tengok ada</malay> table <malay>kecil aku tengok abeh lepas tu</malay> sofa
[ah] <malay>itu betul-betul khemah khemah macam khemah besar</malay> so if raining <malay>dia orang cakap kau tak payah risau</malay>
ya ya ya ya ya ya
this I say go something like this [lah]
ya I say instead of that one right so this one also you can make a party right
[ah]
but this one if like that we can is it we can overnight or cannot can right overnight
ya
that's why
this is what I saw and I say why not right because this is quite cheap you know
if I not wrong is sixty dollars
or eighty dollars if I not wrong
but if you find the biggest one that one the whole family can share
[ah] so maybe we can go for that one [ah]
(mm) so everybody can go inside there so
you can see you can see me I can see you [ah] so we no need to go for separate rooms [what]
if hotel we need to go for separate room then after that we need to pay more money then if you go chalet also
we in separate room cannot talk [ah]
cannot gathering [ah] cannot make side illegal gathering
[ah] cannot gossip [ah]
so at least at least [lah] (mm) so if you think that is my good suggestion then maybe you can go for that [lah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
but (uh) morning I want to do some activity you know like rock climbing <malay>ke</malay> zipline <malay>ke</malay> if
have [lah]
or maybe we can go cycling ya over there we maybe we can go cycling right
I'm not sure who can't cycle [ah] I not sure
but they can (uh) ride on the bicycle right
they got family bicycle because our cousin got children right
so they can rent the
the one that family
ride together so
the mother and the father
ride the daughter no need to ride [ha]
ya
so I think better right
because if we cannot do rock climbing or we cannot do zipline at least we can cycle we also long time no cycle right
maybe this is the best best part [lah] that we can do
[ah]
maybe we can plan saturday morning
(mm) no maybe afternoon
[oh] ya because actually we don't want
(um)
we don't want
<malay>abang</malay> to (mm)
take off day on saturday right
because we don't want to waste his time to so we need to wait for him to come back right
so ya
(mmhmm)
the next morning we go cycling
[oh] over there if I not wrong got burger king [eh]
if I not wrong
if it is really at east coast right I think is much nearer to our cousin [ah]
ya that's why
but I think (uh) over there we can use barbecue pit or not I also not sure [ah]
(hmm) maybe we can search everything
(um)
inside the
google
you can search what more activity that we can do over there
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I don't like to roller blade [lah] actually right I want to go snow city you know
but everybody say don't want to see [seh] don't want to go snow city say boring boring boring the I say okay [lah] nevermind [lah]
you want to go the I went to go ice cream but nobody want to go with me
!alah! !huh!
nobody want to go with me then I see just forget it [lah]
like that [lor]
maybe if can why not we go right
but actually snow city correct [lah] it's boring [lah] because you need to play the slide slide only
because that time when I school time I got go right
but <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>tengok macam mana</malay> [ah]
ya very very cold
(mmhmm) ya you need to wear very thick clothes
ya they give you glove
of course
because that time I go with school right it's a school activity so everything have been paid
before we even go for the event
ya
yes correct it's very dirty
ya
correct
!wah! we die
(mmhmm)
ya
but zoo is so boring
that time remember go on our birthday april is like so boring
you can't even play with the animal
ya I want to play with the monkey
then I want to touch the lion
but I didn't get to touch the lion this time
last time when I small at least I got to touch you know
lion
that's why
so it's a hot day man nowadays also it's a hot day
if like I !aiyo! if I go there [eh]
<malay>nak buat apa</malay> [seh]
(mm) confirm like <malay>macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>panas terik</malay>
[ah] <malay>lepas tu tengok-tengok binatang berpeluh-peluh lagi lepas tu ketiak semua nanti basah</malay> !aduh!
right that's why
so I think we should
plan properly [ah] if we really want to go for activity
ya
obvious [ah] they going to bring their children because nobody going to take care since
<malay>mak</malay> [kan] <malay>tengah sakit</malay> also right so
maybe <malay>dia orang</malay> <malay>akan bawa</malay> [lah]
<malay>takkan tak bawa</malay> [kan] <malay>gila tak bawa</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia orang pun</malay> [kan] <malay>tak boleh tak boleh hidup tanpa anak dia orang</malay> [kan]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
ya [lah] I think (um)
confirm <malay>kalau</malay> shopping <malay>kita punya</malay> cousin
<malay>adik intan mesti memang suka suka gila</malay> shopping
especially <malay>kalau dia tengah ada duit dia memang suka</malay> shopping shopping <malay>tak habis-habis</malay> shopping <malay>baju baju baju</malay>
<malay>baju</malay> [ah]
<malay>gitu</malay>
so <malay>aku rasa</malay>
maybe [lah] <malay>kita</malay> just go with the <malay>yang pergi berkelah tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>lagipun kita dah lama</malay> [seh] <malay>tak pergi berkelah</malay>
<malay>betul tak</malay>
[a'ah] [seh] picnic picnic picnic <malay>tak</malay> picnic picnic
but I think your <malay>abang</malay>
will love it okay will love it

but you know like this kind of
[ah] <malay>tempat</malay> sometimes especially weekend
always have (uh) family gathering [kan]
so I think like <malay>kita nak kena</malay> book
(uh) <malay>ni cepat sikit</malay>
(mm)
if not <malay>kita terlambat kita tak dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>tempat</malay>
maybe some of us <malay>ke siapa-siapa kita boleh pergi dulu</malay> so at least
<malay>tak kisah</malay> [lah] <malay>siapa sampai siang</malay> [kan]
<malay>kalau sampai siang</malay> at least <malay>kita ada tempat</malay> [tau] <malay>ada tempat</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita dah</malay> book <malay>untuk berapa orang</malay>
[ah] so at least <malay>dah ada orang</malay> [tau]

<malay>jadi tak ada orang boleh ambil</malay> [ah]
they
ya but you need to book also you know
[a'ah]
you never know sometime
people want to walk inside !alamak! inside your tent

so that's why that's why I <malay>cakap yang ini</malay> I <malay>rasa lagi kita boleh</malay> save
<malay>kita dah kita bawa daripada rumah benda yang boleh</malay> pack
<malay>semua</malay> pack what I think is
better rather than <malay>kita bawa satu-satu gitu</malay>
then <malay>bawa banyak pinggan</malay>
it's better that <malay>kita bungkus bungkus satu-satu</malay> pack
so <malay>bila tu kita tinggal</malay> pass [jer] <malay>kat</malay> <malay>semua orang</malay>
so <malay>dalam</malay> everything <malay>kita boleh letak</malay> but like <malay>macam dia punya</malay> side

<malay>nasi letak dua bungkus tu</malay> [ah] <malay>letak penuh-penuh</malay>
<malay>jadi kita tak payah ni ataupun letak satu</malay> tupperware

<malay>kita boleh minta tolong abang ke kak nani</malay> obvious [ah] <malay>dia tak akan tolong dia mesti kata nak tidur</malay>
(hmm)
[oh] but <malay>abang</malay> also <malay>nanti dia</malay> tired the next day <malay>abang kerja</malay>

<malay>nasi kita letak dekat benda tu</malay> that's why I <malay>cakap terus nanti boleh buang tak payah ni</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>kita letak dekat</malay> tupperware <malay>jadi kalau kita letak dekat</malay> tupperware
<malay>tak payah ni</malay> so <malay>kita boleh buang</malay>
so you want to use everything all the same [ah]

!wah!
the whole <malay>kau punya ni</malay>
[ah] rides <malay>kau pegang</malay> [jer] <malay>barang-barang tu</malay>
I think it's better actually I thought of
confirm <malay>kalau semua goreng</malay> confirm <malay>kau akan rasa bosan</malay> [kan]
so I want to cook
(uh) something like maybe <malay>lemak cili padi ke apa</malay>
<malay>tak payah</malay>
<malay>letak</malay> so <malay>kita ada kuah dengan ni</malay>
<malay>tak payah</malay> [eh]
<malay>roti</malay> sandwich yes
of course we have
no need [lah] #kimbap# #kimbap# no need [lah]
(mm)
I think
<malay>apa yang kita perlu ada</malay> since <malay>ada</malay> event [kan] sandwich of course <malay>kena ada</malay>
so (um) that's why I <malay>cakap</malay> at least I <malay>nak letak satu</malay> dish
so <malay>bila ada satu</malay> dish <malay>tu</malay>
[kan]
at least <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>lauk macam</malay>
<malay>macam kalau kau makan mi dengan</malay>
<malay>lauk kau cuma goreng-goreng</malay> [jer] <malay>kau akan rasa macam bosan sebab semua goreng</malay>
so at least <malay>kalau ada lauk sikit</malay> because
<malay>kau makan apa-apa pun kau mesti nak ada kuah</malay> [kan]
that's why I <malay>cakap</malay>
so at least I <malay>nak buat yang lemak cili padi ke apa</malay> [ah] something like that [lah]
ya like what I say maybe I <malay>nak buat yang tu</malay>
<malay>lemak cili padi ataupun</malay> I <malay>nak buat</malay>
(uh) <malay>sambal goreng satu sambal goreng</malay> <malay>satu lemak cili padi</malay>
<malay>sambal goreng</malay> is for mama because mama vegetarian
<malay>kita kena fikir nanti</malay> mama <malay>cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>sana ayam</malay>
[eh] <malay>sini ayam</malay>
<malay>abeh sini sini pun ayam abeh aku punya mana</malay>
ya we also need to remember [eh] <malay>kita kena beli</malay> (uh) vegetable ball
<malay>dengan apa</malay> tofu mushroom [ah]
some kind of this kind [lah] (uh) <malay>yang kita kena beli</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal kita</malay> bring along mama [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)

ya
(mmhmm)
you want to buy <malay>mi</malay> [eh] buy <malay>pula</malay> you want to <malay>masak mi hoon ke mi goreng</malay>
I think <malay>mi hoon goreng</malay> is better right because we got a lot right
so at least we can save [lah] save a bit
like over there (mm)
so you want to cook <malay>nasi goreng</malay> is it
how about like this
so you want me to cook the <malay>nasi goreng cina</malay>
I <malay>masak nasi goreng ikan bilis</malay> [lah] <malay>ada ikan bilis sedap sikit</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>ikan bilis itu</malay> [lah] that is what I mean
<malay>nasi goreng ikan bilis pakai ini</malay> [pe] is <malay>warna putih</malay> [what]
(mm)

(uh) okay maybe that is the good idea [lah]
okay so you help me <malay>nanti potong-potong ayam</malay>
we <malay>potong</malay>
ya you <malay>potong ayam</malay>
so <malay>pasal</malay> I <malay>nak masak lauk</malay> [pe]
(mm)
<malay>abang suruh potong</malay> hotdog [ah] <malay>nanti</malay>
<malay>dua</malay> packet <malay>cukup tak dua</malay> packet <malay>tak cukup empat</malay> packet
<malay>empat</malay> packet [lah] [eh] <malay>empat</malay> packet
but one thing I don't like is because I <malay>punya</malay> cut [eh] of hotdog [eh] is different
<malay>memang aku punya</malay> is like <malay>memang</malay>
slide slide (uh) ni <malay>apa</malay>
slice <malay>dia macam</malay> diagonal is it
diagonal [kan]
[ah] so
<malay>aku tak nak</malay> [lah] macam
<malay>kalau yang ni kecil besar kecil besar</malay> because
<malay>aku punya orang</malay> is very particular about <malay>dia punya</malay> size <malay>kalau boleh aku nak buat tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau aku buat macam mana dia orang ni kalau suruh masak pun susah</malay>
[ah]
sandwich <malay>lagi aku tak suka nanti senget macam bersepah</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> especially sandwich <malay>ni aku tak suka</malay> very particular [lah]
[oh] <malay>takpe</malay>
<malay>kita buat macam ni</malay> [jer] <malay>apa kata kita buat</malay>
[ah]
egg tuna sandwich
so <malay>sebelah sapu</malay> tuna [lah]
<malay>lagi sebelah kita letak</malay> egg [lah] egg mayo [lah]
[ah] <malay>jadi bila</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia jadi sedap</malay> [tau] [ah] I think this already good [lah]
so <malay>jadi dia orang tak ni</malay>
<malay>jadi dia orang kalau</malay> at least <malay>dia orang</malay> spread
[ah] <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ni sangat</malay> [kan]
<malay>sayur</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal apa kalau sayur</malay>
<malay>tu yang aku tak nak dia orang buat kalau letak sayur nanti bersepah dia orang buat</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
no
ya because they don't really know <malay>macam mana nak letak</malay> [ah]
<malay>kau pun tahu</malay> [pe] <malay>aku kalau buat</malay> sandwich <malay>aku</malay> very particular <malay>aku nak</malay> make sure sandwich <malay>dia nampak</malay> <malay>cantik</malay>
[ah]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
so <malay>beli yang ada cili punya</malay>
you know <malay>itu baru sedap</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(ugh) [oh] that's so much work [ah] you need to do [ah]
so the crust <malay>apa awak nak buat ke</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
I think maybe <malay>kalau macam gini</malay>
since <malay>ada</malay> sandwich and <malay>ada ni</malay> then <malay>kita nak beli</malay>
(uh) since
like that right I think (um)
fishball <malay>nak letak ke</malay>
<malay>ke tak payah</malay>
since (uh) mama <malay>tak makan</malay>
so why not we change it we just (uh) buy everything (uh) veg veg also quite nice [what]
mushroom ball
(mmhmm)
ya nugget fried chicken [ah]
that is what we going to buy [lah]
actually I want to cook fries also
so at least <malay>kita boleh buat</malay> cheese fries
[oh] ya correct because we don't want the food to be soggy right
if not <malay>nanti sampai sana semua dah</malay> taste not nice ya
(mmhmm)
yes instead of
(mm) correct
(mmhmm)
ya [lah] like what we suggest
<malay>kita nak beli</malay> mat <malay>yang dua</malay> dollar <malay>tu</malay>
ya
that one also better right
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun fikir-fikir juga</malay>
but I think this is already nice planning [ah]
that's why
but make sure [lah] this time round happen [lah] [eh]
because when we plan like what <malay>abang</malay> say when we plan every time
<malay>mesti tak jadi</malay> [seh] everything <malay>tak jadi tak jadi</malay> !huh!
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya that's why
correct correct
(mmhmm)
(mm)
I think why not we just buy a dress for <malay>kak nadiah</malay>
then for <malay>abang</malay> (uh) <malay>kita beli kasut</malay> [jer]
at least <malay>baju</malay> [kan]
cause I think
she really need <malay>baju</malay>
since <malay>dia tak habis-habis cakap kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju kakak tak ada baju</malay> [kan] [ah]
so I think better right my suggest better right
(mm)
but I know she like denim jacket also
ya why not [ah] buy denim right
denim means <malay>kita</malay> lump sum [pe] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> sharing [what] <malay>duit</malay> share right so <malay>beli satu</malay> it's considered cheap [what]
<malay>kita beli kat</malay> uniqlo
event

but since <malay>kita nak pergi tu kita kena</malay>
<malay>bawa baju</malay> extra [lah]
(mmhmm)

(uh) at <malay>ibu cik</malay> house [lah] the difference right
(mm) okay so now you still working there
then now now what
why experience [what] you pack
but is it fast paced job
so how long did you work there
one week and then you cannot <malay>tahan</malay>
(uh)
it's just too fast paced [ah] <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
ya one day <malay>berapa</malay>
as in one day ya numbers of packs to pack
one thousand
two K [lah]
(mm)
!wow! not bad [ah] you
do you know you know in cause I did packing job also but the best
(uh) the best position is which one or not the first one
means right you are in the in the emtire human line
if you are at the first first person [ah] then <malay>paling senang</malay>
cause all you have to do is just
then the rest all just need to catch up [what]
[ah] [kan] so if you are the first person it's the easiest job [ah] but quality check a bit hard [ah]
quality check and need to <malay>buat cepat cepat</malay> then that's crazy [ah]
I did for foreign workers so we pack for we packed food for the foreign workers at the dorms
and that was crazy and tiring also because
<malay>macam</malay> from
(err) we start at about nine [kan] then we need to
pack for [eh] no we start at about [oh] <malay>macam lapan setengah</malay> then <malay>lapan setengah</malay> all the way until <malay>pukul dua belas</malay>
you stand and then you pack that's all and then you pack damn fast
so I usually need to scoop the [ah] the rice is either you
(uh) scoop the <malay>kuah</malay> then after that you #kiap# the container then you
then total the whole day must I don't know what's the target [lah] but ya it's a lot
it's a lot and tiring and
and smelly because you're in the kitchen
[ah] pack <malay>kat</malay> kitchen [ah] so ya the food is already ready and
sometimes you'll injure yourself because <malay>panas</malay> [lah] then when you #kiap# the container then you also will #kiap# your finger [lah]
bla bla [lah] then lepas <malay>balik</malay>
when you take the bus home you'll be like the most smelliest person [ah] so ya cause you work in the kitchen ya it's damn tiring
<malay>kat mana kat</malay>
the industrial area at #Woodlands# there [lah]
(mm) so they needed manpower (uh) so they asked manpower from my company so so ya [lor]
(mm)
yup my current company [lah] so this this this the the the the workplace that I work for
I mean the the packing place <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>kerja</malay> is (um)
has good networks with my company and so they asked manpower from my company
they they pay us then we help them [lah] (mm)
(mm)
ya [lor] so that's why I when I ask you how how was your experience for the packing I understand [lah] what it means when you say fast paced
express <malay>gila</malay> [lah] especially when you do quality check how to quality check <malay>cepat cepat</malay> [seh]
so that's how tired you are then now <malay>kerja apa</malay> [seh] <malay>kerja malam</malay>

you and Andy on InstaStory
that's why <malay>selalu macam</malay> spend time <malay>sama sama</malay>
<malay>dia pun</malay> holiday <malay>ke</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay okay
[oh]
that's why you guys spend time together
(mm)
ya that's why that's why <malay>macam selalu</malay> when I see your InstaStory <malay>macam</malay> [eh]
Andy Andy Andy but then got one time no Andy at all
<malay>kenapa</malay>
<malay>apasal</malay> [seh]
[oh] I mean
[oh] <malay>gitu</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mata merah</malay> [ah] <malay>kirakan</malay>
like jealous <malay>ke</malay> like [oh] I have a boyfriend but you don't like (err)
[oh]
but you always prioritize your work from what I see also
you I think you know how to balance so they have no say
ya ya ya it's how but good thing Andy <malay>faham</malay> [lah] that's the thing
understand each other
meet <malay>tapi masih berbual</malay> [kan]
like on Whatsapp or at least <malay>berbual</malay> on the phone
good [lah] good [lah]
(mm)
not talk
(mm)
well good [lah] good [lah] at least
in in this relationship the two of you
<malay>kau orang dua faham</malay> each other the needs and the the wants
ya so when you guys have your free time then spend as much as possible
<malay>bagus</malay> [ah]
ya how long already [ah]
what
three years
not bad [ah] three years [ah] this is this the longest
(mm)
I actually forgot who is he but ya I understand
okay I cannot recall
I okay okay I think I remember I think I remember
ya never mind focus on this one now
ya
okay [lah] actually I don't know if you realise anything on my Instagram though
ya what assumption did you make any assumption yet
but did you like did you come across anything
you are my close friend right
ya [lah] because his side he don't make it he don't
show it <malay>dia punya orang dia tak tunjuk tunjukkan</malay> so
(uh) his type is he don't show either his relationship side or he only show more about his his own life
which doesn't really involve me so ya (mm)
ya so sometimes when I see you and Andy I'm like !hais! [eh] cause at least sometimes Andy will show about you then you will show about Andy that kind of thing
wait besides that point anyways that's not the issue the issue now is <malay>macam</malay>
(err) me and him are dealing shitty stuff now [lah] so ya
together and individually so <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] let's say [ah] so [ah] cause <malay>sekarang dia</malay> [dah] right
do you know what he's working now
(mm) you have no idea you never follow him on Instagram [ah]
[oh]
[oh] that recent stories <malay>dia tak</malay> appear [lah] that kind of thing okay okay
cause [ah] <malay>dia sekarang</malay> work as financial adviser
you know what is that you know right
insurance agent ya so he's an insurance agent
so under but (uh) under there's a sister company called
so (err) basically how to plan your how to spend how to plan your finance according to the muslim shariah law
(mm) so okay [lah]
(uh) you ask me <malay>kenapa dia kerja ni pasal</malay> one day he was just scrolling through Facebook
and he saw a job ad then he just tried to apply and <malay>dia dapat</malay> [ah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer]
[ah] so so he invest I mean he he work on it until he reached to a point that he already is a certified
so <malay>sekarang dia boleh</malay> go around he can come he can go to you he can go to anybody and start selling insurance or any plans
(mm) so that is his career so his career now [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
cause once you
to once you join a full time job you will surely meet new people [kan]
ya so you will meet new people of many of different ages (uh) different character
(uh) gender and everything else so <malay>macam</malay>
okay [lah] I get his point where I get where he's coming from
so (um)
so he was telling me all these then he said okay so
I
<malay>kita</malay> is fourth we're this October we're coming the fourth year already
fourth year in the relationship
ya ya so [ah] so <malay>macam macam mana</malay> [eh]
okay so suddenly actually this thing doesn't only happen once during his <malay>pun pernah</malay> happen I don't know [eh]
so <malay>macam</malay> this thing happen for the third time already
okay so okay [ah] now I explain to you what happen
so (uh) basically <malay>dia dia bilang</malay> me Hans <malay>punya</malay> type <malay>punya orang</malay> is <malay>dia</malay> he's very honest
so <malay>dia jujur dia akan bilang apa apa</malay> his <malay>perasaan</malay> everything to me
so he was being honest about his feelings so he was like telling me [ah] [oh] (um)
he wants to to what is it called he wants to
he don't know if this is what he wants because he wants to explore
so at first <malay>bila dia cakap macam gitu</malay> I thought
explore means he wants a bit of freedom
like (uh) means like me not disturbing his work or me not disturbing when he
go out and hang out with his friends if he want to hang out go and hang out that kind of thing I thought that was it you know
<malay>tapi</malay> it's not explore means <malay>dia nak</malay> explore <malay>dia nak jumpa orang baru</malay> without feeling (err) bad
get it so means [ah] means [ah] like for example I'm Hans and
you are the first the new person that I met right
then I don't want to feel guilty talking to you
ya without at the back of my mind thinking about #Lina# that kind of thing you know
ya so
so
okay so I told you this is not the first time it happened this is the third time it happened the first time it happened was during his
his <malay>dia ada</malay> group of volunteer corps do you know what is volunteer corps means you volunteer for
[ah] so that is the first time it happened
so when he met new group of girls then <malay>tiba tiba dia macam</malay>
!wow! <malay>macam</malay> okay sure
then that's the first time it happened when it first time it happened okay [lah] <malay>sakit hati tu sakit hati</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> at least
[ah] it
it it did hurt me but it was the first time so <malay>macam</malay> okay first time let it go that kind of thing
so the thing is he
that when the first time it happened he actually talked to someone
already and actually like like want to know her even more
ya but that someone that lady <malay>dia macam</malay>
not interested [lah] because that girl also have a boyfriend
no is (err) volunteer corp
yes means you volunteer for
[ah]
so
okay so when it first happened I take it like okay never mind
okay I do have my emotional (uh) breakdown [ah] I mean mental breakdown and shit for the first time it happened
then okay done done done done life go on as per normal then second time it happened still during his
<malay>dia macam sampai berbual</malay> on <malay>dia macam</malay> my no [ah] like
<malay>memang dia</malay> they know each other on phone I mean they know their phone numbers so
Hans until talk to her on the Whatsapp [lah] like
like made a move [lah] <malay>macam</malay> message [lah] message the <malay>perempuan nak nak</malay> know better
so first time it happened okay
okay people might say it's cheating [lah] but but but but
I don't I don't take it because he is telling me what he's doing
that's the thing
okay so when it first time it happened okay I let it like okay let it pass
then it happened for the second time
correct [a'ah]
so during is also volunteer corp also
but this time around he haven't made any move he wants to make a move but he tell me
<malay>kelakar</malay> [kan]
[kan] (uh)
ya
this is what I'm trying to say [lah] don't know why until I hold on until today
so the third time it happened which is now this period it has been three weeks already
the third time it happened nothing has happened yet
it's just <malay>dia punya tiba tiba</malay> the way <malay>dia layan</malay> me the way he he behave around me change
<malay>macam</malay> in terms of not good [lah] <malay>macam macam</malay> he he he he tell me things like (err) I want to explore he don't want to feel
like limited talking to new people
get it because in this in <malay>dia punya</malay> line of job <malay>dia akan jumpa</malay>
<malay>jumpa orang baru</malay>
especially in his workplace and stuff and plus it's his first so called first time meeting a group of ladies get it
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] ya [lah] professional that part it is [lah] but at the same time <malay>dia nak</malay>
know more about people get it and he thought he he basically said this to me he said that what if
he found he he will meet somebody that is (um)
(err) way better than me that kind of thing
ya of course then he said to me you are already the he said this to me the benchmark is you
so the benchmark let's say [ah] this is me [ah] this is the benchmark so he wants to see if in this world
at any point of time in his life <malay>dia akan jumpa sesiapa yang</malay> better than me that kind of thing
I said that thing <malay>tu juga</malay> I said <malay>macam</malay> I I say to him [ah] I also can say the same thing to you [what] but I choose to focus what is in front of me
I said that to him then he say ya correct but what if the thing is
his so called
reason or intention is he don't want to regret later he want to regret now he wants to make the mistake now
<malay>faham tak</malay>
let's say if I leave like for example
if I leave him
will he feel regret and he will he be able to meet somebody that is better than me that kind of shit [lah]
so ya !hais!
no I don't know because
from the start of the relationship I got even I <malay>pernah bilang</malay> you [what] <malay>bila kita nak</malay>
together remember we had this night calls
I tell you that Hans really want this relationship to to end up (uh) like like a real thing
then now this get it
ya so this is the gist of the entire story
that's why I'm like so tired of this emotional breakdown almost every single day
but then then if you ask me [ah] if you ask me now why are you still with him
then I I then I will reply you I also don't know
so ya [lah]
like that's why when you things like (uh) on Twitter will say this and that right you you wait sometimes you need to leave you you need to let go of the people that you love
eventually but it's so hard for me to let go
[ah] I've invested so much
on him time
thinking thoughts and shit don't know [lah]
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] I mean you <malay>nak</malay> comment <malay>pun</malay> comment [lah] because honestly
this thing has been almost like it has been
like a month like almost a month
ya and there's no there's no end to it <malay>macam</malay> there's no conclusion there's a closure there's a closure in terms of how we feel
but conclusion <malay>macam</malay> do we still want each other do we still want what we have or do do do do do you still want to go on with like endless
ya so so <malay>macam</malay>
that's why I was I was quite impressed with how you Andy are together even though you are very busy you still can still go back to each other
for me and him we are too dependent on each other that that now he want to do his own thing
the thing is he can but I cannot do on my own thing because I'm already
I've already so called shaped my life around him get it
<malay>macam</malay> okay
<malay>macam</malay> dependent [lah]
not exactly [lah]
<malay>bukan macam</malay> okay so
I don't see
I don't see other things I don't see other parts of my life without him get it
ya [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> my end goal in this relationship okay let's say to get married and stuff
is I don't have my own like self goal
okay
I got my own goals but like again it revolves around him that kind of thing
so it's
it's stupid [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay>
yes sure up to you you can go ahead and share
(mm)
(mm)
but you you do try to recover after that right
(mmhmm)
(mm) [ah] that's the word make up
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay> [lah]
ya [lah]
cause that's how you begin the relationship also so
[kan]
<malay>dia belum</malay> [kan]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay> [lah] but at least now <malay>kau orang</malay> at least <malay>ada ada</malay> so called same goal in the relationship right
(mm) (mm)
with him
(mm) at least at least a goal with him [kan]
ya
now is we used to now is
no goal
get it <malay>macam</malay>
we like I say to you we we
we agreed on one goal which is next year maybe
late next year or early early next two years to get married now is like (err) am I getting you for nothing that kind of thing
ya
ya it gets to that extent so
so at least you have a goal okay maybe for you and Andy it's not marriage maybe it's to travel together first
to know each other better maybe I don't know but
for me now with Han is really <malay>macam</malay>
a total switch a total change of goals which is now <malay>tak</malay> match
ya so now I'm just like
(uh) like that ya so
I'm taking day by day but really I feel that at the end of the day maybe
I don't know [lah] I really don't know I don't know whether <malay>kita</malay> are compatible or what already [lah] because <malay>dia memang</malay> [dah] ada</malay> other mindset <malay>juga</malay>
I
met his parents
spend time yes <malay>tapi macam</malay> other stuff to talk about the future no [lah] because <malay>dia punya</malay> parents obviously is supportive of Hans
his parents still thinks like you don't have to rush into things and stuff
ya so
at the same time Hans' father also said don't make her just like a
like a like a person like like a <malay>gundu</malay> like that <malay>tunggu macam macam</malay>
<malay>macam badut gitu</malay> but the (uh)
!haiya! ya [lah] the thing is
the thing is if you if you ask me
if you ask me whether I'm hurt and stuff
it has been weeks already [ah] so if I cry now also <malay>macam</malay>
it's just tears [eh] <malay>macam</malay> really legit [sia] so <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah]
so well I'm just updating you my relationship status so <malay>kalau</malay> we ever have another family gathering then suddenly very awkward why no Hans already now you understand [lah]
<malay>tak apa</malay> (uh) it's okay not to make assumption [ah] but
but the thing is it hasn't it hasn't go to a stage where okay the thing is
<malay>kalau kita</malay> so called if we reach to a to a level where we break up right
my my type my type right
my type right is if I break up with somebody I want to cut ties with the person
obviously will you
(mm) [eh]
like
[kan] [kan] so no matter what you'll surely cut ties with him with him right
(mm)
ya so but this thing is special case I told Hans the same thing if I ever break up with you I will totally cut my ties with you then <malay>dia macam</malay> disagree [ah] <malay>dia cakap</malay>
(uh) (hmm) no he I don't know <malay>dia cakap</malay> (um) why it doesn't makes sense why can't we just (um) be friends
okay the thing is it's it's also hard to cut ties you know why
because me and him we have the same group of friends
we have the same clique we have this the same a lot of things so <malay>macam</malay>
if I cut ties it means I have to sacrifice in terms of <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> hang out and there's Hans I might
I might think twice of hanging to hang out <malay>macam gitu</malay> (mm)
so far so far during this period right
where (uh) like
I (mm) only just now I met him [lah] after like a week <malay>tak jumpa</malay>
but few days ago when my friend <malay>ajak</malay> me hang out then I asked <malay>ada siapa</malay> <malay>kalau ada</malay> Hans I say to them I <malay>tak nak</malay> join
(mm)
so ya I'm just telling you so there's no okay whatever story that I've shared there's no bad guy
in this story [lah] okay people might say it's him but at the same time
it's also me for staying because I I'm getting hurt
for no reason I could actually just leave
ya I could just leave the relationship then he can do what he wants I can I can take care of myself
recover myself but the thing is I choose to stay then now the situation is not any better
see I am aware [sia]
(err) like I don't know a week ago maybe
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> ya <malay>ini susah</malay> [ah] <malay>susah</malay>
he's
I know I understand
!hais!
!hais!
no
I want to tell but I don't know how to tell I want to tell also but I don't want to tell that kind of thing you know
but
I I hint only [lah] I hint to my mother only [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
she she sense it [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> (mm)
I don't like to tell cause I just don't want to (uh)
the group of friends <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>bilang pun macam</malay>
I think I tell only like
three people
three people from my friends and then you one then my colleague at least one so at least he knows why I'm feeling like this during work time so ya [loh]
so this issue <malay>macam</malay> I really <malay>tak nak bilang orang</malay> but
on my Instagram I think people can like [oh] okay Hans and #Lina# is no more that kind of thing
ya
ya
(mm)
ya <malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think <malay>pasal</malay> I'm just too <malay>macam</malay>
too
I have fallen for him too hard that (uh) now I cannot see myself doing other things besides being with him that kind of thing
get it
even though people can say girl you are still twenty two <malay>masih boleh jumpa orang lain</malay> and stuff <malay>tapi</malay>
I still stick I can say that I'm quite a loyal person [lah] but
ya [ah] so ya [dah] <malay>itu</malay> [jer] [lah]
that's my that's that's what I'm experiencing now so if if you happen to like see my Instastory and more to green colour right
[ah] it's just me expressing my emotions
(mm) and and now I'm trying to work on my mental health because it's really affecting it affecting me so badly
!huh!
ya it affect
<malay>kadang kadang</malay> [seh] <malay>dalam kerja</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> if I don't have any ideas right like for example if I zone out [ah]
then suddenly <malay>benda tu</malay> come in
then when <malay>benda tu</malay> come in I need to talk to that guy then when I need to talk to him then negativity kicks in then from there
it affect the whole thing then that is why when <malay>tadi</malay> you <malay>bilang</malay> me [kan] [ah] what time you sleep and stuff right
when it first happened I've been going home late from work
so I left work I left office at about twelve
twelve <malay>tahu</malay>
sometimes I <malay>habis kerja dalam pukul sembilan</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I'll just hang out talk I just like (err) but sometimes I have Zoom meetings so <malay>macam</malay>
okay I do Zoom meetings at at the office then I just chill then wait a bit more then I <malay>baru balik</malay> that kind of thing then once I go home
I'll just knockout [ah] so knockout about maybe sometimes if I decided to express my feelings to anybody or to him I'll sleep like I'll sleep as late as maybe three o'clock
but I sleep as late as three but the next day I have to wake up as early as eight so that kind of thing [lah]
so and that
that first two weeks it was the worst because it has it repeats so everyday is that
<malay>tidur pukul tiga bangun pukul lapan</malay>
then
then it affected my work in terms of productivity [lah] I <malay>lupa benda</malay> I forget things I forgot what to do and shit
and I really can see the difference legit you need sleep
so (um)
so ya but I'm catching up on my sleep already [lah] so that is good enough
(hmm) ya at least sleep at one or at least don't cry to sleep that kind of shit ya
ya
ya understand [lah]
it's okay
to nineteeth
ya I think I don't mind just hanging out at your house also make myself occupied and shit
busy
[ah] your <malay>rumah macam tukar hari hari</malay> [seh]
ya ya ya ya
then before <malay>raya</malay> I think I went to your house once also different theme then <malay>raya</malay> also different theme
then <malay>sekarang</malay>
ya your kitchen got the vine right I saw your Instastory what
busy [seh]
it's only your room <malay>tak</malay> involved [lah]
ya I can see that
but at least you got a working space [seh] that is good that's what I need [eh]
but the thing is I don't like to work in my <malay>bilik pasal</malay> wifi <malay>tak</malay> strong legit <malay>tak</malay> strong
ya (mm) me me and my <malay>adik</malay> already had this conversation but we're not doing it so ya that's all
we just need a different type of (um) router ya
because this wifi sucks you okay for example [ah] <malay>kalau sekarang</malay> you go to my house you sleep on my bed you are using your data already
ya
[kan] that's why I rarely do my work like you won't even see me do my work in my room
I always do outside <malay>kalau tak</malay> I'll just do at other places
(mm)
ya means we need an additional router right
ya because the one that we're using now is in the living room next to the
so <malay>macam jauh gila kalau nak pergi</malay> to my room
how many wifi you have at home
[oh] you have two
one is at
(mm) so you are connected to your
parents' [one]
(mm) <malay>patutlah boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>gitu</malay> ya then I need to <malay>pasang</malay> one more [loh]
(mm)
ya
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] but
it will be eventually right this is the this is the norm now also you know I
I now conduct workshops via Zoom
(mm)

I mean <malay>memang</malay> [ah] it's a show but it's too overplayed
<malay>macam terlalu</malay> drama [lah]
ya
(mm) but
(mm)
I know dan
I know it's he he
I know dan is <malay>jadi</malay> gossip girl <malay>tetapi macam tak</malay> make sense [eh] story <malay>kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku</malay>
story <malay>kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja tak ikut buku</malay>
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
ya
(mm) yes
(mm) <malay>sebab boleh nampak</malay> (mm)
ya
<malay>tetapi kalau ikut setakat cerita sahaja</malay>
<malay>dia tak masuk akal</malay>
because dan
<malay>dia macam</malay> he in one scene <malay>dia pun terjekut</malay> he was
texting quote unquote texting gossip girl so <malay>dia</malay> texting <malay>diri dia sendiri</malay> [lah] [kan]
<malay>tak masuk akal</malay>
<malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> theory is
other people were also manning the website of gossip girl <malay>boleh masuk akal</malay>
can make sense
ya or <malay>macam</malay>
but it also makes even more sense if everything that was sent through gossip girl just went up like that without filter
(mm) so the shock vaue makes sense [lah]
ya the fact
no the end result make him look like a psychopath
ya and the fact that <malay>dia dapat</malay> marry serena <malay>pun macam</malay> (err)
(mm)
I mean the
he gaslight
serena and then he talk trash about her <malay>dekat</malay> gossip girl
(mm) raccoon [lah] <malay>bapa dia pun sama</malay> [jer]
no the daughter also
no
vanessa
(mm)
but I like
#ya allah#
<malay>macam mana tak terkoyak seluar</malay>
(mm)
yes
<malay>tetapi</malay> wait <malay>dia punya</malay> part
part <malay>rambut itu</malay>
no [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> hairstyle <malay>dia kadang-kadang macam tak</malay> match
<malay>pelik</malay>
(mm) yes
[eh] <malay>dia dalam cerita</malay> star trek
[oh] <malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
what about her
(uh) <malay>siapa baru</malay> give birth <malay>tak</malay> [eh]

(mm)
<malay>sebab dah tengok semua cerita lain</malay>

[oh] ya
a bit quite boring
for me
(mm)
ya
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I mean I'm saving up all the <malay>cerita</malay> for after exams
ya
next week
(mm) <malay>tengah belajar</malay>
school is okay a bit stressful but normal [lah] [kan]
normal
if you're not on your toes means you're too comfortable what
<malay>apa dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
I know
I mean you just
you just want to know for yourself or you want to help other people
coping mechanism
yes
suspicions
I mean
degrees and diplomas they are not cheap
so <malay>nak kena</malay> make sure [lah]
<malay>kena</malay> make sure <malay>betul-betul nak</malay> yes
time dedication
don't let it be just a simple [oh]
<malay>macam</malay> interesting [jer]
(mm)
personally like based on your achievements already right you already have architecture mass comm and business
so
they can all be interrelated right you can make a business out of architecture and you can
promote it through mass comm yes
psychology is something you can take on <malay>tapi kalau tak nak pun tak apa</malay>
yes
<malay>sekarang ini bila nak ambil ini ada tak yang perlu</malay>
time <malay>duit</malay> and <malay>betul-betul nak atau setakat fikir saja</malay>
(uh) well <malay>selalunya orang cakap</malay> two out of three is okay already but I think for diploma and degrees
diploma first
still need three out of three still need time and dedication
but <malay>tak ada duit pun tak boleh ambil</malay>
<malay>ada duit ada</malay> time <malay>tapi kalau tak ada</malay> dedication <malay>macam buang masa</malay>
[ah] so you need all three
I think if you want to go for it just make sure you <malay>ada</malay> [lah] these three
(mm)
(mmhmm)
yes
<malay>perangai melayu</malay> yes
<malay>habis</malay>

that's why
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>fikir pasal duit</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang memang</malay> okay
but <malay>kalau nak ambil</malay> one more
financially taxing item can you cope or not
and <malay>kalau</malay>
(mm)
wet tissue
personal <malay>betul</malay>
nineteen
they will get the gist
why <malay>kenapa</malay>
(hmm)
<malay>nak tetapi</malay>
<malay>tetapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ambil lesen</malay>
<malay>tak nak ambil sebab nak kena ambil nak ambil sebab nak ambil</malay>
<malay>sekarang tak nak sekarang macam</malay>
<malay>nak fikir pasal sekolah</malay> so <malay>kalau ambil lesen nanti nak kena</malay> divide
exciting <malay>itu memang</malay> [lah] but <malay>sekarang</malay> I <malay>pun tak ada kereta</malay>
ya <malay>tetapi kalau tak ada macam</malay>
<malay>kalau tak ada</malay> use for <malay>kereta</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> waste of time <malay>itu sahaja</malay>
and
ya [lah] I <malay>sudah biasa sangat naik</malay> public transport
(mm)
[orh]
yes I still want to go to america I still want to see new york
even
ya and pretty much every political thing there
really just clashes with the fact that I wear hijab
yes
like before trump
if I were to go there I would still be
discriminated discriminated against just for wearing my hijab
then after trump it was even worse now is is
also very worse
ya but now is and is also still is not finished [lah] I mean
ya everything everything now is all about race in america
(mm)
(mm)
also you heard about the paris right

<malay>lepas itu</malay> I <malay>tidur bilik</malay> you <malay>apa sebab itu</malay> [lah]
you <malay>tidur kat luar sebab panas</malay>
<malay>atau</malay> you <malay>nak buat kerja</malay> I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>tingkap buatkan bilik nampak besar apa</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
you will considered it
for yourself
then there will be two rooms and so you rent out the whole thing
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) yes

okay so is actually (um) in which year [eh] you <malay>nak</malay> get married [eh
[oh] so this one is (um) actually like or you tend to move to your home first right after your wedding [kan
tru
(um) but again I thin
(err) you also have to think this if you are staying like in one year's time then you need to find a a <malay>bilik</malay> or a room <malay>yang</malay> like you actually both are more comfortable to stay with [lah] correct or no
ya [lah] correct [lah] <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> I think you you both have to think what's the budget [lah] so budget actually <malay>berapa</malay> is it a combined wedding <malay>ke</malay
(mm) okay okay [lah] then I think <malay>kita</malay> we have to take a look part by part [lah] [kan] like for example K now a wedding will come first before the house right so and (um) so basically is between like (err) in six months time can you get the new flat is that correc
ya that one agree but I think give you like certain allowance right like a number of you have to complete the basic renovation is that correc
[oh] ya [lah] that one I think normal [lah] since my time many years ago also same also [lah] the thing ya so I think (uh) ya your dad perspective or opinion I thin
quite correct it's just that I think at least if active for [lor] at least the basic must be there like for example flooring and then like painting but I think for every house the most important thing is the flooring and the kitchen cabinet at least [lah
[oh] because I think you have to that is because that's the one I think make most no
ya I think we w
if the business already there then okay there's a plus point so I think at least the renovation will be on the kitchen so if you ask me the kitchen you need [kan] <malay>macam</malay> lik
do the edit the the first bottom and then the top right you need to do first that will be cheape
that's one suggestio
ya I think that will be cheape
yes it i
for the wedding righ
(mm) I think I think in this case [ah] I think your situation is very similar like mine so I think you have to prioritise things like [ah
which one you want to cut down [ah] on the on on itself like it's like flat versus wedding so if let's say (uh) if you ask me then of course I will choose the flat [lah] because apparently like <malay>macam</malay> flat <malay>kita nak tinggal sepanjang hayat</malay> !chey! <malay>sepanjang hayat</malay> [ah
okay so basically like for wedding like ya is once in a life time bu
like I say (uh) the the most important thing is the the the <malay>nikah</malay> itself only so other the miscellaneous take photos okay that's another to me i
more fundamental [lah] but in terms of guest if let's say the other party agreed maybe cut down to two hundred fifty eve
let's say a super ya #gemod# [lah] #gemod# is like very stingy like that so basically like that we just lik
invite two fifty then maybe like you know (uh) his side [ah
hundred fifty ya [seh] hundred so that super budget kind of thing ya it can be don
like like for example I thin
ya like I say like both have to compromise [lah] it's lik
(um) family support have to come in so that's why that day you all <malay>kena macam</malay> plan budget like how much like per per side can contribute with their family already inside the picture [lah] that [one] have to be very like (um
(um) very like (uh) transparent but in the event if let's say both side <malay>macam</malay> let's say for example your parents either deal with their own ideology or plan of their wedding the
you <malay>ada</malay> your own plan of your (uh) I mean his side <malay>ada dia punya</malay> own plan of ideology then I think the only thing you have to <malay>fikir</malay> or think about i
like okay in that case we do separate [lah] that is another alternative [ah] other alternative then your side then [ah] then he has to like make a figurative speech or what figurative speech [oh] !wah! like super english like tha
K so basically like you he has to tell frankly to his side like yo
parents like okay maybe I can only afford to pay for how many guest then the rest you can absorb <malay>tak</malay> so that is another another way [lah] [kan] <malay>macam kita nak</malay> (um) try to put everything in hand [lah
so wedding time at least your side <malay>macam</malay> okay then for your side (uh) you and your family then like for use okay I can only pay for hundred guests then if your father say okay another hundred guests I can top up your father say like that then is if sometime
you may say that having a separate cost more but you will depend on the individual side of budget [eh] sometimes <malay>kita kena fikir</malay> that in terms o
the pros are I know now the trend is all combined but provided if let's say all agreed and transparent on board the costings and expenditur
this is something sensitive in even in our culture in <malay>kita punya (err) <malay>orang melayu kita macam</malay> sensitive [ah] about <malay>duit ni</malay> so I think you all have t
considered in the air because like right now both families <malay>belum</malay> sit down and really get to know each other you know even like for me and my brothe
about <malay>duit pun kita adik-beradik masih</malay> sensitive <malay>tak boleh macam</malay> [eh] just <malay>bang aku mau pinjam duit kau</malay> [lah] <malay>satu ribu macam suka suka</malay> [jer] <malay>nak minta [kan] abang</malay> you know I have to be like more tactful to u
<malay>kak</malay> are you okay if I pay down then I will I will lay down what I can afford then in at least is like more clear cut <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay
like in this case <malay>lagi</malay> the other party <malay>yang</malay> your parents <malay>belum kenal</malay> [kan] and then the breedlove assumption the so I thin
(uh) bottom line you both must tel
(err) got two choice if want to combine the
then (err) you and #hairin# you he tell his family how much he can afford you tell how much you can affor
then how much your both parents can fork out together so if let's say you [dah] sample among all again okay [lah] <malay>kita</malay> work combine then okay celebrate <malay>buat</malay> combine <malay>tapi</malay> if let's say [oh
[ah] you know [lah] I still want my one thousand guest let's say #hairin# <malay>punya</malay> side the
your mother say okay <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] based on your budget <malay>kita</malay> invite <malay>saudara mara dekat</malay> [jer] one hundred okay then you do separately because let's say his mother say okay then I will pay for tha
extra guest whereas for his (uh) no need then you [leh] you just you just invite [lah] whoever that is important between your lis
because there are two factors you need to think first (um) <malay>kita tak nak mengecewakan hati siapa siapa pihak</malay> because you all just become a new family member secon
(err) then is like you al
like want to have a fresh new beginning with a very good fit startup [lah] <malay>tak nak macam semua gaduh gaduh</malay> then after this the next time <malay>dia pergi rumah</malay
you know last time you are fortunate you actually know that you gonna have six months down the road after the wedding that you have a flat you know how my time I got my flat is so like you know like how to say [ah
like <malay>macam</malay> (err
<malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> waterfall at that I find it or even tsunami so offence already like I will just like get (err
think that time really I think I could engage in january finall
july I got a fla
and then july got a flat [ah] my <malay>kita punya</malay> timeline two years <malay>tu nak engage</malay
you know then <malay>tak tahu macam mana tahu</malay> bought flat then because [ah] because <malay>atuk</malay> said better
<malay>cepat cepat nikah dapat rumah sendiri</malay> then after that we are like [ha
then like that everything all my plan with your uncle <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] haywire all I received only fla
<malay>kita punya</malay> like dream wedding <malay>kita punya</malay> dream vacation <malay>semua macam</malay> [dah] flash toilet [jer] <malay>tu begitu</malay> [ah] so it's lik
then after that I think (um) at that tim
I I'm quite fortunate like I have support or family so like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] my father know that he will pay off my wedding expenses whereas for I will just focu
(um) <malay>makanan tapi</malay> [kan] shamefully I have to admit even I [dah] work that time [kan] I <malay>tak boleh</malay> afford [tau] because I just start my work the
and I'm about to save so like <malay>macam</malay> even like you know the bridal like you all have all these [ah] then I think I can only afford the photos <malay>begitu</malay> that's all with with my husband then I think my husband that time even <malay>hantaran nak</malay> exchange [ah
(um) I think quite I I would say I like <malay>macam</malay> drag it [lah] but I think about it because in the end like we don't really can afford even for exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> I think in the en
we buy some things on our sid
then because the the story was that that we will promise that some sustain law said okay [lah] why not <malay>kita</malay> combine <malay>kita beli dorang dorang hadiah untuk</malay> exchange <malay>hantaran</malay
then suddenly when the time come the exchange is not there so it's lik
so I buy solely whatever I can afford that's all [lah] ya correc
I think if I were you I will actually create an excel spreadsheet the reason is because I I will actually (um) pros and cons if let's say I have I have this budget okay what I know if combine I I pick let's say shortlist two place on i
then okay shortlist already know what they have you don't have the push [ah] you no need to type [ah] you just put what are the key things that are there okay how many dishes [ah] food [ah] food dishe
(uh) the equipment that include all the (err) the <malay>kompang</malay> and everything I think some weddings some packages inclusive some are not so <malay>kita kena tengok macam mana</malay> [lah] [kan] so is lik
you will you will see like [ah] how much it is can I find the similarities you have anothe
(uh) tab that we're actually for separate cost then you see the cheapest of all including the decoration the ball hall everything like per head like how much then how many dishes there from there on okay let's say vehicle K you must think of [eh] (um
<malay>orang melayu kita ni</malay> actually (err) come with a lot of (err) <malay>gotong royong</malay> even though <malay>kita tak sekampung</malay> [lah] not inside you won't believe right so the thing i
relative will still to will be okay to like <malay>macam pinjamkan kereta</malay> you know so when if you no
(err) how to say #farah# see you just like okay [lah] whatever people (uh) rent you okay [lah] something like that so if let's say like your your your parents like know like <malay>macam</malay
(uh) certain relative got this car whatever they say [eh] I #chope# your car <malay>dulu</malay> for the coming wedding can or not just ask [lah
you know or maybe like <malay>dekat dekat</malay> wedding <malay>tu</malay> you ask becaus
(uh) <malay>dulu</malay> I in this case usually [lah] people will still be alright to loan for wedding car then you just lik
(uh) we're not that chinese must be like Mercedes-Benz or Jaguar [lah] [pe] [seh] joke [ah] I'm not racist [tau] but I'm talking about culturally we no need to be like so branded indicative kind of of stereotyping that kind of thing [lah] so it was just like <malay>kita</malay> like just focu
(uh) what we collect like okay let's say if car put there possible free you know okay is to make it compatibility the same as like you are in a in the same central place [lah] then after that (uh) if plus decoration you see how much is some I think per head come with decoration simple simple decoratio
(uh) then after that from there you see we which is much better so at least when it comes when they're both families sit dow
okay because you will have to target by maybe end of this yea
<malay>ataupun</malay> early january next year you and your partner must how much you all can fork out <malay>agak agak</malay> because by that time you [dah] start your full time job okay then he already has its sort of monthly <malay>berapa</malay> one month <malay>berapa dapat</malay> sav
so basically you can <malay>agak agak</malay> already estimated amount that you can reach between end of twenty next year is what twenty twenty one [ah
[ah] so then from there [oh] then you all like [oh] okay [lah] then can start working I know you your what you're getting married twenty twenty tw
[ah] so if let's say cannot fit maybe we aim january twenty twenty three that's the worst worst timeline [lah] so that even though you got five months (uh) to your new place but actually you will actuall
like you have the time to what we call you know already you have some surplus cash ready that for you to prepare the basi
okay let's say #khatib# (uh) when you move in or maybe you need to check first because we already have the basics right so you just make sure that you have like simple lightings for some places only or you can actually have th
like (uh) the cabinet or whatever because I believe (uh) you got to check that one [lah] renovation too so you get the minima
you can even ask (err) K what's the minimum renovation I should do within that timeline because what happens if I don't have the amount to have a full renovation you can ask them all these so that at leas
like I'm pretty sure you are not the only owner like this [lah] there's a lot of new couple that are buying flat also wha
so basically is like that [ah] so that is one area that you actually ca
can save on it [lah] that is one part of it ya so ya [lah] so I think you you you ca
take I mean seriously you wedding's already a big headache if you ask me seriously big headache ya then having a new home is another big headache so it's just that now it comes one one can take care [kan
my only thing is that okay if he's (uh) you all have to like let's say workout [lah] the thing [lah] workout the thing then from there on then you will se
how is it (uh) on i
[oh] I think (uh
this one take time [lah] but again (uh) I think #hairin# (uh) or or #hairin# [lah] <malay>siapa</malay> [lah] (uh) maybe is t
need to actually like you know find the time for it for to have this share with his parents especiall
because this part I think you really cannot butt in yet because (uh) you <malay>ini</malay> [kan] actually <malay>masih macam saudara baru dalam keluarga tu</malay
so <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>nak kena macam jaga-jaga jugaa</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>yang mereka</malay> seems like okay okay <malay>tapi tak</malay> okay <malay>kot</malay
ya <malay>memang</malay> [lah] (um) to plan the wedding is not very easy so I think is one phase at a time but despite all these challenges must really look at it like <malay>macam secara</malay> positive ya so at least that <malay>macam</malay> you know what you can (um) do best within this (err
(uh) constrain the constraints of it then from there you workout on it [lah] so let's talk about happy things [lah] <malay>macam</malay> stress [jer] <malay>cerita cerita macam begini kita buat cerita cerita</malay> happy <malay>pulak dalam pasal pasal</malay> wedding <malay>ni</malay
so <malay>kirakan</malay> okay actually that time you got share with me [kan] <malay>tentang mak andam</malay> like quality of <malay>mak andam</malay
that's good actually is one advantage so she just going to spend a lot of on her coming honeymoon maybe next year there's one of her plan [lah
ya okay <malay>macam itu kira</malay> not too bad [lah] [kan] because anyway the number of guest is being cut down ya actually if you ask me if you want to make use of the pandemic als
very good if you you all like <malay>macam</malay> prepare and then both both parents are okay [ah] it's just anyway you also have time also <malay>nak</malay> save money you kno
but then you have to stay in one place for two years [lah] or in fact one year next year I think I don't think they will open for thousand people stil
ya I think still about one hundred or hundred fifty the most y
frankly speaking (err) is a good time to be use if you already have some budget even for like hundred fifty guests or hundred then if both ar
okay [kan] then at least like you know you all can have the wedding first and then after that [ah
the money surplus keep first can go for honeymoon because I'm pretty sure by that time maybe can go new zealand because (um) certain country [dah] already open [kan] so <malay>macam</malay> you can just like chill relax [lah] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak payah</malay> [lah] <malay>macam nak fikir fikir sangat</malay> [kan] then after that at the same time there's another part of money can still keep saving for one year for the house [ah] that's another advantage [lah
[ah] <malay>ini pun</malay> if let's say both side okay [lah] I know it like I think both of you you both of you I think you will like <malay>kita macam</malay> like okay [jer] like <malay>nikah</malay> is that correc
[oh] I think that part can't be helped right we all <malay>memang</malay> [lah] <malay>keluarga melayu ni mesti nak macam</malay> happy happ
know you are like can can just like (uh) <malay>kita sama sama</malay> you know <malay>ramai ramai meraikan</malay> !chey! <malay>macam meraikan ilmu pulak tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>saja mengeratkan silaturahim</malay> so I think can [lah] I think we jus
(uh) take it positively and then now do live streaming also possible what you just need to pay additional for the live streaming [lah] so there's one one idea you can hav
[ah] but now I think for now don't take it as (uh) <malay>macam sedih nak kahwin</malay> [kan] you just more like if all the all the (err) <malay>apa ni</malay> restriction constraint you just take it like what can be done during that point that point of time [lah
ya so I think for you for now don't stress too much but it's just that you all just save as much but you both <malay>kena bincang</malay
<malay>sebaiknya</malay> like what can you like save like within a month you know and then what to work on the next next month <malay>macam kena ada</malay> like your own goals [lah] but if let's say if both of you like very <malay>nekad</malay
or very determine like what you want <malay>nak buat</malay> [kan] like <malay>macam tak kisahlah apa orang nak cakap</malay> [kan] <malay>biarlah</malay> you know so basically you just can just ignore and then you all like determine what you all want to hav
(um) to prioritise [lah] then <malay>kalau</malay> let's say family <malay>kata</malay> [oh] no no no no I just want to have the big wedding you know you have to then you just sit [lah] [ah] okay option one I let go the fla
you can have the big wedding but (err) we have to burden one of the side [lah
must stay don't know until when because after that don't know how your selection because I heard once you withdraw you want to apply again can take some time if no
if not ya ya that's what I hear
then if not alternative you do the resale flat [lah] [kan
[ah] that's another option [lah] that means to get a resale flat maybe <malay>dalam</malay> three five years that <malay>macam</malay> [ah] you know our relativ
some of them <malay>ada</malay> so you can have like that or another one that you also can have like (uh) just a another second option you tell them okay I can have only this budget both of u
okay so (err) if you want to have this guest is up to your own description of expense
you know [ah] <malay>sendiri sendiri yang macam nak</malay> spend [lah] so if let's say if this side <malay>kata</malay> okay <malay>boleh</malay> [ah] can we can come out each another to ten thousand ten thousan
[ah] then okay then so <malay>semua boleh</malay> centralised <malay>atau pun nak</malay> separate <malay>itu</malay> another one [lah] [ah] because I thin
about <malay>tunang</malay> he can never be meet everywhere [lah] [kan] like <malay>macam semua</malay> happ
then that that is the fact in life I think it's very very difficult you cannot make everyone happy so I think we can only do what is the best of the situation <malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>macam boleh</malay
then okay [loh] <malay>kalau tak boleh</malay> [oh] too bad [lah] because (um) either or I think there's only some loss factor for example if they use option on
you lost your down payment of two thousand dollars from the but maybe you don't put your your your plus point you need to think about renovations you are just focus on one poin
and then (uh) so you spend lavishly [ah] your your whatever you needed to okay that but you need to spend five years three to five year
for you to (uh) come back and then apply again for another flat there is another factor [lah] okay then if there's an option two that both parties <malay>cakap</malay> okay [lah] why not we bought (uh) you know <malay>yang</malay
norms [lah] <malay>sederhana</malay> [jer] like very minimal number of (um) (err) what you call number of peopl
then after that then that's it [lah] finish okay [dah] <malay>tak ada lagi</malay> [lah] that is the the the point of it ya so that is one of i
ya ya actually but before you all have a discussion (uh) of course you separately have to talk to your own parent
then that means but you prefer you talk to your parents both of you like <malay>macam tahu</malay> okay <malay>kita ada</malay> this amount <malay>kita ada ni kita boleh</malay> prepare <malay>macam ini</malay> [ah] then [ah
<malay>orang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang mampu macam ini</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan] like it's like you know we can't be #bo# #chap# in everything <malay>sebab</malay> we just have to be like telling what we hav
on the table then after that (err) you <malay>apa ni</malay
[oh] ya then your your when both of you display what is on the table and then let them decide [lah
[ah] what they want [lah] [ah] because I thin
(err) for you both all you want is just <malay>nikah</malay> maybe take beautiful pictures go (err) nice honeymoon then [dah] <malay>habis</malay> then after that focus <malay>kat rumah</malay
[oh] okay okay <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is (err) more important than <malay>hantaran hantaran</malay> is culture <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is <malay>agama</malay
[ah] so <malay>mas kahwin</malay> is part of the (err) <malay>macam dalam dalam</malay> term <malay>dia dalam</malay> arab is called <malay>maha</malay
so <malay>maha</malay> is the compulsory amount that you supposed to provide so the amount <malay>yang kita dapat tu</malay> minimum is actually is if I am not mistaken <malay>yang kasi</malay> the minimum amount then other than that above is up to yo
[ah] you know so that is the the initial so in ya I think in don't know which <malay>negeri</malay> ya <malay>dia orang lagi</malay> emphasise <malay>mas kahwin</malay> then a gift gift <malay>tu hantaran</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi dia orang</malay> [ah] that is culture <malay>melayu kita ni terbalik</malay> [ah
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] gift <malay>tu lebih</malay> high <malay>daripada mas kahwin</malay> but right it should be another way but I think (err) <malay>mas kahwin ke</malay
(err) <malay>hantaran</malay> (err) for me [lah] I think it all depends on the affordability yes correct to have that amount is for you your parents <malay>cakap tak nak ambil</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> the thing i
even for you the amount to them is a a stipulated savings that you can have one shot for your house but I think along the way (err) sometimes <malay>rilek</malay> [jer] [lah
(err) you can have the best of both worlds [kan] <malay>jadi kita kena tengok mana yang lagi</malay> important [lah] [kan] [ah
that's why I said despite the whole thing now seems already [dah] <malay>pening kepala</malay> [lah] [kan] like very (um) you know so you you just got to <malay>doa</malay> for awhile <malay>rilek</malay> you know don't need to thin
(err) so in detail yet but at least to think okay now <malay>macam</malay> okay [ah] you know what is among all these things <malay>yang macam</malay
(err) mix up what is it like like you think that [oh] what I want to have [oh] I want to have nice photos then you just think that okay nice photos focus what photograph I want then how much budget are from it [lah
like you can because you think things that you can control <malay>macam</malay> budget photographer your brother [ah] these are the things that no need to involve family wha
like bridal studio photo or this not belong to family right even the exchange of <malay>hantaran</malay> also not belong to family so anyone want to give extra is a plus poin
but other than that [ah] if let's say for example [ah] we exchange (err) three <malay>saja</malay> [lah] item let's say for exampl
okay [ah] for example [a'ah] <malay>cuma satu</malay> I this one I don't know [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> I should have known luckily I never [ah] exchanged <malay>quran</malay> do you know that what is i
in other in one I read about in (err) on here like for example you know certain things when you exchange actually for example sensitive thing [lah
like (uh) okay so <malay>jada</malay> is common <malay>tapi</malay> [seh] <malay>jada kita tahu</malay> you will be used for (um) after marriage in when we play together but when talking about <malay>quran</malay> and something like actually you must actually reflect the whole when you <malay>hantar al quran</malay
I don't okay y
you mean the <malay>hantaran</malay
both side actually exchange gift [ah] how many you want to have it depend
[oh] <malay>duit</malay> that one that one is the <malay>mas [eh] <malay>ini</malay> not <malay>mas</malay> [kan] that one is (err) !alah! <malay>hantaran</malay> [lah] ya [lah] but some give cheque [ah] nowaday
ya I saw all my friends they give the cheque but I think now cheque they were really better PayLah PayNow [lah] no need [lah] I pay now [loh
ya correct correct so I think it can be just a symbolic amoun
or can be just a cheque amount ya that is one thing of it [lah] ya if you ask me can be cheque <malay>kosong</malay> [ha] [ha] [ha] [ha
okay what righ
cheque <malay>kosong</malay> what but inside is PayNow [leh] is direct transfe
[ah] so is all depends [lah] but again if follow tradition ya [lah] they want to see for real to sure <malay>masih</malay> cash you know you know bank not
[ah] but I think in today's context can be just lik
like a normal cheque just to display in fact if you ask me a paper also okay but <malay>mesti</malay> there's a transaction and PayNow
if not screen shot and then you se
(mm) it happens [ah] actually happens during my time also is like [oh] because they only said [lah] when you actually in engagement phase that there's a lot of challenges gaming up coming up so [ah] ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay
like you say like you know some can we stand some cannot <malay>tapi</malay> to know each other's partner is very very important so i
if let's say you know the [oh] your partner [ah] really can't afford this right so but he he he he's willing to take care of you he's willing to you know he can take care of yo
you know that means that if you have a flat together what know you all still are able to maintain its just you all need time need the time to start up or maintain so it's either two way either (um
like I said [lah] is the thumb comes with terms of agreement like either you all actuall
(uh) get the support of family either by you can stay to the other place one of the houses you know for like three to five two to five years and then we get married earlie
or you actually like (err) like both family are agreeable to have a smaller budget then all had to start out on the ne
home ya because if you ask me this term it takes a village to raise children but I always believe it takes a village to even start a hom
so I think like this (uh) family support is one factor very very important to me [lah] that's why (err) I mean culturally <malay>kita melayu</malay> is very united <malay>satu hati</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>kita</malay> you know [lah] we are lik
we always like (um) always don't forget like what to do I mean what to to help out even like with friends you know like we hear when peoples <malay>susah</malay> even like just now you say comments comments just now righ
not none of our business also [lah] but the thing is like people also like <malay>sibuk</malay> and go and go and comment y
ya [lah] she wants the opinio
[oh] it depends some some partners maybe like they do in front of you like they buy you lavishly and all that <malay>tapi</malay> out there maybe <malay>dia pakai</malay> card card card <malay>tapi tak</malay> shar
[ah] there are couples are like that like they because they don't stay in a one home under one roof right so of course there are things that you can hid
and then maybe like (err) the person (uh) then where the family said firmly talk [oh] it is a very well to do but initially it is not you know that (uh) kind of situations o
per per per person or individual like that like <malay>macam tak tunjuk</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay
(err) like no communication with their families feel like <malay>tak tunjuk</malay> or what [lah] ya so that can happen [tau] <malay>macam</malay
<malay>tak tak tak ada</malay> then why you ask me after seven years dating <malay>pun tak tahu dia ni buat apa ke kaya ke</malay> [kan] maybe all the while the guy only show up front [oh] <malay>aku ada hadiahkan</malay> best best you kno
[ah] <malay>dia bukan pun tak tunjuk</malay> kind of thing some some can leave that up staging on staging [eh] <malay>macam berlakon</malay> staging up everyday which like to me it's excruciating [ah] but some people ya carry on maybe like for example <malay>dia</malay> partner no [ah
the other party <malay>tu tak ada duit</malay> maybe <malay>tak</malay> you know not affordable or whatever but she she will ask and then she always try to give her so he thought or maybe [lah] should be okay [lah] <malay>nanti kahwin pun</malay> okay [lah] <malay>macam sekarang</malay
(um) he has so many money <malay>aku minta pun</malay> okay [jer] [ah] you know sounds like but I the end when the person say [oh] (uh) he's in debt for the wedding <malay>ini</malay> ya actually that is not the only on
I think <malay>dari zaman</malay> our grandfather they are always this occasion people last time if you watch P #ramlee# sho
[ah] lie [lah] borrow the #chetty# [lah] you know that that particular #chetty# will always just borrow lend the money to them what (um) high interest and then end up <malay>hutang</malay> because because our tradition that our culture that sometim
(err) kills the that particular portion [lah] but in this younger generation in your generation (err) things have changed progressivel
then like for example ya you you want to prioritise on this you have to have budget and so is it again like assist supporting the family [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> family understand family <malay>tahu</malay> what you can what you cannot and the
it's okay we'll like for example like a friend of mine both of them !wah! very have good job then they get flat <malay>dengan</malay> with their pa
they cannot even get flat [eh] they must buy a condo or private propert
[ah] high ceiling income but then (err) there's one period of time he changed jo
so there's (uh) about three months is like or four months ya <malay>tak</malay> start he take a break but he got ready a job to start later on so he used tha
you know that particular period and try to appeal you know [ah] and then they finally got it [ah] then but there's a word then the reaso
(err) a a very meticulous person who are very fact this or more usually this happens in a matured couple [lah] ya where the
ready above thirties then they think long term already so like when I ask you both like above ten should be able what stay in condominuim or what then they say no [lah] to think tha
I have to pay more than half a million for the house I could headache already [ah
that's why he told me [lah] [kan] so like <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>kelakar</malay> then I was like abby you all <malay>gaji</malay> seventy eight thousand [dah
like very stress then me [leh] then ho
then like let me [oh] <malay>mampus</malay> [ah] like that like that then he said no [lah] it's just tha
(uh) you know the more th
the you earn actually the more expenses we have you know like (uh) like <malay>macam peribahasa melayu apa</malay> the <malay>apa kerak nasi makin tebal makin</malay
[ah] <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] don't know [lah] there's this particular you know so basically this is the this is the part that he always remind me that [lah] which I always think [oh
okay for you maybe because your parents comes not in my generation slightly older generation so apparently like you know they have certain exception (um) but agai
I thought generation we're beyond discussion they always have a room for discussion but the thing you as
to know you usually parents [ah] whether to let go kids to <malay>kahwin</malay> I think me as a parent I will only see whether are you ready financially emotionall
you know and [ah] both ways [lah] both parties [lah] so (uh) people might say money not no money is a need when you want to start a family but did did as a parent you look at these two aspects [lah
if financially you okay then no need to be so damn rich [lah] right no need to be like so <malay>kaya</malay> or whatever you just need to have like (um
[ah] more than enough like can start [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you can pay your bills you know you can you can (uh) you can have a proper food you know don't end up like until like when you have kid
(err) want to want to buy a normal <malay>sayur</malay> or <malay>kangkung</malay
also you have enough that's a situation like that okay but you are working you know so that is the one funny part sometimes that can happen that's why I say [ah
financial planning to me is it is very important though I'm not a very good financial manage myself but the thing is at least from the mistakes I learned I share with my kids I say you al
(um) when you work you have to think is I always remind that's why like when when when my <malay>anak</malay> when all of you come to me my <malay>anak anak saudara</malay> ask me about weddin
my concept is what is your vision <malay>apakah</malay> your <malay>punya</malay> vision to achieve in building live together if your vision is to hav
okay a stable marriage a stable home then to me is wedding to have a lavish or not is secondary because bottom line you want to stable yourself you <malay>nak</malay> make sure tha
you start something that with no <malay>hutang</malay> you know because basically you you start something with <malay>hutang</malay> you got headach
I am not saying when you are together you know <malay>hutang</malay> [lah] [kan] you will have you got kids already <malay>hutang</malay> will be there bu
is not as if you are not able to pay that's the only thing [lah] [ah] because <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau memang kita ada segalanya memang</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau kita anak anak sultan</malay> #johor# <malay>ke</malay> daughters <malay>sultan</malay> daughters of <malay>sultan</malay> johor can [lah
[ah] then you anything you want or you want a lavish wedding can and you want a good honeymoon good then you want to have a very beautiful flats also ca
ya involves money ya but the thin
but the thing don't let it kill you [lah] that's why I said (err) in this case [kan] <malay>suka ke tidak</malay> instrinsic back breakdown <malay>tu kena ada</malay
[ah] introduce you must have really must have because if not [lah] if you ask me [lah] !wah! very #jialat# [lah] like every everything also must <malay>risau</malay> bu
really we really have to have to do it because if not later you have problems and then (um) you can't convince your parents lik
what can be cut down what can don't need to cut down I mean <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> convince like that <malay>macam</malay> like for example [ah] you kno
fathers [oh] <malay>mesti nak ada lima ratus</malay> okay bu
because you already give a picture you know what can be done what cannot be done then your parents [ah] okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sembarang</malay> [ah] he will come to a point like that I know my brothe
like he will come to a point <malay>apa-apa suka hati</malay> okay [lah] <malay>korang</malay> [dah] plan [kan] okay okay <malay>tak apa</malay
[ah] <malay>engkau</malay> continue okay I will I will support you it will come to that bottom lin

have you watched the the the the what the marriage
[ah] the world of the marriage it's on Netflix now
<malay>kenapa</malay>
so you watched the first episode
okay (um) for my this is my opinion [lah] [kan]
the first few episodes was good
then after a while [kan] <malay>dia</malay> (err)
it got to a point that <malay>dia macam</malay> super nonsense
the the wife is psycho [kan]
no but I (um) the the the first wife I don't know [ah] like <malay>apa</malay> motive <malay>dia buat macam gitu semua</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia nak apa</malay> revenge
yes because
so <malay>dia</malay> don't love the husband anymore
so <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> revenge only
<malay>dia apa</malay>
I don't know that's where I'm confused about like whether <malay>dia</malay> fall in love with the colleague or
did did they did she even fall in love
[oh]
<malay>habis</malay> (um) so the guy love her or don't love her the guy like her or don't like her

the #han so hee# <malay>punya bapa</malay>

<malay>ni</malay> wife <malay>punya bapa</malay>
ya
the show [kan]
the show is good you know the first few episodes was so good you know that I really want to watch I really want to keep watching and watching [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> after awhile
like merepek apa</malay>

and then they kind of felt pressured to do better so people
[oh] ya they follow the standards [eh]
I know but then why the lock
ya I locked I locked already
no it's not about the episodes it's about the way they run the show like the was so good ya the story line was so good <malay>tapi</malay> after awhile it's just so <malay>merepek</malay>
the writer failed big time
ya I know we watched it like so many times

so she went to some aesthetic clinic and then (err) she paid like few thousand she keep <malay>macam dia orang</malay> keep inject here inject there but
the problem still persists

okay
(mm)
what type of superpower I want [ah]
(err) <malay>kalau ada</malay> superpower maybe I want to be someone like maybe bat man or iron man
<malay>mana tahu</malay>
because (err) even though they have all the riches but they actually work hard to be what they are ya their superpower meaning
they use their brains than they train their body
and they learn
how to
(um)
how to fight
they learn the martial arts
okay and on top of that they modify their weapons become better and better
you get what I mean
(um) ya it's not a
(err)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>ada duit lepas tu boleh tolong</malay>
<malay>orang yang susah</malay>
(err) to fight crime
like
(err) and they don't just fight
(err) those on earth
<malay>orang pun lawan</malay>
people from
the aliens
<malay>semua</malay>
<malay>macam</malay>
both of them ya
how about you
you <malay>nak jadi apa</malay>
(uh)
(uh)
okay <malay>kalau kalau</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
bat batman or iron man
(uh)
(mm)
<malay>takpe</malay> K [ah] basically [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
superpower <malay>yang</malay> best is superpower <malay>untuk terbang</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> that that <malay>kalau</malay> if like one
specific
ability is to fly
<malay>itu</malay> [jer]
(mm)
(mm)
(err) okay <malay>juga</malay> but who has teleporting
powers
doctor strange (mm)
(uh)
[oh]
(mmhmm) harry potter <malay>betul pun</malay>
(mm)
[orh]
<malay>yang</malay> the one <malay>yang</malay> ron weasley injured <malay>tu</malay> ya that [one]
(mm)
(mm)
port key <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>yang satu</malay>
I <malay>lupa</malay> [ah] <malay>tu punya</malay> scene
<malay>mana satu</malay> [eh] <malay>tu lupa</malay> [eh]
[ah]
ya hogwart that [one] [ah]
okay <malay>kalau</malay> magic
[ah]
but a superpower a magic power is not a superpower
telepathy
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
like a burdensome superpower
I change mine to
I'll change mine to either flying or running fast <malay>tu</malay> [jer]
so that can get
from one place to another
quick
but not
but not
teleportation [ah]
teleportation boring [ah]
teleportation is boring you don't get to see the view of
when you travel there
but I want to see the view of where I'm going like let's say you want to go to the mountains you want to enjoy going to the mountains also not just be at the mountain
if I'm
you are it like night like like night train [kan] you don't take the train to just be at the top of the mountain you want to enjoy the view
<malay>untuk</malay> while you <malay>naik atas</malay> mountain
okay if like <malay>lagi laju lagi cepat juga</malay>
<malay>sekejap saja</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
okay
(mm)
you can help people <malay>apa</malay> you can distribute your money away
that's also superpower to distribute your money away to people
ya but you can help other people
no I mean you don't you already you your superpower is being rich then you can help other people
just giving away your your
your rich
<malay>tapi ni</malay> superpower <malay>bukan senyum</malay> [ah]
(mm)
(um)
(mmhmm)
(mm) but people need [what]
okay when you are rich you might not feel that [oh] money is not everything but people who are poor need the money
so my thinking is when you are rich you give away all your wealth to these people of course
not to one person you distribute to everyone meaning
when you have a superpower of wealth right means your wealth is unlimited so you can give to you can give
your wealth to unlimited people
to help them of course you don't have to give that one person one million [lah] not not like that [lah]
ya but you can help them in some ways
you know
like
like
free public housing or something for everyone who are
homeless <malay>macam gitu</malay> you know you build one condo just for homeless people in the world to live in <malay>macam gitu</malay>
no you should
(mm)
okay then
as a superhero
you can set
what you want to give
meaning instead of giving unlimited money for them to live for the rest of their life you give
the basic needs only
which is
basic needs that they
very difficult to afford food
for
food they can work for it meaning they can work to earn a living to to get food
but things like clean water deposit more difficult for them to get you know especially in certain country clean water difficult
so
you set up
a housing free where there's clean water
but bills is
let them
(err)
let them (err)
<malay>bayar sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>kira air dengan api semua bayar sendiri</malay>
<malay>tapi rumah tu</malay> maybe they difficult to <malay>beli</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>dia orang</malay>
think <malay>dapat rumah tu</malay> free
it might be a it don't have to be a very
extravagant houses
you know
those simple simple <malay>sudah</malay>
<malay>rumah</malay> just for them to live <malay>apa</malay> then after that
you enable your superpower as a person who rich you can set up jobs for them to work and
<malay>macam gitu</malay>
you know
they can be the one working at the factory that provide the clean water for themselves
(mm)
no it's not unlimited <malay>duit</malay> for yourself
it's a
power
[ah]
[ah] where you can give to people
(uh huh)
okay because most of the villains in and cartoons all have money that they use for evil
so my take is
the superhero has a lot of money
then he's using it for good
destroying poverty
poverty poverty is the evil
<malay>pun boleh juga</malay>
(mm)
but how
I think that [one] is only for yourself you know if you learn everything because
the key is if you learn something you must
pass on
what if
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
and then make it free for everyone
should you make it free for everyone or should you not make it free for everyone
then people will say that people will say that (err) no need to work [lah]
because I can just live with the with the <malay>ubat</malay> and all
just need bare minimal
then how do you decide which one is free which one is
subsidised which is more expensive
ya so you you are the one who as who's deciding then people will think that [eh] why our our
our
health care
people might not see that that way people
<malay>orang</malay>
ya
(mm)
(mm)
magic <malay>lagi</malay>
ya superhero I you say is
iron man ya
or maybe (err)
(err)
(err) superman is boring [lah] or maybe the flash
or
(err) <malay>siapa</malay> [eh]
<malay>siapa yang canggih sekarang lupa</malay> [ah]
(mm)
or maybe ant man
the most stress free
superhero
wonder woman
(uh)
cause you are as beautiful as her
okay let's talk about what is the burdensome about every single
(uh) superhero with power what is the most burdensome
what the most burdensome of her power
feminist <malay>ke dia</malay>
(mm) but the <malay>dia apa</malay> she's brought up in a feminist environment
(mm) (mm)
what's the most burdensome
not about
advantage
(mmhmm)
<malay>dia bukan tak boleh tua dia lambat tua</malay>
[ah]
<malay>mati</malay>
okay next
no no that [one] they they they are not reviving him there is a different personal clone
he's a clone
ya
it's not it's not the
ya I I <malay>tahu tapi</malay> from what I read is
someone made a clone
of the boy friend
<malay>orang</malay> clone so they <malay>tapi dia ingat macam</malay> [oh] this is actually the person <malay>tapi</malay> actually <malay>bukan</malay>
it's just a clone so I think
the person the villain who made
that clone until will be the one [lah] who will fight
wonder woman
(err) something like that [lah] the storyline is the villain made
clones of people or something like that
of like
of the people in the past something like that <malay>macam gitu</malay> (err) <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [tau] [lah]
<malay>dah dah habis</malay>
<malay>dah habis</malay> film <malay>sekarang</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekarang tinggal</malay> production <malay>lambat saje keluar pasal</malay>
<malay>dia dia orang tengah kira-kira</malay> pros and cons of
(err) letting out no
cause you will not allow a lot of people can watch at once [mah]
the box office
revenue will not be a lot
ya
yes so they <malay>dia orang takut</malay> impact
stream
(mm) video on demand <malay>ke apa</malay>
apple (uh)
<malay>lagi apa</malay> ya [lah] Netflix <malay>ke apa</malay> all those [kan]
ya right
ya
apple apple [lah] the I
games movies <malay>ada</malay> you <malay>bayar untuk</malay>
for that movie
for and you watch for a
certain period of time
(uh)
something like <malay>dia orang ada</malay>
<malay>dia orang dah ada dah</malay>
they don't have the new movies <malay>belum lagi berani</malay> [lah] go into this
they'll new movies will go into
that [one] produce by Netflix that's why they do that
but you those not produce by Netflix is those produced by Warner Brothers the they <malay>dia orang masih belum berani untuk</malay>
free
[ah]
so
<malay>macam tu kalau</malay> this [one] <malay>keluar</malay> movies
it left on movies first
before it came out in Netflix
to Netflix
that's how Netflix fund them
they go by the stream
because they know that the more streams that people watch
people are
subscribing
<malay>orang orang bayar untuk</malay> subscribe to Netflix to watch their movie
[ah] that's how they get their for themselves monthly subscription
(uh) this is how they fund their movies
<malay>dia punya tu</malay> advertisements <malay>semua</malay>
<malay>kalau dia orang buat letak kat tu</malay> people will unknowingly buy it [mah]
if they put a certain drink people will like will want to
<malay>nak beli juga</malay> I

<malay>dia tak</malay> lightweight it's very <malay>berat</malay> it's like eleven
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> (err) I like thinking [lah] whether to get or not because at first
cause at first <malay>macam</malay> there's a there's other Nuna demi grow that we wanted but that [one] like <malay>besar gila</malay> and then but that [one] can put two people in two babies two babies
your head [lah] how can you sit ya you see you see <malay>tengok tengok</malay> show me ya that [one] that [one] the the <malay>tu</malay> [a'ah] <malay>cantik</malay> [kan] that's why you you see the video it's
<malay>cantik</malay> [kan] [ah] actually <malay>dia ada</malay> another one it's called Nuna Mixx <malay>ini</malay> Nuna Mixx next <malay>yang</malay> Nuna Mixx <malay>tu dia</malay> fold <malay>sama macam ni tapi dia tak boleh</malay> shorten so <malay>dia macam dia</malay> compact (err) so <malay>yang ni yang baru ni dia</malay> compact and very
<malay>apa tu</malay> <malay>dia</malay> fold just nice [ah] and it can stand on its own and then <malay>dia boleh</malay> recline <malay>sampai</malay> [ah] lay very flat <malay>untuk</malay> baby <malay>baring</malay> ya and then <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> canopy <malay>boleh tarik sampai kat bawah</malay> the canopy the <malay>tu</malay> the cover <malay>ye</malay> [lah] <malay>bila dia tidur</malay> then like sunlight right either that or you [ah] you don't want people to see the baby right then you just cover the whole thing and then the wheels are very big
twin stroller talking about
demi grow
!huh! what
[orh] I no I I don't want to get a bassinet because bassinet only can use (uh) like zero to six month [jer] [seh] then if like
like no you use up to six months after that <malay>lepas tu dah tak boleh pakai lagi</malay>
because it's not meant for after six months [lah]
it's meant for something like that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> is heavy or probably the height or weight is not [ah] suitable <malay>untuk dorang</malay> anymore
according to the person [lah]
so I decided to take I decided not to take the bassinet kind but I'm getting a car seat so that <malay>macam kalau</malay> I want to take grab <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
it's like ya then I can just yes ya it's easier [lah]
because only grab can use (uh) if you want to take grab you need to have a car seat <malay>kalau</malay> you take taxi <malay>tak payah</malay> car seat
<malay>cik</malay> #usop# [kan] <malay>kawan abah cik</malay> #usop# [ah] what [oh] my god my toe <malay>sakit gila skit gila</malay>
my toe
it looks swollen
really
<malay>tapi</malay> why [seh] why is it even swollen [eh]
no cannot be !alah! I scared I scared it's (err) gout again [seh]
no [lah] I scared [lah] cause that time I also <malay>sakit kaki</malay> again you see already not the stroller you need to see how the <malay>dia nya tu</malay>
how it works ya you will see how how <malay>dia punya tu</malay> works I got so many things to clean
ya and then the <malay>belakang</malay> the <malay>belakang</malay> is meshed is like <malay>macam</malay> like on hot days right you can just take out the the top part <malay>lepas tu</malay> when she <malay>baring</malay> [kan] <malay>belakang dia dia boleh rasa</malay> [ah] <malay>panas</malay> [eh] <malay>apa</malay> the air and then this [one] also <malay>boleh buat</malay> like bassinet bassinet
because <malay>bawah dia punya</malay> feet area [kan] you can just snap out <malay>dia punya</malay> feet area <malay>tu</malay> then you snap back inside and then it becomes like a bassinet like that [lah]
ya
I love the colour also the colour is nice
ya ya ya ya you can you can ya ya that's one thing I like I like the handle handle bar
<malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> I also like the I like the colour of the handle bar <malay>sebab dia</malay> colour vintage colour ya and then another thing because I bought it is because <malay>dia boleh pusing</malay> and baby can face me instead
ya
ya and then like let's say [lah] <malay>macam</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay> I don't want people to see her right even though she's facing me I can bring the canopy all the way down to cover her instead but she still can see outside because when I bring the canopy down <malay>dia tepi dia ada</malay> net <malay>ada</malay> meshed so she still can see some sunlight
ya it's good I can't wait can't wait for the <malay>barang</malay> to <malay>sampai</malay> next week I think about seven days

I mean it's good cause <malay>kita dah tak larat nak cuci tangan pakai cuci tangan</malay> ya socks underwears all the small small [ah] <malay>ni</malay> [lah] T-shirt can T-shirt can but then you see [ah] if he even if he wash this [one] right maybe he can wash and then drying he go down
go to laundry mat to <malay>cuci</malay> to dry <malay>satu kali</malay> and is more saving [lah] <malay>dari dia pergi pergi bawah</malay> then washing machine and then after that you know [oh] no <malay>cuci</malay> is one thing right and then dryer another thing right so if he manage to to wash <malay>kat sini kat dalam</malay> washing machine <malay>ni</malay>

<malay>bila dia dia</malay> [ah] <malay>bila keluar</malay> [ah] when <malay>bila</malay> release
[oh] [oh] K then
but the specs (um) similar to (uh) <malay>yang</malay> which iphone
actually <malay>ada ada</malay> iphone eight plus <malay>tak ada</malay> [kan]
[oh]
but now they are still selling or not iphone eight

<malay>ambil</malay> iphone ten [ah] <malay>pelik</malay> [ah]
no what are they doing
<malay>dekat rumah</malay>
ya
[oh] (uh) today <malay>pergi sekolah apa</malay>
<malay>bapak</malay>
<malay>kerja</malay> [ah]
[oh]
[oh] so how many [ah] <malay>dua kali</malay> [ah] one week one week <malay>dua kali</malay> [ah]
[oh] then (uh) how how's your job search
then (um)
you K so like estimation by when you think you can finish the
ya
but I heard
actually now [eh] all the interview [ah]
the developer they [eh] you need to
proper other start looking in you will forget up things so the the technology keep changing right ya when it go
[ah] interview maybe <malay>yang</malay> second time [ah] second time <malay>dia orang suruh ambil</malay> this kind
this kind of coding test [kan]
[oh]
no I mean (uh) <malay>bukan yang bukan</malay> [tau] the the one at (uh) what you call that
the the you must type the code inside
that one you that one <malay>tak boleh</malay> search <malay>apa</malay> online
I think they asking the maybe they ask the approach right like how
(mm)
okay
(um) <malay>tak</malay>
so actually I I think you know right this monster dot com
[ah] I think they really keep calling you know
yesterday there's <malay>ada satu</malay> interview [eh] recruiter [kan]
it's like
what's the word [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
very pushy [ah] so like
like you know like you ask them to call back [kan] <malay>abeh dia cakap</malay> [ah] no only two minutes <malay>macam</malay> a bit annoying [ah] you know
then like the salary like they ask very low then it's like my expectation lowest is like five hundred more than five hundred dollars more than
[ah] what is the maximum [lah] the so called maximum but I think
I think better try to be firm [ah] [kan] because there's no point you find a job that is lower pay than
I mean if the pay is worse than your present job then
it's it's a bit [ah] pointless [kan]
so like
<malay>orang melayu cakap</malay> (um) <malay>jangan apa</malay>
[ah] I forgot the word lowball [ah] something like lowball [ah]
no no value [ah] [kan]
but like the destination
aviva you know aviva insurance
ya but but most
most of the job <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> !aiya! it's like contract it's not really [ah]
it's not permanent [ah] but actually because if those who no bonus then they should offer higher pay right
that is that makes sense [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> nobody will also <malay>macam</malay>
be eager to you know (um) ya
join the company like this
[ah] mostly
full time but because <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] I teach tuition [kan]
so tuition
but ya that's why
no but tuition only left <malay>lagi dua bulan</malay> [ah] until (um) october [kan] O level <malay>atau</malay> N level [kan]
so that time middle of october [kan] so called most of the exam already finish
so now is middle of august right about two more months [ah] [kan] so actually
last week I just start (um) this new student [ah] <malay>budak melayu</malay> [ah] <malay>budak apa</malay> N level [ah] N level <malay>dekat</malay> #bukit batok#
I think one or two weeks before [ah] two weeks before
but there's N level there's N level you know there's normal tech and also normal academic right [ah] so
I think the normal acad or normal I think
but I think normal tech is the earliest [ah] maybe can't remember
actually both both both about the same [ah] one week difference I think
the normal tech
!huh!
ya
no I think now they they make more centres [ah] I think they I think <malay>dia orang</malay> there's no way they can do in a big hall [what] [kan]
because like the hall
it's like a big group [ah] then people will walk past the same place right
so I think they or or maybe the hall have but then half the what occupancy is half
then <malay>yang</malay> students <malay>yang lain</malay> all <malay>pergi</malay> normal classroom [ah]
I think same time [ah] the the whole singapore <malay>mesti</malay> same time [what] <malay>kalau tak</malay> later how to know that you know
ya
so actually that's why now
if work part time better [lah] until october
I think part time got got a a lot job [ah] <malay>macam yang</malay> this (um)
<malay>kat mana</malay> [eh] (um)
data entry [lah] you know those
just typing on excel [kan] basic [ah]
[ah] office [ah] and typing or sending email those basic admin work [ah]
but part time
they say part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends must work
some some I think you see the job description [kan] is not so clear like
but how come they feel part time but then they like what one day half day half day everyday then weekends you must work or some some I think you see the job description and is not so clear lack
they said that they said (um) they said okay monday to friday the timing is (um) I think
about five to ten [ah] or four to ten like five hours [ah] or four hours
then weekends full day but they say
for part time <malay>mesti</malay> commit
(um) for two to four days a week
then when I say okay I only can do weekday then the person reply (um) sorry we need person to commit on on weekend
ya so it's unclear [ah]
ya as long like okay I think there's two right so I'm not developer [ah] so
for me best is (um) data analsyt <malay>atau</malay> business analyst
<malay>atau</malay> system analyst [ah]
like but mostly mostly also must support [ah] because my the thing I don't like is the support evac
<malay>kena</malay> twenty four seven support
sometimes middle of the night they will call I mean they call you up phone phone support [kan]
so phone support is a bit too much [ah] you know
[ah] that's why then but even if you work from home you still need to like
it's like like to me not much difference right <malay>kalau</malay> work from home then
they call you at late night and do the work or something
python right
I think python <malay>macam</malay> python for me is okay [lah] because it's a
like the code is like very simple and it's what readable [kan] it's a it's it's python programming considered high level [kan]
actually high level is the the code that <malay>macam</malay> can be readable [kan] so <malay>kalau macam</malay> if a human being <malay>baca</malay> the code
(uh) they use like they use words like can be understood then it's high level right
so like low level is what
(mm)
[ah] there's this code thing called fortran right <malay>betul tak</malay>
it's called [ah] fortran
A N ya
then what <malay>ni apa</malay> this there's this language <malay>namanya</malay> C hash [eh] <malay>apa</malay> C hash [eh] is it
is it C hash or something hash
[ah] C sharp
!huh! golac
G G O L A C [eh]
[oh] golang
but it's (um) the pace is what like <malay>dia ikut</malay> which (um) which language
(mm)
okay then
because
I don't really like to like build you know <malay>macam</malay> build all the app
building [kan]
or web development
I know how to like maybe like all these [ah] data and then maybe
a bit of support [ah] the support kind of role [ah]
because like for me last time I work in a bank [kan]
<malay>ingat tak</malay> (um) during the year twenty
twenty nineteen [ah] twenty eighteen to twenty nineteen I think ya
[kan]
that time I work in a bank [kan] so
my job mostly like [ah] then investigate [ah] <malay>gitu</malay>
so (um) laymans [kan] the back end [ah] so
you know logs [kan] you know logs
L O G S [ah] log log
okay so you just like if let's say there's a what you call that
[ah] error error <malay>dia akan</malay> email [kan] so times ten [kan] times ten
go to back end and then take everything out [lah]
then investigate maybe or something
(um) the front part is a investigation [ah]
like <malay>macam</malay> need to find the what they call it the the root cause analysis
but the it's like ticket [ah] like they say what
support and ticket and then
(uh) raise the ticket then
issue then if if you complete then they close [ah]
then last what you call that analyse [ah] whether the same issue might repeat again you know
to me it's it's quite (um) interesting or it's it's quite a
like enriching to do this kind of work but <malay>yang tak suka</malay> is the I really <malay>benci</malay> is support twenty four seven on the phone [ah]
how do they expect you call me at four right and then I can think straight and execute whatever you ask me to do right you know
for me because I'm the support so it's like
in the bank it's called (uh) run the bank [ah] not change the bank so run the bank run the bank means (um)
it means that the the app is ongoing [ah] you understand like it's not a project [ah] that means the project already finish that means it's live [ah] live product being used by users [ah]
some more actually the issue is because it's global so
you support until surpass eleven eleven countries right including america australia china (uh) all this so the timezone all weird weird [one]
so all the weird timezone means like if something happen like you know the job fail right
so time is twelve hours before us [what]
ya then their working hours until our six [what] so actually our system right is twenty four hours live you know up because off on tues [what] I think there's only one period that
the like not say down time [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
low low what low traffic [eh]
[ah] nobody use or low traffic is like singapore seven [ah] because that time that time australia all finish all the thailand all finish right japan all ahead [what] only [lah] then just wake up [what] that time
because there's two countries new york [eh] no two states
new york and where [ah] san francisco right [ah]
no don't I don't they have their own server that means the user right use the system then our server [ah]
I don't think so [ah] or maybe no china have china have but china and hong-kong have I think but
like because it's only a singapore company I mean because the bank is local bank [ah] our local bank so ya the business not so much [ah]
so it's only user use like the user
like the apply loan all this [ah] this basic functions [ah] [kan]
[oh] they call it the green [eh] green lane [eh]
but but
we cannot go right
<malay>nenek boleh pergi balik</malay> [ah] <malay>nenek</malay>
ya but somebody must handle that [what]
(um) I think <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] but [eh] but <malay>dia</malay> right <malay>yang syakilah iman</malay> is maybe [ah] I think
they can come
[ah] they they can say [ah] ya they can use the fact that their house right at #clementi# need to do something [ah] right collect the mail the mailbox [ah] because
[eh] I I think already six months they never collect the mailbox I think <malay>berlambak</malay> [ah] mail <malay>dia</malay>
(um)
but the the tenant [kan] you know the [eh] now they change tenant right that time
so the new tenant have to keep the mail [ah]
who
okay
no [ah] [oh] auntie I always just say <malay>cik cik rozi</malay> [ah] <malay>cakap</malay> something [ah]
cousins (uh)
they I think busy also [ah]
then <malay>dah</malay> you all <malay>dah makan belum</malay>
but
it's hard you know why because
I think I think the best time to cook is midnight [ah]
<malay>semua tengah tidur</malay> [kan]
you lock the door close the door
but
you will not their dog ya the dog they thought
you buy from where
<malay>tak dia punya</malay> ingredients [kan] <malay>beli kat pasar atau</malay> (uh)
!huh!
(mm)
so there's money
you mean the <malay>ikan</malay> is the the one that is boneless [eh]
it's not in the fridge [eh]
[oh]
if like this to I mean the sweet and sour fish I think
(um) <malay>mesti</malay>
fry the [eh] fry the fish first right
ya the sauce right then pour on top [kan] just just <malay>tuang</malay>
I think just but the sweet and sour you can make [ah] <malay>macam</malay> mix and match
<malay>apa apa</malay> ya like
tomato <malay>semua</malay> [ah] tomato (um) pineapple
[ah] capsicum <malay>sedap</malay> I like I like the capsicum
I think the it [ah] the the the preparation is a
the <malay>yang makan masa</malay> [ah] [kan]
nevermind you you work harder you get a new place or house hire a maid
or or hire a wife [ah] hire a wife to be your to be also a part time maid [ah]
but it's it's good if you have a maid [ah] but
for for us actually if let's say our our family [kan] <malay>macam nak ada</malay> maid [kan]
the best is we have a maid let's say let's say in the future
<malay>kalau siapa dah kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>atau</malay> like we have our own house [kan] maybe separate [ah] let's say I
or maybe I thirty five year apply for house [kan] so one maid right (um) share our #woodlands# house
they maybe my future house or your future house [ah] so then like the maid right
no I mean like one maid [ah] because like the maid <malay>tak payah</malay> just stay at one house do all the work [what] because sometimes <malay>mak ada nenek ada</malay> [kan] so maybe can
they stay no they stay there but then means then few days can stay
they can stay somewhere else [ah] like
ya I think someone call but I ignore first [ah]
(hmm)
ya
no but I think
internally [kan] if
the maid is okay then we we must <malay>bayar</malay> for the transport
and maybe give them time off [ah] [kan] <malay>kalau</malay>
I think the the maid will will have no problem to have link somewhere and then get time off [ah] right
I think it it it's not about legal or illegal [ah] because (um) as long the maid
<malay>tak</malay> complain <malay>atau tak</malay>
feel <malay>macam</malay> pressure [kan] we we like they call it give and take [ah]
don't over over work the maid [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> maid is okay then okay [what] you know
!huh!
normally the maid off sunday [kan] one day off [kan]
ya
this one maybe we can plan ten [ah] next time because <malay>bapak</malay> [kan] <malay>dah tua<malay> [kan] <malay>nanti mak</malay>
like at least like the maid <malay>boleh masakkan</malay> actually the best [kan] the maid <malay>masak</malay>
right because if the maid <malay>masak</malay> right then we just need to buy the stuff [ah] then <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>tak payah leceh pergi kedai apa kita boleh</malay> just order online [kan]
but any online <malay>pasar</malay> or not <malay>macam pasar</malay> food [eh] buy meat or chicken <malay>ada</malay> [eh]
but I mean like the <malay>betul punya pasar</malay> online maybe maybe
no because fairprice <malay>jual</malay> beef <malay>tak</malay> [eh] because beef is very hard to find right
but I think they're a bit
[eh]
but
that all means but the that means the so called the map [kan] is fixed [ah]
but what you see in the is live or not or just like a map a virtual map
virtual [ah]
ya then if the stock finish
(um) <malay>macam mana</malay> the person <malay>tahu</malay>
[oh] !wah! cool [ah]
[oh] no [oh] but means the device [kan] then the the user <malay>mesti jalan</malay> to
so call move [ah]
I think no but
I think I think [ah] Singapore difficult because you know why or not
our our house all small [what] america everything is so big [kan] I mean america everything you see <malay>dia punya rumah besar-besar</malay> or I think european some also the house big [kan]
so or they can they can go to park and then walk like someone someone mental [ah]
but the device is (uh) quite <malay>mahal</malay> [kan] I think thousands right
the but I think the hardest part I think is the interface [ah] the mapping [kan] the timing and the lagging this one is a big issue [ah] [kan]
so seven days <malay>tak payah pergi kerja</malay> [ah] just somewhere else [ah]
but they they can they will monitor your work [ah]
[oh] ya [ah] standard meeting [ah] [kan]
[oh] last time that time zoom you all also use zoom [ah]
so actually zoom actually zoom suddenly get hire more people [kan] during the COVID
really [ah]
!huh! they going to open here [ah]
ya but singapore smart [ah] I think they know how to what you call that tap into the market and then what tackle all the issues [ah]
[oh] good [ah] [ah] are you buying anything else from ikea
ikea the the food open or not [ah] now
ya
[oh] open already [ah] I don't know [ah]
<malay>itu hari cakap</malay> open the ikea but [oh] but now open [lah]
half [ah]
I think half of that
[eh] I think because I think
susah nak apa kita</malay>
[ah] predict the people [kan] because if some person couple then two or four so
so like the table they they don't know how like half is
couple or half is group and then one person
[oh] actually don't but I think this one in singapore mostly don't have you know those (um)
the long table single person eat you know right
they they call it what [ah] counter counter you know counter table right I think overseas a lot [ah] like last time I went I went exchange also same [ah] I I
because most people will eat solo [ah] because last time the lunch time is between the period right
so nobody can meet their friends to eat [what] so they just have to eat <malay>cepat-cepat makan</malay> then then just <malay>balik</malay> class [ah]
so
the counter table is like just one person [ah] then you face the you face nobody [ah] like you know face like a the wall or something [ah] so it's like against the wall [kan]
[ah] actually they should make like that
but that that time weird you know [ah] <malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa nama kedai dia yang</malay> mister you you know orchid house <malay>dekat</malay> #serangoon# gardens <malay>tu</malay>
orchid house the the indian food <malay>macam mamak</malay> [ah]
<malay>mamak</malay> food
no it's not it's like you know those it's like
<malay>al-azhar gitu</malay> those kind <malay>macam</malay> woodgrove <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
#serangoon# garden so it's like outdoor no it's outdoor but it's indoor [lah] you're it's not inside the mall but it's like those outdoor setting [ah] like like #al-ameen# at our place the the woodgrove [kan]
ya open concept [ah] like is is like sheltered [lah]
there's a indoor and outdoor then I think that time COVID
phase the first week of phase two [kan] <malay>atau</malay> I think I <malay>jumpa</malay> my friend during the phase two second week [ah] [kan]
phase two is about nineteen june [kan] so about late about twenty seven or twenty eight june I go out my my friend <malay>makan dekat tu</malay> [ah] orchid house
then
they like the the table outside is mostly like two person [ah] then the inside right all the table right is like
they close off one side [tau] that means like if you eat four persons right you all you all will eat you all will seat down side by side
<malay>pelik ke</malay> so that means there's you cannot communicate like weird [ah] [kan]
so that means like the four of you [ah] or three of you [kan] will face the same direction you know
like the they don't know I don't know what they are doing [ah] but actually they can just
you know like tape properly then [ah] section off like one table instead of six right become four [lah] you know
I mean they can do that [lah] but I think
maybe today they change [lah] because maybe someone or recommend or something if they actually doing that
<malay>mesti</malay> customer complain or next time they choose somewhere else [kan] because
because of the <malay>apa</malay> seating arrangement
or if they more than five
and some people they <malay>apa</malay> like they in a group [kan] say eight people [ah] four four [kan]
so I think recently there's a news [ah] then they like to inter change like I think they
they are together but then they sit separately but then they like can change table and then <malay>bersembang</malay> [lah] <malay>dengan kawan-kawan</malay> [kan]
but I think
but must pity the the business owner [ah] for because actually right like very strict [ah] I mean [eh] it's it's not the [kan]
(uh) [eh] it's so they are very strict [ah]
so
I think some of the
(um) I heard the store owner [kan] <malay>atau</malay> business owner dia orang</malay> call the
[kan] complain [ah] like [oh] call police [ah] I don't know what they call [ah] they call some
ya
to to to complain say that these people because
actually [oh] at first maybe they ask them to go out [lah] say don't come here because
you cannot mix right
but sometimes we think [oh] it's no big deal but then if everyone can do it then later next thing happen next thing that you <malay>tengok</malay> news
another search [ah] you know
but but how they control right they said they got crowd control right that means people cannot go in if too many right
they they call it the maximum occupancy [kan]
ya I think maybe like they have a counter [lah] like the system can control right no but now the issue is the the tap out people don't
don't don't [ah] what you call that scan out [ah] checkout from the place
[eh] but do do you think it's possible [kan] <malay>kalau dia orang</malay> make a system [kan] means by far away then they auto checkout
[ah] if the person off then <malay>tak boleh</malay> [ah] [kan]
ya the the app <malay>apa</malay> what's the name of the that time they make the app singapore made the app
!huh!
[ah] trace together [kan]
[oh] that one
it's good [kan] <malay>macam</malay> but if that one you off or you off data cannot right
[oh] because of bluetooth [ah]
but
no but the app is running while you close the app like
like will the bluetooth be used when you are using the app at
ya
[oh]
so like between [ah] android and they also know what to do right
ya
(um)
maybe okay or maybe I change to Google [ah] [kan]
I don't know [ah] because like maybe I want to try Google [ah] but
because I have the you know last time I buy the macbook air [kan]
they gave me the free speaker what google home mini [eh]
actually that one <malay>bagus</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal</malay> you like [eh] !hey! google then the you can play spotify
you can play (um) I mean you can play the [eh] what's it called [ah] the radio station like singapore radio station
[ah] live streaming [ah] as long you got wifi [lah]
so actually from the wifi [eh] but actually dangerous [oh] I realise [kan] they recognise our voice [oh]
the google home speaker [ah] I mean the I mean google home [ah]
because right that time [kan] my friend [kan]
K because my my friend he <malay>dia pakai</malay> google home [eh] google phone [tau] so I use apple [ah] but the that time I stay #punggol# also share with him [kan]
so
I ask google [ah] using my voice [ah] like when is my birthday or what is my age [ah] something
then they know [ah] cause I think like google gmail [ah] all this something
so like they know (uh) something like my birthday or my name [ah]
then because my friend got google phone right
so he use the the what google assistance [eh] <malay>yang cakap</malay> the voice [ah]
[oh] there's one time he use he talk on my google speaker [ah] the google home speaker [kan] then he ask (um) like what is my name or something [ah]
then the google know that it's him then say his name
[ah] or birthday [ah] [ah] I think birthday also no birthday is like very hard to guess [what]
you you can guess the birthday means you know actually the person [what]
[ah] so a bit scary [lah] I think but I I heard like I saw online that you know like community [kan] instagram or something [kan]
<malay>dia cakap</malay> even your google is like off or something right they still listen to you is it correct
[ah] <malay>macam macam mana nak tahu</malay> [ah]
no I mean <malay>macam mana nak nak tahu</malay> that whether they are listening to you or not
but if the wifi off [kan] but K let's say we on the speaker but wifi off do you
I mean the so called electricity is still passing in the in the device [kan]
so will it still listen
no I think if let's say [oh] but I think google [kan] <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh] if you like ask question [kan] like no need the internet you like ask for the weather right and there's no wifi then they will say (um) [oh] sorry we cannot
(um) connect you
to the
but default [ah] but if you ask like questions like (um)
something basic [ah] like (uh) what time is it maybe <malay>dia tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau tanya</malay> something like (um)
[ah] offline what do you call it offline data [ah]
what basic basic functions [ah] [kan]
ya
it's good [ah]
that time I went that time I went exchange
because I think america amazon they use amazon [what] a lot so
my friend [eh] my friend singaporean [kan] but then he <malay>dia</malay> study full time <malay>dekat pergi luar</malay> [ah]
then <malay>dia punya</malay> apartment [kan]
I think because they also got money [ah] so their apartment like one room one bedroom [ah] so like those studio [ah]
then <malay>dia pun ada</malay> alexa I think now alexa better [ah] because
got how many version [ah] I also don't know [ah]
smart home device [ah]
but is it a brand or what
no but the smart oven [kan] like is there a brand for smart oven now
[oh]
[oh]
got smart shower or not I don't know
[oh] but the smart shower cannot anyhow on when you are there [lah] because later you go toilet
do business also cannot I think maybe they have a touch screen [ah] I don't know
or voice [ah]
[eh] but that means right COVID better [what] if let's say because of COVID right the hygiene [kan] then I think maybe future [ah] singapore the lift also maybe smart [kan]
or lift system
I think can make right
[oh] the base I mean there's a pedal [kan]
I think that one <malay>bukan</malay> maybe that one is it thailand something [ah] I cannot remember
[ah] the [ah] the <malay>dekat mana</malay> [eh] [ah] this place [ah] that time I went interview #tanjong pagar# go it's called what guoco tower [ah]
so your card right is only access to level one and the level that you are working [ah] so you tap right
then then after that
the screen will show like which lift is going
like you thought because there's like like there's two screens [kan] too many screen one is left one is right [kan]
so when you tap [kan] <malay>dia dia tahu</malay> which which place to go to [ah] like which lift to go to then but when you going down because when you tap means you know that is going down [what]
because you card is only one level [ah]

ya I mean looks nowadays [kan] <malay>kau tengok</malay> [eh] looks doesn't matter [lah] for me looks doesn't matter but most of the time guys go for looks [ah] which <malay>pada aku</malay> is just (uh)
which <malay>pada aku</malay> is just (uh) not a good thing it can lead you to I'm not a good thing I mean it can lead you to <malay>macam</malay>
a bad woman [ah] basically
<malay>bukan aku cakap</malay> not all <malay>aku tak cakap yang</malay> all beautiful ladies
<malay>perempuan lawa</malay> is basically <malay>jahat</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau katakan</malay> [eh] like ninety per cent
ninety per cent
<malay>kalau</malay> from my point of view [lah] <malay>aku tengok dia ni lawa tapi</malay> [oh] <malay>dia buat kawan aku macam gini</malay> [oh]
it give you <malay>macam</malay> a thought [ah] <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>perempuan lawa macam gini</malay> [ah]

like my like nowadays it's more of <malay>kita</malay> judge the book by its cover [kan]
I mean you can judge a person based on <malay>dia punya</malay> personality first <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> most of the time they judge on looks
just because <malay>dia tak lawa</malay> [eh] <malay>dia ni macam gini</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam gitu abeh kalau dia lawa dia ni macam gini dia ni macam gitu</malay>
so nowadays is different [ah] from last time

<malay>macam mak ngan ayah punya</malay> time is more [ah] !wah! <malay>aku suka dia</malay> K [eh] she's the [one] for me <malay>macam gitu</malay> like
like last time people is more of a <malay>macam</malay> loyal [tau] <malay>sekarang</malay> is more of K [ah]
(mm) what you mean
ya attention <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> they need attention [ah]
because now is <malay>kita</malay> living in a modern society [tau] so this modern society and singapore is quite strange to begin with <malay>faham</malay>
and we need to work and we need to think about this and that
<malay>tu pasal</malay> [ah]
<malay>rabak gila</malay>
that's why they need attention as like <malay>macam</malay> (uh) pleasure
not (uh) pleasure [ah] <malay>macam</malay> how to say [ah]
[ah] they need attention because they are young [ah] basically
<malay>kalau</malay> married couple for me <malay>kalau nak</malay> attention is very hard [ah]
for you to get attention if both are working most of (uh) most of the adults now you see is both working [what]
ya is have to
<malay>tapi kalau nak cakap</malay> [kan] [eh] (um)
<malay>aku kahwin dia tapi dia tak kasi aku</malay> attention <malay>tapi kita</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> you're not [ah] giving both
both of like both of your life a chance [tau]
like
<malay>kau nak selalu cakap</malay> I need attention <malay>tapi</malay> you never see the point of view
as a married couple you need to understand a lot of things <malay>apa</malay>
that's why you're married because you trust each other
<malay>kau faham tak aku cakap</malay>
is it
no [ah] <malay>kalau nak cakapkan</malay> piece together all of it [kan] is <malay>susah juga pasal</malay>
<malay>sekarang</malay> is more like <malay>kita</malay> have different thoughts different feelings <malay>kita punya</malay> emotions all jumble up
basically
<malay>jadi kita</malay> [ah]
and singapore [eh] <malay>kalau kau nak tahu</malay> [eh] singapore is rated one of the most depressing country in the world [tau] serious
because of the stress that <malay>macam kita</malay> put on ourselves just to survive every month
that is quite harsh [lah] harsh reality [ah]
and singapore [eh] have the <malay>macam</malay> the highest divorce rate
one of the highest [ah] divorce rate in the world
mostly <malay>melayu</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
it's very hard [lah] because nowadays more of like <malay>dia orang</malay> (um)
they never think
<malay>dia orang tak cuba fikir ke depan</malay> [tau]
they <malay>fikir</malay> okay <malay>macam orang putih cakap</malay> yolo [eh]
you only live once [kan] so they never think <malay>macam</malay> [ah] beyond horizon [tau]
<malay>dorang just fikir</malay> okay (uh) <malay>aku nak</malay> party [ah] all the way but <malay>dia nak kena fikir juga</malay>
end up you need to have a family you need to have a life a you need to have a career if not you're going <malay>macam</malay> downhill [ah]
[kan]
so <malay>pada aku</malay> wise [eh] <malay>nak cakap sekarang punya zaman</malay> is more stress [lah] basically
<malay>tapi yang penting</malay> [eh] <malay>daripada</malay> drama <malay>boleh pergi</malay> marriage

<malay>macam</malay> [oh] but it's not going to happen [ah] it's just that <malay>kau ada dia punya</malay> thought [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> end up <malay>macam kau</malay> face reality [ah] basically <malay>susah gila</malay>
<malay>tapi sekarang pun</malay>

[ah] [ah] [ah] [ah]

<malay>kenapa</malay>
but <malay>macam mana</malay> you <malay>terkeluar</malay> Zoom
I also actually I don't even know what is Miro
okay <malay>tak apa</malay> I I <malay>ajar</malay> you <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> Zoom <malay>dulu</malay> cause I use Zoom everyday so I'm quite
like good about on it
so
K so first start we need to like download Zoom on either your tablet your phone or your
laptop
okay <malay>lepas tu kena</malay> sign in usually cause I'm under like my my account is under the under school so I <malay>punya</malay> sign in is just under sign in with <malay>tapi kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> personal I would think you have to (um) sign in <malay>pakai</malay>
your own email [lah] <malay>tak</malay> okay but let's just pretend <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> your own email okay
so I'll just sign in with mine so mine will be like redirect me to (um) another
platform another like website for me to open so sometimes you'll get that sometimes you don't I think
ya
and then
(mm)
okay so like <malay>selalunya</malay> when people ask you to join a meeting you will have they will <malay>macam</malay> send you a link [kan] then like from from the link you you just
click on the link then open
ya
so but then like
usually when you [ah] they will they will prompt you to sign up I think
but let me just create a new meeting and I'll just show you how it sort of works so you create a new meeting
select you can see like my background <malay>kat sini</malay> [kan] you it's <malay>apa</malay> (um) it's virtual screen so <malay>maknanya</malay> my background <malay>takleh nampak</malay> [lah]
[ah] so
<malay>kalau kalau</malay> messy <malay>kalau</malay>
yes ya
so you can change like your virtual background [ah] at the bottom at the start of the video and then you can just pick choose virtual background so during class I <malay>selalu pakai</malay> virtual background cause <malay>belakang</malay> messy [kan] so I don't want to like show my background so <malay>kalau</malay> it's not the option is none it would be no virtual background
then you can you can use their (err)
<malay>tak ni dah</malay> log in <malay>dah</malay>
as in it's after you log in
yes ya
ya so these are some of the like preset that they give you [lah] I'm not sure about your personal [one] but my school [one] has like
(um) my school's background
so (uh) you can also add in your own photo so for me I <malay>macam</malay> I create I even created my own background just to
<malay>bagi lawa</malay> [lah] so I I use this
<malay>tapi kadang-kadang kalau pakai ni</malay> [kan] it's
(err) you will not be able to see what like let's say I'm showing a piece of paper in front of me
cause of the green screen it won't be able to show [lah]
(mm)
K
so background is done and then (um) <malay>apa lagi nak tahu</malay>
(mm)
okay so like for usually your share screen will be under here I think that it's the same for tablet <malay>dengan</malay> iPad I think [ah] ya
so when you click share screen right
I'm not sure about (um) <malay>apa</malay> not android <malay>apa nama dia</malay> Windows <malay>punya</malay> laptop but
like usually will have a different different kind of windows
so
so <malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>pakai</malay> desktop [kan]
it will show everything that I go
it will show like so even if I'm on Zoom and then I click open my WhatsApp <malay>punya</malay> web
everybody can see that
but
ya but if I <malay>pakai</malay> if I choose the Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> [kan]
it will just show whatever is on my Google chrome
so even <malay>kalau macam</malay> I <malay>tengah pakai</malay> Google chrome <malay>lepas tu</malay> I open WhatsApp web
<malay>dia tak akan nampak</malay> I <malay>punya</malay> WhatsApp web
ya cause cause I choose only my my Google chrome <malay>punya</malay> (err) window
okay so that's how you share screen then you just click share [lah] share
so like this would be hard <malay>macam</malay> (uh) once you share screen this will be your screen and then you can just toggle back to your Zoom I'm not sure about for for Mac I can just (um)
slide
okay then whenever you want to stop sharing screen
[ah] you stop share [lah]
ya so you just stop share
okay then another important is your mute button cause you know <malay>selalu macam</malay>
you <malay>selalu cakap</malay> then ya so muting sometimes even or when you whisper <malay>orang boleh dengar</malay>
so just make sure that the if if there's a cancel sign the red colour sign it means you're muted
ya
and then it goes the same for the video [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> your video <malay>takde</malay> they will just show your name like this
ya then you just unmute usually for me <malay>dalam</malay> class I'll just unmute I I'll just mute myself
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> [lah]
<malay>tak yang tunjuk</malay> you <malay>tadi</malay>
ya it's it's exactly this so if let's say (um) they will ask you for the prompt at the start
no that [one] is cause she downloaded on her iPad right
she download on iPad and then after that whenever you download an app on your iPad <malay>dia akan tanya kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> (err) <malay>apa</malay>
allow
<malay>macam</malay> for privacy measures they will ask you to like allow allow camera allow microphone
ya yes so like for hers <malay>tadi</malay> (um)
she chose don't allow
so even <malay>kalau</malay> even <malay>kalau dia</malay>
pick the stop video I mean I mean [ah] like on her video it will not allow cause she her
ya her own iPad settings already say no
ya so
so <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> video [kan]
(uh) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
you just make sure that
it's not cancelled like the red sign is not there
actually you can see yourself [lah] <malay>kat tepi</malay>
right so as long as you see your name it means that you are <malay>apa</malay> the video is done I mean the video is off
<malay>apa</malay> done
(mm)
and then other basic things is like <malay>macam</malay>
okay I don't even know I don't really know if you use this during your meetings but like for my classes they will usually have like
raise up your hands or (err) <malay>apa</malay>
thumbs up thumbs down
okay I don't really have it [oh] <malay>dengan</malay> yes no
okay so they will just ask [oh] [ah] who knows this question who knows the answer to this question raise your hands then you just <malay>angkat tangan</malay>
<malay>tapi angkat tangan takde kat sini</malay> [lah]
okay so it's at the bottom of the screen and then just click
and then you just click participants
and then you just click usually it will be a like raise hands (uh) put down your hands yes no
(err) thumbs up thumbs down but I usually use yes no and thumbs [ah] hands up
ya usually at the participants area [lah]
ya then like just now you can like
<malay>apa</malay> rename yourself so if let's say but you can only rename yourself you cannot rename for others unless you're the
host I think
ya so I can rename myself like let's say I want #siti# instead
so #siti# ya and then other basic things is (err) okay if you're the host or the co-host right you have the options to record
so record is just you <malay>boleh tengok balik</malay> [lah] the recording
okay so you can choose between like (err) record on your laptop or record on cloud
record on cloud means on your Zoom account which I which I prefer cause if you if you record <malay>macam macam</malay> that time I conduct my master classes right
and then I had to record the classes
[ah] I chose
the first mistake was I chose (uh) to record on on my laptop and it became a whole two hours plus footage
<malay>macam</malay> movie <malay>gitu</malay>
(mm) so so I had to I had to
<malay>apa</malay>
find a way to upload that huge file to make sure everybody can see it then <malay>susah</malay> [lah]
ya then <malay>lepas tu</malay> I just (um) I tried out (uh) record on cloud
and it will just record on your Zoom account and then you can just send the link
then <malay>orang akan</malay> just
ya <malay>orang akan</malay> be direct redirected back to the to the Zoom
(mm) ya
and then some basic things like chat
chat [ah] okay cause <malay>ni tak ada</malay> participants <malay>sekarang</malay> [kan] so
(mm) then you know you can change (err) to everyone <malay>ataupun</malay> to a specific person
(mm) <malay>tak boleh</malay>
<malay>takleh</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] <malay>ada orang cakap yang</malay> like what like the host who
no but but it depends like like it hasn't been proven even I'm the host (uh) even when I host meetings right I cannot really see
ya so I don't know I don't know if it's true but just to be safe I don't like saying anything like nasty things about my lecturer <malay>kat dalam kelas</malay> [lah] ya
so ya usually
so it will have like a button here and the to everyone then they will have like a a small button here which (err) will have like a I think downwards button and then you can just pick
(uh) instead of everyone there's like person [ah] other people's name all the participants' name [lah] then they will have like bracket privately
so make sure you bracket privately then when you send a message [kan] you have to make sure <malay>yang apa</malay> you you click back to everyone
if if you want to talk to everyone else ya
ya
<malay>tapi</malay> [kan] sometimes get confusing cause the messages your private messages and your messages (uh) your and messages <malay>apa</malay> to everyone
it will be altogether
ya so you just have to <malay>macam baca betul-betul</malay> [lah] like which one is everyone which one is to you only
(mm) ya but that's just like
usually when I want to like ask my friends something then I'll just like click to <malay>apa</malay> to to my friend [ah]
(mm) other than that there's breakout rooms but I don't think you'll be a host anytime soon cause you don't even know how to
operate Zoom
ya breakout rooms is just
breakout rooms is just (uh) <malay>macam tadi</malay> you experience that smaller rooms right so basically let's say you have a participant of <malay>macam</malay>
forty people
<malay>lepas tu orang tu nak</malay> breakout into smaller groups to do group work
so I will just
<malay>macam</malay> create let's say two rooms
and then like as a host I will just break up the rooms but as a participant <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>tengah tengah tengok</malay>
I'll just be like (err) there will just be a notification that pops out (uh) proceeding to breakout rooms something like that then you just wait [lah]
and it automatically will be changed to
your breakout room
(mm)
(mm) I guess so [lah] but like
cause
cause for adults I don't think you guys <malay>pakai</malay> much like for meetings only right and during meetings also you don't really talk much like you let your boss
ya but like students we always have to tutorials then like when tutorials you have to talk to get participation marks <malay>apa</malay>
I get
ya so if you like (uh) if you're a host then you can schedule meeting so like let's say <malay>macam</malay> I conduct my fundraising master classes [kan] the other time I will I will schedule a meeting and I'll just pick the time the date and then
yes
yes this is my the one I send on email
ya then I on the day itself you can just (err)
it will just be somewhere here [lah]
like ya
(mm) I think it's better than <malay>apa</malay> what's the other option the outlook is it live live
google meet or live outlook something like that [lah]
(mm)
so like let's say if you schedule a meeting then it will just be my personal then you just copy and send to people [lah]
(mm)
but just now you had you had something on
<malay>ada apa</malay>
team bonding in this COVID period how is that ya but like it's not time for you to bond with your team hello
but it's so <malay>susah</malay> just now
(mm) but I think like
wait so how did it go just now
no but like but like what was your <malay>apa</malay> what were the activities that you do and everything
escape room <malay>ada</malay> virtual
I <malay>tak</malay>
I <malay>tak pernah pergi</malay> [lah] but like how so so what must you do in that escape room
no as in like what is the objective of a escape room
the objective is just to escape the game room using the mysteries [lah]
<malay>cakap</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi susah tak</malay>
[ah]
no but like what were you trying to find out in the poem
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay> it's the starting of the
[oh]
I mean technically it's in the poem also [what] so like even if you <malay>baca</malay> like
but then how long were you given to do the escape room
that's a long time
but this is done by the escape room <malay>punya punya</malay> company [lah]
[oh] so like the facilitators like bought this escape room and then cause like they had you had a separate facilitator <malay>macam</malay> team bonding facilitator right
!huh!
the gavin (err)
but they were like from some motivational slash team bonding organisation [what]
[oh] then the escape room is they create or what
cause cause got my for my global studies <malay>punya apa</malay>
welfare pack [kan] everything is online now [what] so we have like a series of wait do you know what welfare welfare pack
no it's like <malay>macam</malay> okay basically if it's physical [kan] in school then they will give you like nearing to exams [lah] <malay>macam</malay> your <malay>apa</malay> midterms or your final year then they will give you like (err) a literal goody bag
then inside <malay>macam ada</malay> foolscap <malay>ada</malay> snacks <malay>ada</malay> like ya then like all these are like
usually free stuff so like you will source out from
(err) <malay>apa</malay> get
what what's that called when you ask someone for
free stuff [ah]
promote [ah] sponsorship [ah] sponsorship ya so you ask for like you ask this company for sponsorship [lah] but usually like if it's a bigger scale like what like your whole faculty <malay>punya</malay> goody bag then it's usually easier but like for us cause we are just a small <malay>apa</malay> faculty group [kan]
then we have to like ask around like all the different organisation that we want to partner up with [lah] so like we actually ask escape room like the organisation itself not organisation the company escape room you know I think you've been there before right ya
then they said like (err) cause I think now COVID they cannot
okay I'm not sure whether they cannot go in like to play the physical [one] or something like that but like
<malay>tapi lima orang apa</malay>
maybe maybe ya then they
in the end they were like okay we give you the sponsorship but (um) is to try out our <malay>apa</malay>
mobile app
ya but then the thing is the mobile app is only for android people and they they said okay if you can gather (um) if I'm not wrong thirty thirty pairs of people to play this game then we will give you the sponsorship like a I think ten dollars off or something like per escape
(um) room <malay>punya</malay> fee
no no no as in like cause if you if you go escape room usually got you have to pay [what] to go inside the escape room
no no no okay so so like for for for us is that
they will ask you to get a certain number of people it's like a trial run <malay>dulu</malay> [lah]
I think it's thirty pax or is it or is it thirty people then fifteen pairs
something like that [lah]
<malay>tak tak tak kita</malay> play for free cause they just they just want to see if you can get the people or not
cause the main point of sponsorship is you <malay>nak orang</malay> (uh) you want to get as many attention as you want as much attention as much attention as you want [what] [kan] ya
so then you ya then after that you just have to like
you have to source out for the for the people [lah] but in the end we couldn't cause it was only for android <malay>punya</malay> phone
ya exactly then we were like
it's a bit
ya cause they said their software developer like only develop for android then I'm like
then we were like
okay like we tried [lah] we tried to ask but even within our own EXCO group only one person use android of like eight people
so so hard then a lot of our friends also don't like even when I ask my friends also they all don't use android so be like I think in the end we couldn't get the sponsorship cause it was just
no but they had a
they had an age limit below thirty five
ya
but then it was just so hard and then after that we were like
and then cause at first they tried to <malay>apa</malay>
divide the welfare pack the E it's called like E welfare pack or something like that [lah] like basically E-vouchers so it's just a
a document full of vouchers that you can use
(mm)
and then like initially I wanted to
(uh) produce like three different
E-vouchers for <malay>apa</malay> three different three different categories <malay>macam</malay> welfare [eh] welfare <malay>pula</malay> beauty (uh) food and <malay>macam</malay> activities [lah] like yoga and everything
but like the sponsorship rate was the the turnover the turnover was like just so low then in the end <malay>macam</malay> I think they just decided
to produce one instead
ya so it's a bit sad cause we tried to <malay>macam</malay> we tried to
engage in home-based businesses
<malay>tapi tu pun susah</malay>
like it was supposed to be
release
[oh] it supposed to be released now but then cause like there was a lot of (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> delays and everything a lot of the sponsorships <malay>tak</malay> reply cause COVID <malay>sekarang</malay> then even their organisations not doing well <malay>apa</malay> the companies not doing well
like even like activity <malay>punya</malay> entertainment places <malay>pun tak</malay> not
they open [lah] but I mean who would goes to all these entertainment places right
ya
so like
we in the end
(err) we pushed back to week thirteen I think week thirteen is about like six november
ya it's quite late
but
ya then now I just finished my fundraising <malay>punya</malay> series [oh]
we collected a total of
okay I don't know what's the exact number but
I think almost reach six hundred dollars
!woohoo!
ya our target was four hundred dollars
ya then then even if four hundred dollars at first <malay>macam kita</malay>
we just like no confidence [ah] <malay>macam</malay> it's so <malay>susah</malay>
four courses [a'ah]
(err) each courses minimally
I think ten people each let me see
no but the thing is okay like like one of my (um)
(uh) members in that EXCO group like he gave like constructive criticism [lah] he was like you you pass the target but then like a lot of people also <malay>macam</malay> donate in bulks [what] like you and mama
donate like seventy dollars right
ya no as in as in but
seventy per cent seventy per cent <malay>pula</malay> seven dollars out of like our total is still quite a lot [what]
you get what I mean it's like
ya
ya then like some of my friends also donated like seventy dollars like their mum and them like donate seventy dollars so I think total about
three of you like make up like half not half [lah] like maybe one third of it
no but but
ya but the thing is it's like
the main point is to gain as much audience as possible [what] it's not to rely on like
just you <malay>sorang</malay> [jer]
[kan] so like that's what he said [lah] he was like ya you you managed to to hit your target ya but then
like
(mm) but ya not not there yet not as
(mmhmm) (mm)
ya then we're like that's quite true [lah]
(um) no but like
the first class is cooking class second class is makeup third is [oh] third is excel and forth is (um)
<malay>apa</malay> embroidery the worst was makeup cause I think <malay>macam</malay> is so common like everybody can just watch YouTube tutorials
so so that [one] a bit but in the end (err) a lot of my EXCO just join in last minute so to the person teaching the makeup class <malay>macam</malay> it's not that bad [lah] ya
cause it was still <malay>macam ramai</malay> then she was like [oh] my god didn't expect this much this many people and then I'm like [oh] [ha] [ha] [ha] <malay>nasib baik</malay> cause there's only like
three people <malay>yang</malay> sign up ya and it was very no three three or four people <malay>yang</malay> sign up
ya it was it was quite hard
I think also cause
like (err) in our faculty there was there's another group
[oh] by the way I won a giveaway from them
from the faculty <malay>punya</malay> group
ya it's a just a makeup set [lah] ya
ya and then after that the most popular was the excel class which did you
[oh] ya I send did you receive
ya then
no but
overall but I think he's the nicest he's the nicest person ever like
[oh] at first he I don't really know him but I just <malay>tahu pasal</malay> he lives in my for
ya
not not like as close friends whatever it's more of acquaintance <malay>macam</malay> I saw his (uh)
I saw his poster inside the inside the lift the other time <malay>pasal</malay>
[ah] this excel course [lah] <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> and I wanted to join that time <malay>tapi</malay> I had something on that day so I couldn't make it
and now I was like but but but I I remembered thinking that it's such a good course [lah] ya
and then fast forward (err)
I was <malay>dengan tengah</malay> planning for this fundraising I was thinking like (hmm) like what other interesting courses would people be interested in
then I thought <malay>macam</malay> I think
like
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
not hands-on <malay>macam</malay> very practical skills that people would need <malay>macam</malay> in their workplaces in their school right
ya but
ya then after that I I ask him [lah] I was like [oh] will you be interested [oh] I ask his number from my friend and then after that [ah] I just ask him would you be interested and that was my first time talking to him I think
ya
and then
he was just like ya sure sure <malay>lepas tu</malay> I I went to find out (err) he thought the class was like he was conducting the class for the somali refugees
then I was like no it's not then I was like [oh] my god so <malay>kesian</malay> then he was like no no it's fine I was like okay
[ah] but ya it's just it's
<malay>dah</malay> I told him already but
I told him in the in like a whole group of like other volunteers
but I think he didn't really like
read properly something like that but ya but ya I told him he was like no no it's fine
but his class was like over
two and half cause the maximum <malay>kita anuh</malay> is
(uh) two hours only
ya
two and half hours
ya and like we started at eight
so he he was like
talking for
ya two and half hours straight he was talking and he don't even take a break he given ya
and then he was so nice he makes like (uh) extra class notes and he even like answered (err) post like questions that people were like asking afterwards after class everything
yes
[oh] but he's really really smart he has like
double double degree
and he he intern in like
and like
ya and he
[oh] he was (err) he was chosen for and Facebook or something like that like I know like (uh) ya
prestigious one [lah] but then
but he in the end he chose like I think ya
cause he's a business student engineering student
(mm) really [meh]

for two hours
like you can stay for cause before this is just half an hour
but now you can stay for two hours
then but then you still have to book a slot online [lah]
but like two hours <malay>macam</malay> so <malay>sikit</malay> if I want to study there
ya and then <malay>nak nak nak belajar kat luar pun</malay>
like I don't mind studying outside but
some establishments <malay>macam</malay> Coffee Bean they have no no laptop policy like cause they know a lot of people like going out to
to study and do their work right
ya and then like
no but do you understand the concept of burnout it's like it's still I don't know how to explain but like
like when you just
sometimes you just need a change of environment ya
that's what you said cause you go to office twice a week
so that's still okay
is [oh] my god I feel like I'm just my whole twenty four seven I'm just seated here
that doesn't change my that [one] my setting
but ya I already have let me see I think I already have
most of my assignments are due soon
like
a total I have I have a total of
one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
ten more
but I finish four already
so I've six more major exams (err) assignments to do
six
all different [lah] so one I got like twenty eight october one nine november one thirteen november one sixteen november no two sixteen november and I got I still got my final exam
twenty third
<malay>tapi</malay> it's a take home so it's like twenty four hours
twenty four hours [ah]
but that's the worst like I did that for my previous exam (err) my job <malay>punya</malay> module
cause they know we have twenty four hours and you have like the liberty to <malay>cam</malay> use all these
your laptop <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
it was super hard mummy
it was like
I couldn't even answer the questions
everyone was like
exact ya it's open book
so it's like you know I tried googling the answer okay and I just like my god how do I even answer this question
but ya and then I got B for that
contact
can [lah] but like
it's an exam who who wants to share your answer with you you get what I mean
cause I don't have friends that mob what like unless you have your friends then I guess like advice to help you [lah] but
even if you have friends <malay>macam</malay>
#paiseh# [kan] <malay>nak tanya</malay>
like it's not not
#neh#
no but it was
it was so much time [lah] I actually spent
over thirteen hours straight on the exam
!huh!
<malay>cakap apa</malay>
no [lah]
no
I mean you can give clues like he can tell us everything but ultimately it's like the way he phrases the questions and everything is
is very hard to answer
cause he purposely like professors are smart mummy like they know that you you are first thing you are firstly smart
ya then
then they know you have all these resources then obviously they don't they won't have like a question be like
[oh] you look at
exactly ya
so it's usually like like <malay>apa</malay> a combination of (err) topics
ya and then you just set the question like what
ya
[oh] no but
but one thing bad about online school was that (err)
[orh] okay at least for my faculty you have no exams at all except this exception one module [lah] but
[ah] generally across all the modules in my faculty you have like
very very little exam and then it's all replaced by assignments which I thought <malay>macam lebih lebih bagus</malay> [ah]
no the answer is no
[oh] that's the mistake that's the mistake of a of a freshman student that's a mistake of someone who has never taken full a non exam module okay so last sem I took like three
(uh) non exam modules and two exams <malay>pastu</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> happy [lah] !yay! three three modules no exam
[ah] <malay>ambil kau semua</malay> submission at the same time cause usually
like (err)
if if you have two assignments or three assignments usually [lah] (err) the <malay>macam apa</malay> submission the deadline is
about the same so let's say
in this (uh) my first mod then my second mod right I have like (um) my first essay usually the first essay will be due around the same time
<malay>tak tahu kenapa</malay> [lah] but it's just like that [ah]
ya
yes no and cause it's assignments it's usually very okay let's say you have an exam you will just like
(um) let's say short answer question it's like less than five hundred words like you answer one question right
but an essay you have to write three thousand words minimum
no our
that's what you think
but the assignment like most of my assignments here (um) especially towards the end there will be this like one major like so all like consolidating <malay>nya</malay> assignment
so it would it will be like okay let's say I have this
at first I explain to you like [eh] it's really like a burden to all the uni students to have no exams
like just like I was like !yay! no exam fun [what] then my students were like no you will not lucky then I'm like !huh! why I never knew until I experience it
ya so like let's say I have this refugee policy <malay>punya</malay> mod
and my major (err)
my major <malay>apa</malay>
essay is I have to solve a policy problem and I have to write like
almost four K words [lah]
so you you <malay>bayangkan</malay> I have to do that and that's not my only module I have to do I have my other modules and top of modules I have readings to do readings which will help me in my modules
<malay>semua</malay> yes you see
two two of them are in sixteen november which two of these is my major [one]
and then two thirteen november okay then this [one] is okay [lah] relax [lah]
twenty eight october eighteen october you see it's all like about the same <malay>sama-sama</malay>
it's crazy ya that's why people always say like don't don't take
like it's gonna take non-exam mod at least take like one one or two [lah] but
you take three onwards it's crazy so this sem is like five of them
it's just insane
like all five modules of mine no exam [what] like all modules all assessments based
ya
so I was like
just screwing for like time [lah] then now I think
some period
<malay>macam</malay> now
now and
two [eh] no week six that's the crazy period [lah] cause that's the like now now is my #chiong# period all the way to
twenty third november
ya
that's one like technically technically you end faster [lah]
no it's not managing time it's okay it's like
how to say like
even if you manage your time properly right you will still need
ya the the amount of time you take to finish one essay right like you <malay>tak percaya</malay> you <malay>tanya kak</malay> #shima# the amount of time you take to finish one essay is like super long okay
that's that
there's the planning then you have to make sure like what you write is coherent you have to reference and then you have to find more sources that everything is so much easier to like just <malay>belajar</malay> for that one
(uh) like you <malay>belajar</malay> for certain period of time and then you just do exam for one day
then that's it
it's so much easier trust me ya I would totally prefer that
ya but now it's like a combination of both so it's even worse
ya
but
I just got my I just go my <malay>apa</malay>
(err) result for my which one
my four K mod and I got a A
ya
it was my first it was my first A yes for the semester
(mm)
<malay>apa</malay>
twenty third november <malay>baru</malay> end
ya
no but I won't I won't be getting like results for everything
cause you cannot the university policy is only like fifty per cent
you can reveal
then they just don't show you [lah]
ya
!huh!
[oh] no
no they will just give you like okay let's say you got three assignments [kan]
then cause different assignments is different weightages <malay>apa</malay>
let's say my first assignment is fifteen per cent my second assignment is so what is fifty minus fifteen
thirty five thirty five then the last one is fifty per cent right
so I will only receive my first two assignments
or I will receive my last assignment which is usually not the case [lah] cause of the last
cause fifty fifty per cent
they can only show results up to fifty per cent of your grade
that's the thing
like like I think it's cause <malay>macam</malay> they don't want to people to know the bell curve also
you know what's bell curve right ya
then cause if you know your fifty per cent okay let's say I got like A for everything
then my ultimate grade is a B plus
<malay>mesti</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !huh!
like confirm I want to like
like ask the university all that [what] then I think they don't want [lah]
ya but
I guess it's it's okay [lah]
like
no but it's also like sometimes a a blessing I guess cause like you get like B B then like you work so hard on your last one then you don't know right so like when we <malay>dapat</malay> results you <malay>macam</malay>
(mm) will I get a B or A and then you'll think you will get a B you know like A and then like okay
so so you know you did well on your last but you'll never know how well you did [lah]
ya
ya
it's like
<malay>lagi cepat</malay> stress
ya exactly exactly ya which is which is hard about uni [lah] I guess
cause you have to consistently do hard cause you never know
when it's like
ya when when you are going to do bad in it
which is why I want to do exchange to freeze my
cause when you freeze your then cause of my now is is okay [lah] I guess so like I don't want to make it drop anymore cause is I mean when you
you <malay>naik</malay> year three year four it gets harder and harder [what] you have to take harder modules [kan]
ya and then after that
I just want to <malay>macam</malay> freeze my [lah] so that it won't <malay>macam tak turun tak naik</malay> I mean I mean <malay>naik</malay> is possible it's very hard for you to <malay>naik</malay> [lah] honestly
ya <malay>tak turun</malay> [lah] basically
ya
ya maintain or don't drop
ya but COVID happened and then
my exchange to
(mm)
(mm)
okay cause they open up the
the
application again cause they said like [oh]
ya okay okay no cause they officially cancelled
(uh) our sem two [kan] sem two they cancelled
then they sent out email [lah] they said like [oh] like ya unfortunately unable to proceed cause there's still no cause they were I think
<malay>dorang nak tunggu</malay> vaccine
ya so like they were thinking if they like delay they hope there will be a vaccine that will come out already [lah] but unfortunately <malay>tak ada</malay> vaccine
so they said cannot [lah] like
I think only countries to europe
asia and
ya which is allowed I mean
most of the countries are from there [lah]
ya then they they said but they will extend cause the application for the next round <malay>punya dah</malay> actually <malay>dah tutup</malay>
but then they just <malay>buka balik</malay> then they said [oh] it's until [oh] it's two more days actually the deadline the due date
ya
then you said then they said you can apply but your just your application will just be like as though you're a new student so <malay>macam tak kira kalau</malay> you <malay>ada</malay> you were accepted like me like in your exchange you will still have to like
go through everything again and like they will send to review your your grades and everything [lah]
but the thing is my
my major <malay>punya</malay> requirement is that
you have to finish these two mods consecutively
like in sem one and sem two consecutively cause it's like <malay>macam</malay> group work
ya exactly that's that's the thing that it's stopping us from going again [lah] cause if you go let's say you go
sem two my year three sem two
yes next year january
january but
no no no no so what they are opening now is my year four sem one sem two
okay so technically year four students you cannot go in your sem two so sem two is out [lah] I <malay>tak boleh pergi</malay> [lah]
(mm) so sem one but my course my my major <malay>ada</malay> this requirement that you <malay>kena ambil</malay> this particular module
like in sem one and sem two consecutively so <malay>kalau</malay> you miss out in sem one <malay>tak boleh ambil</malay> in sem two [jer] [tau]
you have to wait
you have to wait another year [lah] so you have to extend another year
which is why like we
we are trying to propose but
but okay you
okay but you try to think of something like try to think of a solution how it's quite it's quite impossible cause you cannot we firstly cannot ask them to do (um) online cause
time difference and I don't think it's possible cause (uh) you're it's actually taking
two (uh) <malay>apa</malay> different modules from two different universities
right
and then after that time difference also cause it's it's like a <malay>macam</malay> group work <malay>gitu</malay> ya
no it's not
ya which is why like we were we were okay we were okay with (um) just like (err) <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
(uh) doing online <malay>kalau boleh</malay>
but the thing is they don't they don't let
like they don't let if (uh)
they don't let
if you are <malay>apa namanya</malay> I lost my train of thoughts already <malay>ayah</malay> keeps calling
no I mean it's it's actually calling your it's actually calling <malay>pula</malay> it's actually trying to like
take two different (err) from two different schools <malay>macam macam mana</malay> you you can attend two different schools like it's at the same time some more
ya so that's like
I don't know but like we we're just trying our luck (lah) we just we just trying to ask but
I don't really have hope <malay>yang kita akan pergi</malay> [lah] cause it's ya it's quite hard
and then also like
you cannot do in sem like let's say I want to cause cause I can only do in let's say I go exchange in sem one right
then I can only do it in sem the module compulsory module in sem two
but
if I propose to take in my next sem instead my year three sem two
I cannot cause then (um) the organisation that we will that will work you
that will work with will be
but they have to wait one whole semester for us to continue working again which is <malay>macam tak baik</malay> [lah] like who which which organisation is nice enough to do that
and obviously the school will not allow it [lah]
but ya we just we just trying our luck
to propose
no <malay>kalau kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> one <malay>kalau</malay> one year then I won't [lah] like no and and it's not just them it's like
you have to pay eight K of money okay
ya
cause I'm not subsidised anymore [what] if I extend right
ya exactly then I was like okay it's okay especially when I don't think can [lah] which is damn unfair cause it's just like
the faculty I mean my major <malay>macam</malay> just extra want to have this module to be different cause now we are like interdisciplinary module everything
but I'm just like
exactly and it's like a whole
[eh]
it's a whole batch that is that is
like you don't allow them to go just cause of your the way you structure your
ya actually ridiculous [lah]
but ya
I don't know
I'm hoping to
but the the new application <malay>yang dorang kasi</malay> it's more
<malay>apa</malay> there's more options [ah]
so I don't know
but it's it's in two more days and I haven't
really
done my research so
<malay>kena</malay> submit <malay>lagi</malay> [ah]
yes
but it's not that much I think
ya
I just like I just have to fill
I just have to find and no but I cannot cause as in it's they only give they only open back for ten days
ya so it's impossible for us to get approval first [ah] so we just gonna submit first and then I will just email cause
if you submit you get accepted you can still reject <malay>apa</malay> and you and you won't
that that's the thing I said there's a lot of
there's more options now so have
like more options [ah] to choose from
maybe maybe not you okay [lah] no but but even if I go to a non
ya I was thinking of that
no but the thing is it's not the problem of COVID now [what] it's not the problem of whether I can go or not ya
just don't think I'll be able so sad
it's like your whole uni is like
you've been looking forward to this but <malay>nasib baik</malay> I I stay in dorm if not like I really like no uni life at all
what <malay>takde</malay>
know like <malay>kak</malay> #shima# stay in the hall everything
[oh] ya
two years
ya
ya luckily luckily I got
and that was even like
a last minute decision [what] remember
like for me to enter my my
but ya [oh] did you hear about the the sexual harassment case
don't know [lah]
but it's not
ya and they they filed police report [lah]
ya but no the thing is
what it what people are mad about is like <malay>macam</malay> the the college <malay>tak</malay>
they don't they don't <malay>dia tak</malay> relay <malay>apa-apa</malay>
(mm) like cause some people notice like
only after two weeks they reported <malay>baru ada</malay> like
actions or something like that like action taken towards the
the <malay>laki</malay> [lah]
then like people like
it took two weeks just to <malay>macam</malay> do something then that speaks a lot [what]
but apparently like they were doing like internal investigations all along but they just
they never like say anything [lah]
ya
ya and not
ya and then after that like
I don't know [ah] just like
just
ya then after that we were like
thinking what what can someone what can someone do
like
what can
<malay>jap</malay> [eh] <malay>ada ayah ni apa apa ayah nak ni</malay>
<malay>jap jap</malay> and then after that like they and then we were like
(uh) what can the person do
what can the what can the
what is it called organisation do then they release (err) a statement [lah] saying like [oh] increase our transparency and everything
and then after that
I guess okay now but
it's just a bad reputation for again yet again
which is bad like especially especially like sexual harassment case it's like
it's such a big thing and you
I don't know [lah] look but
no but the thing is that the thing about
(um) my school is that
the spotlight has has is already on us cause we're like the top university everything right
and then like just cause of that even though like other sexual harassment activities happened in other universities like not much attention is placed on them just cause like like you know <malay>macam</malay> sensation [lah] like the media just wants to like keep on (uh) saying [oh] again
and then the last like
you know it happens and some people actually think like [oh] like it only happens in everything but
it's wrong like
sexual harassment happens everywhere it's just cause that media chooses to portray us in this light cause we're like top and everything
which is a bit ridiculous [lah]
no but but in but <malay>kita punya</malay> people keep saying my uni right you know in other universities it's worst but but it just don't hear reports right
but it's worst
cause we have friends there where we know what's happening there we have ties with organisation like the clubs there obviously we know
like in singapore it's not so big also
ya
report [lah] like reports do happen that's the thing
ya exactly which is what I'm saying they don't they don't report it in the media
you get what I'm saying it's the media
yes it's reported but but nothing is reported in the media
cause the sensation is just on us
ya
so I don't know
it's just
it's a it's a very controversial topic [ah]
like everytime another one comes and then like (uh) yet again but like in like before
before that like before another case pops up another case already pops up in another uni but you don't hear from them also cause like like the media doesn't cover that [what]

okay clap
hello hi #madir#
I'm okay
<malay>aku penat</malay>

he wants to become an <malay>ustad</malay> you know because his family is really really pious well he came from a pious family
but then one day he fell in love with a

I am sorry to the flag for the first trial video it's not
idealistic
[oh] what about me
[oh]
[ah] okay my full name is rismawati binti razlan people will call me #rismah# #ris#

and I'm having an internship (uh) by this september
<malay>insyaallah</malay>
<malay>sampai</malay> december and I'll be graduating already and I think I'm planning to take (um) maybe
(err)
like higher NITEC or because I'm still NITEC so I think I'm taking in higher NITEC or
maybe poly
but
I'm not so sure first [lah] (uh) [ah] like (um) I have to plan everything first and
you know move on from there
but (um) as for now I think
(err) talking about language (err) languages [ah] I can speak <malay>macam biasa melayu</malay>
(um) then after that (um) english english my my english is not like my brother's english
(um) because his english is like really fluent
but mine is (um) just normal like (um) I don't really know how to speak english that well but
you know you know like don't know like how to say [ah] like I know how to speak english but then
I don't know some words I have like I still have a long way
to go to to you know to to know a new word
to use
and indonesian (um)
of course my brother can speak really fluent but me
I can my indonesian is really really rusty
like I can just speak a bit but I understand what other people say when they're in they talk in indonesian
ya that's one thing about me and (um)
I think about that [ah] I think [ah] other than that
there's nothing more I guess
(err)
like

okay right
so probably (err) I will start [lah]
so my question is regarding the wedding preparation
okay so from my understanding right <malay>apa tu</malay>
the <malay>kadi</malay> is you book the <malay>kadi</malay> from the website right okay so and then you don't actually contact them <malay>apa tu</malay>
directly [ah]
okay
okay
ya
<malay>takpe</malay> [lah] it's okay [ah]
it's okay <malay>tak payah banyak-banyak</malay> then ya
(hmm)
[oh] okay <malay>jadi kalau kadi tu macam</malay> stay further but you select that <malay>kadi</malay> because you prefer also okay [lah] [oh]
(mm) okay
okay I see
okay okay
okay
(mm)
<malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I have to wait until the date I want available first right so I cannot do in advance right
[oh] I see that means <malay>kalau</malay> if six of june I still have to wait until sixth of june available then I go in and register
[oh]
[oh] I I I I <malay>takut</malay> what or not I <malay>takut</malay> go in [ah] then I click click click click right then suddenly right it submitted then my date right not available then if I need to amend [kan] then is charges <malay>takde</malay> [eh]
okay
there there there is any amendment (err) there's there's charges [ah] ya
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> on that day is your date available already [lah] on the
[oh] haven't
ya
[oh] okay okay
[oh] I see so <malay>kirakan</malay> before the date available
you go in you select the <malay>kadi</malay> so (err) I mean you play with the form <malay>tapi</malay> you don't submit
[oh]
[oh] I I was thinking of doing that <malay>tapi</malay> <malay>macam takut</malay> #tersubmit# then you amend changes
later have to pay the difference [ah] the the charges [ah] and then ya so but I was also curious [ah] I want to see the form right and what is this question required because because my date is a double date so will be very (err) sought much sought sought after [lah] so don't want to make the mistake [ah] then that time you book <malay>masa tu nya</malay> (err) it's a sunday
<malay>mesti</malay> popular [kan] but then (err)
(err) how fast [ah] did did did sold out as in do you like wait the the night when the the date became available or you just wait the next day you submit
[oh]
okay
[ah]
<malay>takut tak dapat</malay> [kan]
okay
(mm) okay cause I also have to settle quite a number of things [ah] cause for #dewi# side [kan]
<malay>dia punya</malay> cause the dad is <malay>bukan</malay> is a non-muslim <malay>jadi kena cari kadi kadi tak banyak cuma ada sepuluh ke</malay> I think <malay>sepuluh</malay> then
[oh] [oh]
[oh] I think about ten [ah] ya but <malay>dia ada lagi satu</malay> (err) <malay>punya susah</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> (um) <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> [kan] <malay>dia tak boleh apa tu</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau buat dekat</malay> (err) location <malay>lain</malay> [kan] <malay>dia nya kadi</malay> cannot be <malay>yang</malay> full time staff
so full time staff <malay>sana ada</malay> about <malay>tiga orang</malay> so out of the ten
I only can pick seven then from that seven I think got two or two not fluent in english [ah] so my (err) number of <malay>kadi</malay> shrink shrink then <malay>entah abeh sekarang</malay> nowadays I cannot see the <malay>kadi</malay> reviews on the web [eh] <malay>dulu</malay> got or not I saw a lot of the video being recorded previously
but the the videos are removed ya so I like
so I also don't know but I know #salim jasman# I saw the video [lah] so I thought
he's okay he's fast I prefer <malay>pasal dia nya dia nya</malay> style is like
<malay>berbual sikit</malay> then go
[ah] <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>ada satu</malay> (err) <malay>kadi tu dia</malay> quite quite
very eloquent [ah] <malay>tapi bila</malay> I <malay>tengok dia nya</malay> video [kan]
[ah] they they drag on
[ah]
ya ya (mm)
ya ya correct
(mm)
ya <malay>pasal sekarang</malay> I know <malay>yang satu kadi ni yang</malay> I identified this #salim jasman# I saw
<malay>cara dia buat macam betul</malay> relax [ah] (err) he just
(err)
I think he is not very particular as long as he can hear the person say and he just proceed
[oh] okay
okay
yup
ya
busy [ah]
okay
(mm) okay (mm) (mm)
okay okay
[oh] okay okay
[oh] the okay (uh huh)
<malay>tapi bagus</malay> [ah] because you <malay>tak ingat</malay> then that means also no stress [lah] <malay>bila baca baca</malay> [jer] [ah]
ya ya ya it sounds it sounds <malay>baku</malay> ya
ya [lah] ya [lah] <malay>tapi berbual macam berbual bahasa melayu pun kelakar juga</malay> ya
(hmm) okay I see then ya
<malay>tapi yang kadi tu</malay> is your family <malay>punya</malay> (err) acquaintance [ah]
[oh] <malay>tapi</malay> by then you don't know who that colleague is [lah]
(mm)
ya
okay (mm) okay <malay>jadi kirakan</malay> my plan <malay>sekarang</malay> is to go to the website fill up all the details then <malay>tapi bila dia punya</malay> date available submit straight (mm)
okay
okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tapi dia</malay> to submit is there's a submit button right as long you don't submit it won't go through [kan] okay

(mm) okay [lah] angry [lah]
okay
<malay>cuma cuma dia punya masa tu</malay> thinking is <malay>dia nak pergi sana cepat</malay> so <malay>dia ada</malay> time to makeup [lah] <malay>tapi</malay>
(mm) okay [oh] okay okay
for bride [lah] ya you <malay>dah</malay> plan [pe]
ya okay
okay
[oh] <malay>tu tak boleh jadi</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau orang dah bayar untuk tu semua mana boleh</malay> [seh]
!huh! [oh]
<malay>kirakan sekarang ni macam</malay> they are <malay>macam</malay> (err) they messed up the (err) planning
some some some <malay>mak andam</malay> because they because they want to do their part which is so they the the main thing is they make messed up the planning [lah] okay
okay
okay <malay>dia</malay> panic [lah] okay
okay
<malay>kirakan</malay> flexible [lah] okay okay (uh huh)
(mm) <malay>jadi kirakan kalau macam</malay> if we do <malay>nikah</malay> and wedding different place that's where the problem comes
ya okay
yes yes and traffic jam you don't know whether
okay
[oh] <malay>kirakan bukan pasal</malay> delay <malay>pasal</malay> they earn more [lah] no [lah] we we already paid them for that whole day so inclusive
<malay>tapi</malay> [oh] but you know how their charges are is like per whole [oh] not [oh]
but usually they won't try to delay unless really special occasion [ah] ya
okay
(mm) <malay>tapi</malay> #prata# okay
a bit greasy [ah]
<malay>sakit perut</malay>
[oh] most of your friend also do at fort canning [ah]
okay
I see
okay <malay>jadi mak andam</malay> is not requirement unless you have (err) several outfit change
[oh] okay okay <malay>jadi sama</malay> [lah] I think for my side I think I don't want to have <malay>mak andam</malay> I want to have like the makeup artiste is okay and also to see whether I have (err) ya
(mm) but but she have no experience
true also
okay
okay
ya [lah] ya [lah] ya [lah] cause you want what you want [lah] okay
okay
I I even thought of what you know because <malay>dekat</malay> (err) <malay>katong sana</malay> [kan] there are many (err) salon ya then we thought (err) go there early ya
but that will be strange
(mm)
ya cause very close [eh] because <malay>yang</malay> grand mercure <malay>ada banyak</malay> salon ya how good [ah] that's why I have to go there okay
peranakan day [ah] so I think ya I have to go there early
ya <malay>dia pun</malay> I email <malay>juga</malay> (mm)
(mm)
okay so that part
ya I have to ask #dewi# to do research [lah] then from there
most likely we also will do the same thing [lah] <malay>kita tak akan ambil mak andam jadi</malay> [ah] the day <malay>macam</malay> one off <malay>saja</malay> [lah]
[oh] okay <malay>mak andam</malay> is for rental cause they got special rate
ya [lah] and another thing I was thinking whether should do photography after the wedding or that day
then the makeup will have to tip top after the wedding [mah]
okay
<malay>tapi</malay> of course photography on the same day is the best [lah] cheapest [ah] cheapest [lah] because you do makeup all that
[oh] okay so we do the <malay>nikah</malay> and the photography after that
okay I was thinking the peranakan house the terrace house over there and then east coast
(mm)
okay another thing I thought of so is inside the wedding the the hotel itself but must inform them right
cause (err) lynn told me don't know must sign agreement I don't know if you remember okay
okay now I cannot decide where to take photo because I haven't gone to the venue
<malay>paling senang dekat dalam</malay> hotel <malay>tu tak boleh gerak-gerak</malay>
(mm) okay
ya
(mm) ya <malay>dia nya</malay> swimming pool I ever went it looks nice [lah] so I think I need to ask the person on that day
whether to see okay
(mm) we can go up and see [ah]
(mm)
<malay>bila</malay>
really [ah] you mean you all what wedding day
you want to book the hotel [oh] we thought of booking hotel for you all so
!huh! is
okay
lucky you tell me [eh] cause we really thought of booking for you all also then dinner we can go eat ya okay
okay ya okay ya let us know [lah] because we thought of (err) booking [lah] ya
okay
okay then ya so
three three (err) I think for for your case [kan] <malay>tiga jam macam</malay> okay [ah] very manageable
ya it's is very fast I like that
<malay>apa yang</malay> teething problems
I I know one problem that you all face is the
the because of the shortage of space right the clearance of the the food I I saw is a problem <malay>aku</malay> outside [mah] but I can see people no space sit ya
(mm)
!huh! [oh] they stay back [oh]
(mm)
<malay>pasal panas</malay> [oh] ya [lah] <malay>hari tu memang panas jadi yang dekat</malay> (err) lawn <malay>tu</malay> mostly <malay>budak-budak</malay> parents <malay>semua tak pergi</malay> [seh] [ah]
yes yes I saw I saw it's quite (um)
ya I I I also saw a lot of people came to witness the <malay>nikah</malay>
[oh] okay
[oh] okay
for for my case okay [lah] <malay>terus</malay> settle
(um) but it's during the (err) the you you guys got the how is it how I can't remember the walk in [ah] how you guys did the walk
is straight away just sit on the okay
then after that all the way there and then
[oh] then after that then eat lunch then go back and sit again [ah]
cause for for (err) the place I have right there's a stage <malay>jadi kalau kirakan</malay> okay I was think I can rent for three hours three hours so I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> start at eleven thirty
then everything finished at twelve thirty
[eh] wait [ah]
I remember is a eleven to three [ah] ya
okay
[ah] I think it's four hours total ya ya
okay ya there will be there will be delay yes definitely
<malay>lagi-lagi kalau apa tu</malay> like what you said
<malay>betul juga tapi</malay> wedding <malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>orang macam</malay> panic [kan] <malay>jadi ada sikit</malay> problem <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma apa tu</malay>
(err)
the itinerary so example eleven thirty my <malay>nikah</malay> so
<malay>nikah</malay> plus (err) tea ceremony ya
that is the main main core concept
[oh] I cannot say like I have to have at least sixty percent I must know what's happening
okay
ya [lah] <malay>siapa nak ikut</malay> to the letter [kan] yes
she don't care
yes
okay cause I thought the <malay>nikah</malay> and the tea ceremony will be done the first thing in the morning
[ah] that's the thing I need to go down and see the venue how it looks like whether ya
they will delay
<malay>kirakan</malay> I want to like <malay>macam</malay> eleven thirty to one for example is <malay>nikah</malay> tea ceremony and then
that's also the time <malay>kalau nak tukar baju pun boleh tukar</malay> [lah]
then one thirty
lunch time
so one thirty to about (err) one thirty two thirty three thirty ya about one thirty to three thirty [ah] then whole lunch [ah] then in between before the one thirty starts right (err) we have the walk in [lah] then from the walking then that means about one forty five blah blah blah some some
some plans [lah] some activity [lah] so for about ya
okay <malay>tapi kalau</malay> COVID <malay>dia ada</malay> different kind of rules [ah] only the twenty percent will be selected you can mingle
(err) out of that twenty they have to be in their table [oh] but <malay>mungkin</malay> maybe <malay>masa tu</malay> policy <malay>belum</malay> start [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> I went to the Grand Mercure right and (err)
#katong# and they mentioned the same thing twenty
close family can mingle
[ah]
<malay>tapi tapi kalau ada apa-apa nanti kena</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> COVID infection [ah]
okay
hopefully [lah] okay
okay I see but only worry like (err) <malay>yang</malay> table <malay>yang tak</malay> mingle boring [ah] <malay>duduk tengok</malay> each other <malay>makan</malay> cannot mix with the you know
so I thought of what you know get some emcee or what [ah] ya
okay
<malay>kalau</malay> [ah]
<malay>pasal</malay> your wedding <malay>lain</malay> [tau] your wedding can mingle is a is different cause (err) your time can be taken [ah] you know speaking [ah]
<malay>kena</malay>

Pan Pacific service suite

better
it'll be better to have
an apartment instead of
a normal hotel room
(mmhmm)
this one you planning to do for <malay>kak</malay> #ain's# birthday right
then
then before that
then before that like before check in or after check in do you plan to do anything
<malay>makan kat mana</malay> for dinner

how many
because of the number of adults that you book [kan]
that's why they follow like
ya
[eh] [eh] sorry sorry
(mmhmm)
I think it's easy [seh] if you get like central
central area <malay>lagi kalau nak makan</malay>
[a'ah]
because I thought like if you know if we have if we go for apartment instead of normal hotel then
<malay>ada</malay>
[oh]
(mm)
is that the kitchen then
<malay>malam-malam lapar ke</malay>
<malay>boleh masak</malay> Maggi
and then
(uh)

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya correct
[oh]
<malay>bangun pagi</malay>
usually like who want to <malay>bangun pagi</malay> I cannot <malay>bangun pagi</malay> man
[eh] <malay>kalau</malay> staycation
have you been to the <malay>yang itu</malay> the art museum
I think you should go I think with kids is fun
because they have that interacting <malay>punya</malay>
I forgot the time she I think the one that #mama# went with <malay>kak</malay> #ain# <malay>dekat</malay>
japan <malay>kat</malay> #tokyo# they went to the japan [one]
then #mama# <malay>cakap ada</malay>
like this one this <malay>macam</malay> interacting <malay>nya</malay> board <malay>gitu</malay> so you can draw your own animals
and because that time then that time she draw a butterfly and then the butterfly that she draw just fly around
[oh] then she excited <malay>macam budak kecil</malay>
ya I think since you got like a child maybe that is maybe that's fun
since [dah] <malay>macam</malay> central central
and then your parents <malay>boleh</malay>
feeling <malay>sikit</malay>
<malay>malam-malam ambilkan gambar</malay>
because I think <malay>dekat</malay> Carousell you can find like cheaper tickets
if not I can find for you also [lor]
actually <malay>tengok-tengok</malay> date [lah] but then if you book december right you can use your voucher [mah]
that around december but I'm not sure when exactly but I'm guessing it's december it'll be credited to your SingPass
then like make use of that [lor]
or maybe if you not using that as a
I mean for your hotel then I think you can use for your activities
ya
is do you think #aryan# is old enough to <malay>masuk</malay>
(mm) then can <malay>boleh pakai</malay> [seh]
hundred dollars
ya my
(uh huh)
sea aquarium
adventure cove
ya
then can also
then they have that lazy river
but then do you think #angah# will
this hotel also nice
but you went to Malayan Council before right to <malay>makan</malay>
have you gone before
I think you went before
[oh] is it
ya
because it's too malay
I mean like since
since #angah# like
I forgot it was a while back
like few years it's like a while back
a while back
(mm) can [ah]
<malay>makan dekat sana ada</malay> that Noosh Noodle Bar
[ah] if you go the if you go the the art museum [kan] [dah] <malay>dekat</malay> like you walk through the helix bridge <malay>lepas tu</malay> [dah] <malay>belok</malay>
then [dah] <malay>sampai</malay> esplanade what esplanade [kan][dah] <malay>dekat</malay>
at Noosh Noodle Bar
and nak <malay>kalau nak mengopi ada</malay> coffee bean
and then <malay>boleh jalan-jalan</malay> can take photos
[eh] we have the same thing
we can quiet for too long
(mm) okay
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
you went so far and you ate you went to japan
to eat a
crazy [ah]
I also don't really like japanese curry
ya
maybe they like it because
that's their idea of curry like our idea of curry is different
ya so when I tasted aside he set up
in singapore dollars
[ah] okay
(mmhmm)
but then I feel like if you go eat overseas I think you don't even
feel like you're spending too much of money on like food
it's like I think I don't think you will mind
did you had the
Luke's Lobster
<malay>yang dekat</malay> #omotesando#
why didn't you eat it's so good
like you know the japanese they very <malay>macam</malay>
generous with their portions so the bun they toast it <malay>dia</malay> [dah] toast <malay>panas-panas</malay>
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> the amount of lobster that they stuffed inside that
thing it's overflowing it's marvellous
ya I feel like <malay>semua orang cakap</malay> it's (um) expensive <malay>lagi mahal</malay> but then I feel like if you record [eh] (uh) record <malay>pula</malay> if you (um)
convert it back right the price is actually the same as the one <malay>dekat</malay> japan because <malay>dekat</malay> japan they have the regular size and size
<malay>dekat sini</malay> they only have size
so actually if you convert it's like twenty
ya
so it's actually pretty similar but because you
having it in your own currency that's why I think like people <malay>nya</malay> mindset <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ni lagi mahal</malay> [seh]
[ah] <malay>berbual</malay> for what
<malay>kat</malay> japan <malay>boleh makan</malay> [pe] but now you're not going japan right so
if you like craving for it just go for it [lah] twenty plus dollars
because I see <malay>dekat macam</malay> online blog <malay>gitu</malay> I feel like it's
okay [lah] <malay>dia macam tak lokek</malay>
because I think they have like fixed
(um) measurement on how many how much lobster to put on the bun
<malay>gitu</malay>
then that time also I had this #yakiniku# you know #yakiniku#
the beef
ya ya ya ya ya I thought you were the one <malay>yang tanya</malay> what is #yakiniku#
Yoshinoya
[oh] no okay #yakiniku# is the
okay [lah] like that is after they #yakiniku# the beef [mah]
but #yakiniku# is basically you get
to grill the the beef
<malay>dekat</malay> the place itself
so they give you raw beef <malay>dia macam</malay> Seoul Garden Seoul Garden <malay>tapi</malay> it's just beef
maybe because they #yakiniku# it in the kitchen you you don't get to do it
but ya
I had the one <malay>dekat</malay> japan also it was so good the halal one
that
that time there was only one halal #yakiniku# outlet
so we went and then we went for (um) during lunch time <malay>dia macam tak</malay> crowded even though there's so many people at the
the #asakusa# temple area
ya
and then they had dish <malay>macam</malay> dish [eh]
they had this <malay>macam</malay>
(um) raw beef set like the bento <malay>tapi</malay> with raw beef
then the griller <malay>dekat depan</malay>
so you get to grill your own <malay>tapi</malay> it's like a bento
it's so nice one of the set was #wagyu# then I'm like
it's so soft [oh] my god
I don't know when we get to go to japan again I'm so sad
if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
I think
dish is like <malay>lauk</malay> right
I mean it is technically [lah] but
okay dish
dish I think I would pick
like
let's see is soup like a dish
ya ya ya it is it is a dish
so that means like #mee soto# is that a dish
do you consider that a dish okay then I will pick
no I won't choose #mee soto# okay I think I will pick
(um)
<malay>apa</malay>
[a'ah] there's like so many things that I like
like I don't mind eating the Luke's Lobster everyday for my rest of my life the <malay>roti</malay>
(hmm)
I don't know
let me see let me think
he if given a choice
I would probably choose a seafood dish though
chicken
<malay>sama macam adik</malay>
but it's a dish [mah] so I thought it's (um) <malay>macam</malay> should be included
okay I think I will choose (um) clam #vongole# #mama# <malay>punya</malay> clam #vongole#
with lots of <malay>cili padi</malay> and (um)
garlic
so good
want to eat ya true alright
okay

staying in that kind of house but okay
I would like to try
what would be the worst buy one get one free sale ever
buy one get one free you get one
like the worst
thing to have buy one get one free
ever
I think it's
a bad thing ya
[a'ah]
(mmhmm) (mm) (mm)

lower on is free

then [ah] if they like talking about things then I feel like I cannot think of any as of now
(um)
good looks
ya I feel like I choose good looks also
like the that like (uh)
[a'ah]
because like how do I say like good fit body you can train to get it
<malay>tapi</malay>
face
face is
<malay>dia</malay> just <malay>kekal</malay>
at your head so I don't think like you know you can have like
you can be <malay>tak</malay> handsome but then have a good (uh) fit body <malay>tapi</malay> I'm like
once you have a fit body <malay>kalau muka tak</malay> handsome then I'm like
(err) you still not a
like you see some model <malay>pun macam</malay>
[eh] <malay>badan dia</malay> buff [seh] <malay>sekali dia pusing</malay> [ah] <malay>kau</malay>

<malay>apakah</malay>
genre drama <malay>atau rancangan</malay> <malay>yang paling anda gemari</malay>

(uh) like for example conjuring <malay>dengan</malay> annabelle
[a'ah]
I don't
I don't think
I think paranormal activity is
(uh) like you know I don't ya
because <malay>dia macam</malay> okay they want to act
make it <malay>macam</malay> as if [oh] <malay>betul betul</malay> happening <malay>betul betul</malay> like
it really happened
[a'ah] the original camera
<malay>abeh macam</malay> if you <malay>macam fikir balik</malay> like
who has the camera on their hand like twenty four seven <malay>gitu</malay>
so I feel like a bit like okay
I mean it's a good <malay>macam</malay>
tactic
something new
maybe <malay>dulu</malay> is a good <malay>macam</malay> good thing for a change [lah]
but then recently I've been watching the bailey
bailey's makeup videos
the makeup mystery and murder makeup murder and mystery
but then I feel like she always
don't know I like the way she tells the story <malay>macam</malay> very interesting like she doesn't <malay>macam</malay> she talks a lot but it is like she doesn't <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam tak</malay> boring <malay>gitu</malay>
you know some people <malay>nanti dorang macam berbual berbual</malay>
and then halfway it gets boring because <malay>macam</malay> too draggy
<malay>tapi</malay> and then this
bailey she just knows how to like
make sure everybody is not
ya I I finished all the ones <malay>dekat</malay> Facebook
<malay>dekat</malay> YouTube is still ongoing
the longer ones right

(mm) kids
I didn't know the story was out on Netflix <malay>macam</malay> a few years ago I thought <malay>dia baru keluar</malay>

<malay>dia keluar bila</malay> two thousand eight [kan] [eh] two thousand eighteen
the movie <malay>keluar</malay>
[oh] the movie is just recently
[oh] okay okay okay okay okay
[oh] okay
why recently Netflix <malay>macam dorang</malay> released so many <malay>macam</malay> documentaries

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
and she effectively you know
expecting

I would wish for
what I would wish for
I think first things first I wish for no poverty in the world
and then
is there something that you always wanted to
something that you wanted for like so long
<malay>macam</malay> [dah] <malay>lama nak</malay> [lah] like you wish
this can happen you wish
(mmhmm)
<malay>sampai sekarang sama</malay>
or is it
so <malay>dari kecil sampai sekarang</malay> you like
okay like when you
[ah] okay okay
[a'ah] [a'ah]
true
<malay>rumah besar</malay> as in like
castle
like
[a'ah]
like your own land
with a swimming pool and then you can have a tennis court badminton court
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
so like <malay>balas jasa gitu</malay>
(mmhmm)
I think everybody
<malay>tapi dulu</malay> when SARS happened
I'm in I think primary school <malay>kot lupa</malay>
I think primary school
but then it
[oh]
ya then <malay>dia tak serabak</malay> now [lah] like
<malay>ni pun</malay>
(mmhmm)
SARS is just singapore
<malay>tapi</malay> COVID is like
from one country then <malay>lepas tu</malay> another country then <malay>lepas tu tiba-tiba</malay> like the whole world <malay>sampai</malay>
airports <malay>semua tutup</malay> [sia] like
I don't expect
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
father daughter or like kids
(mmhmm)
like <malay>tiba tiba orang tengah kerja macam</malay>
what is it [oh] your your
father is infected with COVID so
<malay>nak kena balik kerja</malay>
I think (uh)
it's the same I think for now
one of the wish is always to have
a mask-free
I'm waiting for the day that we can go mask-free
like finally
I think like [oh]
I think like
these people like some people in the world like let's say the they not taking this <malay>macam</malay> seriously
like he
<malay>tu</malay> [ah]
I mean <malay>tapi sekarang</malay> re-election so I feel like
I'm like one step closer to going to finally going I guess
<malay>tapi macam tu</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>korang nak</malay> the COVID to finish
to end to finally like <malay>macam</malay>
no more new cases <malay>tu semua</malay> everybody to heal
until <malay>tak nak dengar</malay> like to wear mask wash your hands
be hygienic
<malay>tapi orang tak nak dengar</malay> then like
you're not contributing you know then not even safe
okay
a !duh!
<malay>esok kerja</malay> [eh]
[oh] ya ya ya
#sembawang#
<malay>esok kerja petang</malay> [seh]
you know my <malay>tempat kerja ada budak baru</malay>
who
it's a malay guy then he <malay>budak</malay> T
he's like so young
ya
he's on internship and because I thought when he <malay>masuk</malay>
usually <malay>kalau</malay>
ya
ya very funny right
ya I feel like it's so weird
[oh] I didn't really actually get to ask him but it was so <malay>macam terkejut</malay> like [oh] you from polytechnic I'm like [oh] ya
interning gag
I mean like okay then you would be more familiarised with the <malay>macam</malay>
grants and all that
like you know the courses <malay>tu semua</malay> how the works <malay>tapi macam</malay>
I don't think that's a long long term thing
ya I guess
[a'ah]
[a'ah]
that's why because I'm
I'm not even an intern but then they
because I think it's like
<malay>macam</malay> sensitive issue [lah] because they usually <malay>macam</malay>
deal with <malay>macam</malay> money money (um) <malay>orang bayarkan</malay>
<malay>dorang bayar duit tu</malay> join courses <malay>tu semua</malay> so maybe they like
because
that's why they don't let us do that kind of things
they don't let us have an account to do that kind of things just in case we make any mistakes <malay>ke apa ke</malay>
so they will only let the senior <malay>yang kerja lama kat sana tu</malay>
so <malay>kita orang</malay> usually <malay>ada</malay>
<malay>kita duduk</malay> counter [jer] <malay>kat</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> office [ah]
ya then we just answer we just answer like enquiries [lor]
like let's say okay mainly is about passion card [lah]
so [dah] passion card <malay>layan tu ni</malay> but then
I think they like
people
from other working at other places [eh] like customer service wise right if they
okay for example SingPost
the other time they refer a resident to the
to (um) <malay>apa tu</malay> apply for you know the
grant
for the self employee
self-employed people
so basically not all grants is under [lah] then after that they
I think people who don't
visit their community centre often they don't know that
not everything is
under <malay>macam</malay> not everything can <malay>buat</malay> right
[a'ah] especially <malay>kalau macam</malay> the
issue is about government <malay>punya duit</malay> like government <malay>bagi duit</malay> because of this COVID right so they'll think like
ya
so when they
they already like refer them to us then after that <malay>kita orang macam</malay> then they come to the then after that we tell them that
[oh] (um) we actually this this grant is not under us so
then you know <malay>macam tak</malay> happy [lah]
ya but then they are the one who refer us here why you cannot help us so I was like
okay they referred you here without knowing that the cannot do all these
ya then after that the other day got this one <malay>makcik</malay> [lah] she was disappointed because we couldn't help her with the application
because it's also [what]
like
to apply for these grants you have to login your SingPass SingPass
if can
we cannot even like use other people <malay>punya</malay> computer
ya our own public computer to
login to your SingPass because it's [mah]
I mean like okay [lah] if you allowed there's there's
your issue [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> for us is sensitive because
<malay>sekali kalau apa-apa</malay> ya
<malay>sekali</malay> your information is all leaked or what then I'm like okay that's why
I feel like some people should be
understanding about this issue
the other day
the other day (uh)
the right
they referred this resident to
to the to change their address their
ya1
ya
it's so weird right like should know that they are the ones who do all this
ya
so they refer in
<malay>jap tengok dia punya</malay> battery
so when they refer it when we refer right and I was like ya we can change we can change your (uh) at the but then it will
it will take like a few days
but then if you want like immediate then you can go to the then I'm like !huh!
like it's actually weird this kind of things actually happen the other day got also got resident they come to the and they like
(uh) can you help me look for a house
ya they really they really come to the to
ask for everything they ask for literally everything
ya so I said go to but then <malay>dorang cakap</malay> [ah] very far I cannot walk and all
so like
imagine the amount of time spent to explain to them that
(hmm)(hmm)
not everything we can do at
so funny
and then some people they understand [lah] but then you know some people when they like
[oh] but I'm doing this for my mother and then she cannot walk or what then a bit <malay>leceh</malay> so far
<malay>adik</malay> stop
[a'ah]
that's why I say
[ah]
because now
now also everything is online
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
need to go down (mmhmm)
[a'ah]
ya it's like that so yes
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
that was the life every day literally
so the other time also
the other time also there was this one
there was this one resident
<malay>dia cakap</malay> she applied
the (um) financial assistance for the mum and then just recently
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> she passed away
as in the application that the application for the
that means the person <malay>punya</malay> mum
is the one who is supposed to receive the financial assistance right
the she passed away so she asking like if can transfer under his name
then I said cannot [lah] because your situation and your mum situation is different you all not listed living in the same address
but then they keep like arguing <malay>macam</malay>
but
I'm related to her she's my mum why can't I have the money instead
ya
then like that ya it's a needs it's hard it's hard to please everybody
especially if it's like
racial
especially if it's like racial issue <malay>macam</malay>
because I'm malay right and then after that if there's a <malay>makcik</malay> who came
if there's a <malay>makcik</malay> who come by
and then I couldn't help right for example with their their grants or whatever
and then they always said things like
<malay>tolong sikit pun tak boleh kita</malay> [kan] <malay>melayu</malay>
ya and I'm like it's not that
ya exactly
so they gonna play they're gonna play the race card also
so it's like that my <malay>kerja</malay> is like that
that's what I thought like okay I'm not gonna
remain in the for a bit any longer
because by right I use
(mm) ya
at the
ya
ya
(uh) as a housing officer <malay>dekat</malay> dormitory <malay>punya</malay> office
ya so it's not exactly in the dormitory but in their office
so like if the
(mm) I'll be in the office [lor] so basically <malay>kalau</malay> that office is for the foreign workers <malay>kalau</malay> let's say they have
issues with the
employers
[ah]
because they (um) employees from different different company [mah] so that means let's say if the employer don't want to like
(uh)
pay them on time <malay>ke apa</malay> like this kind of problem they will come to the office and <malay>tu</malay>
then when I went to the interview they said to be mentally prepared
because it's super crowded I'm like [oh]
I like okay
but but then I'll be in the office [what]
I told them I was like ya but then maybe you'll be doing <malay>macam</malay> roundings <malay>ke apa ke</malay> so you like
just be mentally prepared [lor]
<malay>dia kata macam</malay> you know <malay>macam</malay> Expo event but every day
(mm)

(mmhmm)
they didn't decrease the pay for them
then your diploma when start
[dah]
that time you went for the medical interview [ah]
[eh] medical interview <malay>pula</malay> the medical check-up

<malay>dorang berbual</malay> english

okay <malay>abang</malay> so how our renovation plans
<malay>hari raya</malay> !wah! you so confident now is still COVID do you think can celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay> yet
it is today
well maybe they will only let direct families because now from from four right four to eight
then eight
is like
direct families
probably will be like less than fifteen
like our siblings four ya I think around there so maybe direct families only can celebrate <malay>hari raya</malay>
in like maybe a parent's house but I think like have like distant relative cannot [ah] too risky
okay
why are we talking about <malay>hari raya</malay>
okay let's go back to the renovation plans ya so you say that we must do it as soon as possible
(uh) how about this month I think we should start to meet the or wait I think we should start research first right
I don't know I I have a lot of ideas actually but I haven't got the time to collate yet but (uh)
I think I want to do like a mood board I think ya mood board
so that I can show the contractor visually because I'm a visual person so I need to show them visually so that they know what I'm talking about
and then I think it will be it will be better it will give a better understanding to the to look at photos instead of just verbally telling them right
so <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> (um)
<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi</malay> Popular I <malay>beli</malay> cardboard
I <malay>beli kertas yang keras tu</malay> then (uh) I
<malay>cari gambar nanti</malay> I print
<malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>cetak</malay> <malay>nanti</malay> I print <malay>lepas tu nanti boleh tampal</malay> [lah] <malay>dekat</malay> cardboard <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>itu itu kena tunggu nanti nanti bila jumpa dengan dia punya</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> designer <malay>itu nanti baru dia bilang baru kita boleh tanya sekarang pun kita kita</malay> just (um)
<malay>kita</malay> just <malay>baca-baca</malay> [jer] <malay>tak tahu betul ke tak ke</malay> [kan]
<malay>buat lawak</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak ada maksudnya</malay>
<malay>kita kita pun tak tahu apa yang</malay> company (err) company <malay>itu nak apa nak</malay>
<malay>tunjuk kita nak bagi kita</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay>
<malay>jadi kita</malay> just
<malay>kita ambil ambil gambar inspirasi</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>letak kat dalam</malay> mood board <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>hari itu</malay> I <malay>dah tunjuk</malay> you <malay>gambar dekat</malay> WhatsApp <malay>dah tengok belum</malay>
WhatsApp
[ha] ya [lah] <malay>habis</malay> group <malay>mana</malay>
<malay>dah tengok</malay>
<malay>corak</malay> [oh] okay [ah] if it's the kitchen then I like the open concept
you know like the english one the not contemporary [ah] english kitchen contemporary
I want a open concept not say open concept like style like people can see from outside
like can see the kitchen from the hall or living room but what I mean open concept is that there's minimal wardrobe because our house is like
so humid is easily mould so
I think the lesser the cabinet wardrobe not wardrobe cabinet the lesser the cabinet will be better
<malay>betul juga</malay> (uh) (uh) [eh] <malay>paling tidak nanti kita masak nanti habis semua</malay> (uh) <malay>apa itu</malay>
(uh) <malay>almari perabot semua berminyak yang hari itu ingat tak yang kita panggil apa itu</malay>
<malay>orang yang</malay> (uh) <malay>cucikan</malay> sofa
<malay>sekali dia cakap dia punya minyak yang melekat itu apa yang kotoran yang melekat itu</malay> actually <malay>dari daripada minyak masak</malay>
(uh) (uh) [lah] okay [lah] then I I have to agree with you [lah] we go we put the partition that means
[eh] ya [lah] correct [lah] when I say open concept it doesn't mean
open concept as in we hack the wall like that's not what I mean what I meant was
open concept as in minimal wardrobe as in
the kitchen is still there but I have this idea
to make the kitchen look bigger we have to
put the you know like those bar top counter
like (um)
[ah] like you know kitchen service usually they will
they will they will prepare the food and then after that they will serve it through the waiter through that counter ya maybe you can get that idea
we can find that idea for our kitchen instead
you think I'm a waiter
!chey! private cook
private cook then like that I must I must I must prepare the all the what receipt [lah] all that [lah] so that you are like my customer like that at home
funny [ah]
ya I know I know okay okay let's let's not deviate from the actual topic again okay so where were we we were at the kitchen right kitchen area
ya so how do you you okay or not with that idea
that bar top counter wiped out of the
ya
ya that's a good idea right ya like (uh)
anyway because when I'm cooking is always like so gloomy and dark inside the kitchen so at least
if there's that that little partition then light light can come in you know like make the kitchen look brighter
and then
(mm)
okay that's settled but I think we shouldn't use the word open concept because I scared the will
(uh) mistook it for the open concept like those did the open concept means
means there's no wall or half wall ya so I think we just tell them we need we want that partition
(uh) or like you say the hole in between ya
okay
<malay>lepas itu</malay> (uh) <malay>yang bahagian luar itu yang dekat</malay> (uh) platform <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>yang yang dulu</malay> actually <malay>nak buat</malay> #musollah# <malay>lepas itu tak jadi</malay>
<malay>sebenarnya bukan nak</malay> hack <malay>nak nak buang</malay> (uh) <malay>yang lama punya</malay> platform <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>sebab</malay> platform <malay>itu satu dah bunyi dua dah reput</malay>
<malay>tiga kayu pun dah nak dah nak terkopek dah dah nak reput</malay> [lah] <malay>itu dah nak</malay> (err) <malay>dia punya hujung itu dah terkopek jadi macam ada lubang</malay>
<malay>lepas itu bawah</malay> platform <malay>itu pun kita tak tahu jadi sarang binatang apa mungkin sarang cicak</malay>
<malay>mungkin sarang labah-labah sarang semut tapi sarang semut tu makanan</malay>
(mm)
[eh] but the other day I went through (um) this hard zone or something [lah] the website right
like people write reviews on renovation and stuff then I happen to come across (uh) this person
(uh) he wrote he wrote that he did the platform for bedroom
and then plus something else [lah] then it's already two K
just the platform
(uh huh) <malay>buat sementara waktu kita boleh letak</malay> vinyl <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>lepas itu nanti dah ada</malay>
<malay>letak</malay> vinyl <malay>dan kalau ada</malay> budget then <malay>baru boleh tambah</malay> platform
(mm)
okay <malay>tak apa itu nanti</malay>
I put (uh) under
(uh) extra budget column
in the planning [lah] so but then we okay like that we settle the needs first rather than the wants
the needs I think there's quite a few okay the kitchen and then [ah] the service balcony you know the
the doorway (um) between the service balcony and the kitchen there's the there's the grills (uh) window right window grills so
I thought I want to hack one segment of it so that the door will be bigger and then again the kitchen will be brighter
right
ya because now now the window is the old style one right the flip one because is to for the air to go in and out but then
if let's say we replace with glass
there won't be anymore air coming in and out but because we already hack half of it [what] so
actually the air in and out will come from by via the door instead of the window you know so I think should be okay [ah]
that [one] I that [one] that idea came from <malay>tak</malay> I <malay>nampak hari itu</malay> my friend <malay>dia tengah buat</malay> renovation <malay>sekarang</malay>
<malay>lepas itu dia</malay> upload <malay>dekat</malay> (uh) story
<malay>lepas itu dia pakai</malay> glass <malay>itu</malay> [ah] (um) <malay>dia pun ada</malay> that same same <malay>sama punya segi</malay> balcony <malay>lepas itu dia</malay>
<malay>pakai sama apa itu</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia dia yang dia yang</malay> I <malay>nampak daripada</malay> story <malay>dia</malay> [lah] <malay>yang dia pakai</malay> glass <malay>itu kalau tidak</malay> I <malay>pun jadi tak tahu macam mana nak</malay> replace that that <malay>tingkap dengan</malay>
<malay>dengan apa</malay> so idea <malay>dia datang itu</malay> [lah] I <malay>ternampak</malay> story my friend
<malay>dia ada</malay> tag <malay>hari itu tapi</malay> I <malay>tak ingat ada dia ada</malay> tag (uh)
<malay>dia dia</malay> popular <malay>juga apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nama dia</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ingat</malay> [ah]
ya <malay>habis sekarang</malay> I scolding [ah] everytime they upload video
[ah] <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>pergi intai dia punya</malay> video <malay>tengok apa</malay> progress <malay>cari</malay> idea
(mm)
actually not bad [leh] you know my ideas which I come out like just visually in my mind like I haven't do any research yet
then the things that I've told you before right like any ideas I have to do this and that (uh) different parts of the house
actually it can be done because after I do research
!wah! I really find some pictures on Instagram and all that like really have the idea visualise
(uh) came to real life you know really [eh] so actually my idea is valid so you must trust my ideas
no that's not what I meant what I meant is when I go and
like look through like renovation company they always upload their portfolio and their
their houses that they already renovated so
when I look through then some parts like bits of here and there like example I wanted a like (uh) extendable
counter top which I don't even know whether it can be done I I know there's the fixed one but I don't know whether it can be the extendable one like those
table we saw but this [one] is the quartz top kitchen top so
and then and then there's one time I really saw the picture there's some there's a house that did the same thing so it can be done
[ah]
okay so after the kitchen so balcony so balcony anything else [oh] ya of course the window we have to change the whole house because
there's too many insects and that's like
(err) like the window grill I don't know
so but then that [one] I haven't research (uh)
<malay>abang</malay> you <malay>boleh tolong tengok-tengokkan tak apa jenis tingkap yang ada</malay> you <malay>tolong</malay> scolding [kan] <malay>ke kat jiran-jiran daripada bawah</malay> I
I [kan] <malay>tadi nampak juga ada satu itu dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>tingkap cantik</malay>
<malay>dia satu yang dia pakai yang</malay> (uh) <malay>sorot punya yang lagi satu yang buka punya</malay> (uh) <malay>yang macam ketat</malay>
(uh) <malay>ketat punya macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>yang ada yang ada</malay> handle [eh]
[ah] <malay>tapi cantik dia macam</malay> simple <malay>saja tapi cantik</malay>
<malay>tapi masalahnya sekarang</malay> sliding <malay>pun binatang masuk mungkin dah haus agaknya dah bertahun</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>tingkap</malay> okay actually <malay>dia orang cakap kalau boleh cari</malay> supplier <malay>sendiri pun bagus tapi sudah</malay> [lah]
<malay>ini tingkap lagi nak buat satu rumah</malay> already <malay>yang</malay> [kan] <malay>sudah</malay>
but (uh) ya
I think I think it's because [ah] it's already old [lah] that's why the insect can come in but actually supposed supposedly not [what] it's supposed to be tight [what] like fit
fit to measure measure to fit I don't know
made to measure
ya
then you remember the (uh) the other day I told you
I found out the window
there's this [one] capping went off and then that's why the lizard can come in and out of the house
because there's a huge hole so easy for them to come in and out
that's the thing that's why must renovate because
you see all the trunking and the electrical (uh) wiring the trunking for the electrical wiring
there is like so many holes these lizards like holes like outside our house also
I tell you you must go and tell our
go and write a letter and tell them to put something the killer the insect trap I mean the lizard trap
because they have been breeding over inside the trunking of the wires you know
hello who are you talking to my wife is in front of you
are you okay
ya [lah] that's why I told you then every night there's this super loud
I think the lizard have grown from small to big you know seriously because
<malay>dulu bunyi dia tak macam itu kuat</malay> [tau] <malay>dulu bunyi dia perlahan sahaja</malay> I <malay>bila kat dapur baru bunyi</malay>
<malay>sekarang daripada bilik hujung dah boleh dengar maknanya apa maknanya dia dah besar dah dah sedap makan dah sempat membesar</malay> you <malay>tak bunuh dia sebab itu</malay> I <malay>cakap kena panggil</malay>
<malay>orang itu yang tangkap tangkap cicak itu</malay>
<malay>ini sesi mengadu nasib ke</malay>
ya that's why I tell you our house is like already really time for
time for a renovation already cannot make cannot [lah] I cannot <malay>tahan</malay> already is
it's not that I don't want to cook for you but it's because sometime the fear you know the fear
hinders me from staying in the kitchen very long so that's why sometime I want to
wash the plates like late at night I'm too scared it's not that I lazy or what you must understand that is because you know the
the the the knowledge that there's there's a lizard inside the kitchen and it's super near it's just below the stove
makes me have that like phobia [lah] because
because I know it's big it's not a small lizard
so imagine if suddenly appear the other day I
you you heard me the other day you heard me right almost I almost cried right because
the lizard just suddenly super loud at my ears and then like like I'm like so shock okay
I'm so shocked and terrified and you know I got phobia with all these insects
ya so you better do something
I ask you to call pest control also you haven't call right
it's not about time it is the time you remember renovaid we watch don't wait until our kitchen become like the renovaid
(uh) recipients
[eh] but [eh] but you know what there's a new series of renovaid channel five belinda back you know
they took belinda as the host back !yay! belinda very good compared to the other hosts
hello people watch renovaid to watch the house [ah] you watch the host [ah] hello
more thin
okay later you see her you go and ask her okay
[eh] but the new season (uh) the other day I was (uh) randomly (uh) looking for right
and then I saw (uh) one of the actually posted the renovaid advertisement so I think they are the one who will handle the
(um) the renovation this time round this season because the the previous season it was [ah] what is it called three D innovations right
ya I think this [one] this time round is this company !aiya! I forgot the name but ya later I I show you again
ya I think this time round so maybe we can actually (uh) watch renovaid few episodes first then after that we can try to meet them then see how
if they their style okay then we can actually meet meet the this same this [ah] if not actually (uh) three D innovation is good [leh]
the only thing I'm concerned is that ours is not a the big project not the
not those above twenty five K so three D is like quite reputable but then
but then if to think back they actually do for
do for the low
(uh) what do you call that low income families [eh]
then maybe though I don't know I'm not sure maybe can just try inquire them [ah] because our
but looking at our renovation we we want to do the whole house but we don't have the budget so
ours is considered the small budget [lah] maybe we can start with the kitchen plus two toilet plan first then maybe we see how if the
that's a lot of things we actually just replace also right like what [ah] you remember
tap
I remember he I remember he came
he didn't come for few weeks so funny the story I remember he came
he he was he disappeared a few like he for a few months right then after that we ask
when is he coming back because there are still some things incomplete or not proper [lah] okay it's actually complete but not proper only so
still need to be modified and stuff then we we keep asking him to come back and then he
say postpone postpone then eventually when we come back
imagine when he came back (uh)
[oh] we didn't even say anything but he himself say that (uh) we we call
him a a liar but we didn't even say that you know suddenly and then he just went off out of the gate like <malay>merajuk</malay>
you <malay>tahu macam merajuk perempuan</malay> [ah] okay [lah] okay [lah] <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>saya tipu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya tipu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] bye bye
emotional [ah] uncle <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tak boleh lupa</malay> [eh] <malay>kelakar</malay>
ya but his job also not proper really and then now not even like three years [eh] the toilet you see the
the flooring the tiles in the toilet there's like white patches and then the
what do you call that the (uh) what not grout grout is what not the grout what you call that
not the cement the one the white colour one in between
the one they use to glue the tile that [one]
okay whatever you call it [ah] ya that [one] also some already (uh) like (uh) <malay>apa itu</malay>
(uh) wear and tear already when you want ya
we should just call handyman [seh] to install our this [one] the only thing that he helped is the
the re-piping only [lah] that [one] okay [lah] but even so (uh) remember the
the also not proper
hollow [eh]
it's not supposed to be like that
and then remember we actually paid a more expensive tile and then is nicer and then
even though it's more slippery but it's still for toilet we ask [what] we ask the tile person right
he say for toilet but then and then he claimed
(uh) and then after that when the day comes he suddenly bring his own tile then what for he ask us to go to #hafari# right
he ask us to go and see the tile but actually he already got a tile in his hand he already know what he want to do for us already <malay>merepek</malay> right
then [ah] then after that (mm)
either that or he know that he never do correctly [lah] he maybe if he never cut properly or what it's not like wastage
because if it's an expensive of course we will we will count him account him accountable [what] right because ya it's a expensive tile
maybe [lah] he want to save that way or what !alamak! then I regret [seh] <malay>sekarang menyesal</malay> [seh] <malay>tak pakai</malay> tiles <malay>yang kita pilih</malay>
<malay>dah bersusah payah kita pergi</malay> #hafari# <malay>lepas itu pilih yang kita nak lepas itu dia suka-suka hati pula habis kita pun tak tahu datang kita pergi</malay> ya [kan] <malay>saja</malay>
(mm)
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia cakap tak tak jadi jadi tak</malay> (uh) <malay>tak licin tak jatuh</malay>
ya but the good thing but the good thing we had this contractor at least is a experience for us like the next time you know what to look out for already
actually actually we also don't know right we want to pick the contractor or the right but then you see both also got pros and cons so we just
hope [lah] we just hope we get a good one that's why I say research very important that's why I tell you even though I ask you
we meet (uh) already but doesn't mean we select this month actually it's just to compare quotation because
the first appointment it will be free and then they will give out the quotes
ya they just give us rough idea there's no three D or whatever <malay>pun</malay> so
they give us a quote at least we know (uh) like we compare with other
so we know already actually this price actually come for which which which component like
is it the (uh) is it the accessories or
ya is it the tilings is it everything so at least you can compare what is the market price you know
ya so actually the more we go and survey also the better it's not it's not about making you feel confused or what it's not for is not the case
because really it will help you in the quotation
ya
<malay>habis</malay> (uh) <malay>nak kena</malay> plan <malay>nak kena</malay>
plan <malay>itu lagi</malay> budget <malay>lagi nak kena</malay> plan budget <malay>nanti</malay> you <malay>bilang</malay> I <malay>nanti</malay> I <malay>buatkan</malay> breakdown
[kan] so <malay>kita boleh jimat banyak sebab apa</malay> [kan] toilet <malay>pun kita baru buat cuma</malay> maybe <malay>kalau</malay> tiles <malay>itu memang</malay>
<malay>tak bagus itu tukar saja</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia punya</malay> slope <malay>pun ingat tak kita</malay> [kan] <malay>suruh dia buat</malay> slope <malay>jadi air pun mengalir betul pergi kat longkang itu tapi</malay>
<malay>pun masih bertakung</malay> [tau] I <malay>cuci</malay> toilet <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>tahu masih bertakung macam tak betul dia punya</malay> slope <malay>dia</malay>
(uh) (uh) <malay>tapi yang macam</malay> accessories <malay>macam tempat mandi</malay> (uh) <malay>apa itu picit-picit nak cebok</malay> [ah] <malay>tu semua</malay>
(uh) <malay>boleh pakai balik</malay> [ah] so at least <malay>itu dah</malay> save cost <malay>sebab itu pun</malay> under <malay>dalam</malay> quotation <malay>juga</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu dah</malay> save cost [lah] <malay>lagi perabot pun kalau kat rumah</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> let's say <malay>ada</malay> budget <malay>untuk buat yang rumah punya pun</malay> actually <malay>perabot tak payah cuma kita</malay> just <malay>ambil gambar</malay> [ah] <malay>kita tunjukkan gambar dia perabot-perabot yang kita ada</malay>
<malay>tengok tema apa yang sesuai dengan perabot kita sebab perabot kita pun</malay> considered
(uh) <malay>apa itu macam</malay> modern <malay>apa</malay> modern minimalist <malay>pun boleh sebab warna kelabu macam itu</malay> [kan] <malay>senang sikit</malay> [lah]
(mm) modern <malay>juga tapi lampu pun kita dah tukar ingat tak</malay> (mm)
<malay>lagi apa</malay>
<malay>lagi apa</malay> [eh] <malay>kita dah tukar</malay> [eh]
so far <malay>yang kat dalam</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> ya [lah] [kan] <malay>lampu</malay> (uh) ya so hopefully
hopefully that [one] will reduce the cost [ah] cause
ya because every because the quotation is every single item they will list down for you
so every single thing that we can checklist (uh) off like check no check tick off
tick off means you already have [ah] that [one] already save save save save then that's where it will come to the total cost
so if we can actually we can actually save back that two K that we did for our toilet also good enough already
(mm) <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang</malay> plan <malay>dia</malay> is <malay>ini tak</malay> standard plan is one (uh) kitchen two toilet
[ah]
[ah] package ya two standard
<malay>sebab itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak buat</malay> kitchen <malay>saja ini susah memang dia</malay> comes together so might as well <malay>buat saja</malay>
<malay>sebab kalau kita sikit-sikit</malay> you <malay>tengok sikit-sikit kita buat tiga</malay> K <malay>habis kalau kerja tak sempurna pun tengok kita pun bingit</malay> then end up <malay>kita tetap kena buat yang betul punya</malay> [kan]
so <malay>kita betul-betul buat sekaligus</malay> [lah] <malay>lagi pun</malay> toilet
<malay>lagi pun</malay> (uh) <malay>bilik air dengan dapur dah sebelah-sebelah</malay> [kan] <malay>habis kita nak rombak itu lagi kita nak pecahkan tembok itu</malay> [ah]
[eh] <malay>sekali terus habuk semua</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya and after that ya
and
ya then the
[ah] <malay>betul</malay>
<malay>lagi bilik bilik</malay> #aqi# <malay>pun</malay>
(mm) <malay>bilik</malay> #aqi# <malay>pun dia punya lantai pun dah kopak itu kalau nak pasang</malay> vinyl vinyl <malay>sahaja</malay>
<malay>dah berapa</malay> (uh) that time eight hundred [kan] <malay>lapan ratus</malay> vinyl <malay>sahaja dah lapan ratus habis ini</malay>
[oh] double
[ah]
ya and then now this renovation I don't know if they can take out and then put back the same one
but anyway if (uh) whatever it is also we can call back the same we can tell them we want the same (uh) the same supplier
then they will deal with the contractor or actually don't need (uh)
they will give us the timeline then we will just inform our own (uh) contractor for the vinyl right
[ah] when they can come over and do this but I think can take out because ours is the click click function right
[ah]
<malay>kita kena buka balik sebab nak kena pecahkan balik dekat pintu</malay> toilet <malay>itu semua nak kena</malay>
(mm) <malay>kalau kita buat balik</malay> [lah]
<malay>itu</malay> [kan] <malay>pintu</malay> toilet <malay>itu</malay> [kan] <malay>dah reput bawah dia itu yang itu nak kena</malay> <malay>nak kena</malay>
hack <malay>nak kena</malay> plaster <malay>balik</malay>
<malay>semua akan</malay> affected
<malay>tapi ini</malay> click function [kan] vinyl <malay>itu</malay> remember
ya it is the newest click function that [one] right
ya is a new technology that time click and all that's why you think you can do your own vinyl remember
that's why you thought you want to do your own [one] but how can I told you we must cut it according to the measurement
how you you how you cut
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>ini ini kena potong kena apa kena</malay> measure <malay>sembarang saja</malay>
<malay>entah nanti tak tersempurna lagi</malay> [ha]
[ha]
<malay>entah tengok itu cacat</malay>
<malay>tak boleh dah haus</malay> you <malay>tengok dia punya</malay>
<malay>dia punya tengok ini dah</malay> <malay>hitam hitam itu maknanya dia dah ada</malay> gap [lah] <malay>dia dah ada jarang-jarang</malay> in between <malay>dia punya ini kayu</malay>
[ah]
then how how because vinyl <malay>pun boleh kembang ikut</malay> (uh) <malay>panas atau sejuk</malay> [tau] <malay>bilik</malay>
[ah] <malay>dalam bertahun</malay> [ah] <malay>ini ini pun macam tak tukar</malay> [ha] <malay>ini dah kembang</malay> [lah] <malay>ini nampak</malay> line <malay>dia ada</malay> gap
<malay>lepas itu tak boleh ada</malay> gap <malay>itu</malay> hit <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah ini merekah</malay> [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
ya that's why later it will chip off like the one in (uh) kids room
[oh]
ya
(uh) (uh) [eh] <malay>ini tak bagus ini</malay> I think <malay>murah punya ini bukan yang</malay> vinyl [tau] <malay>ini yang</malay>
<malay>murah punya sebab itu dia kena air dah menggelembung</malay>
[eh] (mm)
I remember while we met the the company
I remember we met the company
I remember we when to the company (uh) he mentioned actually the more we do the the cheaper they will give [what] remember
and then because we got no budget at that point of time
(mm)
ya
K but
but that time that time but now since you also want to do for the hall right the hall I cannot that [one] cement is too cold not good for the feet ya
you know (uh) overlay also cheaper rather than we hack the cement so hall we never hack that [one] also already cut off from the quotation so good already then
then the kitchen also I thought we do vinyl because I remember they said it was fire is (uh) I remember is they say it was fireproof right
then kitchen then is easily clean [eh] you want you want to consider kitchen vinyl vinyl
(hmm)
vinyl
(mm)
cause we have to think how like we are really can can clean easily right
but vinyl cannot pick the one that has many groove this [one] remember this [one] got two option we this [one] is still the cheaper one then there's one more the the most move [one] without lesser groove
ya
maybe that [one] cannot see the whole kitchen because kitchen
later will have oil splat and all that you know so it can go in between then ya bacteria you know
maybe want to consider later can go the showroom again then we see the different if there's not much different then okay we just stick to the old one
but if there's a lot of different then we we should go for the one with the smoother lesser [ah] grooves
ya because kitchen there's a lot more stuff you know
and then any ya all this splat and all that if it's in between and then we never clean it properly is all bacteria some more kitchen has to be the cleanest place
(mm)
ya of course but if is there's more groove then it will be harder because even if you use you know now we are using that that water mop right the
mop (uh) water sucking mop [what]
that [one] that [one] you won't go into the groove
ya [lah] it suck water the mop suck water right
[ah]
okay water absorbing mop
[oh]
[oh] that [one]
that [one] very expensive that [one] is mop plus vacuum
ya wireless is good but [ah] make sure it's not heavy some heavy like Dyson last time the older one very heavy
but Dyson don't have that two function you know it's famous [eh] that two function mop plus vacuum
it's famous
<malay>dia orang pandai</malay> [kan] [eh]
after after the renovation
not sucking water absorbing mop
ya but the sponge also very old (uh) [oh] now you change to three M already I thought the I thought the one you bought at japan home
ya now is the three M [one] but the the sponge is so expensive to refill right
!huh! difficult have [what]
but but better than the japan home
better than the japan home [one] you go and find no
only that brush [sial] no wonder on sale then after that clearance
other branch don't have
refill
[ah]
okay so (uh) actually [oh] I forgot to tell you I (uh) I sign up through Renopedia
and then (um) through there there will be contacting me [ah] like they ask me to fill in my details just like that
they even (uh) ask me to select the budget how much we there's a few selection [lah] so
I I click I click on one of them the the one follow our following our budget
and then like the that instruct interest interested
then will contact us [lah] through either through mail or WhatsApp ya so I don't know I just feel that maybe through Renopedia then at least like more reliable or what
I don't know because because if let's say the companies doesn't do well then it will reflect back also to Renopedia [what] right
so is all go back to our own research [ah]
actually they say (um) doesn't mean the very the company [eh] very reputable can be trusted means it's good
actually it's back to the individual so doesn't
so I'm not supposed to just list shortlist the (uh) company but I must also research (uh) and
look for the specific
ya
because ya because sometimes they say the also may
[ah] hop companies
correct
ya we can we can request you know when we go down to their showroom or their
ya correct
we can select one
and then (uh) also don't pay anything first
okay so
ya so after this I will
show you the mood board I do the mood board I go buy the cardboard and then I'll do the mood board then I show you
then (err)
I already shortlisted the that like
I don't know like maybe we can go (uh) down and (uh) have a appointment with them
I shortlist a few already other than the one Renopedia give [lah]
ya (uh) but I haven't show you then I I even I even (uh) wrote down their names the
(uh)
so this saturday how about this saturday saturday we are free
you want go for our first appointment
[oh] ya
remind me to buy the
ya ya correct because I also need time actually I I need to repair the mood board first before we go down [what]
(mm)
it must be a balance [ah] we don't we don't want that only listens to what we want
but also suggest things whatever that can be improved
and also not those who only one they're designed to be
[ah] to be turn into reality ya but then don't want to listen to our requirement because now our renovation is a need because of certain things in the house

<malay>aku tengok</malay> drama [jer] the world of married
it's about this girl she's very successful <malay>macam dia jadi</malay> the associate director
of all doctors I think or of doctors in her company then she got
a husband that looks younger but is actually the same age as her [ah]
then what happened is that her husband is actually cheating on her
in the first place <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak tahu</malay> whether she
he really cheat <malay>dekat dia ke tak</malay> eventually [ah] she found out [ah] and about the girl and everything
then there's a lot of drama with the girl cause the girl <malay>macam</malay>
although <malay>dia tahu</malay> that he is a married man <malay>dia tetap nak dengan</malay>
that guy [ah] then that eventually
(um)
because the guy has always been <malay>macam</malay>
living off from her wealth
so <malay>dia</malay> the wife
was actually very very very
(um)
afraid that he would take every everything of her wealth
the son everything from her
so she plan her divorce properly
then but then in the end <malay>dorang</malay>
(uh) <malay>cerai</malay> [lah]
then <malay>cerai</malay> the the wife manage to take all her wealth back
and left the guy with nothing
actually there's a lot of drama [ah]
but I'm just like summarizing then
two years later the guy actually became very very successful and he
he got married with the girl
but actually I think he still have like
feelings of
like if you hate someone so much right maybe you actually kind of like love them also I don't know
or like leftover feelings from the marriage [ah] because
actually he got say that
he like he love
both of them
ya and then like
people can say how how is that possible how can you love two women at the same time and then he keep on saying that
I love
(uh) you you don't understand unless you in my situation but I really love them
entire time and then he used this (uh) phrase
[ah] loving loving some falling in love is not a crime then I'm just like <malay>apa</malay> [seh]
ya
but
now like the story I <malay>masih kat</malay> episode nine so like
(uh) they got divorce but then
the (uh) kay the son right is so irritating [seh] <malay>dia</malay> [dah] <malay>besar pun dia macam</malay>
<malay>macam selenger selenger gitu</malay>
ya so
now I think the
the wife the ex-wife
is like
developing feelings for this guy
but then
(um)
she like restrained herself
cause <malay>dia tak nak</malay>
<malay>anak dia ataupun dia tak nak macam</malay> involve
in this kind of thing again [ah] drama again
ya
(mm)
but then I heard that
I mean [lah] I don't know cause #Syamsul Yusof# has always been
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> how to say [eh] <malay>banyak</malay> rumours <malay>pasal dia</malay> like you know remember about Diana Danielle also
ya
but I think that is the risk of falling in love [what] like you cannot expect the person you love to today to be the same person tomorrow like they will always change
ya and Bella
but they got back together
but he has a long list of crime record here in Malaysia I mean in Singapore [kan]
because I heard that he stole something and everything
I mean he really got really really <malay>macam</malay> soul soulless again
but
I don't know [lah] how to say about him but I feel that he keeps on screwing things over and over and over again
[oh] wells
ya
ya
but
I don't know [lah]
[ah] up to him [lah] he celebrity [lah]
but you know (um) you know I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [seh] if I want to do my hair tomorrow <malay>ke tak</malay>
ya the original price is about three hundred fifty [seh] and hundred fifty for three hundred fifty treatment
then right I see their steps like firstly they will like massage
then after that they will like put essential oil for you to relax then they will put something for your scalp then they wash
then after that they put like this
beads then they crush it then they put like the medicine the carotese medicine or what
then after that they steam
after they steam then (uh)
okay already like they blow dry
(mm) I like I mean I've booked for tomorrow but I don't know what time what time you going school [ah]

two more one year plus
till I end my work

<malay>tak sabar</malay> [seh]
I never know why
well cause maybe you don't really get sense of security there like everyday it's like it's playing with your anxiety did you do something wrong or not
ya
why I mean like even if I were to continue my studies I don't think I'll be in the same school as you
is it cause you <malay>tak</malay>
(uh) used with your friends <malay>lagi kot</malay>
!huh! they you mean you don't #chiong# last minute [one]

but I thought yours is near the [one]
[orh]
then did they say hi

cause some of the stuff they are like over
overpriced or like they take from Shopee or something
[oh] my god you know like I've been searching for clothes [kan] then most of the clothes <malay>takde</malay> my size [seh] it's like I go to like
AforArcade I go for Modparade I go for Editor's Market actually Editor's Market maybe tomorrow I <malay>tengok</malay> cause
ya tomorrow [oh] my god ya so right I don't know [seh] what I I should like spend on cause I budget myself to only spend like three hundred
so like one hundred fifty gone
then maybe like fifty gone for transport and like nine thirty gone for
(uh) eat (uh) <malay>apa</malay>
and a fifty I mean like another hundred gone for eating
so that would be two hundred fifty then I mean I have like fifty dollars left
like what you cannot also buy [seh] fifty dollars
no I mean for the whole month
ya so confirm cannot save like that
I've been trying to save
that's true some more I pay for the bill and then pay for myself
!hais!
[oh] ya ya that's true

anyway I think [oh] my god ya then after that
I need to buy present for #Anas#

clothes but I thought I wanted to buy him body cause clothes <malay>susah</malay> [ah] for me I need to see his size all then later he cannot wear how
ya some more like clothes hard
cause I don't know whether he will like my taste
but he chose to wear it that's the thing it's
is it then <malay>tak</malay> [kan] I <malay>nak beli</malay> [kan] <malay>dia baju batik</malay> confirm <malay>dia tak beli tak pakai</malay>
no he won't wear purple he say Barney
what serious [ah]
[meh]
exactly he is
[oh] ya that's thing I <malay>takut tak muat</malay> cause
you know got like those like slim fit regular fit all then I don't know all this guy shit
ya that's why I thought just buy <malay>sapu</malay> [jer]
he can <malay>wangi</malay> himself
<malay>lagipun</malay>
that's the easiest
<malay>kalau beli</malay>
(err) clothes then you have to take into
size the design whether it fits
ya
but how is he [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
how is he coping now
in the new work and all
(mm)
<malay>tapi dia kadang-kadang suka</malay> act tough [jer]
!huh!
that's true
like long time <malay>tak jumpa dia</malay>
ya
(mm)
it's okay [lah] one day I see him [lah] slowly
(uh)
okay [lah] but maybe my next like three day off I ask him out
but then I scared he go dating [ah]
cause if he's free he will usually go dating [what]
do you like study math anymore no right
[eh] why you don't want to teach the our neighbour anymore [ah]
(mm)
because like I heard the kid is really struggling as well
ya and then like he needs to take next year and then
he skip his grades are doing really bad right now
so he really needs help
but for me personally right <malay>macam</malay>
for me <malay>mak dia tahu</malay> [seh] <malay>yang dia tengah</malay> struggle then like
<malay>mak dia</malay> just hantar <malay>dia</malay> to like those like
tuition centre
then it like didn't help him then she don't want to teach him also
then I feel that <malay>macam</malay> if you give up on your own son then what about
people outside [seh]
ya
but actually he's such a nice kid [seh] I kind of miss teaching them <malay>tapi</malay> I really <malay>takde</malay> time <malay>untuk dia</malay> !hais!
but he play with my soft toys
like when he was sick he hug
#Didi# the dinosaur
and stuff like that
like a little sick cause his mum didn't want him to skip tuition
[oh] my god I think was only fifty
ya last time you also got paid fifty right
no it was never seventy
it was always fifty #Erra#
ya that's why I stop
is like about ten [ah] eleven
or twelve dollar plus
<malay>satu</malay> hours
ya still not worth it
like I know [lah] I get it <malay>dia macam</malay> mentally draining to teach a kid
some more he's very naughty but
I don't know I just <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> I just really hope that he at least
make it to like
make it well
yes true
but then that's not the end right
ya
you don't even do that much
but they still revamped a lot right
primary school <malay>pun ada</malay> [seh]
ya
but
(uh) I don't know [ah] it's like you know like how this kind of drama always happen then teachers will talk about it I just feel that the teachers should just stop talking about it <malay>macam dorang</malay> like to pry open to
people private affairs [seh]
actually right honestly I've always not be in good terms or have any good
like (err) <malay>apa tu</malay>
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> feeling of a good
relationship I mean
<malay>dengan</malay> teachers
ever since primary school secondary school and days
because I feel that the teachers all <malay>macam</malay> #kaypoh# you know like during my right
the discipline committee actually came down to talk to me like counsel me
and say that I should breakup with my boyfriend my ex [ah] my boyfriend
because it was affecting my studies
then I was like you don't even know me
you know
it's like
who the hell (um)
like
who the hell have time to spy on their own students [seh] but apparently they are so free because they like
some are like if like example like they like hold the couple hold hand or hug in public they will take picture and give the principal something like that [seh] and I was like it's not even illegal to fall in love
I hate I hate the old said old malay thinking like that
I <malay>tak suka</malay> [seh]
so traditional
I don't know [lah]
I mean like they are they are toxic in their own ways but I'm really really glad that we
managed to go through all that
!huh! it's not it it's not
<malay>kita tak pernah lambat</malay> I always <malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
I <malay>pernah lambat</malay>
ya that's why the third time
that was my last time
that last chance
I got it was actually the fourth time already
I usually see the discipline
master or what
no [lah] sometimes I go late
really cause that guy like make me cry before that's why I remember
then he panicked
then [oh] ya then he was not happy because I was
wearing ankle guard
then I say [eh] I injured <malay>mesti pakai</malay> ankle guard colour black cause last time we need to wear white socks right
then I'm like [eh] you want to pick fight with me cause of this <malay>merepek</malay> [seh]
don't know
<malay>tak betul</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay>
[oh] my god ya she is
she was so immature I don't know she was actually quite young to be a coach
I mean okay [lah] whatever you young but never mind [ah]
but she cannot handle the team well [seh]
she <malay>lepas</malay> [kan] at us so many times
I remember she just graduated from and then she was
looking
at the she was looking <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
looking into taking a degree and I think she got a degree like in sports sciences or something
ya definitely early twenties
ya she throw tantrums [seh]
I remember so many people vomited [ah]
after a suicide runs
and then I remember how she just left training halfway cause she was so angry
I don't think I think you skip
ya she left training cause she was so angry that we couldn't catch the ball
we will always like butter butter finger or something
then what [eh] I remember she do the stupid like
(err) push-up
then it was so hot the flooring
<malay>abeh</malay> like we all felt like dogs [seh]
and then I still remember that
she asked us to go
to school at as early as six just to run everyday before school
start
season period
ya
I mean like after all the effort and everything we still didn't get into second round you know
I don't know [ah]
I don't think it's because we not fit you know actually I think we were quite fit maybe it's because we don't have chemistry
they have trust issues cause they scared if once they pass to us
(err) the chances to win is lost
ya because she's crazy
ya that's true
I remember so many people stop
I remember there was this girl <malay>dia macam</malay>
like quite <malay>berbadan</malay> then like she was so <malay>semangat</malay> to go training then after that training I never see her face again
ya
ya ya
but after that you didn't join any sports until
soccer right
[eh]
ya I think I brought the trauma when trauma with me when I <malay>masuk</malay> [ah] <malay>bola</malay> [seh] <malay>masa</malay> I seventeen <malay>kat</malay> cause after that right I <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) I cannot push myself to do better like I will always stop
I feel like it's a mental block
especially I'll feel well I tired I just stop [seh]
and like I I feel it's not normal
like before every match <malay>pun</malay> I very <malay>macam</malay>
nervous <malay>semua</malay> you know
!huh!
<malay>tapi</malay>
like I'm really glad that we actually did sports last time
cause in some way or what
I feel that <malay>dia macam</malay>
help to
discipline us and make us stronger [ah]
cause imagine <malay>kalau kita tak buat</malay> sports [eh] <malay>kita</malay> confirm <malay>tak nak gi lari semua</malay> [seh] cause I see some of my friends <malay>yang tak masuk</malay> sports [kan]
<malay>dorang macam</malay> okay [jer] <malay>macam</malay> how to say <malay>macam</malay>
if they run <malay>takleh lari</malay> two point four <malay>ke apa dorang</malay> still okay [jer]
but actually it's quite bad [seh] it's like you're not healthy you know
ya
anyway what kind flowers do you like
ya
<malay>tak</malay> [lah]
[eh]
ya
!wah! but [ah] I hate flowers [lah] cause <malay>dorang mati cepat</malay>

like I scared
cause actually it's a very how to say [ah]
[ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>benda yang mulia untuk dibuat ye</malay> but like
I think it takes a lot of courage and
hard to take in a stranger into your home and make it a home for them
you know what I mean
I know right
I also hate children
(mm) I actually love dogs <malay>tapi</malay> dogs <malay>haram</malay> bro so I I think I will just take cats [seh] I love cats

but
I heard they like to scratch stuff too
!huh!
I like [seh] cats it's like you have fun with them
I mean like you can play with them
and then they actually know when you're sad
you know they like will be there your friend
and then <malay>kadang-kadang</malay>

crazy [eh] you know sixty eight K in another country can buy
two three cars I think
(uh) I don't even think they have the
it's just the car
ya but then like other cars I see like two hundred thousand then got until one million all [ah]
then like even housing in singapore
is so expensive
then they said that maybe getting a condo
is better than getting a at this rate
cause of the facilities
and like condos [kan]
most of them the new ones are built near like
the <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
you got see (uh) is it Gueenstown or Redhill
the new condo right is directly opposite the
and it looks really good
ya
ya
it's small
but ya you win some you lose some
I think condos right the small small ones is like suitable for those that is like living alone or with just a partner you know

does turkey have beaches like this because it's right next to greece I'm assuming it has to
(mm)
ya so
turkey and greece are big and powerful cyprus is a bit of their little cousin now it's so small and turkey and greece are pulling it cause it has a lot of like is very famous for the farmland it has good natural resources (um) good location so like <malay>macam</malay> turkey greece <malay>macam</malay>

use the segway and just drove off a cliff and died ironic right your own emergent killed him
at first I thought like <malay>bedek</malay> [lah] <malay>ini macam</malay> global myth [ah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> then a lot of people was really cause there is no confirmation you you hear a lot of the story on the internet
I think segway is a very (err) lazy way like you can walk walk [ah] I mean unless you are like a a person who has difficulty with physical physical task if not just walk
no peacekeeper there these people the you can see
(err) cyprus [ah] the they are they are neighbours [what]

on weekdays a bit hard [lah]
(mmhmm)
#putri# [ah]
the son work from home
can <malay>semua boleh</malay> work from home
that's the thing I don't like about the singapore the the mainly the bosses like
you can you have the capabilities to work remotely right you can you can you can do all your work and some more you are productive [eh] and your employees are happy because you you don't need to spend time two hours travel to and fro that time but yet they are the old school there is old school thinking I need to see your face and you as you are physically in the office I need to see you to know that ensure that you are I pay you according to the hour that kind
they don't care about as long as I finished my work I do my work properly hundred percent give you everything is fine no they they are not like that it's (err) very frustrating
but then then ya they treat you like like kids you know I told you right before they they there's this company in singapore they give the employees all of them (uh) checklist (err) time stamp
so like okay from ten to eleven what you do from eleven to twelve what you do like you got to report and give your hourly report to your boss I think it with that right you cannot cannot even do work because you spend time actually filling up the the the the checklist because you want to remember what time this what time what time what time [lah]
this is the the the obviously the border town but I think it's the same as greece their orthodox christian ya
[ah] <malay>nampak lama sangat</malay>
what is your opinion on #aldemir#
is he is he a good guy a bad guy or just no opinion [ah]
cause turkey turkey has always prided itself on being a a circular state like they are they are muslim majority but they are also like very very proud they are very proud of their progressiveness like (err) women don't need to wear the the <malay>tudung</malay> and ya [lah] I mean it's good but
I think that that they are a bit hypocritical when they they criticise like saudi arabia not defend you know saudi arabia now it's very (err) it's I have to say this saudi arabia very disappointing the king #faisal# the family like pay slackers give them money and they are rich and they want investment in the in the place saudi arabia is a rich country but this is very disappointing that the people who are supportive of the the the like what happened in the programme in china
the ones who are actually voicing out are not the saudi arabians when ya which is very sad the one who's making noise is the progressive one you know turkey turkey is the one that [eh] <malay>dia ini macam macam mahu</malay> but they are the ones actually advocating for change so I don't know I it's so messed up
of what
what's on [oh] they watching or what
by who
the government
<malay>macam</malay> brotherhood [lah]
they're pragmatic [lah] ya ya
[oh] he got to K so he he got <malay>tahan</malay> because he take itself [lah] you that's the border the demarcation then you of course he gonna get in trouble they cross the thing you got the
okay this is asking for trouble
he is lucky he didn't get shot [eh] honestly

happy family you mean yes
[oh] I think you will know my answer I will I really am a fan of (uh) you name it anything that is korean-related korean drama especially ya so if you were to ask me it's korean drama it's because of
I would not say I grew up watching it [lah] how how would I explain it <malay>dulu masa sekolah rendah tak tengok</malay> drama korea <malay>macam cuma</malay> drama <malay>melayu macam dekat</malay> channel five I mean I do watch channel eight too sometimes because of my sister
so like I got into korean drama is because of one of my friends (um) she suggested me this [one] at at that point of time of the year [ah] the title was boys over flowers
so I I bet everybody knows this so <malay>masa tu macam</malay> [ah] [eh] <malay>tengok</malay> [ah] boys over
flowers best [tau] <malay>cerita dia</malay> [ah] <malay>cerita dia pasal sekolah perempuan ni perempuan ni dia pergi sekolah kat sekolah orang kaya-kaya</malay> then <malay>nanti dia berkawan empat lelaki ni</malay> then I was like
[oh] okay <malay>mula dengar macam</malay> [oh] okay then when I watched I was like okay it's it's getting more interesting because of the twist and the plots of the story so I'm like I'm so down to it I'm so like and I end up watching the the whole full episode so it was
it brings me back so much [lah] like that was the joy that I found in watching like
I think basically I like korean I korean korean type of drama they have they have lot of genre like romance thriller they even have like [ah]
they I mean they have a lot [lah] but ya I think I'm more to like those kind of like stuff like friends family and such how about you
verbally
[oh] I like
we watch the same thing ya [ah] kitchen nightmares
[oh] those were the days I tell you yes I do watch catfish is I think is the number I don't say it's number one but it was on right at that point of time ya I remember watching catfish I was like it's so interesting like how can that guy that host
found out about okay let's let's [ah] go into this and then you just type your profile and all that stuff then how like !wah! like !wah! you bring me back so much to to the time where ya
naive
(err) how do I say this I'm not the type because I don't usually use those type of apps that people use nowadays to connect to a friend or to find someone I don't dare to use it because I heard a lot of stories sometimes like like you say [lah]
it might be I mean I I'm thankfully enough because I'm not on that side of it I never tried any apps so I never gotten catfish before but I heard stories of
like people using fake profiles <malay>macam dia orang pakai gambar orang lain habis lepas tu gunakan dekat laman sosial macam gitu</malay> then <malay>orang mesti macam</malay> [eh] I want <malay>tinggi</malay> !wah! <malay>cik lawa</malay> [ah] <malay>buat kawan</malay> [ah] [kan]
so I'm like how can they do that like even they even it went viral before on a social media where there's this this person use a influencer
photo to just catfish people on this app so I'm like how can how can people
I mean ya I mean
ya I I got nothing to say about that but you know
talking about kitchen nightmares though it would these kind of shows also make me mad it will make me want to watch it's cause how interesting like gordon ramsay is there to help like no matter how rude or how bad the person is he's like [ah]
<malay>aku dah mesti nak tunggu kau nak bantu kau</malay> I'm here for you like you know
like that that's the that's the thing I like about gordon ramsay he don't care about what other people says but because he's just there to help you he's he's genuine enough to help you so and ya kitchen nightmare also got fun side of the stories also
[oh] ya ya ya
movies
(uh)
[oh] movies would be harry potter yes harry potter is
ya harry potter is the one [lah] I mean I watched
from the season season one to like I think I I I forgot how they got too many but ya their their movie in each and every series is so good I mean ya it's because I think is the connection of
the ending of the story makes you wanna know more usually they end it the movie like you need to wait for the next next movie to to know to find out so that makes me and I mean wizard is like
very unique and interesting [what]
<malay>macam dalam dunia ni itu</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> movie [ah] <malay>tu</malay> [kan] based on
non-fiction [what] so it's like <malay>bila ada</malay> movie <malay>macam gini macam</malay> !wah! <malay>macam dia orang pakai macam</malay> magic wand they use like a lot of stuff to to to cast a spell on someone or to fight someone it's like
[eh] it is so good I wish I wish (uh) I could you know get that that kind of (uh) if it was to exist in singapore [lah] or in anywhere like like you could get that skill like we got a wizard school or anything ya how about you
[oh] no okay okay I know
[oh] okay okay alright alright
yes that is
three hours is because (uh) they add in like musics and a lot of stuff because that is their culture [what] ya when making movies [lah] but this is interesting it's because of the movie it's just clear cut it's just it's very mysterious one thing and it's very unique is because it [ah] it <malay>dia ada macam</malay> crime crime scene <malay>kat dalam tu</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> never seen a movie like that before like usually it's just dancing then you like
how [ah] you know that kind of thing I mean like bollywood movies are all
generally good [what]
!oof! cartoon I can say I watch a lot of cartoons but from what I know from my siblings I love to watch teletubbies I you know I I remember I had
teletubbies <malay>punya patung</malay> I mean I <malay>tak</malay> collect <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] I mean I don't have much but I remember I had like two two of the characters I think one one is the yellow yellow is called laa-laa another one is [ah]

[ah] titanic
<malay>mesti sudah tentu</malay> titanic <malay>siapa</malay>
<malay>siapa yang dengar nama</malay> titanic <malay>tu mesti tahu cerita cerita pasal kapal</malay> [kan] <malay>cerita pasal kapal</malay>
<malay>mesti mesti cerita pasal kapal</malay>
<malay>cinta</malay> !wah! that was the first movie also right <malay>yang</malay> very popular at at that point of time ya ya so it interesting [eh] <malay>yang ini</malay> [oh] I got I got a question for you (um) if you have three wishes what would you wish for
<malay>kenapa tu</malay>
<malay>seorang yang tamak</malay>
(err) it'll be money health and food
(err) <malay>terutama saya suka</malay> I <malay>suka makan</malay> I <malay>suka banyak makan siapa tak suka makan</malay> [kan] I mean food bring joy to to everyone so food is for me
I mean [kan] it's important in everyday life [what] you need to eat to get your energy to get to start your day and everything so food
food also is something like <malay>kita boleh</malay>
<malay>kita boleh macam</malay> explore you can go like
<malay>macam</malay> try new recipe or dishes that we found like other cultures' food like it's so interesting like for me if I could get like any food I crave for I can like okay I wish for this food then it will appear in front of me it'll be great ya I mean like
ya that's just a wish [lah] but ya money and health health of course health is very important for us [lah] as we grow older we need to take care of our well beings and all stuff right and ya that is all [ah] ya [oh] I have another question for you
[ah]
if you have unusual superpower what would it be
(uh) it would be to read people's mind for me to read people's mind <malay>pasal yang</malay>
<malay>kadangkala bila kita nak tahu apa orang tu sedang fikir</malay> [kan] <malay>dia macam dia diam</malay> [jer] <malay>jadi</malay> if
I have that superpower to to know what you're thinking <malay>apa dalam minda dia macam</malay> !wah!
I can maybe like let's say <malay>nak buat kawan kita</malay> because I'm I'm a very shy person to be honest to new people [lah] if you want to make friends
so it's like if I can read people's mind like [oh] okay <malay>dia ni rasa macam gini-gini</malay> maybe I can from there I can start a convo maybe because I know what's going on in their mind [what] so
ya for me it will be (err) read people's mind
I wish it could exist but I mean [ah] you know
[ah] food it's always about food [ah] in the end it's always [ah] it's I don't know maybe food or
I know ya exactly that's the downside of reading people's mind too [lah] what if you found out something that you are not supposed to find out but
I think I mean like that's part of (uh) your life journey right in every journey it's not so perfect I mean <malay>dalam dunia mana ada macam mesti ada</malay> <malay>macam mesti ada macam masalah-masalah yang macam</malay>
<malay>yang kecil-kecil</malay> [lah] you know <malay>tapi mana ada yang macam</malay>
and like <malay>tapi apa-apa pun</malay> in the end it's all you know it's all up to you [lah] actually
alright so how about [ah]
K got another question for you okay (err)
let me I'm still thinking about the question
for you so ya ya [ah] okay what is the one thing that you wish was free
exactly
interesting
(mm) (mm) (mm)
that's true
(mm) I get what you mean
what was [ah] the thing that I wish was free yours was very spot on question is education for me I more to
for me it will be shopping because everyone in this world loves shopping right ya so for me shopping is fun if you get feel like <malay>masuk kedai</malay> [jer] [ah] <malay>nak beli baju ni</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>kena bayar tak payah bayar</malay> okay
I mean just <malay>bawa balik</malay> I mean sometimes if it's see something we like
then we're like hesitant I mean <malay>biasa</malay> [lah] sometimes <malay>kita pun macam nak beli ke tak beli</malay> [eh] <malay>nanti guna ke tak tak guna</malay> [eh] <malay>tak guna nanti sayang pula kalau kau tak guna</malay> so
so ya it pays a lot of factors so I believe if we if
it was free like we can shop whatever we want I think we will find enjoy stuff for everyone ya so
(err) [oh] I got this is another interesting and unique question that I found (uh) if humans no longer needed to work to survive what will we think we will do
yes yes this quite interesting
ya I agree I agree with you if me I will think
if we do not longer need to work I think we will be doing gardening
I mean you know garden is I mean to some it'll
be a healing process because like you plant <malay>berkebun</malay> I mean <malay>lepas tu</malay> you <malay>tanam</malay> any <malay>pokok</malay> [ah] any <malay>bunga atau pokok yang yang</malay> favourite [lah] [kan] <malay>tanam</malay> then after that you water it you let it out on the sun and then you like you watch it grow it's like
a very for me it's kind of like a very peaceful (uh) peaceful what do you call [ah] called a procedure you call it that ya I mean like it will be interesting like you can see your neighbours like
<malay>tanam</malay> maybe like you can <malay>tanam</malay> fruits <malay>buah-buahan sayur-sayuran</malay> I got a neighbour [ah] [ah] my neighbour likes to plant [ah]
starfruit
it was so interesting because I never ever saw a starfruit plant before so it's like it's quite big
and then the starfruit was it it came in a it came in in how do I in in a oval shape at first but when you cut it inside it was actually a star shape so it was actually very ya and another I think in common common common areas also <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>ada macam tanam cili padi habis</malay> you <malay>nak cili padi daun kari daun kari</malay> for me it's very common <malay>daun kari</malay> then <malay>ada apa lagi</malay> [eh] <malay>macam bunga-bunga</malay>
<malay>bunga</malay> rose I don't know if it's common <malay>bunga</malay> rose ya common like ya that is like cause my neighbours they love gardening so whenever I walk past their house there'll be a lot like
like a lot sorts of like plants and you know like ya
[ah] ya yes
hobbies actually !wah! hobbies I would say there's a lot I mean I think one thing for me is baking you know me [lah]
I I love to bake I think I I I since I started baking when I was I think I tried to venture out during secondary school may actually
<malay>tak suka masuk dapur sebenarnya masak pun nak masuk dapur tu pun macam susah sikit tapi</malay> I think when it comes to baking is a bit different for me any pastry is more to a sweeter side where cook is more to savoury savoury type of (uh) food [what]

you can say like (err) laces you know lace there there is one lace earring where you like
need to sew on it and you know you create and stuff so for me I'm more to like very simple and very casual nothing not so dramatic and all and of stuff ya I'm curious about yours how about you
I'm more to of a warm tone warm tone in a sense <malay>macam</malay> colour
brown [ah] brown red call it [lah] orange (uh) this kind of colours that I'm more to

<malay>macam terang hijau terang terang dia macam terang</malay> you know what I mean right <malay>macam</malay> you look at !wow! it's so it's so bright on you like I don't wear bright colours I'm not that that kind
and <malay>warna hitam warna hitam siapa takde</malay> [kan] <malay>dalam</malay> global <malay>mesti ada</malay> [kan] so <malay>hitam</malay> is I think
<malay>hitam</malay> like is the is the main [ah] but for me like ya it's the warm colours how about [eh] ya
<malay>betul betul</malay>
love talking about love I suddenly so shy no [lah] kidding love at first sight
(um)
I'm not sure about love at first sight but I believe that we are all
there's there's what do they call that destiny is it
destiny to like it's already like there's a
partner for us [lah] but love at first sight
I think I'm on a neutral side I mean love on first sight <malay>macam macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>kita jumpa orang tu</malay> first time then <malay>kejar</malay> I'm not <malay>terus tersentuh hati terus jatuh cinta</malay> I mean I
I kind of I mean not I kind of I used to I used to to you know look look at like [eh] [oh] my god like maybe I'm interested but then it'll
make me think back like will I really interested to like I mean get to know that person really like
their lifestyle and all that all the stuff ya for me like
I'm on a neutral side basically (uh) ya very interesting how how what what do you think
[oh] I understand K K
[oh] my god okay
[ah] <malay>faham faham</malay> ya ya <malay>ada orang pun fikir</malay>
ya for me also you will only like that person only after you get to know him like I mean maybe some people <malay>mesti tengok macam</malay> !wah! <malay>dia ni kacak</malay> [ah] <malay>dia ni macam</malay> handsome [jer] [ah] <malay>tapi tu</malay> [ah] <malay>fikir-fikir balik</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> like would you really
fall in love with that person just because of your first sight or the looks or
or another thing ya
so I got [ah] another question for you
(uh) [oh] you talk (err) [oh] okay K if you were to eat one dish for the rest of your life what would it be
!alamak! okay that that will be hard for me also because I enjoy drinking <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>ais limau dengan</malay> syrup syrup <malay>limau</malay> ya !alamak! if if me K if if I were to choose between syrup <malay>limau dengan teh</malay> O ice I will <malay>pilih teh</malay> O ice
I mean syrup syrup <malay>manis</malay> I mean I <malay>teh pun manis</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>tapi teh lagi macam lagi</malay> like it give you a stronger taste like give you more depth of tasting !wah!
yes correct
I would [oh] wait this is very interesting because I got a few countries I would like to stay in mind but if our !alamak! this also very hard [lah] I mean
I am basically like I said I love korea so much down to the culture but if I were to really pick like
if I were to stay there for the rest of my life I think it would be australia or new zealand
I mean I think mostly australia australian and new zealand
because of many singaporeans too live there currently right so it's like
closer to home also so australia is also quite an interesting [ah] country to I'll say I'll say australia ya it's very quite a interesting country to live in I think I look as if as australia is very kind of a chill country I would say
for my heard experience from my from my friend who went there so far heard stories about that [ah] from my friend went to australia it was ya I'll pick australia I think is is I think is like well ya everybody will pick australia I I don't know I don't know ya but how about you
ya that's the thing I I'm torn between sorry I'm I torn I'm torn between korea and australia but I mean I think I'm more scared to live in korea because of their culture is much
more I mean how do how do I say this mean they I mean
it's hard [lah] to say but then I mean every country all have different different type of culture and different type of (err)
different type !aiya! basically it's culture [lah] but ya sorry what were you saying
of course definitely
that's the ya that's the number one thing for for us
[oh] no (uh huh)
it's just <malay>mi apa</malay> noodle
ya ya correct correct ya ya
[oh] no okay
[oh]
ya of course me too I won't I I I I myself also don't like to stay in one place I would like to know like safe is singapore [lah] like you wanna go to this one place like what this place only [what] what for we will go like [eh] let's go eat here ya then after this we go eat there then we go to another place another place
ya talking about talking about just now you said about tourists right did you mention tourist ya [ah] what would the place that you usually love to go in singapore in singapore any places
[oh] of course of course
<malay>kalau</malay> sound (uh)
any sound [eh]
actually any sound <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>takde</malay> idea <malay>tapi macam</malay> if you were to ask me if [ah] I <malay>tak pergi</malay> where what is [ah] my favourite place to go I will pick (uh)
gardens by the bay it's also nature it's the same I think it's particularly because I like to watch flowers <malay>bunga</malay> basically like I said [lah] <malay>bunga cantik</malay> like I really really really
you know my favourite [ah] <malay>bunga matahari bunga matahari</malay> is my <malay>kesukaan bunga matahari tu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> every time I <malay>tengok mesti tersenyum pasal dia</malay>
the colour <malay>dia</malay> colour <malay>macam cerah</malay> [kan] colour <malay>kuning</malay> [kan] <malay>dia macam</malay> what [ah] it it will lift up your mood
when you see sunflower for me [lah] for me I don't know about other people when I see sunflower it lifted up my mood cause of the colour then it just make you smile some more it can grow so big and tall in other countries I'm like how can they grow up so big like that I wish I could grow that tall and big sunflower in our country I mean but ya ya but the sad thing is that I'm not good at
gardening or planting I mean once I plant something it will take a few months then after that
after that it will you know I I ya
yes
if me I know I I I I heard stories that [ah] rose rose is hard
to to plant and to <malay>jaga macam kalau tanam tanam bunga</malay> rose <malay>tu tapi jaga bunga tu nak kena</malay> [ah] <malay>selalu</malay>
<malay>kasi dia air</malay> so gotta give it enough sunlight if if not it will it will not grow grow well [lah] from what I know rose but if I would would want to plant it's like I say
<malay>bunga matahari</malay> I <malay>nak tanam pokok bunga matahari</malay> ya
like I say if I can plant as tall as big as what other countries do why not
of course of course it give you [ah] much more
it will give you an eye-opener basically and it it give you more energy when looking at
plants and looking at [ah] flowers bloom <malay>bunga-bunga pokok-pokok macam kalau kita bersenam di pagi-pagi dengan matahari boleh nampak</malay> [eh]
<malay>pokok</malay> [eh] <malay>bunga cantiknya</malay>
[ah] it will make us <malay>macam</malay> it will make
make us forget about the busy life in this [ah] singapore you know singapore is now so busy so when you look at plants or like any flowers
it will take you away from [ah] from that side that busy [lah] that side ya
ya so it's really nice to hear all of these [lah] I also really agree with you on all this cause it's

it's a small group [lah] not a big group so met the rest of my colleague and then (um) the place also okay [lah] not so busy last time used to be very busy but now (um) because of the COVID thing so companies send their
[ah] their staff
(um) <malay>macam</malay> in a small group [lah] instead of last time one big group
a participant they only allocate (uh) fifty per a company so just now there's two company so it's like (err) two company fifty fifty so it's two hundred people came but I don't think so hundred people came just a like about
less than sixty
[oh] I guess maybe fifty four two companies because of the (err)
nowadays the government very strict on social distancing so they decided to take small
group [lah] but no more number of days <malay>dia panjang</malay> [ah] (um) james was the in charge [ah] it's quite fun [lah]
I don't know because the deal is (um) they can't go to their
a client office right that's the problem so if they can't go to their clients office they have to cancel the whole thing and in order to cope up with all the
business sales so they I think they implement this thing is is in incurred into the charges [lah]
you otherwise they have zero zero business
they're not going to go for they are not going to have a health screening for any company so I think they came up with this idea of doing it it into one point
(um) the staff we staff we have two reggie one in charge [ah] one que
and one and then myself doing (um)
but surprisingly all the participant came for
[ah]
screening right they are prepared <malay>awal</malay> you know I mean normal
so when I say is it because COVID they say ya more relax
<malay>kerja dari rumah</malay> more relax they says [ah] then they say [oh] then one of the guys is the reason why it's slow because I haven't open up my email
which is a ya it's a good idea later you want to go for health screening don't open up email first come here so you're will be just nice
<malay>tadi tadi</malay> one is from (um) one's from mycrone
if <malay>nenek pekik-pekik</malay>
(mmhmm)
because I told <malay>bibik</malay> to give anxiety pill early
I think <malay>nenek</malay> is more on anxiety rather than depression [ah] because her anxiety is more on because her anxiety is more on
[ah] she [ah] panic and she scared and she wants to play all the time
[ah] so I guess it's more anxiety than <malay>dari</malay> depression she depression is over already for her because those were the days when she like
two days a bit <malay>termenung</malay> thing of the past the sister who passed away already then the her husband then (uh) there is
depression where she very quiet then she kind of very sad really low mood or but now when she have the dementia is going to another level she is more of anxiety I should say
cause (uh) every time she like fall asleep and then she woke up she panic that she miss her prayer
and she started want to pray then she [ah] <malay>tak yakin</malay> that she pray and she wants to pray again and again so that is I think more of anxiety then if we stop her she became very angry
so and then she become breathless in difficulty in breathing and then she start screaming yelling and (um)
she start on saying bad words you know like yesterday we went through and see what are the dementia patient going went through right
not (um) it's quite to say [lah] couple of days when she was at the peak (um) which is really really very I should say <malay>macam mana</malay> very tense you okay she was screaming and yelling at the top of her voice
and it's like it is it's not like those days at night only but this time round like the whole day the whole night and then or I could see that these are the
her <malay>macam</malay> worse or <malay>ataupun dia punya</malay> (um) <malay>paling tinggi</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya mengamuk atau</malay> dementia <malay>punya</malay> (err)
level
so as what you say [lah] maybe after this she's gonna be quiet and I could see like last two days already she's been like <malay>macam</malay> quite [ah] quite more peaceful (um)
(um) more <malay>macam</malay> if she she shouted yell and (err)
but not much and then (err) at night also she sleep even though she wake up every hour she's not screaming screaming <malay>ataupun nak minta keluar</malay> from the room instead she keep asking me what time is it then she keep saying that she wants to sleep when she ask me to sleep you know that kind of thing
which is different [lah] this today's it's so much different from the past
ya compared to the first I don't know whether it's it's a good sign or a bad sign but I anyway just <malay>redha</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>ikhlas</malay> and <malay>redha</malay>
ya
the one thing about her she's always afraid to be alone <malay>itu sahaja</malay> (um) from last time she doesn't want to be alone
she's a bit timid [lah] I should say
I don't know maybe the my elder sister [lah] but the rest I think I don't know the rest are not really [lah]
timid is different from people who is fierce #shah# timid means scared of I think they need is most scared of
<malay>hantu</malay> are not human
she's very <malay>garang</malay> human but she's scared of all those
ghost or those apparently normal thing [lah] she's very scared the rest I don't think so [lah] <malay>macam</malay> people she's not afraid of [lah] none of anybody even I think prime minister also she can shout at
ya she went through all the assessment
of course [lah] unless she says like stupid things [lah] then she says I want to go back why you bring me here loans [lah] <malay>merepek</malay> [jer] accounting but cute [lah] she answer
she answer because she'll respect the doctor and the nurses there to ask her questions but she angry and she turned to me and tell me that (uh) these are all nonsense
but when they ask her what time is it which year how many children ask her to draw a clock you know that kind of things she do she she follow what they say and answer their question but (err) she turned to me and tell me of like (um)
<malay>apa ni merepek nak balik</malay> [ah] which is funny [lah]
(mm) (mm)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
and then they will ask first they ask what's the date today
then they will ask you (um)
what's your name how many children you have <malay>lepas tu dia tanya</malay>
all the personal things [lah] then <malay>tanya</malay>
(um) past then present then <malay>tanya</malay> in between so
cute [lah] but a lots of questions okay not one I think about maybe hundreds questions that is where she become agitated
the cheat one of continue at first we broke break it up [lah] so she <malay>macam ada</malay> rest and then after that continue again (um)
that was so that was like how many months ago that was like like last year last year january it'll last year december before she had the fall
november I think november that is when I know that she is having that dementia problem
no (um)
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
you didn't
(mm)
(mm) ya
(mm)
under the sovereignty you don't like it seems like she's continues dementia with all these mental condition you get like this you are who you are by doctors are usually like you know
(mm)
ya but the progression is like (um) the progression is actually <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] people
the signals they they progress to recover but people with mental illness they progress with getting worsen and also they only if I detect grandma or did it earlier
there is nothing much [ah] maybe slow down the process and understand her better but there's no way to stop her from going to another level no so it's quite difficult
for people with dementia of people with mental illness are unless unless people with
(um) which <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] [ah] depression [lah] maybe [lah]
difficult for me to say [lah] because it involved brain and then like <malay>nenek</malay> they said that some of her brains already stroke
so is there any chances of recovery no right because once the brain stroke and then becomes more you know they say the brain shrink so the chances of recovering is not there
I think the only way for dementia people to on to tackle them is
to
educate the caregiver <malay>itu</malay> [lah]
because <malay>dia orang ni</malay> sooner or later they going to be
(um)
ya they can't depend on themselves they don't even know themselves they don't even know
(oo)
(uh) sooner or later she she will forgot how to (err) right now she doesn't want to walk and then sooner she forgot how to use hand or to feed herself and then she like sometimes I bring her to the toilet she confused
she confused what to do then she just stare at the wall then say [ah] [eh] I thought you want to (err) pass motion or you want to <malay>kencing</malay> and then after that she looked at me then he or she doesn't even know that (um)
before she could go into the toilet bowls you have to put the (uh) leg rest up are you know that kind of thing
so we have to tell her again and again a bit just
quite sad [lah] mean sometimes I also don't know sometimes is it good to get
(um) professional <malay>ataupun</malay> [ah]
nurses <malay>yang</malay>
(um)
well educate about all this <malay>macam</malay> well prepared or they are teach to handle another human with mental illness or is it good that the children or the family themselves take care of them
which is (err) no the better [lah] no way I'm quite difficult [lah] this this this this dementia or old aging <malay>punya</malay> (err) problem [eh] it's going to hit the world
I tell you if if the government doesn't do anything right now right now like
the youngsters educate the youngsters <malay>ataupun macam</malay> make it a point that
(um)
or <malay>anak mesti nak kena jaga</malay> parents <malay>atau</malay> there is this centre <malay>ataupun</malay> help from the government from the nurses from the healthcare is going to be a challenging one I tell you
lot of abandoned or old people I think in years to come not people don't abandon babies anymore they abandon old folks
that is why I say
<malay>kita kena ada</malay> this mindset that you know this mindset after when when I go through taking care of minute which is having dementia you know on the went through then I come to realise that
it's not so bad at all if you send your parents to a nursing care home it's not bad so we have to change those mindset people who says
[eh] <malay>tak baik</malay> say <malay>dia tak nak jaga mak bapa dia tak baik</malay> say <malay>tak nak jaga mak bapa dia</malay>
the because people don't go through
sending your parents to a nursing home is not a thing that <malay>macam kita nak</malay> abandon them it's like you putting them into a nowadays when you got a child
you have to work and then putting a child to childcare centre is last time people will say [eh] <malay>tak baik mak dia tak nak jaga anak dia dia letak</malay>
so it's gonna be the same
the same mindset that is going to happen for old folks so I think in europe they find that <malay>ataupun</malay> european europe country <malay>atau</malay> the america they find that sending the
old folks or sending nursing home is okay but not in asia we still haven't got that that
thinking of actually sending them there is so much better for both parties
<malay>dalam islam</malay> okay <malay>kita kita sebenarnya dalam islam pun memang kita nak kena berbakti pada orang tua tapi islam tidak tidak meletakkan</malay> a must
that the children must take care die die children must be get take care of course you have to take care of her make sure she's okay with her she's fine make sure that you don't abandon them but putting them into nursery
you know I got a friend who the aunty they put (err) into the nursing home and then he actually my my friend got (um) cousin [lah] she could say [ah] eight boys [ah] the mother got eight boys
so everyone is actually eight boys so actually everyone take turns to take care of the mother but
so it seems that everyone couldn't take it because people have a both husband and wife working children schooling and then are having mother is like full
time attention should be given right so they decided to send her to a nursing home which is not cheap the thing everybody fork out money I think it's about two thousand dollars per month and then what they did
is everyone must take turn to visit the mother everyday everyday there should be at least one of her child come to visit and stay with her until she fall asleep
so I think that is a very good thing to do in a first the mother won't be bored because she got other people over there
and then second will be (err) medical attention given to her [ah] anytime twenty four seven because there is doctors and
nurses and then (err) third she got (um) caregiver which is also a caregiver which is also not like one to one caregiver (mm) they have
(err) nurses who caregiver I should say who come on shift duties you know (um) half and eight hours taking care of her another one taking care of a eight hours and then she also have her children to come and visit her everyday (err) maybe one or two children
the time so I find that is a very good idea to do that or it won't burden the
the children at the same time also the mother is well taken care by nurses doctors and I I should say professionals and at the same time the children didn't even abandon her come and visit her or maybe they brought her back
during festive season but I don't think so [lah] because she's already bedridden
(um) don't you think it's a good idea I think now we in in asia or should say in singapore should have this (um)
kind of <malay>macam</malay> (err) educate <malay>ataupun</malay> information or awareness given to all these children are about how to manage your parents when they are old and sick you know and specially when they are having dementia
that's that's what my opinion is [lah]
ya I know
(mm)
or you mean like like the one I saw in denmark they have the they have this (err) dementia village where they have shopping mall they have a market supermarket that the dementia can just wander around you know than they have the
officers then is the place is a well said my securities well kept you know that kind of thing ya [lah] I guess in singapore and we don't have land to do that
[oh] [eh] you mean to say I was just about to say you mean the are they call the studio apartment right when they have the old folk and then they make sure that the doctors and the nurses are there to attend and then they have this emergency button inside their house which is I think the government build that
to to do to to
<malay>macam</malay> preparation for the future for the future or
old generation [lah]
I think so because but (mm) but I don't think so they take nowadays they <malay>dia orang macam tak</malay> encouraged but they are
they have this <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] <malay>dia tak</malay> encourage <malay>tapi dia dah dah</malay> ready
<malay>faham tak</malay>
I did in this [ah] they call it the studio apartment kind of thing where okay you <malay>dah tua</malay> you <malay>tak nak tinggal dengan anak</malay> you buy this house which is like thirty year you must be the age of sixty then you can buy and then the house must
be in the centre of a (um) estate where a lot of amenities <malay>macam</malay> vast or or supermarket doctors <malay>dekat dekat</malay> and then (err) the whole building <malay>dia orang pun ada macam</malay> (err)
(err)
how should I say <malay>macam dia orang ada</malay>
clubhouse [lah] something like that for these old folks to come down to do some are ya ya senior activity centre I should say ya but <malay>dia orang tak macam</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>macam apa</malay> [eh]
have campaign <malay>ataupun macam kasih</malay>
<malay>tahu dengan</malay> public no they just do it you want it
okay this (uh) we have it you know <malay>tapi dia tak ada</malay> encouragement <malay>ataupun dia kasih macam</malay> I find [lah] <malay>macam tak banyak orang tahu pasal ni</malay> not many people that that not many people it was once me I don't even know
that's the that's the problem with singapore know they come up with a system or they come up with
an idea <malay>ataupun dia</malay> come up with a they come up with a with an a project or ideas or system [mah]
they don't they they say said very (err) how should I say (uh) <malay>tak macam besar</malay> [tau] like very big <malay>macam siapa tahu tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>siapa tak tahu tak tahu</malay> [lah] that kind of thing
you know like like like specially our money [ah] nobody knows that actually right now before you turn fifty five
when you turn fifty or before you turn fifty five you have this thing that you need to log in and says that you want to withdraw your money otherwise quietly they were just take your money
and put into retirement account hundred percent of it up you know
so it's kind of like <malay>macam siapa yang pandai tahu ambil tahu</malay>
current affair or rules and regulation of singapore or the changes
then they are they are well informed otherwise <malay>takde takde orang tahu tak tak macam orang</malay> be bothered <malay>takde orang tahu</malay> [lah] (um) that's the problem [lah]
that's problem [lah] people take ya ya
even that five hundred dollars the help thing right (err) your dad just got to know when he saw people queuing up the card (err) see see and then (err) this this lady said !hey! you want money you know you give out
so funny right then when he came back if a you want money you know you go and queue up me someone money the government is (err) (err) giving some (uh) help fund because I really apply then is it [oh] you apply already I don't even know I just have to queue up
that's about a long so quite difficult
true (mm) how to accommodate right
<malay>kita tak macam</malay> based we are free religious
(um)
(um)
ya true
ya true so they don't really go into the point of religious [lah] I think the more points of
other activity <malay>macam</malay> [ah] more of entertainment entertainment and activity [lah] you know of <malay>ataupun</malay>
the exercise you know that kind of thing where when you talk about old folks is quite is quite (um) (err)
complex [lah] I should say how to handle the future and the future old folks generation
(um) I I am one of the candidates going to be into that
that that's it there I should say are citizen I'm going to be that
old folk citizen soon or not far also but (err) right now people at my age I should say <malay>ataupun</malay> people at <malay>pak</malay> age those who were born or in the fifties and sixties you know we ask if you supposed to now start
<malay>atau</malay> plan then talk to your children what do you want when you are
at this stage and at this stage so both <malay>ada</malay> compromise both <malay>boleh</malay> plan <malay>sama-sama</malay> and both also <malay>boleh</malay> you know financially prepared you know that kind of thing
for example I just put myself for example what I want to do is I still want to be independent I want to have my own space my own house
(um) I want to have my own freedom you know that kind of thing so at (err) until what stage until the stage that I really couldn't (uh) take care of myself or I couldn't
I couldn't be I
<malay>macam dah tak boleh seorang ataupun</malay> I have to depend on people okay when I have to depend on people
[oh] what what people who I want to or is it my children is it a helper or I want or other people you know that kind of thing so must sit down and tell my children okay let's say I want to be by myself I want to be independent but if I have the <malay>dah tak boleh juga</malay>
I <malay>kena orang</malay> then I know I don't want to burden my children (um)
<malay>kau orang</malay> share <malay>cari orang jaga mak</malay> that kind of thing but make sure and please make sure that everyday [ah] one of my children must visit me [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
[ah] <malay>ataupun nanti cuti</malay> come and visit me to take turns are not to go over to their house a <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay> [eh] <malay>banyak karang ni</malay> I see like <malay>macam</malay> my girlfriends
are people that I know [ah] they have mom which go every week go to every are of (err) <malay>anak-anak punya rumah macam anak dia ni satu minggu anak dia tu satu minggu</malay> I I don't know whether is it a good idea because <malay>mak dia boleh tukar-tukar angin tapi kalau mak dia nak tukar-tukar angin</malay> is it
[oh] at this stage [eh] <malay>dia dah penat dah lemah dah sakit</malay> is it good for her to change
one week to one house to another house or is it better that she stay put in a hug one place and everybody take
turns to look after you know I find I find ya I find
the second option is so much better because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> burden others because you see [ah]
<malay>anak-anak kadang-kadang anak nak jaga betul</malay> [ah] children wants to but you must also remember <malay>anak-anak</malay> not the spouse <malay>ada anak</malay> I know and then a spouse also have their own
things to do and then (um) <malay>anak-anak dia orang pun ada pun nak dia orang punya</malay>
peace also it's like (um) <malay>mak ni macam jadi macam</malay> you know instead of become a responsibility to them it become burden you <malay>faham tak</malay>
unless you <malay>macam</malay> okay let's see [lah] this is
[ah] what I think it's good it's like <malay>macam</malay> let's say I <malay>ada empat anak</malay> I <malay>ada dua belas cucu</malay> something like that <malay>dua belas cucu enam yang</malay> very (um) <malay>macam dah</malay> secondary school <malay>ataupun dah pergi</malay> tertiary you know which they can help
you know so <malay>empat</malay> plus <malay>enam sepuluh sepuluh ni</malay> take turn [lah] take turns to (um) go to grandma house to this (err) monday to this day I'll be staying with grandma for the whole day you know okay then (err) this day to this day okay <malay>mak pula yang kena tinggal sana</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> take care out <malay>dia orang ada ni</malay> [eh] <malay>ada</malay> helpers twenty four seven <malay>dekat dalam rumah tapi</malay> (err) <malay>macam</malay> make sure stay <malay>duduk makan tengokkan dia</malay> the whole time they that's that is the way I want it to be [lah]
rather than (err) <malay>kena hantar pergi rumah satu anak ke satu anak sini anak sana anak sana sana sana habis</malay> I <malay>rasa macam gitu lagi</malay> better [lah] <malay>emak yang</malay> in one place everybody come take turns come and visit
you mean you're not used to it that (uh) you have to go out to take care of the elderly
ya but don't you think that is teaching them a sense of responsibility
[ah] sense of responsibility thinking making them know that elderly need to be taken care of and then at the same time it's not that they come like the whole week they come like okay monday
monday and thursday my turn okay <malay>dia ni</malay> wednesday and friday <malay>dia ni</malay> so the more people into that into that program the lesser that you
[ah] contribute no that's what I think [lah]
I I mean right now this is
(uh) right now right now right now at this situation that I (um)
at present [ah] most of my (err) friends
other elderly parents so (um) I'm I think I'm the only one who has mother with me and are in <malay>mak nenek</malay> into one station the rest all have to rotate [lor] whether dementia <malay>ke tak</malay> dementia <malay>ke pun</malay> rotate
[oh] maybe <malay>macam cik rosnah</malay> [lah] <malay>cik rosnah punya mak</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu satu</malay> place when maid with with the helper than everybody come <malay>cik rosnah</malay> come everyday to bathe her
and then the rest come in and then (err) also so cute then they have this like <malay>macam</malay> caregiver <malay>punya</malay> holiday they wait and caregiver can go for holiday and then <malay>anak-anak lain</malay> have to sit take care
(um) so <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam pada mak</malay> [lah] better <malay>mak</malay> that way [lor] I don't know
(mm)
[oh] you want it to be naturally with their are sincerely go is it
(um) ya
[lah] you got a point there also [lah] it's what you say <malay>tapi kalau sebelum dia orang</malay> could are given a task <malay>kita kena</malay> educate [lah] the main thing here the the the role model is very important
(um) how you want to (err) how you
want your child to be you have to do it first to show it to them <malay>macam kita tak boleh</malay>
(um) <malay>macam</malay> !alamak! this week I cannot [lah] I have to look after my mother you know that kind of thing we have to go [eh] I can't and I have to look to my mom it's been
it's my turn I don't want to waste you know I don't want to (um) <malay>macam kita kena tunjuk positif</malay> that <malay>kita kena tunjuk yang kita kita</malay> look forward you know taking care of parents and then making an appointment [oh] I can't
in this date this they cannot this did this date this is very special it's time for me to spend time with my mom and that kind of thing
so that is the first step that you can educate your children so in future in time to come they know that [oh] it's actually important and then mom is enjoyed parents is enjoying taking care and then they look forward and they find that that moment is very precious
(um)
(um) ya true
ya true <malay>sebab masa tu nenek</malay> okay
but <malay>sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang nenek</malay> have one person to take care of her must be two person just now I just told
james I say my mum cannot be a one person cannot handle her at least must be two because one person twenty four seven can
it's really really take up the energy in the the the mental can can go crazy two so we have to divide
one in the morning one in the afternoon or then sometimes or if she really [ah] really at her peak both must be out at the same time so we need to person to calm her down so they understand [lah]
(um) that's why that's why I say some people I am some some just
put their mother with the maid and then they have to work and then they come back they already tired and then they have to go for their other thing so the maid is with the mother twenty four seven if the the maid is <malay>kuat takpe</malay> that is why there is a lot of cases that maid abuse of old folks because of this
you know <malay>dia orang tak nak jaga tak nak mandikan dia orang pukul</malay> because <malay>dia orang sendiri tak boleh tahan</malay>
you know <malay>kita dua orang pun dah tahu macam mana</malay> okay this one down the other one come up to console and this one okay okay you rest I take care because this one <malay>nak cuba cuba</malay> calm her down she doesn't want you start screaming yelling and cursing
<malay>siapa yang tak marah</malay> even though we know that she doesn't mean it but the negative and harsh word was thrown to us it's very painful
you know so quickly the other
party must come out <malay>kalau seorang seorang macam mana itu pasal ada banyak yang marah ikat nenek dia orang ataupun</malay> [ah] <malay>ikat orang tua</malay> (um) <malay>macam pukul sebab kadang-kadang dia orang tak nak mandi kadang-kadang tak nak makan ataupun dia orang buang-buang barang</malay>
you know that kind of the the truth they become abuse did the abuse the maid <malay>itu yang buat</malay>
(um) <malay>banyak terjadi</malay> didn't know I beginning to understand why people have to go through
this [lah] because <malay>nenek</malay> is actually educating me you know
her character her dementia that she's having right now her dementia early development is really really educating educate me how to handle in future
then what do I want in my future that kind of thing so prepared you know they're gonna <malay>macam sakit ke macam</malay> (um)
<malay>bila marah ke apa ke kena buat banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>banyak</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>sekarang baru tahu mana orang yang marah mak dia kalau dah tak boleh tahan</malay> (um)
because it's not easy really it's not easy it it's really not easy it's it's possible but it's just not easy it's quite it's a lot of patience mental
<malay>punya punya apa</malay> mental mental <malay>punya</malay>
our readiness [oh] <malay>mesti nak kuat</malay>
ya really last time I people always says [ah] <malay>tak apa jaga orang tua nanti dapat syurga jaga orang tua</malay> then when I started to be angry with my mum and then I started to raise my voice at her or at a certain point of time I'm very very mad at her or I <malay>geram sangat ke</malay> then what is <malay>syurga</malay>
<malay>macam tu</malay> I can't even reach <malay>syurga</malay> if I do this to my mum
you know so I change my mindset I tell myself
I take care of her not because I want <malay>syurga</malay> I take care of her because it's my responsibility
it is my duty to take care of her and I've been chosen this is my duty that I have to take care of her that is the one which I tell myself I have confidence if I want to scold her if I want to be angry at her if I don't want to <malay>macam</malay>
I she's get she got annoyed her you know <malay>ataupun</malay> you know I <malay>tak boleh tahan dengan dia</malay> then I don't feel guilty I am human and then when I do this to her I don't expect reward
because I know this is something that I need to go through I need to do it
[ah] ya that's why I said because I <malay>cakap</malay> I <malay>dapat</malay> awareness [ah] so it's something that <malay>macam</malay> god is given me awareness [oh] okay this is what you need to do [lah] that I need I can plan compared
to the rest of my sibling who doesn't
[ah] twenty four seven take care of <malay>punya</malay>
[ah]
<malay>orang tua</malay> and then they they they now I have [ah] [ah] <malay>macam</malay> my siblings they started to see themselves being old and then being in a not being independent anymore they started to be panic who's gonna take care of them
and then they they by hard <malay>atau</malay> by force they says my children have to take care of me I don't care already take care of them
now it's a time for them to take care of me
which is I think not right we are human and we we we have to <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] a process of being young and then adult and then old

(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
ya [lah] you mean a even a person who study how to handle the situation also breakdown because it's like a handling okay is like a technician and a caregiver is a two different thing [ah] technician go machine you know <malay>macam mana</malay> machine
breakdown they can still handle it are they know the steps the the the manual they can open up a manual and then they know through a past experience with the machine is down this is what happen you have to switch on you switch it off
but human handling the human is not it is not like handling a machine human they have the they are so complex especially emotion <malay>dia orang</malay> emotional <malay>dia orang</malay> is so complex that we
don't know [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay> professional you are a good [ah]
it you'd secretaries <malay>apa ke</malay> all of them based on experience or <malay>dia orang punya</malay> client <malay>punya</malay> patients <malay>punya</malay> experience and then they bring forward to another patient you know
but another one human to another human is always there is a different is never the same this this human you study okay this human study because their the way they scream okay the scream because <malay>dia tak dapat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dapat apa yang dia nak</malay> okay I can apply to another another human this woman scream okay okay <malay>kita kasih penat tapi tetap</malay> keep on scream <malay>bukan itu dia tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>dia</malay> scream <malay>sebab sakit perut</malay> you know that kind of thing so it's a two different
human being <malay>dia macam</malay> twins [lah] twins <malay>muka sama</malay> everything <malay>sama tapi tetap perangai lain</malay>
(um) (um)
somehow you were saying that family knows best [lah]
okay (err) family know best in terms of tackling one (err) let's say the mother [lah] because we know our mother character very well we know what is your favourite food what is
her likes and dislikes you know the (err) for the professional we bring it to the they I just (uh) based on their life experience based on their theory based on their finding their event <malay>dia orang punya</malay>
(err) other patient that they see they try to apply right or not so professional <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> family members <malay>pun mesti ada</malay> and then (um) very important [lah]
say right now when we're talking you can hear grandma is screaming (err) since morning they've been very quiet so we we try to
approach different way of giving her medicine last time we give her medicine all in the afternoon about morning she become cranky sooner you giving morning hopefully it can last up to afternoon so in nowadays instead of giving giving her once or twice a day be give me three times a day just to make sure that she is quiet
[oh] so it's not easy it's not easy so it's like at home me and the helpers are also in the <malay>macam</malay>
[ah] <malay>apa</malay> they call it (err)
trial and error also
(um) ya true
(um)
so because chicken
[oh] complain and complain
(mm) (oo) (mm) (mm)
(oo)
<malay>makan</malay> ya
[ah] nevermind just like grandma [lah] <malay>tak tahu macam mana nak bilang</malay> actually she wants to go toilet instead she just say in the middle of night instead of saying she want to got to toilet she say <malay>nak keluar tak boleh tidur</malay>
you know she said [ah] <malay>mak tak boleh tidur mak nak keluar pukul berapa</malay> and then when we stopped her from going out the she said <malay>mak nak kencing</malay>
there's a [oh] <malay>sebenarnya nak kencing</malay> [eh] [ah] then we brought her to the toilet we brought her to the toilet then we pushed her we say okay now it's time for you to sleep okay after <malay>kencing</malay> you <malay>tidur</malay> okay and then she say okay then she sleep peacefully
(err) so sometimes <malay>kat dalam bilik pun sama</malay> and actually she don't like be stuck in confined place <malay>atau bilik</malay> is too cold or too hot she wants to go out and sleep outside so instead of saying that
[oh] <malay>bilik dia sejuk</malay> [lah] <malay>kadang-kadang ataupun mak tak nak tidur kat luar</malay> she keep on saying <malay>nak keluar nak keluar tolong tolong nak keluar nak keluar</malay> then we keep asking why <malay>nak keluar</malay> then that makes her so angry that why can't you just sleep the place is so comfortable
for her it's not comfortable for us it's comfortable for her it's like it's so confined no one but she doesn't know how to tell us [ah] only if she could tell <malay>mak nak keluar</malay> because [ah] <malay>bilik ni gelap</malay> [lah] <malay>bilik ni sejuk</malay> [ah] okay <malay>kita tidur kat luar</malay> that will be much
easier for me instead of a she keep on you know rant and rant

true communication is just like you when small kid cry and cry like babies cry baby cry we will say stomach pain or pampers <malay>dia dah penuh</malay> (um)
<malay>susu dia nak minum ni ataupun dia ada</malay> some [ah]
crack <malay>ataupun</malay> ulcer <malay>ataupun sakit perut</malay> I don't know that kind of thing so it's like a process [ah] <malay>cuma</malay> baby it get get baby <malay>kita kita jaga macam dia punya</malay> journey is to be independent [ah] <malay>kalau</malay> old folks <malay>kita jaga</malay> needed is to be dependent

I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana begitu</malay> but
ya like singapore <malay>memang</malay> got a lot of halal foods like
what what are the underrated <malay>punya</malay> food places [ah] the rating it to worth exploring today maybe
how about A&W <malay>baru</malay> halal [kan]
<malay>dekat</malay> jewel <malay>pun ada</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> [kan] <malay>nak pergi</malay> cycling

<malay>cendawan</malay>
#shiitake# <malay>cendawan</malay> #shiitake#
ya <malay>memang</malay> yummy
ya ya ya
#satay# soup base
!huh! really
[oh]
[oh]
<malay>hari ini</malay> cheat day
K ya so <malay>macam mana</malay>
[oh]
<malay>bukan</malay> B B nine [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh]
[oh]
(um) K <malay>boleh</malay> [ah]
(err)
<malay>ke cakap pasal</malay> shares [lah]
so
so far
I <malay>nak</malay> try [lah] <malay>baru</malay> try try I <malay>nak</malay> try stock then I <malay>macam rasa-rasanya</malay> tesla will grow [lah] in the future
<malay>sebab</malay> ya because a lot of countries are <malay>macam</malay> adopting (err) are banning petrol vehicles by
in the future
so
by investing in <malay>macam</malay> electric car company <malay>ini</malay> [kan] all those clean energy ones
(uh)
the shares would probably go up [lah] in the future like maybe not now maybe <malay>dalam lima sepuluh tahun</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> [lah] bitcoin <malay>dulu</malay> also low [kan] but after four years then suddenly spiked up so ya I feel like for now ya maybe I'm gonna try with
electric cars
so hopefully that one day I will reap the benefits [lah]
so what do you think how about you
!huh! serious
ya [lah] ya [lah]
[ah]
I'm not really sure also but islamic finance <malay>tapi</malay> I think like <malay>macam</malay> those stocks <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> permissible <malay>macam</malay> you know <malay>yang tak</malay> go against the basic purpose [ah] <malay>macam</malay> those thoughts <malay>yang</malay> deal with (um) vices then
alcohol
you know all those <malay>macam</malay> clearly <malay>apa ni</malay>
things that
are not allowed [lah] in islam so I think in generally if you know the company
and like you know what they do right you will have an idea on
what they invest in so if like if they are halal then you just go ahead [lah] with it
that's my <malay>pandangan</malay> [lah] on this
okay for me [eh] I think <malay>kita kena macam</malay>
diversify [lah] our portfolio you cannot keep all your eggs in one basket you have to like <malay>macam</malay>
segregate your assets [lah] so I think one good (err) platform to that we can use is
(uh) #wahed# invest so this is a <malay>macam</malay>
I as far as I know this is the
only <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>syariah</malay> compliant <malay>punya</malay> stocks trading platform [lah] so which means you just put in your money then automatically then you select what kind of risk profile you want
so based on that right they will just take your money invest in the different kinds of
(uh)
commodities [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cash <malay>ke</malay> gold
<malay>ambil</malay> bonds and all these are like certified to be <malay>syariah</malay> compliant so I think you will feel safe
investing in <malay>macam</malay> these kind of companies
(um) and ya and this kind of company is like you don't need
you don't have to put in effort [lah] you just <malay>letak</malay> your money then you just
(uh) forget about it
so I think that better than like putting in a bank
and
and nothing will grow in a bank
right
[oh] okay so like
based on my experience <malay>dia punya</malay> fees is
(err) ten
ten singapore dollars I think for per transaction which means if you want to find your account right if the bank will deduct ten dollars as a service charge [lah] then when you want to withdraw also they will they will charge you ten dollars so this is one one of the downside [lah] of of using
#wahed# invest
<malay>tapi</malay> like maybe this is one
(um)
how to say [eh]
what (err) things you have to face [lah] if you want to go through the halal way
right because I'm sure there are other than other platforms <malay>yang</malay> offer no service charge or something but then you you don't know what they are investing in
ya so you have to put up [lah] with this all these service charge [lah] when these banks
new way
true
maybe you can feedback to <malay>jangan</malay> invest in bonds
<malay>macam</malay> bank <malay>bapa kita</malay>
[oh] like <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I mean <malay>yang</malay> what you say is true <malay>cuma</malay>
I mean you want <malay>apa</malay> ethical investing [eh] in at the end of the day that's what you want to achieve what right so I mean if you can like
do it the halal way then it's the best [lah]
[ah] correct
[a'ah] deep
ya correct [lah] I mean because anyway singapore there's not many options I don't think there's any
options for halal investing also
if I'm not wrong ya so I mean you must start with with
those the regular accounts [lah] me you have no choice [what] <malay>tapi</malay> that's why (err) you have to do your own research [lah] if you really want to go into investing right cannot just like anyhow take
(err) <malay>mana-mana</malay> company I mean <malay>mana-mana</malay> banks
<malay>betul</malay>
<malay>cakap pasal</malay> investment <malay>ni macam mana kita punya</malay> trip <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>bau dia macam apa tu</malay>
so <malay>dia punya kentut</malay> signify more to yes <malay>ke</malay> more to no
okay [lah] ya
<malay>kita</malay> (err)
I think she I mean she's free [lah] it's whether <malay>dia nak ke tak</malay>
ya maybe <malay>dia malas</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> anyway <malay>dia dah</malay> agree <malay>apa</malay> sunday <malay>dia</malay> okay

I <malay>ada lagi berapa bulan</malay> [ah] for recontract
march [oh] ya ya ya march march
I know but the month is ya but the month is different
I know but yours is twenty four months contract but then you took twenty one month so that's three months short if you keep doing that every two years obviously you're short like three it means twenty four months contract <malay>dia dah habis</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> you renew twenty one month so that's three years three months earlier then the next year you do it again earlier three months so that's six months earlier so <malay>dia punya</malay> date <malay>dah lari</malay> [ah] mine could be six months ahead
really
ya but still that's a month apart [what] it's not the same date [what]
I don't know [ah] let me think about it [ah] I kind of like this phone I mean it's not spoilt
no I don't plan on changing already it's very silly to change because if you want to change then I have terminate this line then just leave
ya something like that [ah] which means I just stay with this phone until yours can terminate then we terminate both but then it will affect the
the internet
I know but if we were to terminate this M one line then it will affect
no the home [ah] cause the home is a bundled family thing [what]
right
what what do you plan on changing it to
<malay>bagus ke</malay>
<malay>telefon kita ada ke</malay> five G
<malay>telefon kita ada ke</malay> five G
[oh]
singtel is so expensive
obviously not enough for you
ya but are you still like eligible for the data usage or is that
ya I know so if let's say you were to switch to singtel <malay>abeh lepas tu</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay> ten G then
four G <malay>tu</malay>
but with no sub charges [ah]
[oh] !chey! how sure are you
<malay>berapa dia bayar</malay>
[oh] but you cannot change to singtel
same like #ayim# right
ya I kind of like M one actually their service is also good they have very excellent
no not just the service but the customer service is also good ya they are much better than singtel and starhub
singtel like <malay>macam</malay> very elite so they like think like they know they top notch so they they like like
segregate their customers like you can see how my father gets so such good service and then when you are like low paying customers they treat treat you like shit
I feel [lah] just don't like singtel starhub <malay>pula macam</malay> super low quality [ah] it's like
are you sure
ya exactly that's what I'm trying to say
singtel always overcharge and then they
no I mean okay [lah]
!huh! I <malay>tak pandai</malay> [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> samsung <malay>macam leceh</malay> [ah]
don't say that you don't know though
[oh] my god I remember [sia] <malay>asal</malay> [eh]
<malay>tapi</malay> you <malay>pakai</malay>
[ah] <malay>abeh</malay> you <malay>pakai yang</malay> cover <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
<malay>selenger</malay> [seh] <malay>kau</malay>
[oh] ya ya ya <malay>padahal</malay> your casing was like no it was because of the heat yes it was because of the heat
ya it was it wasn't because it was in water ya [sia] it was a new phone what a terrible phone
what [oh] you cannot use expletive is it
I don't know I never check the things all that never say right
ya anyway we are not very vulgar ya as in dude this is like
an that is going to be assessing it it's it's not like they going to be as in like they they want to like
of course [lah] someone will actually vet it but then that as in it's not meant for like kids hearing or thirteen like they're not gonna be publicizing this
it's like a no not a campaign it's like a a data
no like a data collection so they can actually like (uh)
like collate no meaning they can like collate all the languages and try to like no ya which means install it and actually
make it into a language understand or not meaning like like
ya it's something like that cause they they cause it has to be spoken in singlish [what]
so <malay>macam</malay> they trying to
make the computer understand this language
so they have to keep inputing this language <malay>kat dalam</malay>
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> something like that [ah] ya so that's why <malay>dia mesti</malay> like collect <malay>ramai orang gila punya</malay> that one
<malay>punya punya</malay> conversation
I think a lot people are willing to speak for one hour actually it will be very smart of them to just tap on a conversation because it's very hard to talk <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>kena paksa macam sekarang</malay> [ah] <malay>tadi kita nak</malay> start [kan] <malay>punya</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay>
<malay>tapi bila kita</malay>
ya but the conversation starter suck like the conversation did you read ya like
like what are your dreams what if you can
exactly these are conversation stoppers these are not conversation starters you know when
ya she's okay she stops vomitting she's very happy she wants two cake her
I like it though because it's not because she
I like it I like it that she knows what she wants
#ira# [jer] [ah]

[oh] I'm so afraid that he's gonna lose his job [sia]
he has his tendency of
I think the other parts I'm not so worried for because ya that's true exactly <malay>tu yang</malay> I <malay>takut</malay>
where did you get this idea from
no don't be don't be bullshit that's not true my goal in life was never to be a housewife
#alhamdulillah# okay [lah] I don't think it's any girl's dream to be a housewife okay [lah] there are girls #ira# dream is to be a housewife
ya but #alhamdulillah# ya kind of I think so as in like we never thought that I will be the one who's gonna be a housewife but
not for long I plan to work soon so I am working now as we are speaking this is income
ya it is I mean some money is still money
my money is not off yours so !hey! that's not nice ya but whatever I can just transfer it back to me
<malay>macam</malay> [lah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> password [eh] <malay>esok nak masak apa</malay> [ah]

with money
I don't fall in love with people because of money
actually (mm) I don't know what a superpower be
I <malay>tak sabar</malay> [seh] <malay>nak gi</malay> #johor# okay [ah] that's true we we don't really follow content kind of person okay anyway <malay>tadi</malay> I <malay>tengah tengok</malay> we were watching the news from #al-hijrah#
and then ya mama loves to watch #al-hijrah# <malay>punya</malay> news because the news all like <malay>macam</malay>
no the news is like juicy gossip news so one of it was about first news was about the (err) <malay>adik ipar pakai</malay> motor <malay>dia</malay> motor <malay>dia hilang</malay>
so <malay>rupanya dia ingatkan adik ipar dia curi</malay> which is true [lah] <malay>dia curi</malay> [lah] as in without the permission <malay>lepas tu</malay> accident
<malay>adik ipar dia</malay>
ya but anyway <malay>adik ipar dia meninggal</malay> bro
then another one more was
[oh] about the <malay>banjir</malay> [oh] then <malay>pramugara buka kedai</malay> it was quite fun [ah] actually when we were watching it
[kan] <malay>macam</malay> so juicy
<malay>besok</malay> thursday [eh]
last
!huh! one week why
that's not one week that's just about three days
ya
you <malay>rasa apa jadi</malay>
ya then #rizal# got stabbed then what else happen
<malay>pasal</malay> there was there was one part at the end where he carried the baby a newborn baby
[oh] ya I forgot about that also remember the one where the controversial no the controversial the one that
(err)
lily give birth with <malay>seluar</malay>
ya exactly so which means #ushu# have to still like be in good terms with them [what]
then I thought #ushu# will <malay>kahwin</malay> the
#rahman# [sia]
that's a lot
one week only have five episodes
ya
nah I don't think so because because I saw
no I don't think so no because there was one part where he held the baby so I think he already make
like peace with lily
ya that's true
ya so complicated and technically he already <malay>lafaz cerai</malay>
when he said that no he put a <malay>syarat</malay> he said that if you go and see your father
I will <malay>ceraikan</malay> you remember
he pull back the <malay>cerai</malay> is it that's what
ya but I mean
but after that they went back to the house [what]
that's very (um) vague ya
because <malay>talak</malay> will <malay>jatuh</malay> as long as your <malay>syarat</malay> is <malay>tunai</malay> technically <malay>dia punya syarat dah tertunai</malay> [tau] <malay>pasal dia cakap macam gitu</malay> he said <malay>kalau</malay> what did he say [ah] something like <malay>kalau</malay>
you <malay>jumpa kalau engkau jumpa bapak kau</malay>
<malay>apa aku cerai apa aku</malay> [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay> [eh]
is there really circumstances like this
ya [lah] that's true [ah]
no [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> I <malay>tahu kalau macam benda gini</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> consult <malay>ustaz</malay> because <malay>ni fasakh</malay>
ya but ya but to be safe if let's say the <malay>talak dah jatuh</malay> then you have to just reconcile [lah] and say <malay>aku nikah dengan</malay> you know you have to <malay>lafaz</malay> it back [eh] no need to <malay>lafaz</malay> it back but you have to do it with a <malay>saksi</malay> something like that [ah] meaning you still have to report it yes I'm very sure
that's why <malay>yang</malay> that time <malay>ija ibu dengan ayah</malay> he <malay>lafaz</malay> it right then they already back together [what] because #mubin# kept on pestering them back as long as the <malay>talak dah jatuh</malay> they cannot be in the same room already because they are considered <malay>cerai</malay> and they have to immediately consult
<malay>ustaz</malay> or as in like [ah]
then over there within forty days if you reconcile you don't need to <malay>angkat nikah</malay> back again
<malay>arwah mak long and pak long</malay> is <malay>cerai cerai</malay> dude
they reconcile again but like after one year or so when she fell sick remember
[kan] he already <malay>cerai</malay> her [kan] twenty sixteen [kan] <malay>kita kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>ada satu gambar mak long tak ada</malay>
<malay>ingat tak</malay> then <malay>mak long tengah ambil gambar dengan kita</malay> and then suddenly <malay>pak long</malay> say [ah] okay okay <malay>kita</malay> then he asked <malay>mak long</malay> to walk away then I was just there like !wah! that's mean
ya but
obviously we were just married
really I always knew that I was gonna happen lots of kids
I am a bit disappointed that I only have two right now
I wish I had more
<malay>kawan</malay> I <malay>satu mengandung</malay> then she complained <malay>kat</malay> twitter <malay>dia cakap yang</malay> every time <malay>kalau</malay> part <malay>dia</malay> share good news <malay>dengan</malay> family <malay>dia mesti dia orang ingatkan kakak dia macam kesian</malay> [eh]
meaning like like <malay>kakak dia takde tak boleh ada anak</malay> so <malay>dia selalu ada anak apa</malay> so as in as much as it is not her first child it is still a child what as in it's still a good
yes and then when
whenever she's trying to share her good ya but when she tries to share her good news which means like the way she say it [ah] meaning like maybe she went to her mother and she say [eh] I pregnant again then the mother actually continue it with
(uh) <malay>doa-doa kakak kau</malay> [ah] <malay>yang mengandung</malay> you know
really
I'll be so crushed like I'm sharing with you my good news
!huh!
<malay>tak ada</malay>
but she bought herself a new house you know
they are shifting [ah] as in like they bought themselves a resale
no (uh) ya <malay>tadi pun nenek berbual pasal rumah</malay>
<malay>tak pasal abang elfi dia nak beli rumah nenek</malay> then <malay>nenek</malay> is like saying you know
I don't know [lah] he has this like grand master plan of five years sell gain money then resell I don't know
ya but the thing is ya but the thing is no matter how much you
profit from the house you definitely gonna still come like cash like fork out money when you have to shift ya exactly I mean I understand [lah] could be like few hundred thousand but
I don't know [lah] I also cannot be bothered I'm just contented with my house
obviously he's gonna <malay>nenek</malay> still staying with mama
ya [lah] he's gonna buy it from <malay>pak busu</malay>
<malay>pak busu</malay> bought it at hundred thousandish cheap [ah] so unfair [ah]
like why is house so expensive now
exactly the toilet
go through all the trouble
that's not true it really depends
(mm) ya
ya [lah] true
I <malay>pun tak tahu</malay> why ya
no he he's definitely gonna get a resale though
ya because he wants to be near the #de la salle#
<malay>dia nak hantar anak dia</malay> yes so now he's grand master plan is five years he have to immediately sell so next year [kan] <malay>anak dia</malay> so two years ya so
five years of course [ah] he's like that what which is good [ah] I mean there's good and bad ya but anyway seven by seven years old he needs to be back in the west like around #choa chu kang# area
how sure are you he's gonna be sending his kids everyday he works [sia]
#alhamdulillah#
do you foresee yourself sending your kids everyday to primary school
okay so then what happens when both kids have to go to school
#inshaallah# no but the car yes no no no no no I will send both
they both go to the same school
then
ya but for the rest of their as in like for the next few years preschool is definitely gonna be under the block [what]
<malay>tu yang tadi</malay> one of the parents say
ya probably [lah]
I mean I don't know but
where got such thing where got private
no all primary schools are primary schools ya it's just that affiliation
but do you really want to send your kids to but okay [lah] also not bad
can he go
ya [lah] that's true
#inshaallah# #inshaallah#
ya but that's the only affiliation I don't think they have a affiliation to schools do they
ya like
ya but because it's catholic school [what] #de la salle# is a catholic school
so
[oh] ya that's true
I totally forgot about that I was just thinking of all the christian school like affiliation to so where else [oh] I know saint patrick is also affiliated
ya [lah] that's true see how [lah] I'm not a forward thinking kind of person
[eh] dude
[eh]
what's wrong with that it's good [what] to be prepared
!alah! <malay>dia sihat</malay> for the next few years [jer] [dah] happy
<malay>apa</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>nak cakap tadi</malay>

yes happy new year
ya [lah] <malay>dua ribu dua puluh</malay> we are all in lockdown like the whole year gone
[kan] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>masalahnya</malay>
<malay>semua</malay> resolution <malay>pun dah tak tercapai semuanya</malay>
ya true
(err) of course first of all I have to make sure that I redo back everything <malay>yang dah daripada dua ribu dua puluh yang semua yang tak menjadi tu cuma ye</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap pasal</malay> redo back everything <malay>sebenarnya ni bukan dua ribu dua puluh punya dah lama pun daripada</malay> I would say from two thousand maybe two thousand ten which is lost weight [lah] <malay>memang nak nak turunkan berat badan</malay> [lah] <malay>harap harapnya macam tu tahun</malay> target [eh]
this year target <malay>nya lebih kurang dalam</malay> maybe fifteen ya
(uh huh)
serious [ah] <malay>sihat ke kalau macam tu</malay>
(uh huh)
yes
[oh] I cannot do the skipping <malay>sebab dengan</malay> spine issue [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> skipping <malay>nanti patah pula tulang belakang</malay> so I don't want to go to another surgery for sure not anymore
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya achievable so I would say that <malay>kalau</malay> fifteen <malay>maksudnya dalam sebulan kena</malay> target at least two [lah]
<malay>tapi tapi sebenarnya</malay> one half <malay>pun boleh lebih kurang macam tu</malay> [lah] <malay>lebih kurang</malay>
ya so that's another thing [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> vegetarian [kan] <malay>macam</malay> ya before this <malay>sebab baru</malay> adapt to vegetarian so <malay>banyak makan</malay> processed food [lah]
actually adapt <malay>tu untuk konon-kononnya nak sihat daripada sebelum ni tapi</malay> I would say I ate a lot of
like man man-made meat <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>sebenarnya tak boleh</malay> so I was thinking of this year <malay>kalau boleh nak jadi</malay> vegetarian and grow my own food like <malay>tanam sayur ataupun tanam</malay>
<malay>tanam sayur</malay> [lah] basically <malay>kita orang dah tanam benda lain</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] anyway

(uh huh) (uh huh)
ya the real world comes
okay
(uh huh)
okay alright
okay
for business <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>apa apa</malay> the idea business <malay>yang dah ada buat masa ni</malay>
(uh huh) okay
<malay>apa dia lagi sekali</malay>
I see surprise delivery <malay>menarik</malay>
I see so the surprise part [lah] <malay>yang betul-betul</malay> make meaningful
(mm)
I see I see

I see so <malay>macam mana sebelum</malay> delivery <malay>ni dia akan ada macam</malay> set set <malay>dia ke ataupun macam memang macam boleh</malay> customise <malay>ke macam mana macam mana bentuk yang orang boleh ambil tu</malay>
[oh]
okay <malay>faham</malay>
[a'ah]
so basically <malay>ni macam</malay> (err) <malay>macam bukan</malay> professional <malay>dia macam lebih kurang</malay> special customisation [lah]
okay <malay>tapi barang-barang dia barang macam mana macam</malay> (uh) food based <malay>ke ataupun</malay>
[oh] interesting very interesting I see I see so berapa lama dah</malay> start
[oh] okay [lah] okay <malay>maksudnya dah ada</malay> customer [ah]
[oh] !wow! ya ya ya ya <malay>sebab</malay> ya [lah] <malay>sekarang ni orang pun suka</malay> [eh] <malay>macam boleh pergi</malay> surprise delivery <malay>lepas tu boleh hantar</malay> [eh] <malay>boleh</malay> share <malay>dekat</malay> Insta [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>betul</malay>
I see
(mmhmm)
I see so it's not just it's not just [oh] I forgot the date and I want to send it over I just send something it's not like that [lah]
I see so
I see interesting it's interesting so <malay>apa</malay> [lah] <malay>nama</malay> the surprise delivery service <malay>ni apa nama dia</malay>
[oh] !wow! okay <malay>kotak riang</malay> so <malay>kotak riang</malay> basically like <malay>macam</malay> gift (uh) box of happiness [lah] box of happiness
okay okay okay <malay>betul betul</malay> new year resolution [lah]
healthy food what what is the what is the meaning of the healthy food what kind of food
so dia sendiri</malay> [oh] okay alright alright like like less carbs [lah] less carbs
konjac #mee# [oh] the one without calorie is it okay okay
(err) I've read about it once ya I know
maybe I should be your customer then
how okay you know talking about healthy food usually healthy food used to be very plain and dry and [oh] my god taste like medicine
so what do you have for now <malay>ada tak benda-benda yang</malay> ya it's still give you some happiness in the world <malay>tapi</malay> healthy [lah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow!
I see <malay>tapi</malay> sugar free how is that achievable even
ya ya ya but but but that's interesting because
why so many people didn't manage to do the resolution like losing weight or anything like like in my own case because all the healthy food [oh] my god
it's terrible
<malay>menarik menarik</malay> so (err) healthy diet healthy food
basically ya [lah] <malay>macam kita pun tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>punya</malay> issue I think people are more concerned about health nowadays because somehow in this case like in the COVID issue you really have to have your strong immune system and somehow people say that you are what you eat [kan] [ah] so ya <malay>penting</malay> [lah] very very important [lah] <malay>untuk</malay>
in that so all the best for the business hopefully you will be rich and I will be your first customer
<malay>tapi dia punya perjanjian adalah</malay> when you get rich I will be the first person <malay>yang</malay> you have to <malay>belanja</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>aduhai</malay>
[oh] resolution <malay>lain</malay> apart from losing weight I would say that okay [lah] <malay>dia macam satu</malay> we have to look at the whole system [lah] [kan] I started with trying to eat
healthily [kan] I want to (err) I want to lose weight so I have to live live (err) I have to eat healthily so I want to grow my own food the idea is not just <malay>kita nak kurangkan berat badan</malay> is also because I want to save more money
cause somehow when you are on vegetarian diet [kan] most of the thing <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>beli sangat-sangat cepat rosak</malay> [tau]
especially <malay>sayur</malay> [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> I was thinking of and <malay>kita tahu berapa lama dah sayur tu ada kat dalam</malay> supermarket
[kan] so we didn't know <malay>pun macam kita</malay> opt <malay>untuk</malay> healthily <malay>tapi sebenarnya tak berapa sangat</malay> so I was thinking of like okay with after I grow my own food I will save more money and I want to make sure that I can pay off all the debt because somehow ya [lah] (mm) <malay>kita tahu</malay> economically <malay>macam mana</malay>
<malay>macam keadaan tahun mendatang walaupun kita dah nampak sinar</malay> with the with the vaccine of COVID nineteen and all and so on but the issue is we are not sure how the economy would collapse so I was thinking of trying my best to reduce all my spending
and in some in some ways try to pay all the credit card debts and hopefully my own car loan and things like that so that's my goal I was thinking of I want to save more money (err) ya grow my own food so don't have to buy so many so so much food and pay the debt [lah]
[a'ah]
how is that
like for YouTube channel on planting food I see
(uh huh)
(uh huh)
[oh] interesting
ya when you when you say like that ya it is very interesting because ya <malay>sekarang ni ramai juga</malay> [kan] <malay>orang</malay> monetise <malay>daripada</malay> YouTube [kan] and then ya <malay>betul betul</malay> and because we provide the content YouTube is open platform anyway
<malay>betul betul</malay> okay ya interesting I should think about it should think about it ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>orang kata tanam</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>tapi sebenarnya nak tanam pun ada cara</malay> [kan] ya ya ya
ya interesting (hmm) okay <malay>boleh boleh masuk dalam</malay> resolutions <malay>seterusnya</malay> okay
ya [kan] so I'll be like
(err) healthy and rich
ya ya healthy and rich okay interesting so <malay>cakap pasal</malay> healthy and rich [kan] <malay>kalau</malay> [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> sum up [lah] the the I the expectation of two thousand twenty in one word [lah] <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya apa</malay> one word <malay>yang</malay> will sum up what you want two thousand twenty one to be
!wow! [oh] okay alright alright <malay>maksudnya kenapa yang sekarang ni</malay> the the timeline the the stories not good <malay>yang</malay> you need the plot twist
okay
okay
<malay>untuk diri sendiri</malay> [eh]
ya that that's possible actually because ya somehow we didn't know sometimes we underestimate ourselves and maybe sometimes we also didn't maybe for now we didn't find the right person <malay>macam</malay> it ya maybe with better networking <malay>kita boleh nampak orang yang boleh</malay> bring it forward [kan] ya ya interesting for me two thousand twenty one I would say that I would my my like the motto of two thousand twenty one I want is kind
because I I want to be kinder to myself [lah] I would say that two thousand twenty <malay>dengan</malay> COVID <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> it has been very harsh and I blame myself I critic myself a lot in so many ways and end up
<malay>tak jadi apa-apa pun</malay> so I was thinking okay I want to be kind kind to myself kind to my body like eating eating better food and also kind to the kind to the world [lah] like environmentally more friendly [lah]
so that's the idea
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>apa lagi takkan tu</malay> [jer] <malay>apa lagi</malay> share [lah] resolution
okay alright
that's right
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm) ya ya
you you become a boring person [lah]
ya
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) what what kind of me time like <malay>pergi</malay> bowling <malay>macam tu</malay>
I get give me some example on that
okay so you want to work on any skills that means is it is it okay is it skill <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah ada</malay> and then you want to enhance <malay>ataupun</malay> like new skill
because you don't have the money at that time is it
okay what is that I'm I'm so interested to know what is that
[oh] okay musical you have the artistic side [lah] deep inside okay
alright alright
ya I still remember like your one of your ambition is like <malay>jadi</malay> ya <malay>jadi pemain</malay> guitar [oh] my god
so funny I didn't know you keep it until this this year
I see but not guitar anymore [lah]
I see I see that's interesting that's interesting so (err) you you didn't have any basic yet for piano is it
[oh] alright
(uh huh)
I see but you were in primary is it
[ah] okay ya <malay>masa tu kak long pun dah masuk asrama</malay> I didn't really update
I see interesting interesting
ya piano is very elegant anyway
then
but but somehow piano like <malay>ini dua benda yang berbeza</malay> [tau] mostly guitar <malay>punya</malay> song it's like metal you know very hard [one] piano is like very sentimental ballet things like that so it's it's a spectrum is it because you just want the elegance or is it <malay>juga makin besar makin matang</malay> you become more like feminine in some way do you think that can be that one
(mmhmm)
okay
I see so with before this <malay>kak long pernah juga ada</malay> idea <malay>macam nak</malay> enroll class [tau] and of course I want to also look into <malay>yang macam</malay> elegant elegant <malay>ni</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>cuma kenapa bukan</malay> piano <malay>sebab</malay> piano requires some set up [lah] then <malay>tak dapat berlatih kat rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> so I was thinking of <malay>beli</malay> ukulele <malay>ke</malay> violin something like that [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> at least you can bring it anywhere and you don't really need to the whole band to play with you [kan] <malay>kalau macam belajar yang macam banyak</malay> wind <malay>punya apa ni punya</malay> instruments you need a whole band <malay>baru dia akan menjadi</malay> or you <malay>main</malay> trumpet <malay>sorang-sorang macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>dia dah jadi macam siapa tu kawan</malay> Spongebob I don't remember the name Squidward <malay>tu</malay> clarinet that's clarinet so it will
[ah] Squidward [kan] so it will be like if you play alone nobody will appreciate it [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
interesting okay [lah] basically [kan] <malay>macam kita boleh tengok</malay> [kan] sometime our education system
focus on more maths science <malay>tapi</malay> [kan] art art is very important human very connected to any beautiful things be it the beautiful things <malay>tu dalam bentuk</malay> visual <malay>ataupun</malay> audio [lah] <malay>macam</malay> music [kan] because somehow that makes us
(err) be more empathy [kan] <malay>dan buat kita</malay> more human [lah] and in your own case [kan] <malay>macam memang buat</malay> hard science <malay>buat</malay> maths [kan] (err)
at the end you will turn to robot [lah] if you didn't celebrate the humanity side of you <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] okay so piano so that's the skill <malay>yang</malay> basically dream [lah] <malay>belum belum</malay> start [ah] do you have any skill <malay>yang</malay> just you want to enhance [lah] <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>dah ada dah ada</malay> base base[lah]
how about that
<malay>ataupun</malay> something [lah] <malay>selain daripada</malay> skill (err) musical skill <malay>ada</malay> skill <malay>lain tak</malay>
[oh] mandarin why why mandarin
but mandarin is kinda hard though because <malay>tak silap</malay> mandarin [kan] <malay>dia ada macam empat</malay>
<malay>empat macam apa</malay> [eh] <malay>apa dia panggil perbezaan bunyi</malay> something you know
(mmhmm)
ya that's the thing <malay>sebab</malay> basically ya <malay>bila kita boleh</malay> connect to to a person <malay>dengan dia punya</malay> mother tongue it will be <malay>lebih ni</malay> [lah] [kan]
ya ya <malay>lagipun kita pun</malay> multi racial I think it's best <malay>untuk kita pun faham bahasa yang lain juga</malay> [kan] <malay>betul betul</malay> interesting interesting
(mmhmm)
offered
(uh huh)
so what what is your what's your choice [oh] japanese
so okay <malay>buat masa sekarang</malay> how many language you know like even it's amateur <malay>pun tak faham</malay> how many I will say malay english arabic okay interesting japanese
korea korea <malay>daripada mana</malay> because you watch [oh] my god alright alright
really I only know like I see so
[oh] interesting so basically now you already have like five language already
five language already
anyway (err)
ya I think that that is enough that that is great enough [lah] I would say ya ya ya
so many language <malay>cakap pasal</malay> korea I watch a very very good good drama I'm not sure you have watched it or not <malay>tapi dia berkaitan dengan</malay> business [lah] since you <malay>pun nak buat</malay> business [kan]
you know the start up [oh] okay alright alright alright
so (err) who's your favourite character in that movie anyway
your favourite [lah] [oh] my god I think everyone is on his side anyway so
ya <malay>cerita tu menarik</malay> [tau] because <malay>dia menunjukkan macam mana</malay> yes
so <malay>orang selalu tengok</malay> [kan] <malay>orang</malay> business <malay>ni</malay> at at the end of the success [tau] like the only the tip of the iceberg [lah] when ya and then <malay>macam kita pun</malay> jealous [lah] <malay>bila dia</malay> lavishly spend money and all that but we didn't know how broken they are when they are still when when they are very very young and when they start the business because
I would say that I I have been in business for quite some time and it has been hell but somehow I didn't regret any of it [lah] because everyday I woke up I know that that's something I want to do
even though <malay>macam belum kaya lagi</malay> but there every single day I woke up
I look forward to it and
ya that is something I really want to do
and start up start up makes me it reminds me to a lot that happened during my early years [lah]
even though I would say that <malay>sekarang pun belum kaya pun lagi tapi</malay> it's interesting and I would say that the in the in the drama itself <malay>benda yang paling belajar</malay> is you need a good mentor
<malay>macam bila</malay> you <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>dah kaya ramai</malay> [jer] <malay>orang yang akan datang</malay> [kan] <malay>berpusu-pusu tapi</malay> basically <malay>kita tak tahu orang datang tu betul-betul</malay> care <malay>ataupun</malay> just <malay>nak</malay> ride on us <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) ya
ya
ya that's the thing so <malay>cakap pasal tak kaya tapi</malay> means a lot <malay>sebab</malay>
my business is operating on different model which is I choose a social enterprise basically the business itself <malay>adalah untuk selesaikan</malay> social issues like
ikut</malay> [lah] issue <malay>nya</malay> about environmental <malay>ke apa</malay> [kan] so because I do believe that in the in the in the <malay>keadaan sebenarnya sebenarnya kita perlukan</malay>
<malay>kita perlukan orang buat</malay> business <malay>untuk bantu bangunkan negara sebenarnya sebab</malay> if we just depend on the politicians is not
it's not going to work [lah] <malay>kita pun tahu</malay> politician have so many other things [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> I would say that business <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide like <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide ya <malay>macam cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>kerja untuk orang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita boleh</malay> provide service <malay>diorang macam</malay> in your case you <malay>nak buat</malay> surprise delivery [kan] you <malay>boleh</malay> make people happy and so I would say that
business gives you more autonomy in some way
so at least you can do what you want
instead of ya [lah] I used to work <malay>juga dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan</malay> boss boss <malay>bukannya senang</malay> [kan] <malay>kita salah pun</malay>
<malay>kita salah memang</malay> confirm <malay>salah kita betul pun kita salah</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi macam</malay> ya but but it's okay I think that's the beauty of young age [lah] <malay>untuk</malay>
try error <malay>jatuh</malay> explore ya explore
[oh] my god [oh] my god that that is interesting
I would say that
<malay>jangan jangan berhenti terlalu cepat</malay> sometimes you didn't know <malay>macam awak tengok</malay> [kan] business business <malay>yang dah berjaya</malay>
that take years then even just take even one to two years [lah] <malay>yang</malay> one to two years <malay>ni bukannya</malay> entrepreneur <malay>dia</malay> #grant-preneur# <malay>sebab dia dapat duit daripada</malay> grant [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> basically [kan] (err) <malay>orang perlukan</malay> at least six seven years <malay>untuk dia betul-betul ada</malay> strong base [kan] so if you stop too early
<malay>macam</malay> let's say <malay>kita nak makan</malay> durian [kan] even though we already see the <malay>buah dah ada pun dekat situ tapi kita tak boleh nak kita tak boleh petik dia sampai dia jatuh sendiri cuba kalau kita ambik pokok</malay> durian [kan] <malay>kita sibuk nak makan</malay> durian <malay>nak makan</malay> durian and then we go and pluck the pluck the fruit [kan] it's not going to taste good even though you <malay>nampak hari-hari tapi</malay> you <malay>kena tunggu sampai dia jatuh sendiri</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> the the biggest thing <malay>ialah</malay> perseverance <malay>untuk tunggu bila buah tu nak jatuh</malay>
so I would say that
in the business sometimes you just didn't see what's happening [kan] <malay>tapi</malay>
ya that's the beauty of it [lah] trying to hustle hustle and hustle until one day
you can enjoy the ripe durian
I also waiting for my durian to fall anyway ya
ya not too long two thousand twenty one that free hopefully hopefully
what <malay>kenapa apa what what what was
[oh] so <malay>itu adalah</malay> interesting part I would say that
I really I really like him
as a lead as a lead actor because
he is a good actor [tau] so basically (err) <malay>sebenarnya</malay> [kan] <malay>bagus</malay> [jer] <malay>cerita</malay> start up <malay>ni walaupun dia letak satu</malay> lead actor <malay>yang teruk gila tapi</malay> basically <malay>dia nak ajar sebenarnya yang</malay>
lead actor <malay>pun dah terlalu</malay> superficial [tau] <malay>macam terlalu hebat</malay> so <malay>sedangkan cerita ni pasal budak-budak muda</malay>
so <malay>walaupun awak tak tengok</malay> character #nam do san# <malay>tu sangat-sangat</malay> loser [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically that's how people at twenties <malay>macam tu dia tak tahu apa-apa banyak benda dia tak tahu</malay>
compare to someone <malay>yang dah macam</malay> #han ji pyeong# <malay>yang dah</malay> thirties [tau]
so <malay>tapi mungkin sebenarnya orang</malay> production <malay>ni pun tak sangka dia akan</malay> backfire <malay>macam ni</malay>
<malay>sebab kalau kita baca cerita daripada</malay> synopsis [kan] <malay>ada seorang</malay> mentor <malay>yang garang suka menghinakan kita pun takkan rasa kesian dekat</malay> #han ji pyeong# <malay>tapi</malay> because he is a good actor himself <malay>yang membuatkan</malay>
<malay>kita</malay> move <malay>dengan perasaan dia sampai kita <malay>sedangkan</malay> character <malay>tu tanpa tanpa</malay> interpretation <malay>daripada dia</malay> [kan] <malay>mungkin akan jadi</malay> character <malay>yang sangat</malay> annoying
harsh <malay>lepas tu cakap suka hati tak suka tunjukkan perasaan tapi</malay> because (err) the actor himself [kan] put so many emotions on the face
!aiya! many conflicts (err) conflicting emotions <malay>yang kita tahu yang</malay> he is not bad he is just
tersakiti macam tu</malay> you know
(err) <malay>mula-mula dia memang tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> when I think back and if I am mad at #nam do san# I would say that I'm mad at younger me <malay>juga</malay>
but still as a as a
<malay>nonton suka hati kita</malay> [lah] <malay>kita nak suka siapa</malay> [kan] that is our own right <malay>tapi</malay> I would say it's a good reflection [lah] it's a good reflection
three years <malay>pun tak ada apa-apa perubahan yang bagus</malay> that's the thing
<malay>sebab yang lain ada</malay> character development [tau] the other two friends <malay>tapi yang tu macam</malay> stay like just like that
ya just just better <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>ada</malay> coat <malay>sendiri tak payah pinjam</malay> that's the only improvement made [kan] [kan] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] !aduh!
okay <malay>ada lagi ke</malay> resolution <malay>untuk tahun ni</malay> anything [eh] <malay>untuk tahun ni</malay>
[eh] small thing [seh] <malay>yang buat benda jadi</malay> great and big ya
[oh] my god that's so hard
ya ya
procrastination
ya that that that interesting because sometimes ya [lah] <malay>macam zaman</malay> study I would say that I I'm a last minute person because last minute <malay>kadang-kadang boleh</malay> push you
like push you [lah] <malay>macam</malay> in the very last minute [kan] you <malay>boleh</malay> focus and sometimes your creative juice like <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> in real life [kan] when you involved with more people
and other situation you cannot control such as (err) persekitaran</malay> [lah] environment <malay>macam tiba-tiba</malay> COVID <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
procrastination <malay>akan</malay> backfire you compare to someone <malay>belajar yang</malay> it's just you and your assignment [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm) ya ya
maybe because you are a person <malay>yang</malay> work under pressure
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya that's one thing second thing is sometimes you <malay>kena</malay> you <malay>kena</malay> combine <malay>kerja</malay> you <malay>dengan</malay> team mate <malay>lain</malay> like just imagine if the team mate <malay>buat macam tu</malay> to you [kan] at the last day <malay>baru dia nak</malay> submit <malay>dia punya</malay>
so it's going to be difficult
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
yeah
drag yourself ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> procrastination
and somehow <malay>sekarang ni bukan nak cakap apa</malay> [lah] procrastination <malay>ni pun</malay>
<malay>sangat sangat tergantung dekat kita punya</malay> social media <malay>juga</malay> [kan] <malay>macam</malay> in my own case [lah] I will say sometimes I was like okay I just want to watch one video [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay> another one and then another one then it never stop it never stop so <malay>itu yang menarik</malay> then <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>tiba-tiba cakap pasal tu</malay> [kan] <malay>ada tengok satu</malay> documentary [tau] <malay>dekat</malay>
documentary <malay>dekat</malay> Netflix [ah] <malay>cerita pasal</malay> social network [tau] <malay>macam mana sebenarnya</malay> since since <malay>kita guna</malay> all this services for free [kan] <malay>macam</malay> Facebook and all those thing [kan] basically we are
<malay>pelik</malay> [ah] <malay>sebab kalau kita bayar baru kita adalah</malay> customer [kan] <malay>tapi kita tak bayar</malay> so <malay>tu maksudnya kita bukan</malay> customer <malay>maksudnya kita adalah</malay>
data (err) their their <malay>modal macam tu</malay> [kan] so
so <malay>dia dah baca</malay> [tau] <malay>kita punya</malay> behaviour <malay>dia dah baca kita punya</malay> interest ya algorithm yes that's the that's the word so <malay>macam dia tahu macam mana nak</malay> keep us hook <malay>kita tengok</malay> one <malay>lepas satu-satu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagi satu</malay> !aduh! <malay>lagi satu benda yang apa kita sebut semua keluar</malay>
ya ya ya
<malay>macam fikir fikir contoh kata</malay> [oh] <malay>rasa nak beli katil</malay> [ah] <malay>tiba-tiba semua iklan katil keluar</malay>
[a'ah]
so I don't know I mean they were listening to us [lah] [kan] our microphone is always on <malay>kita tak pernah pun</malay> default <malay>untuk tutup</malay> [kan] somehow
ya
ya <malay>tapi maksudnya</malay> ya <malay>maksudnya kalau</malay> [lah] basically okay <malay>kalau diorang dengar diorang</malay> just feed us <malay>dengan</malay> ads okay [lah] <malay>tetap</malay> okay <malay>juga</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab dia akan buat kita nak membeli</malay> [kan] but how about if bad people
peeking through your life from there
[kan] so ya
so <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>macam bila kita bila kita gunakan</malay> service <malay>ni</malay> for free [kan] for free
so <malay>kita</malay> basically <malay>menjual diri kita</malay> to them [lah] like okay I am going to use for free so you will get you can take anything from me <malay>sebab tu penting kita baca</malay> like agreements and all term and condition
but I would
ya ya ya ya
<malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] like term and condition if you agree tick <malay>siapa pun nak baca</malay> tick [kan] <malay>kat situ</malay> that that's the thing
so
<malay>tapi takpe</malay> [lah] basically the basically the idea is <malay>walaupun kita tahu yang mesti yang penting adalah kita kena tahu apa yang berlaku</malay> at least <malay>kita tahu dia ambil</malay> so at least <malay>kita boleh jaga-jaga</malay> [lah] more careful like in term of sharing pictures
in term of sharing things [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mm)
ya
ya and somehow we also have less privacy now <malay>macam dulu</malay> [kan] like ten years back <malay>kalau kita nak tengok rumah orang tu dalam rumah tu pakai dapur apa periuk apa</malay> that is something like ridiculously happened [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
[kan] <malay>kita tak cakap dengan jiran kita</malay> (uh) <malay>cik boleh tak saya tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>saya nak tengok apa periuk</malay> (err) <malay>dapur macam mana ada</malay> hood <malay>ke tak ada</malay> hood (uh) ya but now now basically people can even access like bedrooms of of other person [kan] because that person <malay>boleh buat</malay> live <malay>dekat dia punya</malay>
<malay>bilik</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
ya
ya
ya ya even [oh] my god I still remember like one house tour that I watched <malay>dia siap tunjuk</malay> the secret room
ya that's the ya
and basically [kan] <malay>senangnya sekarang ni</malay> with the technology <malay>ada</malay> the <malay>semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dengan hanya gambar orang tu boleh terus buat balik</malay> your plan house plan [tau]
<malay>hanya dengan gambar sekarang pun</malay> technology <malay>yang ada</malay> with with pictures you take pictures you can even like <malay>kira beberapa berapa jarak dengan tepat</malay>
okay so basically what if during the house tour people screenshots screenshot and redo back your house plan
and then they already know where is your door where is your window so then <malay>macam nak masuk pun senang</malay>
yes and somehow this wealthy people <malay>pula bila dia keluar melancong dia akan</malay> post so <malay>orang tahu rumah dia tak ada orang sedangkan sebenarnya</malay> rule <malay>dalam kita</malay> post social media <malay>ni kalau boleh kita hanya boleh</malay> post <malay>pasal</malay> vacation after the vacation
yes <malay>sebab</malay> basically posting all informations about our vacation is announcing that
ya my house is empty go and then <malay>curi</malay> [lah] <malay>apa saja</malay>
yes yes yes
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>dunia sekarang</malay> different [lah] people
it's it's very interesting because people are less communicative
but becoming too transparent which is two different thing [tau] <malay>macam orang dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>dia</malay> communication <malay>nya tinggi sebab dia hanya bila nak jumpa kedai kopi tu tu</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>masa untuk</malay> interact [tau] so you really have to all out [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> people nowadays [kan] <malay>dia</malay> neglect
<malay>organik punya</malay> communication <malay>tapi dia boleh</malay> share every single thing about <malay>dia punya</malay> life [kan] <malay>tapi bila orang</malay> judge <malay>dia marah pula</malay>
<malay>orang tak</malay> like <malay>tak tak tak bagi</malay> reactions <malay>pun dia marah</malay> [kan] so
so okay <malay>cakap pasal tu</malay> that's there's one more [lah] one more thing I want to add on the twenty twenty resolution [lah] twenty twenty one [oh] my god twenty twenty one because I want to segment my day [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
I realise that throughout the day there are so many times I check my phone and check my phone [tau] so I was like <malay>macam</malay> I want to segment [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>pukul berapa sampai pukul berapa</malay> is for social media instead of checking it all the time basically <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> check <malay>tu</malay> actually in notification and an hour and I watch hundred videos already
ya and then <malay>macam</malay> then all the video sometimes is (err) ridiculous (err) like cat videos you cannot stop watching cat videos
it's never ending cuteness [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
so I want to segment [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>dalam masa tiga jam ni</malay> I will I will do my best to indulge in social media and the rest I would stay out of it <malay>macam tu</malay> [lah] that's the idea
okay
<malay>macam</malay> quota [ah]
(mmhmm)
!wow!
[oh]
just imagine in the middle of cute cat video and then it stop [kan]
[oh] you can ignore [lah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> parental parental control <malay>yang terus</malay> off [oh] okay okay
just just to remind you [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> [lah] <malay>macam guru</malay> discipline something like that [kan]
<malay>tapi ada</malay> apps [tau] <malay>untuk buat benda tu</malay> which is very interesting I just download it [lah] <malay>macam nama dia</malay> forest [tau] so <malay>macam bila</malay> you start the apps [kan] you <malay>kena</malay> set [lah] you <malay>nak</malay> you <malay>nak buat kerja berapa lama</malay>
okay so <malay>dia ada beza</malay> [tau] <malay>tiga puluh minit dia punya</malay> shrub [jer] <malay>kalau satu jam dia akan jadi pokok</malay> [tau] <malay>kalau dua jam jadi pokok ada buah</malay> [tau]
so basically [kan] <malay>dia untuk bantu</malay> you <malay>untuk</malay> (err) focus so you <malay>buka</malay> app you set <malay>tiga puluh minit nak buat satu kerja</malay> [kan] so you <malay>tak boleh buka</malay> apps <malay>lain</malay> you <malay>kena tutup dengan</malay> apps <malay>tu sahaja</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> [lah] <malay>tiga puluh minit</malay> you access your phone <malay>pokok tu akan mati</malay> [tau] <malay>tapi kalau kalau</malay> you kalau cukup tiga puluh minit dia akan</malay> notify you okay <malay>pokok tu dah hidup</malay> and basically everyday you have a patch of forest <malay>untuk dibangunkan</malay>
yes very interesting so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> basically [kan] <malay>dia bagi kita</malay> award <malay>macam dia bagi</malay> reward [lah] reward <malay>macam</malay>
okay so <malay>kalau empat jam pokok tu masih macam ada buaian</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> so depress
[a'ah] <malay>maksudnya</malay>
ya

sleepy town so basically the town is built while you are sleeping [lah] so you will enjoy it when you so <malay>dia lebih daripada</malay> quality life [lah] so <malay>macam</malay>
interesting I ya [lah] <malay>saja</malay> [jer] <malay>nak tengok</malay> apps I've seen because I want to live better I want to have a balance between sleep

they they keep their [eh] I know <malay>tak</malay> [lah] <malay>macam cara dia tidur</malay> you know then [oh] <malay>tapi tak juga</malay>
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> ya cats can be very then <malay>sekarang ramai orang dah mula macam</malay>
<malay>ramai orang dah mula ramai orang dah mula apa ramai orang dah mula bela bela binatang</malay> instead of <malay>bela anak</malay> [kan] maybe <malay>sebab bela binatang lebih bagus</malay> [lah] #kot# <malay>dari bela anak</malay> [kan] <malay>sebab bela anak ni</malay>
yeah maybe sometimes <malay>diorang</malay> investment so
ya ya ya
<malay>macam tu</malay> [lah]
(mm)
(mmhmm)
okay
[oh] my god zombie apocalypse <malay>tapi agaknya okay [lah] ya zombie apocalypse <malay>tu macam agak-agak macam kita rasa</malay>
I don't know I I have seen the video people <malay>cakap</malay> the science or some drugs can make you like that I don't know [lah] <malay>tapi</malay> I would say apocalypse <malay>akan berlaku</malay> so be it zombie or not but still [ah] <malay>kata</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau</malay> that's why that's the thing I've been reading about bunkers [tau] <malay>macam menarik</malay> [ah] <malay>orang yang boleh buat</malay> bunkers <malay>kat bawah rumah</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> because you want to save save your family [lah] at least and <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>tak payah tak payah</malay> zombie [lah] apa-apa pun datang apa-apa pun kita sebenarnya kena bersedia bersedia untuk ada</malay> food ration
and then at least <malay>ada</malay> survival skill [kan] let's say [lah] <malay>kalau berlaku</malay>
disasters [kan] actually zombie apocalypse <malay>akan</malay> leads <malay>kepada</malay> disaster [ah] <malay>dia akan rosakkan barang akan bajar rumah</malay> [ah] [kan] <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] so (um) <malay>kita kena ada</malay> survival skill
let's say <malay>kalau macam mana kita nak</malay> (um) <malay>menyorok kat mana</malay> [kan] <malay>ataupun kita nak buat apa sebab</malay> ya [lah] so far <malay>nak cakap pasal</malay> zombie <malay>ni kita tak tahu</malay> zombie <malay>tu macam mana</malay>
there's so many kind of zombies some zombies are dumb and slow some zombie are very fast so I don't know [lah] which zombie will come first so that's the that's that's
some some zombie cannot can can only can cannot see [kan] can only (err) listen [ah] <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] so <malay>tak tahu cuma</malay> I would say that since we didn't know what kind of zombie will come so we we have to be prepared [lah] [kan]
let's say <malay>kalau</malay> zombie <malay>semua yang ada tu tak boleh berenang</malay> [kan] so <malay>kita kena</malay>
[ah] <malay>duduk dalam air</malay> [kan] <malay>betul tak pastu kita kena jalan dalam air</malay> at least <malay>kita kena</malay> basic <malay>macam</malay> rafting <malay>ke apa macam tu</malay> [kan]
(mmhmm)
ya it's not zombie [ah] we call it bunk out bag <malay>dia macam</malay>
(err) bag <malay>tu ada cukup</malay> [lah] <malay>untuk</malay> something happened <malay>ada macam</malay> first aid <malay>macam ada</malay> dry food and then <malay>macam</malay> (err) your details <malay>pasal</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> your blood <malay>semua</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam kalau orang jumpa</malay> you <malay>terbaring ke apa</malay> you <malay>ni tapi kita panggil</malay> bunk out bag [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay> ya but <malay>kalau kalau kita cakap</malay> zombie kit <malay>tu orang akan rasa</malay> [oh] it's ya maybe it's a good marketing
it can be another thing like how to survive zombie [kan] but actually (err) disclaimer <malay>sebenarnya ni tak apa-apa saja</malay> [jer] [lah] it don't have to be zombie let's say [lah] <malay>kalau ada orang masuk rumah</malay> you yes war we don't we never know [kan] <malay>macam</malay> even though <malay>kita rasa</malay> everything is so peaceful but
we have seen how a virus turn the world into chaos in this whole year <malay>yang buatkan apa pun kita punya</malay> resolution <malay>tak tercapai tu</malay> [kan] so ya interesting zombie zombie apocalypse there is so (mmhmm)
okay
ya
ya
so that's the thing that's the tricky part of it [lah] so <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> overseas [kan] <malay>orang akan macam ada</malay> [kan] non disclosure [kan] <malay>macam tu tapi macam</malay>
I would say that <malay>berapa berapa</malay> probability <malay>dan</malay> possibility <malay>dia</malay> [ah] then <malay>macam macam mana dia nak ingat kita kadang-kadang kita punya</malay> contractor <malay>tu pada negeri mana pada negara mana</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam boleh berlaku tapi</malay> I would say that's why we have to build it now before we get too famous [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> maybe [ah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> for now I would say that if we <malay>pun orang akan rasa</malay> [oh] this for safety
but for people <malay>yang macam</malay> influential [kan] let's say say it's (um)
(uh) artist celebrity politicians [kan]
but
ya <malay>kalau dalam</malay> movie <malay>kalau macam</malay> mafia <malay>ni kalau orang tu buat</malay> bunker <malay>untuk dia dia tembak</malay> [jer] <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] [ah] of course [lah] we cannot do that [kan]
<malay>cakap pasal rumah</malay> it's very interesting [kan] how ya people try to customise house [kan] <malay>macam buat</malay> secret room <malay>macam buat</malay> bunker and now people <malay>sekarang macam buat apa</malay> #catio# <malay>untuk kucing</malay> [lah] [eh] <malay>macam buat</malay> hub ya
cat is like social media [ah] hook you [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mmhmm)
why because cause you don't want them to go in the house anymore is it then
okay ya [lah]
ya ya ya
and make them you know that's the thing (err) we call it like cat nourishment [ah] <malay>macam</malay> cats used to live in the wild <malay>tapi kita yang</malay> bring in the home [kan] so somehow they can depress also so that's why we have to make sure that they can connect to the wildness part of them which is <malay>kejar rama-rama</malay>
things like that [kan] so that is <malay>tapi kalau ada rumah</malay> the first thing I want to have is swimming pool [lah]
okay
seriously you want to hi and things <malay>waktu</malay> swimming that is a bit like dream like
at least <malay>bukan semua baka</malay> [lah] maybe some some breed can [lah] <malay>macam</malay> I would say bengal <malay>ke apa yang yang</malay> very wild one [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically <malay>kalau perasan semua kucing berenang</malay> most of them <malay>adalah yang</malay> short hair
ya instead of long hair [ah] <malay>macam tu sebab</malay> so <malay>kalau</malay> long hair I would say it would be very very very wet and then <malay>tak dapat macam</malay> wiggle wiggle <malay>badan dia</malay> how dogs do it [kan]
ya it's very interesting and then I want to have like place <malay>untuk macam</malay>
<malay>buat</malay> yoga with all the sun you know because somehow [kan] <malay>kita macam sekarang ni dengan pakai</malay> mask everyday face mask everyday we are less then <malay>kita</malay> most of the time stay at home working at home and everything because of the COVID
we have less exposure of vitamin D [tau] but because vitamin D we can only get it from sunlight [kan] so I was thinking <malay>kalau ada rumah</malay> [kan] in the middle of the house I want to make sure the <malay>dia punya dinding tu</malay>
(um) made from glass no no made from glass so <malay>dia dia dia</malay>
sunlight can come in so you can do yoga things like that in the house but still getting the benefit of sunlight <malay>macam tu</malay>
ya ya glasshouse glass house
like <malay>buat</malay> like igloo style so <malay>macam</malay> #dok# <malay>macam macam ni</malay> [lah] <malay>kubah macam tu</malay>
ya the remaining is always nice and I think dreams and hopes is what keeps human alive [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> during this trying time [kan] <malay>macam</malay> ya every new year <malay>pun kita buat</malay> resolution [kan] <malay>pastu kita buat</malay> plans and everything because we want to look forward in life [lah]
ya
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>macam</malay> and most of dreamers <malay>pun orang rasa macam</malay> crazy people in the beginning [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau tengok</malay>
<malay>macam mana kita tengok adik-beradik</malay> wright [kan] the the the wright brothers [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> when they want to fly things <malay>siapa</malay> [jer] <malay>yang setuju</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> now that is <malay>diorang punya</malay> determination <malay>tu yang membuat</malay> we can cross country [kan] <malay>kita boleh</malay> experience things on the other side of the world
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay> I would say that any tourism related business is high heavily affected [lah] <malay>dengan keadaan sekarang sangat-sangat</malay> heavily affected
<malay>sebab</malay> ya [lah] <malay>diorang pun macam diorang tak dapat nak</malay> operate [kan]
[oh] <malay>tak boleh langsung</malay> ya then most people <malay>yang kerja dalam</malay> industry <malay>tu diorang adalah macam</malay> skillful people <malay>tapi</malay> in one area [tau] so <malay>diorang tak ada masa pun nak buat benda lain</malay>
(mmhmm)
I see and I would say they are very good in emergency response [kan] I see
ya that's interesting like paramedics <malay>pun boleh</malay> [kan] <malay>macam tu</malay> like basic basic [ah] <malay>menarik menarik</malay> so ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
because <malay>senang</malay> [kan] bila orang kena</malay> lay off <malay>ramai sebenarnya orang yang kena</malay> lay off <malay>sekarang sangat</malay>
<malay>dan</malay> somehow apart from <malay>dulu sebenarnya kita takut dengan</malay> industry revolution industry [kan] <malay>bila</malay> everything's automated <malay>semua benda pakai</malay> robot <malay>pasal dia akan</malay> take away our jobs [kan] <malay>tiba-tiba kita berlaku</malay> economic <malay>punya macam ni yang yang merudum</malay> [kan] so
ya it's going to be very very difficult to most people [lah]
and ya
<malay>sebab itu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita buat</malay> business #kot# [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>bantu orang</malay> maybe provide more jobs to people [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> the economy have to run [lah]
ya
ya because somehow <malay>dengan ramai orang kena</malay> laid off employer <malay>pun ada banyak sangat pilihan</malay> so the competition is very very high
yes yes most most business are barely surviving
<malay>macam tu</malay> [kan]
and <malay>cakap pasal pasal ada kesan besar pada</malay> business [kan] [lah]
I would say that <malay>kesan besar kepada</malay> education system <malay>juga</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>macam</malay> kids nowadays I would say sometimes <malay>bagus juga sebab orang dah mula</malay> adopt online learning <malay>sebagainya tapi masalahnya budak-budak sekolah ni dia perlukan</malay> interactions
<malay>dengan kawan-kawan sebab tengok macam</malay> universities [kan] some universities are (err) fully (err) fully on online platform [kan]
<malay>tapi bila kita dekat</malay> university <malay>kita bukannya hanya belajar</malay> theory <malay>dan kita punya</malay> subject <malay>tapi</malay> life lesson <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kita belajar</malay> communicate <malay>kita macam bagikan masa kawan ajak pergi tengok wayang kita nak pergi ke tak pergi</malay> [kan] so all that <malay>adalah</malay> very important life skills so I am so into online learning I I really support it because somehow it gives more people more access
and some sometime <malay>boleh juga bagi tapi</malay> I don't know how much the impact will be towards the character building
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
even though they are tech savvy (mmhmm)
ya <malay>betul betul</malay> ya
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya and that's another thing about autonomy like family is not something you can choose [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> friends <malay>adalah orang yang</malay> you <malay>boleh</malay> choose ya [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
you <malay>boleh</malay> choose and and <malay>boleh</malay> align <malay>minat dan sebagainya</malay> [kan] compare to <malay>ni</malay> then ya [lah] <malay>macam</malay> same [eh] <malay>macam</malay> peer [kan] <malay>macam</malay> same age peer <malay>sangat sangat penting untuk kita</malay> associate <malay>untuk kita faham</malay>
<malay>dan sebagainya</malay> so
ya <malay>akan jadi ada</malay> impact <malay>yang besar</malay> [lah] <malay>kepada</malay> characters building <malay>macam tu</malay>
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dalam keadaan yang mencabar</malay>
ya just imagine before this <malay>pun</malay> graduates <malay>susah nak dapat kerja</malay> because
it's a very competitive market [kan] and now <malay>kita ada</malay> so many
(err) talented people <malay>kena</malay> laid off and compete together with them
ya <malay>macam dah</malay> [lah] <malay>nak</malay> compete each other <malay>pun dah</malay> hard enough and then <malay>kena</malay> compete <malay>lagi dengan semua yang dah ada enam tahun tujuh tahun</malay> experience it's not going to be easy
<malay>tapi</malay> new economy <malay>pun akan terbuka</malay> [lah] <malay>macam macam sekarang ni ramai yang dah jadi</malay> influencer [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> ya like influencer <malay>pun boleh</malay> give money
(uh huh)
!wow!
<malay>dah lama</malay> [kan]
life goal [lah]
<malay>cuma bahaya dengan</malay> being influencer <malay>ni</malay> sometimes they are not being human [tau] <malay>macam</malay>
and they ya and <malay>diorang ajak orang lain untuk jadi benda yang sama diorang letak satu</malay> social status <malay>yang</malay> sometimes unachievable <malay>kita pun tahu macam contoh macam gambar</malay> [kan] <malay>untuk bagi nampak</malay> abs <malay>nampak kurus</malay> sometimes it's just about angle
then people <malay>yang</malay> see that they didn't know <malay>pun itu adalah</malay> angle sometime they perceive it as true and they force themselves to achieve that <malay>sedangkan</malay> all that is just an illusion is a it is just an different angle [kan] camera trick that's the thing sometimes
<malay>dah</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi lebih mencabar</malay> [lah] <malay>kat kita punya</malay> youth <malay>kalau keadaan macam ni</malay> ya [lah] lack social skills compete with so many people and at the same time have unrealistic appearance goal
(mmhmm)
ya even big brands <malay>pun sekarang dah</malay> start to work with influencers instead of artists <malay>yang memang buat</malay> art [tau] <malay>berkarya</malay>
okay [lah] somehow artist people <malay>diorang</malay> charge <malay>memang terlalu mahal</malay> [kan] and influencers <malay>dia ada dia ada</malay> bigger fan base
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
ya <malay>faham</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>dan</malay> artist <malay>dan</malay> actress <malay>ni dia terpaksa</malay> produce something <malay>dulu</malay> [kan] <malay>baru orang boleh</malay> look up to them [kan] compared to influencer <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>pergi makan pun orang suka</malay> [kan] <malay>pergi</malay> jogging <malay>pun orang suka</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam cuma tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kerisauan dia adalah macam dia boleh</malay> set unrealistic thing [ah]
so !fuh! <malay>banyak juga kita borak ni</malay> [kan] <malay>daripada</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> resolution <malay>cerita pasal</malay> zombie apocalypse <malay>dan sebagainya</malay> so ya hopefully <malay>takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>yang penting kita</malay> start <malay>sekarang buat sekarang macam</malay>
ya <malay>boleh</malay>
it's going to be a tough year but it's going to be interesting and fun [lah]
yes hopefully okay
(mmhmm)
<malay>untuk</malay> family [ah] <malay>untuk</malay> family (err) I would say that more collaborations <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] before this I would say that I live on my own [lah] <malay>pun duduk macam jauh</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
I live on my own I just want to achieve my own goal [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> I want this family to be more collaborative like <malay>masak sama-sama</malay>
<malay>buat kerja sama-sama</malay> and even though <malay>macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>adik yang masih sekolah kita tolong macam tu</malay> you know like sometimes I feel like is is burdening sometimes but most of the time actually it is a collaboration
yes it's very good one [kan] even though of course [lah] <malay>macam kat mulut tu macam marah-marah</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi</malay> basically [ah] but basically actually basically it's a good thing because
(err)
<malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> ya [lah] <malay>kita pun kena bergerak sebagai</malay> family
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
<malay>betul</malay> how about you <malay>apa yang</malay> you (uh) foresee for as a family <malay>punya</malay> movement
(mmhmm)
(mm) even the silly silly stuff [lah]
ya true true
<malay>aduhai</malay> okay [lah]
ya
ya ya ya hopefully [lah] <malay>macam</malay> and it don't have to be far <malay>pun</malay> but at least places that we can
just leave the work behind and just connect as a humans [lah] as siblings as
daughters and son and all ya [lah]
okay <malay>jom rasanya</malay>
<malay>rasanya</malay>
<malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [kan] <malay>kita</malay> start put in the planner <malay>ataupun buat</malay> vision board [kan] <malay>letak dekat dalam semua lawa-lawa</malay> [kan] and <malay>satu benda lagi</malay> it's good [tau] actually <malay>bila kita</malay> tell other people about our resolutions so at least they can remind us [lah]
(mmhmm)
ya because when we say it [kan] <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> at the end <malay>takkan</malay> [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> at the end of the year <malay>nanti macam</malay> [eh] <malay>apa jadi dengan</malay> <malay>macam tu</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>

I was doing backstage work
and then <malay>apa tu</malay> (uh) one day like (uh) my first appearance on stage was as a human prop
they need a dead body but actually that role right can just use a dummy you know actually can just use anything [ah] is just the thing doesn't move you know the dead body doesn't move
somehow they get somebody cause <malay>kita</malay> free [kan] they get us to just lie there
lie there then after that I say okay so (um) it was supposed to be someone else I was I wasn't even the actual human prop I replacing somebody
then that guy cannot make it so okay [lah] my job was just really to lie down I was preset you know so that means before the audience come in I was already prepared the covered me
and then somewhere in between like halfway in the
act
like in the middle of the show [lah] before intermission one of the character <malay>cakap</malay> what the character say <malay>macam</malay> [oh] who is this you know then after that reveal [lah] so like !wah! a dead body
and (um)
until the end everybody <malay>dah balik</malay>
then I can they can okay you can move now so I really have to stay still for like what two and half hours
I cannot sleep that's the thing you cannot sleep because if I sleep right I might snore I might move so it
you you try [lah] two and a half hours you do nothing two and a half hours you really don't
people thought very easy but actually is hard because
I had to learn how to I think I accidentally learned how to meditate
but ya [lah] because cannot cannot move [what] so my <malay>kaki semut semut</malay> you know
but then <malay>kaki semut semut</malay> you cannot move right so you need to learn <malay>macam</malay> your breathing and stuff like that
I didn't realise <malay>yang</malay> how hard it was until (um) they got a review [lah] somebody wrote a review then <malay>cakap</malay>
complain [lah] they complain <malay>banyak banyak</malay> about the acting of the other actors or blah blah blah then after that
<malay>cakap</malay> about the best potrayal was the portrayal
the inert potrayal of higgs my character got a name higgs because he died
because I was so still they didn't even funny thing <malay>bila</malay> I think got this [one] (uh) <malay>kakak melayu</malay>
watching the show and then (um) second day they tell me okay you can stand up for curtain call then when I stand up for curtain call already she was so shocked she was like #astaghfirullahalazim# she was like
[eh]
<malay>orang rupanya</malay> so she was like she was surprised <malay>yang</malay> she so she was shocked [lah] to realise actually I was a real person [lah] so okay

my there will be a set [kan] <malay>kat belakang tu ada macam ada</malay> the table so I I actually so you cannot see half of me [lah] ya I'm just like top half I was like lying down like that [lah] so I
so my leg actually <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] my leg can move but then (err) just to but then I make sure not too much so that they couldn't see so that was my first
considered (um)

there was one rehearsal a lot of people never turn up but then they say okay guys can you just <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) can you just
(uh) take over whoever's not here [lah] so I was just doing my job very well [lah] whoever I'll remember how they perform then I try to replicate exactly how they do it
and then my director <malay>macam</malay> !wah! I never knew you can act [eh] so then she text me then say okay then next time (um) can you take over his role [lah] because he's very problematic

that's good you have a apparently early on already got path already
like for me also I keep switching switching
[ah]
okay but in the end I did become some sort of doctor
no clown doctor is considered doctor okay [lah] is not is not really but I was a clown doctor so is a (um) <malay>apa doktor badut dorang panggil</malay> (um)
no [lah] I think growing up I very you cannot decide [lah] nowadays also I also think about it <malay>kita</malay> we always ask ask a teacher also right I sometimes I ask the my students very young ones like what
you want to be when you grow up then they cannot decide but it is just a fantasy thing [lah] I want to grow up I want to become
power ranger then I was like okay [lah] <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] power ranger but you know
(um)
but at that time I remember what is it you know I wanted to become a dentist <malay>pasal</malay> my <malay>gigi berterabuh</malay>
my <malay>gigi</malay> I think fall down and then (uh) I all of my front teeth <malay>semua macam</malay>
<malay>hitam</malay> [tau] like <malay>pasal</malay> I think it it was chipped and then after that <malay>ada ada darah</malay> stuff like so I got very ugly teeth growing
up so I was thinking like I wanted to become a dentist so that I can fix and then and then my teeth then after that I wanted to become doctor because I think I thought like
I think it was because I was sick then I realise (ugh) you know what if only I can become a doctor and then (um) I just got the idea from a lot people [lah] one thing I wanted to become scientist also <malay>pasal</malay> that time <malay>pergi madrasah</malay> then after that my <malay>ustazah cakap apa</malay>
(err) <malay>kalau ada lalat tu</malay> [kan] <malay>lalat dah jatuh dekat makanan terus masukkan terus lepas tu gaul</malay>
<malay>pasal apa sebelah</malay>

what do they call the poison and then or the toxin and then the other <malay>punya kepak tu ada</malay>
<malay>dia punya</malay> antidote <malay>penawar dia</malay> the medicines I want to say who [ah] I I'm curious [ah]
which side of the of the <malay>kepak</malay> of the <malay>lalat tu yang mana satu</malay> toxic <malay>yang mana satu</malay> what
so then after that I'll be curious to do that so I have a very specific idea I remember I want to become a researcher with john hopkins to study lilac
then of course [lah] that
<malay>apa tu</malay>
(um)
I was just study I was really focused on learning science but then
I don't know why [eh] [oh] I know why
because when I was in I was I was so I was always late and then every time I <malay>kena</malay> punished and I don't like to be punished then everytime before because I know
I know that you know if I were late just go doctor get you know get excuse right and then I just have very good acting
no [lah] no [lah] no [lah] it was just one of the inkling thing but then I was at my school got (err) theatre studies and drama which I wasn't part of so I was always hanging out with them
so <malay>dia cakap macam</malay> [eh] <malay>macam</malay> cool [eh] <malay>korang apa ni</malay> what you do performance and I enjoy that [lah] but I was in science I was in triple science at that time
planning to working towards becoming a doctor
but then it was stressful [lah]
<malay>pasal</malay> to get into medicine here at that time [ah] for me you need to get straight four A's
and I wasn't doing very well in [eh] no in chemistry I think was
was it chemistry [eh] no physics physics and I wasn't doing very so well you know is it I like but I don't know why I didn't get A
<malay>geram</malay> [seh] but anyway ya
so ya [lah] and (err) I remember my teacher you know mister #yaz# telling me to like [eh] <malay>bila</malay> ya [lah] where are you going to
just drop one subject [lah] just drop one subject because they were they care so much about <malay>apa ni dia punya</malay> school <malay>punya</malay> standing ya they don't want they want to get us to get as many A's as possible [lah] so ya but then in the end I just decided to
(uh) attended this [lah] you know I do this workshop at then after that become an actor then slowly slowly
somebody I somebody asked me to replace them so all my job so far are because of replacement
this person <malay>tak boleh ajar</malay> ask me can you take over so okay then I take over then after I take over then say [eh] you are actually quite good [ah] (uh)
like that [ah] so I always like the replacement then after that okay then they like okay [lah] give you more job [ah] then now I started learn

<malay>apa tu</malay>
!wah! this I don't know whether I can say this I on record some more (uh) but ya got big issue [lah] that [one] until now some people are very traumatised by the experience but not the show itself but because of producing the show
ya so that like in a way I have to give advice [lah] it's really about you say [lah] your marketing
to win your audience (um)
<malay>macam</malay> last time also I was <malay>pakai fikir apa tu</malay> !alah! <malay>nak buat</malay> like I always have this embarrassment [tau] <malay>kalau</malay> everytime <malay>kita buat</malay> show [kan]

the (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay>
the how whether they can the whether the audience can pay or not and stuff like that but then the thing is
<malay>bila kita</malay> calculate the budget
cannot it doesn't make sense we are losing in the end in the end we are not even (err) we are actually give it like say as if it's charity because we where we pay for other stuff we have to pay <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak ada tak ada balik modal</malay>
(mm) then how you guys do it

<malay>apa tak</malay> explain <malay>sikit</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>buka bunga apa</malay> open open flower open flower
(mm)
so it's about really respect [lah] <malay>adat adat adat</malay>
okay then <malay>kalau</malay> martial arts what martial arts you want to learn
(mm)
okay
(mm)
(mm)
okay how important you think
that skills
nevermind scratch that question okay alright so for me if one skill (uh) I want (uh)
<malay>apa</malay> [eh]
(um)
I think martial arts is good
but if I try
I try not
but can avoid it I will [lah] [ah]
I did learn
I did I like one time I my friend taught me how to do one move [ah]
the flying the flying arm bar I remember <malay>dia ajar macam mana nak buat</malay> flying arm bar
<malay>ni masih</malay> uni [ah] I think because
ya in in I I didn't really I don't really learn much at lectures but I learn a lot from
doing <malay>merepek-merepek</malay> stuff
like one of the things one of my friends decided to okay let's go okay we were trying no he was shooting a a a
because I did I do film school right so he study <malay>apa tu</malay>
trying he was trying to make a a fighting movie [ah] a fighting film [ah]
then they were were trying to choreograph some the steps [ah] then I okay then <malay>aku</malay> more to learn [lah] then he show me a flying arm bar
cool [lah] but (mm)
and I don't like to fight [ah]
ya ya ya so <malay>macam mana</malay> I got the video [ah] choreo but I remember it was (uh)
like ya ya so you you hook on to the <malay>tangan</malay> and then after that one of the <malay>kaki</malay> will
ya <malay>gitu sekali banyak kali</malay> [ah] that move actually they look a lot <malay>dekat apa tu</malay> what a lot of the fightings sequences [lah] that kind of hollywood
ya but then no [lah] I don't think
okay I also don't know
what three skills that I want to learn
I want to learn a lot of skills
I mean right now I'm learning counselling
[eh] you don't know
I'm learning counselling I I did a diploma
no [lah] just (uh) (uh) (uh) generic
(um) a lot of the but (uh) just basic ones [lah] very introduction to all the different therapies [lah]
it helps also for yourself for myself and for
to learn about others and then they need a person
non-violent communication
which is very hard for
to do here
<malay>pasal</malay> okay so now [eh] do you about the guessing culture and asking culture
okay you know (uh) I was <malay>baca</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> okay can
so guess culture okay this question okay that I ask you [ah] <malay>kalau macam</malay> all your friend a text that you somebody didn't not your best friend [ah] think of (uh) somebody you <malay>jumpa</malay> every once a year or something like that
I'm using that person okay so let's say this person <malay>tanya</malay> okay #ayisha# (uh) can I (uh) <malay>macam</malay> stay at can I stay at your place for two weeks
I like this person overseas and want to stay what would be your answer be
[eh] [oh] okay <malay>gitu</malay> [jer] [eh]
okay so some people okay I
some people they said okay to how you respond to it depends whether you are asker or you are guesser
<malay>kalau</malay> an asker
they know <malay>dorang tahu yang apa tu</malay> if you ask a question there's always a yes or no
okay if you can like you said okay can [lah] you ask me a you ask I ask you a question can I can this person stay at your place for two weeks
then you say okay like I have space you stay [lah] two weeks right
but some people they might say that
[eh]
two weeks <malay>macam</malay>
not as <malay>lama</malay> [lah] but they will say like how how could this person even
dare to ask me we're not even that close (um) you know
you know
how dare they ask me like that question <malay>asal dia tak fikir pasal</malay> so there's a lot of like issues that come with it <malay>pasal</malay>
(um)
we take that example is not a very good example [lah] like one (uh) like so so the point is in guessing right in guessing culture
you either <malay>macam</malay>
when you ask a question right you you want
or you always ask a question knowing the answer will be yes before so you don't actually ask before you do the asking you make sure
you can you guess around that it's okay to ask and they will say if an a guesser right would think that this friend
who wants to come over and stay at your place for two weeks <malay>dia macam kurang ajar</malay> [lah] very rude how can you ask me you know and we're not even that close you know
(um)
got the hull invert (um) because they think like <malay>ada</malay>
the they should have guessed what kind of status that relationship is they should have guessed
that it's an inconvenience they should have guessed a lot of things stuff like that [lah] but then
in the end (um)
but for so that's a point on guesser [lah] so I realised <malay>kita</malay>
in asia singapore a lot of us are actually guessers
right we don't ask directly and even with us we are not open to
there's a yes or no (um) people ask right ask you a question why you asking me that why [ah] <malay>apa</malay> motive <malay>kau</malay> [eh] what is it for <malay>faham tak</malay>
so I'm learning about that [ah] so it's very (uh) and I (err) so so non violent communication
there is one part of it which is about requesting
like you observe situation around you you understand the feelings you understand the needs of you and the and the people around you
then after you know what you need to ask to make a request
(um) <malay>macam</malay> for example [lah]
(uh) [oh] <malay>aku perasan apa yang</malay> you leave your
you clothes around [ah] you know it made me feel (uh) like
I I feel unappreciated of all or I I feel no I feel (um)
that
(uh) you feel [lah]
maybe you feel angry or maybe you feel unappreciated maybe you feel
that that <malay>apa tu yang</malay>
all you have to that you you
your feelings were not considered that you will are the ones who have to keep on cleaning up after this guy right
and then what you need I need
I need
ya this person to also do their part to clean up the house so the request is I the request is that [lah] I
if you could pick up your own stuff
(um)
would you be doing it [lah] am I right
okay I'm not explaining very well [lah] okay but then the thing is
like if
an asker to ask that
if it is a western country I think <malay>boleh</malay> [lah]
maybe they can make make somebody plead and say okay [lah] you ask me then I can say yes I can say no [lah]
<malay>tapi kalau kat sana kau cakap kau boleh tak angkat kau punya baju-baju</malay>
ya it's like a demand [kan] to me so it's always hard I was thinking like how [ah] how to
balance that out I try to figure it out [lah]
ya but won't
(mm)
but they don't understand <malay>apa tu yang</malay>
sometimes your question is seen as a judgement
(uh) <malay>dorang tak faham</malay>
<malay>apa beza dia</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
ya I see hard [ah]
okay come let's see what other prompts they can give us
(um)
<malay>impian</malay> [eh]
<malay>nanti dulu</malay>
if you drop everything to follow your dreams what would you risk <malay>apa ni</malay>
but you are following your dreams [kan]
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know I just only last you kinda kinda nearby indonesia in canada africa you occurred under its eco guy causing like you do
it's okay <malay>sekiranya anda harus menyerah segala-galanya bagi mengejar impian anda apakah yang akan anda risikokan malay>kau ni melayu dia</malay>

(hmm) three wishes right
(uh) <malay>aku rasa</malay> wishes <malay>ni mesti lebih realistik</malay> [lah] <malay>tak boleh yang merepek-merepek</malay> [lah] okay <malay>kalau realistik</malay> wishes <malay>aku rasa aku nak</malay> get rich [lah] one of it [lah] one of it maybe <malay>untuk</malay> get rich
the reason <malay>aku nak kaya pasal</malay> actually (err) <malay>aku nak tolong orang yang kurang kemampuan</malay>
I want to help the poor maybe (uh) I feel that (err) it is my destiny to help others I feel happy and enjoyment when I help others
then <malay>kalau yang kedua mungkin nak jadi</malay> fit [ah] <malay>aku nak jadi</malay> fit <malay>aku</malay> fit <malay>aku rasa macam aku pergi lari</malay> [ah] (err) <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok# reservoir <malay>ke</malay> macritchie <malay>ke</malay> I feel that (uh) my body feels good [lah] so I think getting fit is one of the wishes that I want
then next (uh) the third wish I want to be I want to have the intelligent intelligent of a successful person
if this intelligent I can achieve anything overall if this three witches wishes I can achieve anything that I want
these my three wishes so what is your three wishes #furqan#
(uh)
my views on what your wishes are it's actually (uh) is very good from what I see you are a people person like (err) like to give back to the community I think its a its a genuine personality which a pupil can adore and I really respect them
superpower okay so (err) we are moving from realistic to not so realistic [ah] okay so superpower <malay>kalau boleh aku nak</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kalau tengok cerita</malay> X men [eh] <malay>dia sikit-sikit macam</malay> night crawler
(err) so <malay>kalau</malay> teleportation I can go anywhere anytime that I want
so let's say I want to go to orchard and I'm at #tampines# I can just go there in a blink of an eye I don't need to take transportation like (err) taxi car or any maybe motorcycle so I save a lot
I don't need to I save my time I save my money I don't need to interact with people I don't need to squeeze in the I will not be exposed to any kind of disease like for example COVID nineteen
so if everyone have these teleportation I think they spread of COVID nineteen will be reduced so I think maybe maybe I would I would suggest the government to research on teleportation
I think teleportation is a is a is a good superpower
(um) to a certain extent <malay>pasal [lah] tu</malay> (err) <malay>bila teleportation</malay> okay <malay>kononnya tak ada teleportation</malay> [eh] <malay>macam sekarang ni</malay>
<malay>kita dah kena</malay> expose more (err) how should I say it (uh) more unknowingly for example <malay>kita naik</malay> <malay>kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>dekat</malay>
<malay>tak ke lebih bahaya kalau kita tak teleport</malay>
<malay>kalau kita</malay> squeeze squeeze <malay>naik</malay> <malay>atau naik</malay> taxi grab driver <malay>ke</malay> taxi driver <malay>ke</malay> [ah] <malay>kita</malay> expose in that (uh) area <malay>kita duduk kat dalam</malay> <malay>ke</malay> <malay>kat dalam kereta ke</malay>
<malay>kita dengan orang yang suspek tak kita tak tahu ni kita tak tahu dia ada ke tidak ni</malay>
<malay>untuk beberapa minit ini</malay> [ah] <malay>ada yang</malay> research <malay>cakap tiga puluh minit ada yang cakap kurang</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau ada</malay> measure measure <malay>contohnya macam</malay> (uh) sanitisation
all the sanitisation had been done so every person once they reach to the location they do okay let's say (uh) for example I I share an example [ah]
let's say <malay>nak pergi</malay> giant okay I teleport to giant I take I buy my stuff buy my things buy my groceries then I teleport back
to my home then after that
I can so the next person go before the next person teleport the giant staff can claim that area or maybe food (uh) food court I teleport to the place
then after that (uh) I eat then I back home teleport back home from there I think this it reduces the amount of exposure to others don't you think so what are your views
yes okay (err) you said it can increase because the person (uh) didn't know that they have this disease and they teleport to a location and increases the chance correct
so (err) let's say you are not talking about teleportation you you are talking about (err) going to work
I don't know that I have this disease I don't know that I have COVID nineteen I have been infected with COVID nineteen and then I am going to work
okay I'm going to work I took a bus I took an I took I took a bus and (uh) maybe I have a fifteen minute walk from to my office
then I reach office to my office okay so I am exposing my disease from my house to office so there's buses there's
there's (uh) maybe (uh) the walking distance and the office itself so my destination
I I'm I am exposing my disease during my destination during my my destination to work
and I rest at work and exposed again <malay>ini tak boleh kalau kita dah</malay> teleportation teleportation <malay>kita</malay> skip all the buses <malay>ni semua</malay> [ah] all the transportation <malay>ini</malay> exposure
we only expose to the office
[ah] which is easier to contact tourists
[ah] <malay>tak kan begitu</malay>
it is (uh) something
(err)
interesting
let me give a give you a twist what if every time you regenerate it reduces your lifetime by one day would you still think that this superpower you is this superpower you want to possess
<malay>itu haram tu</malay>
I agree to a certain extent where it can be good it can be good to you know (err) be alone at times
to just think or reflect on yourself and how to improve yourself in the future but to you know isolate one self okay how how long do you want to isolate yourself
(err) I think not exposing to the community
can affects this is this my opinion can affect one (err) mental health
I think K maybe if you will say one two days of (uh) being alone just to reflect on yourself
I think that will be good because it is it is quite tiring to communicate everytime with people to meet people to maybe (uh) act like as if you are happy like an act as if you are doing well with others
so I think it can be tiring but (err)
not exposing to them can be quite how should I say it (uh)
I can't put the feeling into words
I feel that (err) you need to expose yourself to the community quite frequently maybe to understand them I feel that we are being born in this world with the people around us
we have to communicate with them we have a purpose we have a purpose we have a role we have a role in the community every single one every single person in this world have a role in this community so there's no such thing as new rules this what I believe
just that whether do you want to fulfil their role
or not or do you just want to (uh) ignore this role or some people call it destiny
we have our own destiny we have our own purpose in life
we just have to find it so maybe with that isolation you can have that (err) you can gain or maybe you can decide what your destiny will be then I think we feel I I feel is good but if
to isolate one for for maybe months I question that actually I'm not sure whether it's a good thing for the mental health
okay so means (err) if a person is a father
okay so (err) what you trying to say that he should not isolate himself yet okay let's say that he he had he's a father of (uh) two kids maybe one is two years old and the other one is maybe five
are not fully grown yet so would you think that this man (uh) should isolate himself
for months
I feel (uh) I I agree to a certain extent (err) where
let's say this person have (uh) no responsibility maybe (uh) no parents no siblings no children no wives then (uh) I think it is okay I guess to isolate himself
but not too long because okay let's say (err) okay maybe one or two month is not so bad I guess but maybe more than that
the world is changing the world is changing every second I phone is coming up new phone every year so technology and everything else in this world
is is changing quite is is changing pretty fast so if he isolate himself for too long he will be how should I say outdated
like okay for example (uh) a person who went into jail okay it is some sort kind of isolating just that maybe he have maybe a few cell members
but then when this (err) <malay>banduan keluar daripada penjara dia akan dia akan</malay> (mm) apa ni orang kata</malay>
<malay>kena pergi kursus</malay> [ah] <malay>kursus-kursus</malay> (um) <malay>macam mana ada yang saya pernah lihat pergi kursus-kursus macam mana nak megggunakan komputer</malay>
<malay>menggunakan aplikasi</malay> word excel <malay>kenapa teknologi telah berubah</malay>
<malay>jadi mereka dah</malay> behind time so <malay>ada masalah juga kalau kalau terlalu lama tapi mungkin dalam satu dua bulan mungkin</malay> okay <malay>kut</malay>
okay [lah] [eh] <malay>jap</malay> (err) <malay>kita</malay> (err)
<malay>saya teringat</malay> something [ah] <malay>yang pasal</malay> teleportation [ah] kita (uh) <malay>ni</malay> [eh] reverse <malay>sikit</malay> [ah] [eh] teleportation [eh] <malay>kononnya</malay> teleportation <malay>ni kan boleh kita boleh</malay> teleport
(um) <malay>bila kita umur sepuluh tahun</malay>
(uh) <malay>kira-kira ni macam</malay> so called <malay>macam</malay> time machine <malay>begitu</malay> [ah] (uh) <malay>macam</malay> advance <malay>yang lain sikit nak jumpa sikit tu dia punya</malay> invention <malay>tapi tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>dah ada ke tidak ni</malay>
(uh) <malay>jadi kononnya mungkin tu boleh</malay> teleport reverse time [eh] maybe <malay>kita</malay> teleport ten years old
<malay>nak cakap apa dengan awak punya</malay> (uh) <malay>diri tu</malay> okay <malay>kononnya awak jumpa diri awak bila awak umur sepuluh tahun apa yang awak nak cakap dengan dia</malay>
actually (err) pretty similar [ah] on on the investment part because (err) actually investment is quite is quite interesting actually you can evolves (err) a lot
I wanted to turn myself my own self to start investing but
at ten years old how much money do I have at ten years old do I really want to think about graphs statistics
I questioned it
(err)
if you were to tell me that investment is (uh) is a it brings benefits to a ten-year-old I don't really think so
but I mean it it is good it is I mean you can you can grow your money but I think I prefer
to not do it when I was ten when I am ten
I changed my mind maybe
I'll tell my old self to just enjoy life
just do what he wants like like you said you know maybe (err) last time I was maybe too good [ah] I'm too good for ten-year-old
so maybe I will tell myself to just being naughty because it is good to be naughty then
then now now I'm twenty four years old I should not be naughty already I'm a full grown man so
ten-year-old it is kind of acceptable to be naughty
it is acceptable for the society (err) when they see [oh] a ten-year-old boy is a naughty okay never mind you just let it be he is just a boy that's what the society thinks
if now I'm doing what a ten-year-old boy doing they will think I'm crazy
so maybe I will just tell my old self to just have fun not to think so much (err) about monetary (err) maybe maybe on investment but maybe I will tell my mum about it
when I go to when I when I meet my old (err) ten-year-old self I would tell my tell tell my ten-year-old self to tell my mum on investing
on investments maybe that will help along the way maybe I can enjoy life more maybe because my mum have a have more (uh) gains from the investment
and because of what I said to her she might give this (uh) money to me a bit so like I enjoy more on life I can go travel
I can go (uh) anywhere that I want because (err) there's a certain level of (err) financial freedom I would say
second topic
[oh] my my memory memory is (err) degrading
I lost my memory already I can't even remember what I said
[oh] I admit (uh) do you have you heard of (uh) about the time capsule
time capsule is actually a video where you record yourself okay let's say you are ten years old you record yourself conversing
okay then the the following ten years you reply to your old ten-year-old do you understand what I trying to say
I see the one that you said was the original time capsule where people keep (uh) items
or (uh) photos [ah] to then (err) to keep in a secret place or maybe (err) some people put it in a bank even
like for me I did some video (err) it's like a conversation with (uh) my old my my oldest self so let's say (err) my old self will ask some question
maybe my ten year old self will ask some question then met twenty-year-old self we answer the question
so it is actually quite interesting but I'm still waiting for I I did it actually (err) when I was I think eighteen eighteen or nineteen so actually I'm still waiting for maybe
eight years or seven years to make another video so (uh) I just hope I don't lose the video [lah] actually I don't even remember where is it now
(hmm) I like to be famous yes
but
but (uh) I think is (uh) if I were to take myself a picture of myself (err) every month I think I would forget to do that easily
so I'll consider it I'll consider it
(err) <malay>salah satu</malay> (err) experience <malay>yang aku pernah mengalami</malay> [ah] <malay>adalah dia ada sikit kelakar sikit</malay> [lah] [ah] <malay>tapi dia</malay> real [ah]
<malay>dia</malay> (err) it was when I went diving okay so I went scuba diving (uh) at #tioman#
one of the nicer waters in (uh) asia that (uh) that is cheap you can go is affordable so I went there as a as a basic (err) trainee
or open water diver course I went I went for a course open water diver course
so (err) I think there is (err) what what I faced was I forgot to breathe
so I thought I was suffocating I was diving normally was diving I was enjoying the the views of fishes and suddenly I forgot to breathe and I was panicking because naturally we breathe through our nose right
but scuba diving you have you have to breathe through your mouth so that that period of time that short period of time
I think I forgot to breathe and it's kind of (uh) funny where
I was breathing normally for maybe five to ten minutes then the next thing you know I am so called so called suffocating
so because of that (err) short forget to to breathe I think there's one of the near death experience that I faced then (uh) another (err) much more serious (err)
(uh) experience that I faced is a so called a near miss I would say a near miss
where it makes me (err) makes me (err)
<malay>bulu roma ternaik</malay> [ah] <malay>bila bila teringat pada peristiwa-peristiwa yang lama yang telah berlaku</malay>
<malay>jadi ah apa yang berlaku adalah err saya sedang membawa lori lori yang berkelas tiga</malay> so (err) <malay>saya tengah bawa macam biasa</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba</malay> (err) <malay>saya tidak bawa begitu laju tidak bawa begitu perlahan saya mengikut had kelajuan yang ditetapkan</malay> (err) <malay>di</malay> road <malay>tersebut</malay> [lah] <malay>di jalan raya tersebut</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay> (err) <malay>bila saya bawa</malay>
then (err) maybe it was at the I can't really remember it was (uh) I think five six years ago so it was at the I think one of the junction near expo
so I was driving at the orchid street at a normal speed when suddenly there is a car that (err) jam brake
I see I see actually he was swerving he was swerving whether to (uh) go into (uh) into the filter lane or
or to the main road or to the main lane but then swerving between these two lanes so I was I was quite confused on what is he trying to do so when he swerved back to the main lane and the traffic light changes from amber
from green to amber so I thought he will still go to we will still proceed with amber light on but then (err)
he didn't so as a singaporean I will sit when I see an amber I'll press the accelerator
so that's where an accident happen and I
was lucky that I was wearing a seatbelt usually I don't really wear seatbelt because I feel that (err) it is unnecessary initially when this thing happen
I was relieved that I was wearing a seatbelt because if I didn't wear a seatbelt I'll fly out of my lorry and
may might I might even cause a fatal accident so that's my experience actually (err) and even (err) just now I was riding a bike
(err) due to my negligence I almost caused an accident where I thought it was a one way lane
but then it was a two way lane so (uh) I was riding at the opposite side of the road luckily
the person a a driver the driver that (uh) was (err) almost hit me was very alert and he swerved and I also swerved so luckily (err) nothing happen <malay>tak ada benda yang berlaku cuma paling paling kena maki sahaja</malay>
<malay>tapi itu pun</malay> okay <malay>itu kena maki tak apa biar kena maki jangan hilang nyawa</malay>
[ah] <malay>itu adalah</malay> (uh) experience <malay>saya</malay> [lah] <malay>yang</malay> near death experience or rather I would say a near miss [ah] how about you #furqan#
!oho! <malay>dah macam pantun berkerat</malay>
(uh)
I agree on that point where the accident happens when
(err) someone is (err) or or a road user is rushing
because when one person is rushing like for example we can see a lot of (err) delivery riders who is (uh) riding very recklessly around (uh) (uh) on the road [ah] because they are
(err) chasing chasing for the number of orders
or maybe (uh) road (uh) sorry (uh) lorry drivers lorry drivers
<malay>yang lori balak itu yang bawa tanah bawa simen</malay> (uh) <malay>yang tu semua</malay> [lah] (uh) <malay>dia orang kerja</malay> trip
<malay>lepas itu dia orang punya gaji ikut</malay> number of trip <malay>kalau dia orang</malay>
(err) less trip
<malay>kan kurang</malay> [lah] <malay>gaji dia orang</malay> [ah] <malay>mungkin dia orang pun ada dia orang punya</malay> (err) <malay>sebab-sebab kenapa mereka nak</malay>
(err) <malay>lebih sikit dia punya gaji mungkin</malay> (err) <malay>anak dia nak sekolah ke apa ke apa-apa</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dia punya dia punya alasannya</malay> (err)
people tend to rush doing things or or is it or or getting from one destination to another
and these are the things that can cause accident actually and I agree I agree on that it causes some negligence because (err) (err) when you ride fast or drive fast your ration needs to be fast too
and not everybody can do that constantly like for example (err) if you have been driving for long hours and you are you cannot you cannot
drive or ride at the same speed as when you start
your your work
you are you are you you when you start your day because you are you are tired so your reaction will slower so I think
it is always good to to be consistent in not rushing
for things maybe we can (err) plan up our day better or maybe have some realistic goals in in delivering (uh) maybe delivering food or having the number a number of trips all realistically depending on the day and time
so maybe with that (err) we are not so (err) I would say we don't we don't rush so much so when we don't rush so much we are more courteous on the road
okay if I give you some or maybe (uh) three hobbies one is (err) maybe ten years ago ten years ago something that I will start (err) ten years ago something I will start maybe soccer
(err) I would know I'm I'm not really a good (uh) soccer player or I can't really play soccer that well maybe because (err) I didn't play or I didn't play soccer that much
ten years ago and now I realise that (uh) soccer actually connects people
especially when you're good it really connects people from different backgrounds it is quite interesting to me (err) easily when whenever (err) people especially (uh) in in in work
they have a maybe gathering outside we said [oh] let's play soccer outside
(uh) this way you gain (uh) relationship or some
relationship ya I would say relationship it increase or strengthen the relationship between between few people so I guess soccer would be one if I were to start ten years ago
and (err) in the near future maybe I want to try rock climbing rock climbing and bouldering
rock climbing and bouldering seems (err) I think is is is quite interesting
(err)
because I because my my my social media friends are always pull some (err) activities that they they done
in their insta story so it kind of interests me I'm not sure (uh) how would I do but it is really something that I want to try
in the future what hobby that I want to try is golf because (err) in the future I see myself as a rich person and golf is a rich man game
so because golf from what I know is is one of the way to close on deals like business deals (err) so
they they use golf as an activity to make it less (err) how should I say formal
less formal so it is it is I think (uh) as a business man I think is quite important to know how to play golf well then how about you
(err)
so far I think [eh] all the (err) hobby or ambition are very subjective so I see where you're coming from (err) we are kind of (uh) similar in a way we like to do adventurous things so I think we are brothers

topic of conversation between mummy <malay>kakak</malay> and the #madrina#

ya so then mummy was saying <malay>macam kakak</malay> is
(err) what's the word [ah] (uh)
the what's that <malay>anak mertua yang biadap</malay> I think that was the exact words (err)
or maybe that is a
that is a (mm) adjective to to describe <malay>kakak</malay>
but anyway (err) (um) remember <malay>kakak</malay> I was asking <malay>kakak</malay> when she
going to move and she was telling me that whether to decide whether want to

she needs to renovate the house is about two months
I believe it should be may june
late may early june somewhere there
[eh] no it should be may it should be may cause this year's <malay>hari raya</malay> was (err) <malay>dua puluh empat</malay>
I remember the <malay>hari raya</malay> was

after my birthday ya
<malay>dua puluh empat</malay> or <malay>dua puluh enam</malay> I think that was the
that was the official <malay>hari raya punya</malay> date
no [lah] as in just <malay>kakak</malay> was asking me [lah] <malay>macam mana</malay> cause
to be honest she actually very lazy to like
like <malay>kasi orang jalan jalan raya</malay> [lah] to her house
like
ya ya ya I I remember is the one <malay>yang abang</malay> #yan# <malay>dengan</malay> <malay>yang abang</malay> #yan# <malay>datang</malay> then he

#nazri#
<malay>suka hati</malay> [eh] <malay>abang</malay> just <malay>panggil orang</malay> gay [eh]
I can tell I can tell that you you
!wow! so deep
<malay>sangat</malay> deep
no definitely I'm going to keep you
as far away from #shura# and all my other female friends as possible
(mm) no even if I did right I wouldn't show you
are you sure you're not part of the you're sure you're
sure no one took photos video of you showering
<malay>macam</malay> best <malay>sangat ke</malay>
<malay>bagus sangat ke</malay> [ah] (ugh) it doesn't happen in
(mm) (mm) maybe maybe the
has like more freedom
there's <malay>macam</malay> everybody is more free and liberal in
is the liberal [one] is the consecutive
for right okay I know that <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>nak masuk kalau</malay> you <malay>nak dapatkan</malay> the hostel room right
you need to be part of their like or some major then they will like let you
my god
[oh] my god reminds me of the remember when (um)
running man was super big and then running man running man
<malay>yang</malay> the korean <malay>punya</malay> show <malay>yang dia orang taruk</malay> the the name behind the back of the chair and then you have to go and like
<malay>kejar</malay> them then after that you have to pull the pull the name off the back
okay so basically this running man right is this like korean show or
where
a bunch of celebrities they get their they have a name tag at the back of their T-shirt so
like other celebrities have to chase them and <malay>cari</malay> I believe they have to pull the name tag off [lah]
so after that (um)
she like it was very popular so I remember me and <malay>kakak</malay> we were saying that
we noticed there was a lot of (err) people
we have a lot of like these young people running around singapore in with like their names on their back of their T-shirt
so you'll see like
#jia hui# #jia xing# eldrick elway like just running around like
in the station in one in one like tribe damn funny
but last time <malay>dia punya zaman</malay> also is you know those like
very baggy like basketball <malay>dengan</malay> football T-shirt
I remember (um)
last time we used to have this (err) music teacher <malay>kat</malay> bowen [ah] his name was (err) mister #jamal#
so mister #jamal# he spent he actually spent a lot of his time right as a
like professional <malay>macam</malay>
#trumpist# I believe that's what they call themselves
like
trumpeter [ah] I have no idea [lah] that trumpet players [ah] like professional trumpet players
so he spent a lot of his time right like like going around the world [lah] like he told us that
(err) he was a very rare commodity
in japan in the early seventies eighties
because (err) back then they they didn't really see like people with darker skin and he was like brown [lah]
he was a he he had brown skin so when he went to japan right they were all like just touching his skin and he was like
<malay>kenapa ni</malay>
then I remember he told us
okay you can say that [ah]
so I remember he was telling us that like
he used to perform in like bass in (err) chicago [lah]
so he would play the trumpet and then his
(um) his
friend would play the piano
so (err) I remember what I heard was that
when he from my senior [lah] who was at that time who's going to graduate already who was about sixteen seventeen sec five
he was telling me that mister #jamal# right when he first came down right to the
to the like band like
like what you call this [ah]
<malay>dia punya</malay> club room he
he was in those like baggy football T-shirts [lah]
so they how that's how everybody realised that
this guy must have some sort of
either he's <malay>kekek</malay> like like wannabe or he really has some sort of affiliation with
(err) the
like the [ah] because he was wearing those
(err)
football jerseys [ah] like those what cowboys [ah] patriots
okay I know that
one thing that's very popular is those like lakers <malay>punya</malay> basketball <malay>punya</malay> like
jersey that is always worn by like
filipino people
true true
it reminds me of #kasanaz# I'm sure you remember #kasanaz#
so #kasanaz's# husband is an engineer and he I believe he's a very successful engineer [ah] to the point that
they live in singapore but by right #kasanaz# doesn't need to work
ya so <malay>macam</malay> the husband must be really making serious money [ah]
#kasanaz# is like apparently like got money kind of like girl [lah] but I believe the husband is those
<malay>macam</malay>
chief engineer or something [ah] like the and he's been in singapore for quite a long time [ah]
like even before they met and got married
yes he is filipino
I've seen him
ya
#kasanaz# knock it down
I really miss all my friends at
did I tell you that #wei xiang# is still working at
and I got so annoyed
ya so I got so annoyed cause I'm just like #wei xiang# first of all right
you and me [ah]
[ah] both you and me right are both like poly graduates you know like
your whatever the score is right
somehow some way right we both probably can go to university [lah]
keep telling me that you don't want to go to uni then you want to work
like for the rest of your life then
<malay>macam</malay> <malay>tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] like
he you're you're very smart you're very smart you're very smart you're bright
and it's not that there's anything wrong with <malay>kerja kerja</malay> [lah] but
is really like quite
not doesn't make sense [lah] since you like you
you're so <malay>macam</malay>
somehow educated [lah] most of these are mostly the people who work there are mostly aunties [ah] who
who like couldn't like if they could they would want to work office jobs [ah]
and if you tell me that
if you tell me that you want to work your way into the (err) the office side right then I think you should there should be a way to get in [lah]
so ya [lor]
I believe he's just a cashier
(mm)
supply chain <malay>abang</malay> a job that is quite a big need in singapore
you know (err) he used to intern for supply chain for
exactly so <malay>macam tak masuk akal</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
first of all you are bright second of all you did pretty good
(err) so first of all you did pretty good
in school and like you were quite interested in it and then you you you intern for not a small company [eh] you intern for like a really
big
(err)
you intern for a really big like like
ya should be okay [lah] no it's not
I believe yes but I don't think you
you can buy because I believe is a blue what do you call it a blue chip [ah]
those <malay>macam</malay> how they rank the
cost everything I don't think is
you can easily buy also [ah]
they might be like you might be you have be invited to buy cause I think
like for example #temasek# right #temasek# holdings singapore
you can buy their bonds and all this but you have to be invited
I believe so that was what my teachers to me so I remember
my finance (err) teacher in school right and in poly right
we know that she's rich right because she told us that she has bonds with #temasek# then we were like bonds [ah]
you know shares right you can buy like hundred [ah]
hundred shares bonds [ah] you have to like buy by the thousands [ah] if I'm not mistaken so <malay>macam</malay> you really is bonds are basically you are funding something
yes so it's really like you need to have money [ah]
ya
but ya [lah] it just doesn't makes sense to me that <malay>dah dah dah belajar susah-susah</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
you just it is really not nice to see that you are wasting away [lah] but
it's a bit sad [lah] like then your parents how
then I remember when we were in secondary school right his
he got an endowment I believe it's called an endowment plan [lah] the one where you
pay every month a certain amount and then you get a certain cashback at the end of like twenty five years [ah] I have [one] [lah]
but recently is I'm paying with it with my own money [mah] and I believe he's still probably getting his
from his parents [ah] cause how much could you possibly earn from
to be honest
quite sad [lah] quite sad so and then I'm just like
and the way like he lives his lifestyle also
cannot understand
I remember like the he keeps eating at
he keeps buying like a lot of designer goods
he the other day I remember he I think he booked a room at like or what [lah] those hotels to celebrate
his birthday or whatever [lah] so I'm just like
why
I tell you this is this everything went downhill right after he met the that <malay>mamat</malay> the his boyfriend
the I remember it's quite insane [lah] like the his boyfriend used to
use him as some sort of like card like that you know
ya they are gay actually technically but you know that's not the issue [lah]
issue is that
the the issue is that
and did I tell you that he he has a debit card then he gave his boyfriend his nets card
so there will be the boyfriend need money can just take I'm just like what kind of insane
ya
ya it's just that the guy handsome [ah]
I think he I remember he was
so this is quite funny so I remember last time
(err)
#wei xiang# was quite a
like not say an advocate [lah] he was quite a
he was quite against <malay>macam</malay> he liked to look down on a lot of this <malay>macam</malay> people because I remember last time
I asked him can we go and eat at this <malay>macam</malay>
the <malay>halal</malay> version of jack's restaurant [lah] there was one at
this at this
it's the steak [one] I remember the there's a <malay>halal</malay> [one] made by this chef then he had a
restaurant at this then #wei xiang# didn't want to go and eat there
yes
it's not like called a jack's it's a by the way jack's place there it exists (uh) near the library
yes
I believe it is or it's just (err) something like jack's but it's <malay>halal</malay>
ya so he say he didn't want because he just like
you want to eat [meh] with all these like
kids running around then I'm like dude that is so mean it's not like they're going to burst into the restaurant and disturb you you know
no [lah] so like remember he didn't want to eat there
cause he was (uh) didn't want to like be near this like be near students
so then lo and behold his next boyfriend is an student
yup so I remember the (uh) boyfriend was studying [ah] architecture or something [ah]
and then the boyfriend he's (err)
he's got money [lah] he's rich I forgot what the father does [ah]
(err) the father quite strict with the money [ah]
like I remember the father once said that
(err) got one time he slept in and then he on the aircon until like after ten [lah] then the father got so pissed the father said
(err)
since you on the aircon after ten right (err) [ah] your allowance is cut in half
to pay back for the time then the the son in like what the fuck it's like
I'm sleeping
I'm sleeping I I slept in like I don't have the power to like
wake up and off it then I remember like got so pissed off the parents were cause he and the
the father and the mother
(um) divorce so the mother is indonesian chinese
then the mother is back there then he is here [lah] then the father remarried then I think like the father <malay>macam</malay>
I think the father
<malay>dah macam macam pilih kasih a bit [lah] like the father
like care more about his like his like half siblings [ah]
I don't know
I don't know [lah]
no I don't think that that is what happened
but anyway so !wah! talking about how ridiculous this is so I remember
whenever these two idiots right go on holiday right for some weird reason they always go #jakarta# one
second thing right they always go #jakarta# on like
business then I'm just like
you go to on business class right
you should go for long flights because
#jakarta# right to me is two two hour three hour flight is not bad because it's just
you are just crammed right for two hours three hours and most of the time you can be sleeping
I'm like have you ever flew to freaking like
#dubai# or like london or not
that is a six hour crammed flight right where like I was so
so sleep deprived right that I lost my phone that was how bad it was
okay I'm pretty sure I got robbed
but yes
that's besides the point
yup I'm pretty sure I got robbed anyway
like <malay>macam</malay> it doesn't make sense [lah] and then you know what's the worst thing I found out from #wei xiang# #wei xiang# told me that he went there and then he still need to bring
(mm) go and meet the mother
he still need the mother still ask the son for money #wei xiang# give the mother money
yes but you can put a number on stupidity and this is this is this is fifteen out of ten
it's over nine thousand
not all of them [ah] but some of them right really right you know you can't put
you you know words can't describe your your beauty right but numbers can [lah] one out of ten
that is not ethical that is anything but ethical
no [lah] you have to make sure that if you are Instagram model and you are like
showcasing any product you need to make sure that
first of all whatever you showcase is true whatever you say is true whatever benefits you say is true
you don't lead on any of your followers you don't prey on kids
don't be #dee kosh#
don't prey on kids
seriously #dee kosh# is like screwed he is like
screwed I told you right that he did actually go to come towards my friend right with an offer
(err) okay so basically I was having a convo with my friend whose mum is the baker
remember the lemon yogurt loaf
lemon yogurt you <malay>tak</malay> you <malay>tak ingat</malay> [eh]
I did I bought muffins as well and brownies
okay so I remember I was talking to him about
I think about his nephew [lah] his sister gave birth so
he was telling me
no
listen to the story so after that
the I remember he was telling me [eh] #raf# want to want to hear something cool then I say what then he's like call me then I'm like
okay so I called [lah] then he was like [oh] my god do you know who just like
what proposition to me then I'm like who
freaking #dee kosh# then I'm like !huh! what you #dee kosh# wants you to model for him [ah] he's like no #dee kosh# wants to suck my then I'm like
[eh] wait wait wait wait wait [eh] you don't anyhow [hor]
then he show me the like the text [lah] so I was like
you're this guy is insane [eh] you want to like
you want to find these kind of services right
you don't <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam bodoh</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> don't don't <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] <malay>pakai</malay> your own freaking like
Instagram account like you first of all right you use another Instagram account
and to be honest
your selling point right should not be
your selling point right should not be the fact that
hi I am #dee kosh# your selling point should be hi I have money
he did both he used both
so basically like he what he does right is that he will always be like [oh] you look hot or whatever want to come with me on my videos or not
that is his first proposition
yes so after that (um)
like then later on he'll be like [oh] like (err)
how about this like spend a night with me like I give you one thousand dollars or two thousand dollars or whatever amount of dollars [lah]
so so <malay>macam</malay> I was telling like him [ah] that
no obviously I don't know #dee kosh# I'm telling my friend that
no so (um) I was telling my friend that in the
in the like gay world right
like this kind of thing is normal [lah] hooking up and everything is normal but
you don't stupid [lah] there are apps and all these [mah]
as in like there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being gay there's nothing wrong with being lesbian
all these kind of thing anything that as long as you
you don't hurt anybody you keep it to yourself don't go and attack all these [lah] cause like
to me right all these
like people taking photos of like guys taking photos of guys showering right that is like you're harming people [mah] like
no one agreed to this [ah] and like you know
you shouldn't be doing this [ah] so this is the
part of like
like you know how people say there's like white privilege
so sometimes people say there is
in a sense right I won't say this is gay privilege but I see that like sometimes people are very
like
they they don't want to <malay>macam</malay> speak out against like gay people because like
they don't want to be seen as homophobic it's the same as
how like people don't want to talk about like how
like sometimes like
women right are actually the ones who victimise people in so called rape cases
like people don't want to <malay>macam</malay> [oh] actually she's a liar and all these ya
it's the same as (uh) you know johnny depp's ex-wife or ex-girlfriend amber something
[a'ah] the one that I believe cut off his finger or something
don't know but I think he cut off his finger or something
or cut his finger or something the one that she's now married to
that Tesla guy right I think
elon musk
ya so as in like
a lot [lah] I tell you right all these <malay>macam</malay> people taking videos of like people and all these
so anyway I guess he's still got support like #dee kosh# is quite stupid [lah] in my mind <malay>macam</malay>
you're famous <malay>kau</malay> famous <malay>macam</malay> like people know people people know your face then
<malay>kau buat macam gini macam</malay> you want to proposition right don't use your own account [lah]
<malay>pakai macam pakai</malay> fake account [lah] <malay>gini pakai</malay> your own account <malay>macam</malay> you're just asking for trouble
you're just asking for <malay>macam</malay> like someone is
and the worst part is right like what the sushi guy said [ah] is like it's okay to
preposition people
preposition people for and using money right is is illegal [lah] you can't like solicit sex for cash [lah] I believe
that is
wrong [lah] like that kind of prostitution thing is wrong [lah] I don't know how how wrong it is [lah] in singapore
but he was propositioning minors you see
then he should need to what's the due (err) not due I don't think I think it's called due diligence to
find out whether the person is of the correct age or not [lah]
because <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know right is not a good enough (um)
answer to to evict you from like (err)
like
a a sentence [ah] it's like that there was this guy who
who didn't know what the heck he was bringing into to singapore to <malay>macam</malay>
to give somebody to pass off something then
someone (err) he actually got caught in the singapore terminal
(err) with drugs [ah] that he was supposed to pass off to somebody
and then he's he did tell the the the judge [lah] he say I didn't know what's inside
these all locked up already I never open it I can't open it also
then the judge says that
just because you don't know what is it right you never think it's suspicious [meh] for
four thousand someone ask you to do a delivery for four thousand dollars
like like so not knowing right is not a good enough <malay>macam</malay>
it's (err) it's not a good enough (err) like what you call it
defence [ah] the guy got the guy got hanged anyway
so same for #dee kosh# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> just because you you
he the guy never say or whatever right [ah]
doesn't like make it right [lah] you should own self <malay>macam</malay>
make the initiative to ask or if the person lied to you right then
then is different if the person lied to you will be like ya ya I'm actually eighteen but he's not
and then
(err) lied to you and you're eighteen and there was no payment involved and then you guys had sexual intercourse then
it's fine [lah] like the person cannot say because the person lied [mah]
and the person tricked you into it but #dee kosh# I think he
fairly knows I'm pretty sure from photos you can kind of tell
that these guys are probably under aged or if they're like
if you've seen like they're if you follow them on Instagram and then you see that [oh] I'm still in poly they still post poly photos
there's a high chance they're not even eighteen yet
cause poly year one poly you're seventeen only [mah]
okay the thing is right empower him right
in the sense that
we we
not me exactly [lah] but like people like
influence [ah]
ya
who
ya you can you ya as long as you
as long as you no it's john lennon
ya so like in a sense that
okay first of all these guys are social media influencers if you want to make it like like more
more specific [lah] social media influences [ah]
to
follow a a type of lifestyle
to buy a certain product mostly is to follow a certain lifestyle [lah]
that's between the followers and them [ah] some people will like [ah] it's the same reason why
you like guitars and I don't understand why and I
I quite like and [ah] you're not that big a fan of it
so
as in I won't say we empower him
in a sense because
what we do is that we we we give him
monetary
like we give him we support him in terms of monetary sense [ah] like you know by by giving like watching his videos and then people go and
like advertise on his channel and all this [lah] but we don't empower him to do the things he do [mah]
if you ask me who empowers him to do the things he do then is things like Instagram [ah] Instagram empowers him [lah] Instagram like
gives him the ability to do all these kind of things [ah]

(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh] okay okay okay <malay>aku pernah dulu aku pernah buat apa ni</malay> mystery shopper that was many years back [lah] then after that (uh) the I only did once
because (uh) <malay>lepas tu</malay> like there's no job and nobody call me [lah] I did the [ah] <malay>aku pernah buat yang apa yang</malay> shopping <malay>tu</malay> [eh]
I did the one for (uh) one of the retailers in singapore [lah] but I have to go it's a it's a one brand <malay>tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak</malay> outlet [tau] <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan]
(uh) it's a very it's a very interesting job and it's (uh) the pay is good the I just have to go there and basically I pretend to be a customer [lah]
then (uh) I have there's a whole checklist of things [lah] that I need to look like the shop display the product display then the some
one of the important one is the customer service [ah] because they are rating customer service <malay>punya</malay> survey
so you actually depends [ah] <malay>macam</malay> when you go for this job they will advise you first like what are the things (err) they are looking out for
and then (err) ya but for me is I just concentrate one brand <malay>tapi aku kena pergi banyak-banyak</malay> outlet [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) after that they never call me [oh] for very long then after that just gone like that
but I got a friend who was doing something similar <malay>tapi dia punya</malay> product is
(err) groceries she have to go to a few (uh) supermarket
hypermarket that kind of thing (uh) all within her area
then (uh) she's given one product so it actually varies <malay>macam kau buat</malay> (uh) mystery shopping right
it's not just like shopping items sometimes it can even be like (err) basic necessity <malay>macam</malay> for your home
so it can be like anything [lah] depends on the product they are doing the survey for
but (uh) my friend one is quite interesting <malay>dia pergi</malay> <malay>dia buat pasal</malay> (uh) food product [ah] I think they give her one product
can't remember what product I think <malay>macam</malay> like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> maggi then with a a particular brand specific brand
<malay>lepas tu nanti</malay> (uh) <malay>dia kena pergi</malay> (uh) two or three no three or four different (err) supermarket
to actually (err)
(err) do a survey on the product pricing
so it depends [ah] <malay>macam mana kau punya</malay> what when you get the job you can actually find out what it's very interesting for a and it's very good pay
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] [sia] upfront
(mm)
no I think when they when you do for them right they will give you the assignment then you go and do right they will give you like one week or two weeks they will give you a deadline that you have to come back to them with the result [lah] responses [ah]
so it's your own free time <malay>bila kau nak pergi besok ke bila kau nak bila-bila</malay> once you are done before that the deadline that they give you
you just come back to the office then you just you submit everything so they will look through I think you should get your pay around one week later
ya it's quite fast <malay>cuma</malay> (uh) they will give you a deadline [lah] by this date <malay>kau kena</malay> submit back come back to the office and submit [ah]
<malay>lama</malay> [seh] but I think that time was not hundred [ah] less than that
but it was just like say (uh) one retailer then I think two three usually it's three and more [lah] three different outlet
and ya but it's not hundred [lah] is only but it's the pay is good [lah] for that time
(mm) assignment <malay>tapi</malay> the assignment (uh) <malay>dia kasih macam</malay> (uh) <malay>tiga</malay>
outlet [kan] then (um)
the one the ya then the questions is all similar [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> three different outlet <malay>kau kena pergi</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> outlet A outlet B outlet C <malay>lepas tu</malay> the questions are the same [ah]
ya
(uh) price about it it's the same [lah] because it's the same retailer [pe]
so customer service then the setting of the shop the display all that <malay>macam berselerak ke ataupun</malay> very neat always very neat
and then (err) I had (uh) my my
my assignment was I have to be a difficult customer
so I have to be like a shopper [lah] like have to go around like I want to try this I want to try that this one got other size this one got the colour like testing the patience [eh]
ya and then after that it was very fun because I find that ya I don't have to purchase anything [what] at the end of the day I just have to rate them
so (err) it was interesting then after that (err)
I just
ya I I mean I managed to rate them [lah] then I I go into the fitting room and I quickly take out my paper and quickly write down like whatever in case I forgot
ya [lah] but then no choice [what] and then is this this is like (uh) you are earning what is like a job so no choice and I think the shops are also (uh)
they they know that mean their their company already inform them [lah] like
maybe informed the manager [lah] not the ground staff maybe informed the manager that
(uh) [eh] this date this or this week right got this date this time (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> surveyor coming
that kind of thing [lah] they don't say like mystery shopper [lah] maybe surveyor [lah]
[ah] they don't know who they don't know when
they then only know this week got one person one (uh) (uh) a surveyor is coming to check out the store so every all the staff is
informed to like be in their best behaviour like be the best giving your the best service
(mm)
then too bad [lah] then you know like they are not consistent right so obvious
so it's like (uh) consistency [lah] <malay>cuma</malay> the
the thing that they the good thing is that the staff already know [lah] that this week (uh) got got got what shopper so they don't know who so this whole week they are they will be in their best
(uh) customer service you know that they can give but then (uh) other weeks maybe we don't know so it's like that [lor]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
one year [eh]
(mm)
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
it's like part time [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> like the working hours how
[oh]
!wow!
okay
(mm)
<malay>cuma</malay> it's like quite far [lah] I mean (uh) I think I feel like it's quite far <malay>tapi</malay> three times a week okay [what] [ah]
(mm)
just nice
(mm)
ya [lah]
that's why
(mm)
(mm) [ah] [ah]
(mm)
ya ya
two staff only right at the outlet
(mm)
ya but
!wah! that's nothing new [lah] because like now I think everybody is looking for a job
right so it's like like like so many applicants to one job so it's like it's a numbers game [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] but I heard that the pay is quite good you know (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> I think it's fifteen dollars per hour
and then like (uh) my friend was saying [ah] like you can easily earn hundred dollars if you work longer shift you know like or like you full do full time the pay is really good [lah]
ya [lah] no it's more than ten I think
depends on the places that you are assigned to I think like <malay>macam</malay> dormitories [eh] the they can even pay up to <malay>macam</malay> I think twenty five dollars
that's why I was telling my friend (uh) and my friend was saying [lah] <malay>macam gini</malay> like (uh) she just have to work three four hours part time she already earn like almost hundred dollars you know
(mm)
true [lah]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah]
(mm)
but you mean your current job is they give you two days work week right
<malay>tapi</malay> (uh) do they give you like every okay you are you you are on a every monday and wednesday shift then your colleague is tuesday and thursday that kind no is it
(mm)
[oh]
like that like like they give you a schedule is it then when they will inform you like one week in advance [ah] like okay next week you only do you work monday friday only [ah]
[ah]
(mm)
[orh]
ya [lah]
true true
like that is like also working part time at your current job but it's just that they will assign you your shift I mean your your days of work like whenever you know
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] but over there she get full time instead of the three days part time
(mmhmm)
!huh!
[ah]
!wow! lucky [sia]
(hmm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[oh] ya
ya [ah]
(mm)
ya [lah] like they have to save cost [lah] if but then
and then I mean like the owner also cannot like (uh) reduce the
the
the rental right ya [lor]
(mm) (mm)
why
(mmhmm) (mmhmm)
[orh] okay
(mmhmm)
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] my god
(mm)
(mm)
[oh] so interesting
(mm)
[oh]
[ah] okay
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>rumah dia berapa bilik</malay> [seh]
[oh]
ya [lah]
(mm)
[ah] that's smart
ya [lah]
but then you have to get used to staying with a stranger I mean like outsiders [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah] ya [lah] true
(mm)
[oh] he's staying alone now is it
(mm)
ya but is he still paying for the house or it's already fully paid
(mm)
ya [lah] true
ya [lah] ya [lah]
(mm)
but it's good [lah] I mean like whatever he lost I mean like the thirty percent that he didn't get from the pay right he actually make up for it with the rental
that's good
(mm) it's so far it's still okay [lah] we don't have any pay cut <malay>tapi macam</malay>
stability I I think everybody is quite is being very cautious also [ah]
<malay>macam</malay> (uh) like how long can we <malay>tahan</malay> like that right like are you sure there's no retrenchment like are you sure you are not going to retrench people or like we are very very skeptical [lah]
so like (uh) and then plus being in the fintech [kan] <malay>macam</malay> don't know whether is good or is not good because like the situation now it's like so so unpredictable
and then (uh) we are also like doing travel insurance then so travel insurance is very much affected like nobody's travelling
so that that's already like zero percent revenue coming in [eh]
then (uh) like other products <malay>macam</malay> very slow moving so we don't know how long we can sustain
and
ya [lah] I mean rumours have been going around [lah] it's better to look for something else but again in this situation <malay>macam mana nak cari</malay> [seh]
like you see like everywhere you apply also like like I see [lah] like one job like ten applicants or twenty applicants applying for one job
<malay>abeh kalau macam</malay> right now like right now I'm still okay [lah] I still have a job [what] but then
in a couple of months down the road who knows and then if I will have to start looking it's like so competitive
and then (uh) don't know if there is even a job then I I haven't been looking [lah] but
yesterday I I just yesterday was the first time I just browse through linkedin [ah] so so far there's still a lot of job I don't know how these company
can actually keep still keep recruiting for for admin backend support
and (uh) and and and the job scope the funny thing is the job scope still put there to to arrange travel (uh) travel arrangement visa application I was like
who travel at this point of time I mean I don't know [lah] but my whole company is like they freeze travel [lah]
so I was like [eh] when I look at linkedin I was like [eh] <malay>ada</malay> [eh] <malay>orang masih nak masih nak cari ni</malay> [ah]
like for to do travel booking [lah] visa application I was like but where got people travel nowadays
really
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] crazy right that's why and then you see the job scope right it's still the is all the same thing [lah] basically like
travel and then after that set up meeting blah blah blah but I was like the travel part is like I'm curious I was thinking
and then especially if I see like on linkedin right the the recruit is from a recruiter [eh]
from like [ah] [ah] headhunter agency [eh] no recruitment agency right
then I'll be like so skeptical like are they just collecting data collecting resumes so that later on they can just call you up
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
[kan] I also thought like that so I thought like maybe tonight [ah] I want to just send out resumes and see
whether got (uh) really like they will call me and arrange really will arrange interview or not
see how it goes like like play them back
ya [lor] makes sense actually I saw the one that I saw is (uh) four thousand five I happy already four thousand five more achievable six thousand is too far away
can [lah] #wei# cause (uh) like more senior level [lah] like you got years of experience and plus if they are in it it mean if they are lucky [lah] they get a very easy boss
with
[eh] you never know you know my previous company there's this one (err) (uh) E old she's not just senior she's also old
<malay>dia jaga macam</malay> (uh) one of the creative (uh) asia pacific <malay>punya</malay> director [eh] APAC director
then the boss always travel overseas <malay>pergi</malay> overseas <malay>punya</malay> office [kan]
<malay>lepas tu</malay> (uh) her pay is like close to ten K you know eight or nine thousand you know
and she just sit down and do and just go around I mean just basically going around the office and talking to people
and then go for lunch for very long and then just
she likes to delegate and conquer her job she go and did whatever she get right she will ask this person to do ask this person and every ask will ask everybody to do [lah]
except for herself unless if like her boss is in town in the office then she will like
basically <malay>aku tengok macam</malay>
like what why why are you being paid eight nine thousand doing nothing like you could just go around and she can go for like yearly europe trips okay
I was like [oh] my gosh <malay>macam</malay> some people are just so lucky
<malay>lepas tu macam</malay> new joiner new secretary join [kan] <malay>lepas tu dia tak nak</malay> (uh) <malay>macam</malay> she she will be the mentor [lah] because she senior [what]
and then her boss always fly around so she's quite free
and then (uh) <malay>selalu tak nak ajar lepas tu macam tolak balak</malay> [jer] [lah] like like just ask people to do [ah] ask people to do the powerpoint
(uh) ask people to change the <malay>apa</malay> send out the video but her pay is so damn good okay <malay>sekali</malay> it in the end <malay>bila dia punya</malay> boss <malay>tu dah tua</malay> [ah]
<malay>sekali</malay> just before I left (uh) boss <malay>dia kena macam apa macam apa tu</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> retrench <malay>apa tu macam</malay> (uh) <malay>dah dah tua</malay> [kan] <malay>jadi</malay> (uh) <malay>kena</malay>
[ah] yes yes yes they say golden handshake [lah] but we all speculate like there's something else but anyway we're evil people
so (uh) they we speculated [ah] <malay>dia dia kata</malay> golden handshake so the boss leave right
then after one month she's also asked to leave she is not even asked to take care of another team or another department [eh]
because obviously you are being paid too high [lah] and people have eyes to see [what] so I think
even though you are being paid very well at the moment I mean there's always a time when you will fall [lah] like too bad
[kan] <malay>aku dah macam</malay> [eh] <malay>kayanya dia ni lepas tu dia tak ada anak</malay>
then she got one condo that she's renting out and she got another place to stay and she got every (uh) I think september october period she will go
for her europe trip [lah] this trip [lah] that trip [lah] I was like <malay>lepas tu</malay> the worst part is <malay>kerja lepak gila</malay>
that's why like I'm so pissed off like we have to do from scratch powerpoint hers is just she ask people to do
then she take the powerpoint she check everything nice already then she just give her boss then her boss will do the presentation
but who the she was the one who supposed to do the powerpoint you know in the end she ask the other people <malay>yang macam</malay> very (uh) <malay>pandai buat</malay> powerpoint [kan]
[ah] then <malay>buat lepas tu dia dia</malay> just submit to the boss that's all her job like that I also can do and I can still earn eight nine K you know
(uh)
[oh] my gosh ya [lah] she's she very good at the work smart but I don't know how is she now but they say like even though she got retrenched or she got asked to leave right
she won't she will still continue to survive [lah] because she's such she's so rich [eh]
(mm)
ya [lah]
(mm)
<malay>gila</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] that's why I was like (uh) [oh] my gosh like so some people are so lucky
no [lah] but she was she was okay [lah] it's just that she's an okay friend but then it's just that working wise <malay>macam suka</malay> ask people to do <malay>buat ni buat tu</malay> [eh]
<malay>lepas tu bila kita minta dia tolong</malay>
then she will be like (uh) sorry I have a a lunch appointment sorry I have this appointment that appointment <malay>lepas tu kalau tidak dia cakap</malay> okay <malay>dia tolong</malay> [kan]
<malay>sekali</malay> apparently that day she's on leave and she never tell you know <malay>macam</malay> bastard [kan] then then I will be like [oh] my god gosh like
[eh] when you ask me to ask you to to help you I help you [seh] then I was like okay [lah] then just <malay>telan</malay> [jer] [lah] because we are all junior level [what] she's the senior [one] [what]
[oh] she's been there for a long very long [lah] usually those (uh) who get paid very high almost ten K is those that has been working there like more than five years
and has been with the same boss
(mm)
(mm)
really [ah]
(mm)
(mm)
ya that time my friend got told me the (uh) one of her experience [kan]
the the wife actually came to the office to get money from the husband
then because that time she was the or something then she was then the but she already got the authority [lah] the the boss will give her the supplementary card [eh] but the but don't know why
the boss don't want to give to the wife directly or forgot or whatever [lah] whatever reason
until the boss that got one day the boss go and tell her (uh) [eh] later my wife is coming just pass her the card
then then later the wife really come then I was like !wah! so interesting I never like encounter this kind of thing before but she say it's like
cool [lah] like like you experience a lot you know then you can really see the wife come and like
(uh) ya I need to take something from my husband you know then then she will like ya it's in this envelope like it's (uh) he already ask me to pass you I was like
<malay>macam merepek</malay> [kan] like so funny
(mm)
[ah] [ah]
(uh huh) ya
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
(mm)
(mm)
!huh!
and then she never tell him <malay>ke</malay>
[oh] my gosh
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] at least can just must tell him right
ya [lah] irritating because usually when they travel it's (uh) company [what] so but they can accumulate their own points
!haiya!
yes <malay>yang dulu tu</malay> (uh) every time want to travel on only
<malay>kecoh</malay> [seh] but actually because I want to collect the points [ah]
ya [lah]
so funny but they are allowed to travel on [lah] but then <malay>macam</malay> [ah] cannot the expensive (uh) like whatever flight [eh] <malay>kau tahu dari</malay> like expensive flights and all that right
[oh]
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>macam yang boleh</malay> cancel <malay>boleh</malay> change <malay>semua</malay> [kan]
ya [lah] that's why we are supposed to see like the
whether the boss will always change or not if were those that will keep on changing changing [one] then no choice have to take the hundred percent free cancellation the the most expensive one [ah]
then if like those who like really will keep to the the the itinerary and will not change right [ah] okay then we can get the cheapest [ah] like more less less risk
ya [lor]
ya [lah] <malay>tu pasal kadang-kadang</malay> [ah] like what like especially the boss that likes to change every time will change [lah] or confirm will change his flight [one] right
<malay>aku nak</malay> book <malay>macam</malay> [ah] so scary then I will always wait until like really last minute [eh] <malay>kadang-kadang macam</malay> cannot so last minute [what]
(mm) (mm) (mm)
cannot [lah] cannot cannot waive off the thing also still have to pay the penalty because (uh) it's I think [oh] that one is because the name
the name is (uh) typo error or something typo
[ah] <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the first name and last name <malay>terbalik apa</malay> and then got one or like I think two alphabet [lah] typo error
but it's so irritating [seh] because we went back and forth then I was telling them like (uh) when [oh] no the
<malay>salah salah salah</malay> the name (uh) of the passenger becomes my name
because when I put in my email address or something one of the button right it auto change
the traveller's name to my name because I cannot use that (uh) <malay>apa macam</malay>
back button [ah]
instead of typing out everything right because when they prompt me is it you want to use this email address I straightaway click right
so once I click that one [ah] the one on top all change to my name
and then I never check the passenger name [what] I straight because I initially I remembered when I fill in the passenger name I fill in correctly [what]

if we could eat one food for the rest of our life
what would it be
(hmm)
<malay>sama</malay> [lah] I also
because <malay>bila</malay> food
food [eh]
but nugget <malay>pun</malay> chicken [what]
<malay>bodoh</malay>
(hmm)
if it's one <malay>lauk</malay> for the rest of my life
<malay>apa sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>ketupat</malay> or with <malay>nasi</malay>
or <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> with <malay>bergedil</malay> and <malay>nasi</malay>
ya
and sis <malay>tak akan</malay> get bored
ya but I think like the most frequent <malay>makanan yang</malay> I crave for is
<malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> [lah]
like ya because to me like <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is
life
<malay>sebab</malay> you will have everything there
you got <malay>paru</malay>
you got
<malay>ada</malay> veggie [ah] <malay>ada sambal kacang panjang</malay>
<malay>ada tahu tempeh</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> chicken
<malay>hati ayam pedal</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam ke pedal</malay> [eh]
<malay>limpa</malay> [eh]
<malay>bukan</malay> [eh] <malay>hati ayam</malay> [kan]
(hmm)
<malay>lagi-lagi ada udang</malay>
[ah] so <malay>sambal goreng pengantin</malay> is like everything that I like to eat is what <malay>macam satu</malay> dish you <malay>makan dengan bergedil makan dengan nasi sedap</malay> [seh]
but it's considered one [what] <malay>tak</malay> [eh]
(oo) <malay>tak</malay> consider [eh]
why why <malay>macam</malay> why like that
what <malay>tapi itu</malay> [lah] okay [lah] <malay>tak apa</malay> [lah] <malay>sambal goreng dengan nasi pun jadi</malay> sis
<malay>pulut begitu</malay> [jer]
<malay>pulut tak ada rasa</malay> sis
one food [lah]
<malay>pulut</malay> [lah] but you cannot put other <malay>lauk</malay>
[ah] one food [what] it's like one like it's like one dish
[ah] <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>pulut</malay>
because <malay>pulut</malay> is one dish
see if talking about dish
then
the <malay>pulut</malay> is not a <malay>makanan</malay> it's not considered [lah]
but food is life
[kan]
because food is life <malay>tengok</malay> [lah] <malay>badan kita</malay> sis
(hmm)
(hmm)
seafood
(hmm)
<malay>bodoh</malay> <malay>bodoh</malay>
!huh! what dang
<malay>habis</malay>
<malay>habis</malay> sis <malay>nak makan apa</malay> make up your mind
(oo) if <malay>kita boleh</malay>
choose like <malay>macam</malay>
buffet is consider
like
buffet
consider
a dish <malay>tak</malay>
like if it's a type
buffet I can eat buffet for the rest of my life [ah]
like buffet !wow!
sis
!walao!
<malay>teh tarik</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> sugar cane
!wow!
!wow! sis
but top-up how many
but <malay>dia tak ada</malay> <malay>dia tak ada</malay> limited hours you <malay>boleh duduk dekat dalam</malay> [kan]
<malay>macam</malay> if you go <malay>yang kita pergi dekat</malay> #yishun# <malay>tu yang</malay> <malay>tu</malay> [kan] if lunch is two hours
then mainly like now buffet because of COVID the it's two hours but <malay>yang</malay> <malay>dia</malay> dinner <malay>dia</malay> up to four hours around three and a half hours [lah] <malay>macam tu</malay>
maybe because <malay>dia macam</malay> on the wheel <malay>sebab tu dia boleh duduk dekat situ</malay> like three hours
but sometimes I wonder what like <malay>kenapa</malay> Seoul Garden <malay>tak boleh</malay> extend <malay>dia punya duduk dekat dalam</malay>
but what are the chances that
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] but if like <malay>pun ramai orang masuk apa</malay>
<malay>mana</malay> Seoul Garden Seoul Garden <malay>kita duduk sebelum dua jam</malay> [seh]
or exactly two hours then <malay>kita gerak sebab kita dah terlalu</malay> full
ya
so maybe next time we can try [lah] <malay>duduk dekat dalam</malay>
for like two hours plus and <malay>tengok kena halau ke tak</malay>
what
we should we should <malay>apa</malay> what's the word [ah] bearing up acts what's the word experiment experiment that
experiment experiment that
but the the the the only downside of
<malay>yang</malay> is because <malay>dia tak ada</malay> they should <malay>buat air dalam</malay> jug <malay>taruk dekat situ</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> Seoul Garden so it's easy <malay>pasal kita kalau nak tunggu dia orang</malay> the person <malay>hantar air</malay>
<malay>lambat</malay> [seh]
[ah] <malay>lepas tu nanti orang tu</malay> get irritated
<malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>pasal</malay> #naan# <malay>tu</malay>
the person <malay>yang</malay> get irritated
(hmm)
(mm) <malay>lepas tu dia</malay>
<malay>sebab tu</malay>

food
<malay>macam</malay> food [lah] unlimited food
(oo) maybe travel [lah]
okay let's say let's say <malay>tak ada</malay> COVID

travel is more expensive than food like I would I would choose travelling like my travel travel expenses is fully paid [ha]

so if sis only have to <malay>keluarkan duit makan</malay> sis have no problem with that
hotel is part of the travel expenses [what]

the
(err) <malay>macam</malay> to to the guy <malay>macam</malay> he is in between believing <malay>macam dia dia</malay> as
<malay>dia percaya</malay> in the unseen as part of faith
<malay>tapi</malay>
cannot mix with science [what] so he's trying to do both [tau] to be like <malay>nak</malay> try to make a logic of that
<malay>habis lepas tu</malay>
but <malay>ya</malay> [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> logic and faith sometimes but to me to me personally logic and faith have to coexist together
but <malay>benda</malay> unseen <malay>ni</malay>
we cannot <malay>macam</malay>
and it's not of our faith to like <malay>rukun iman</malay> we have to believe in the unseen <malay>sebab tu</malay>
cannot stack means [ah] me and you together pay together cannot so I have to pay my own personally you have to pay yours personally ya [lah] it's like that [lah]
I don't know [lah] sis <malay>ingat nak pergi</malay>

cannot stack that is not <malay>macam tak boleh</malay> is not refundable
so that means if like if you pay seventy five you pay eighty dollars then it's not worth it [lah]
<malay>dia cuma cakap begitu</malay> [jer] <malay>apa</malay> so I think I can pay one ticket [ah]
I I will take the express one [ah]

[ha] <malay>engkau tak kelakar</malay> [eh] brother
it's not funny [sia] you not funny <malay>lu lu cari pasal sama wa</malay> brother
inviting
okay I have this question [ah] like for example [kan] okay when
in islam we believe right <malay>kalau kita mati</malay> our <malay>roh</malay> does not exist co-exist in this <malay>alam</malay> already so that means we are in another dimension [tau] so our dimension only <malay>macam</malay> co-exist time we sleep <malay>betul tak</malay> so like for example if <malay>kita mati kita nampak orang-orang</malay> people then if
is it the <malay>roh</malay> of the people or is it ghost or like <malay>jin</malay> in a form of people
<malay>jin</malay> or <malay>syaitan</malay> [lah] but is it
a really <malay>roh atau jin</malay> in a form of
[ah] <malay>manusia</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [sia]
for them
but
but I heard like actually burn money and burn hell notes is actually not burn <malay>rumah tu semua</malay> is actually not because of to have <malay>rumah</malay> for them and others right
it's actually to show that [ah] <malay>bila kita mati benda ni kita tak boleh bawa balik tak boleh bawa dengan kita</malay> or something like that
I heard from some people like that
is it
what if like life is like that [ah] then the <malay>miskin</malay> like got <malay>tak ada</malay> chance [seh]
you just imagine [eh] <malay>kalau kita macam</malay> the rich can buy a lot a lot a lot of special things to bribe <malay>orang dekat sana</malay>
I don't know you steal
maybe steal or maybe you kill people because people too demoralise you because you <malay>macam</malay> too depressed and you <malay>tak boleh</malay> happy tu cakap</malay> you it's like a lot story in the news that people <malay>bunuh orang atau bunuh diri sendiri</malay> because too stress and in every vision I believe in every vision <malay>atau</malay>
or maybe it's it's only islam that if if you commit suicide then it's the worse sin <malay>apa</malay>
it's one of the sin it's one of the sin [lah] so that's why I say <malay>macam</malay>
so even if <malay>kita kita tak ada duit pun</malay> it's part of
there's the the the the thing that we can do [lah] <malay>kita bunuh diri kita sendiri</malay>
<malay>kau bunuh</malay> people
okay imagine
okay imagine like husband and wife quarrel no money [what] you you [ah] yo <malay>hutang ni ni ni siapa nak bayar</malay> gets into the head <malay>dia</malay> stress <malay>sangat</malay> then <malay>macam</malay>
socked in the head then <malay>terus ambil lepas tu bunuh ada apa</malay> is it happens
but we don't know [what] like <malay>macam</malay> some people depression <malay>macam</malay> too too depressed they don't cannot find a way to to solve <malay>dia punya</malay> debts then they kill
their child then they kill themselves
then how you you want to answer that it's the same thing [what]
because you you cannot pay off your debts like at your wit's end like you lost hope everything
ya [lah] then like if that's the sin then you take people life you take your own life then if the people want to live how
ya [lah] then how to bribe
ya [lah]
but if you poor who want to bribe for you if you kill the person with you who want to bribe for you
(mm) islam is very fair in that
in the sense that
you are answerable for your own
#allah# is #allah# won't judge you once
<malay>amalan</malay>
a chance to
but sis can you imagine like for us that muslim [eh] let's say [lah] even if you have a chance <malay>syurga</malay> then if you still have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay> like you never know how long you have to stay in <malay>neraka</malay>
and one other story is like <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes it it gets to me <malay>yang macam</malay> [ah]
they say the first thing that will be questioned in <malay>alam kubur</malay> or in the hereafter is <malay>solat</malay> like if
if <malay>kau</malay> the first question like <malay>solat kau tak</malay> pass <malay>yang benda lain semua tak</malay> matter already
then it gets to me [lah] then <malay>macam</malay> then some people say like some <malay>mazhab</malay> say ya you no need to pay <malay>balik yang</malay>
the <malay>solat</malay> that you missed [ah] <malay>solat</malay> just <malay>solat taubat</malay> then you just try not to do it again
but some people some <malay>mazhab</malay> say you have to pay back after every <malay>solat</malay> like slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly
until <malay>kita mampus</malay> then I asked I asked some people [lah] let's say [kan] <malay>macam</malay> how are we going to know how many <malay>solat</malay> that we missed
like I cannot imagine like okay [lah] let's say <malay>kita daripada baligh baligh umur kita sebelas tahun habis</malay> that at times <malay>kita solat juga</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
repay [oh] maybe if <malay>tak</malay>
I I wanted to I wanted to ask [lah] if let's say <malay>kita</malay> because we are busy in this world [kan] kita <malay>kejar kejar kejar kejar</malay> sometimes we don't have time to <malay>qada</malay> [kan] so let's say in a sense that <malay>kalau aku tak solat qada kalau aku ganti dengan solat sunat boleh</malay>
like let's say like <malay>aku</malay> because of the missed prayer [kan]
then sis <malay>taubat</malay> so maybe <malay>macam</malay> sis <malay>susah nak tidur malam</malay> then the only time that I can wake up is <malay>pukul tiga pagi</malay> onwards [ah]
so maybe that's the time that like <malay>macam</malay> can be it <malay>macam</malay> not <malay>ganti</malay> [lah] like can it help or not
[kan] sis <malay>macam takut</malay> [tau] let's say <malay>macam</malay> I want to be prepared <malay>macam</malay> sis want best of both world I want <malay>macam dekat dunia dengan dekat akhirat</malay> so let's say <malay>macam kita dekat dunia macam ini</malay> [jer] <malay>macam macam kita dekat dunia ni dah teruk macam ini macam</malay> we are already bad <malay>dah dah macam ini dah teruk begini</malay>
<malay>kasi air</malay>
[a'ah] [lah]
ya just like the story <malay>yang yang</malay> the <malay>orang yang bunuh yang</malay> the ninety nine killer or something like that or <malay>yang yang bunuh berapa orang tu</malay> then <malay>dia</malay> repent
<malay>dia</malay> repent <malay>dia mati dia masuk syurga</malay> because the person say no he didn't <malay>belum</malay> he haven't [tau] <malay>taubat</malay> because #allah# take his <malay>niat</malay> as <malay>orang tu cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>engkau kena pasal dia yang dia nak bunuh dia punya yang</malay> first the first <malay>pergi dekat</malay> first <malay>ustaz ni</malay> he went there <malay>lepas tu ustaz tu</malay> say [oh] <malay>kau tak akan diampunkan</malay> [lah] <malay>kau dosa kau dah bunuh banyak orang ini semua</malay> something like that [lah] so he out of <malay>geram</malay> he killed the <malay>ustaz</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> kill the <malay>ustaz</malay> you know
so he went to
[ah] then he went to this another <malay>ustaz</malay> then the <malay>ustaz</malay> was saying [oh] [ah] <malay>kalau kau nak berubah</malay> if you want to be in a better place then you have to get out of your surrounding now move to another place <malay>macam tempat yang lebih baik</malay> [lah] so he [ah] <malay>kau pergi dekat sini kau belajar agama</malay> something like that
no this is another <malay>ustaz</malay> so he <malay>dengar apa yang ustaz ni cakap</malay> so he went to the other village or the other place but on the way to other place <malay>dia meninggal mati</malay> so <malay>bila dia mati tu terus masuk syurga</malay>
ya because <malay>niat dia</malay> because <malay>dia belum taubat lagi</malay> [tau] he <malay>tak tahu apa-apa</malay> because he just on his way to <malay>nak taubat</malay> to get out of the place then he already get to <malay>syurga</malay> so the main story is like maybe
maybe it's the <malay>niat</malay> that matters [lah]
<malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>tapi maki</malay> [jer] [lah]
so if you want to <malay>maki</malay> just <malay>maki</malay> [jer] [lah] [kan]
so I so I I thought I have this conversation [lah] so
moral of the story is all based on out <malay>niat</malay> [what] so if like #allah# decide on where we should go
because if if we were to be judged on our sins <malay>dengan kita punya</malay> doings and everything I think nobody in this world in these deserving of #jannah#
good person
sinners
sinners who repent
ya [lah]
plus point
<malay>tapi tak</malay> minus
<malay>dah ada</malay> stated there
<malay>dia tulis</malay>
so #allah# is fair like that #allah# love us in a way that way [lah] I think that's how I think islam to me islam is a very loving religion [ah] a very loving very empathetic
compassion
society
first thing society [ah]
<malay>islam</malay>
ya
I hope for that <malay>ustaz</malay> also yesterday that <malay>macam</malay> he's saying [lah] <malay>macam</malay> we should educate our child
that
that be modest <malay>penting</malay> is part of islam and all but <malay>kita pun kena ajar anak kita</malay> that you know doesn't mean that <malay>dia tak pakai tudung</malay> she is not modest enough
like we are not okay we have to teach our child like that because we have to teach our child <malay>macam</malay> what islam is all about since young and it starts from <malay>asar dia cakap</malay>
ya [lah] <malay>macam tak semestinya dia tak pakai tudung kau tak boleh kau tak boleh cakap</malay> [oh] <malay>dia tak</malay> modest <malay>dia bukan perempuan yang baik-baik</malay> it's not a good thing [ah] to me personally [lah] because <malay>pada kita agama kita kita punya amalan</malay> is all <malay>masing-masing</malay>
true
I think just now [ah] flying all my <malay>tudung</malay> then <malay>macam apa ni</malay> ten
#lam soon# singapore <malay>ke tadi</malay>
my expire date is thirty first july two years after this
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [eh] what
ya [lah]
perfect
ya maybe we
<malay>kita dah pernah kena</malay> judge [lah] that's why we don't we know how it is <malay>kalau</malay> people judge us
like sis <malay>pernah kena</malay> judge <malay>masa</malay> sis <malay>kerja dekat</malay> [ah] my previous workplace <malay>yang kat</malay> #tai seng# <malay>tu</malay> [kan]
[ah] I I <malay>apa</malay> after I started <malay>pakai balik tudung</malay> right
slowly [lah] I think after that <malay>dah dua tahun</malay> [ah] but it's still slow still new [lah] then <malay>masa tu</malay> [ah] I was judged by one of the co-workers [lah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>aku tak suka</malay> [ah] <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> then I asked why [lah] then <malay>dia macam</malay> [oh] <malay>semua perempuan pakai tudung semua sama nampak</malay> [jer] <malay>baik</malay> but behind <malay>semua hisap rokok</malay> [lah] <malay>ambil laki orang</malay> [lah] I <malay>macam</malay> who are you to judge like <malay>macam</malay> just because <malay>satu orang buat kau nak</malay> judge <malay>aku macam itu</malay>
ya [lah] but it's not <malay>perempuan pakai tudung</malay> [jer] <malay>buat apa yang tak pakai tudung</malay> also <malay>buat</malay> [what]
so why are you judging just because we wear <malay>tudung</malay> wear <malay>tudung</malay> doesn't mean <malay>yang kita ni malaikat</malay> [what]
and then sis <malay>macam tak puas hati</malay> [lah] <malay>kena</malay> judge <malay>macam itu</malay>
you meet american union people start a
step <malay>baik</malay>
step good good
(hmm)
<malay>kurang ajar betul</malay>
what do you mean
<malay>kurang ajar</malay> [sia]
ya [lah]
then if I judge all muslim men are or all religious men are <malay>semua pun macam tak betul</malay> how
ya
at first sis was like sis <malay>dah jadi</malay> defensive [lah] because all of this is something new to me
like at first my friends <malay>semua tak nak</malay> friend with me
because <malay>macam alim begitu</malay> [kan] she don't wan't to friend with me <malay>sebab</malay> she say [ah] <malay>kau dah pakai tudung</malay>
then <malay>buat apa kau kawan dengan orang jahat macam kita nanti kita buat kau jadi jahat</malay>
then I say to her [lah] <malay>tak semestinya</malay> that I wear <malay>tudung aku baik</malay> [seh]
I wear <malay>tudung</malay> is because I wanted
to
change for <malay>agama</malay> [lah]
like sis want to change like <malay>sampai bila nak jadi macam itu</malay> maybe if I wear <malay>tudung</malay> it will remind me to to to be modest
to proper to be more proper to <malay>macam jaga diri</malay> in public
like sometimes <malay>kita dekat</malay> public <malay>kita</malay>
you know like <malay>macam dulu</malay> I never wear <malay>tudung</malay> then sis <malay>pakai baju</malay> low cut and <malay>nampak macam niat kita tak nak tunjuk</malay> [tau]
our intention is not <malay>macam kita tak nak tunjuk pun</malay> but <malay>nampak</malay>
so <malay>macam</malay> to me it <malay>elak fitnah</malay>
[a'ah] especially especially if you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
when you wear <malay>niqab</malay> right <malay>dia punya niat</malay> is to stay away from guys right to <malay>macam</malay>
stop getting attention from guys right but in these in this modern <malay>nya</malay> days if you wear <malay>niqab</malay> instead you attract more guys
wanted to know you wanting to know you ya because
you <malay>kau tak</malay> normal <malay>apa</malay> like people want to know how you look like behind those thing
(hmm) a lot of guys are <malay>macam itu sekarang</malay>
then because
<malay>masa yang si</malay> #nurul# <malay>tu</malay> [kan] then <malay>yang pakai niqab dulu sebelum dia kahwin</malay> [kan] <malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> [kan]
(err) ex #hafiz#
not the ex one [lah] the girl that she's getting to know [lah] <malay>yang dah kahwin</malay>
when she wear <malay>niqab dia nampak cantik</malay> [lah] like you will imagine her to be a <malay>cantik</malay> girl so many girls are adding her [tau]
and she received a lot of from guys [lah]
<malay>memang semua gambar dia pakai niqab</malay> she is very she is wearing <malay>niqab</malay> [what] so she delete all her pictures <malay>yang tak ada niqab</malay>
so people added her
she gains more attention by that
[ha]
like nowadays that people want to know you because you wear <malay>niqab</malay>
no
no
for what
but sis don't want to be <malay>macam tu</malay> but sometimes
<malay>ada apa</malay> you know in malaysia <malay>ada satu perempuan ni muda dia pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>dia pakai niqab</malay> and then she's very young then <malay>macam nampak mata</malay> [jer] [kan] then she <malay>berbual</malay> very <malay>lembut</malay> very <malay>lemah lembut</malay>
[ah] then like guys are attracted to girls like that so people like <malay>macam</malay> !wah! <malay>lemah lembut</malay> then <malay>muka kau cantik</malay>
then I when I was having this conversation with #hafiz# I was saying like you know I don't sometimes I don't I feel like I don't deserve to wear <malay>niqab</malay> [lah] because the purpose of wearing <malay>niqab</malay> is to grown away <malay>daripada</malay> attention [what]
so if like <malay>aku pakai niqab orang tengok aku</malay> then <malay>lepas tu aku berbual</malay> <malay>begitu</malay>
because ya
but sometimes we tend to forget like sometimes you know <malay>kita dekat</malay> public [eh] <malay>bodoh</malay> [lah] like that
because sometimes when we wear <malay>tudung</malay> also our <malay>cara cakap</malay> also still the same [what]
so sis feel that
(hmm)
then
<malay>bila</malay>
(err) <malay>pakai pakai niqab</malay>
<malay>pakai niqab</malay>
you <malay>nak jaga macam mana nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam</malay> like sometimes when we talk to guys like
<malay>tak tak</malay> open <malay>masuk kat masuk kat bawah</malay> [lah] <malay>tarik ke depan sikit masukkan bawah</malay>
I tried [what] once then I feel like I cannot
but then I say [lah] because when I see a people a girl wearing #niqab# (err) I have expectation on them [ah]
then <malay>macam</malay> I say <malay>macam</malay> I hear <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay> I hear <malay>dia orang macam</malay> giggle <malay>macam gedik</malay> like I don't like
[a'ah] [lah]
maybe because I have unresolved issue with <malay>perempuan pakai niqab</malay>
ya because to me like I have unresolved issue <malay>macam</malay>
like #neelofa# [ah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa#
what to expect
react
then how to react
to certain things
so <malay>macam</malay> so
people <malay>lagi macam</malay> have a better understanding of islam
so if <malay>kau</malay> react wrongly people <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>orang islam macam ini</malay> [lah]
no wonder [lah] you know that kind of thing
that's my personal belief [lah] like I wanted to add [lah] that especially during timing right
to me like it's
wear
wear [ah]
then I've asked myself if I were to wear <malay>niqab</malay> then I have to forsake a lot of my clothes [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> to change my whole wardrobe
then if I have to change my whole wardrobe then I I ask I ask I say myself like <malay>macam</malay> if I have to change my wardrobe that means all these while when I was wearing #hijab# I am not wearing properly
that I'm wearing for the sake of covering [jer]
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
big
big build ya
ya
then how [ah]
so sis <malay>jawab apa</malay>
but actually to look presentable is also part of
religion
but then if we wear like that (err)
people will judge us name like <malay>makcik-makcik</malay>
because we will be looking so dull
(mmhmm) maybe we should maybe we should start doing that [lah] <malay>macam</malay> #neelofa# you know like
she change the misconception that <malay>macam</malay> [oh] <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>purdah mesti</malay> boring but if she change [ah] <malay>dia tak macam</malay> sparkling <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak macam</malay> there's bling <malay>sangat tapi macam elok jadi macam</malay> okay [lah]
still
<malay>tak nampak macam makcik-makcik</malay>
what's the word [ah] the the the
ya #ringarde# I don't want to be #ringarde#
but
ya [lah]
true [lah]
and the creator
ya so like
so if you that's why they say when you <malay>pakai benda ni</malay> you are sacrificing the things that women like most
like being fashion
being looking like
<malay>cantik</malay> [lah]
ya
then remember <malay>mak</malay> saying you know like when you want to wear <malay>niqab</malay> when you want to wear <malay>purdah</malay>
you shouldn't wear things that very bright
because you are attracting people like if <malay>kau dah buat macam gitu</malay> that is
you just want to

hey #nurul#
<malay>apa khabar</malay>
thanks for coming here
ya I want to know right (mm)
what is your ideal vacation like
[oh] for me [kan] I think I I really love planning I have to like
I have to know where I'm going I have to know what time I'm going I have to know what time this place close I I love
planning and then I
I may be too much by asking the people who go on holiday with me and like guys remember the schedule we supposed to go here by here <malay>jadi kalau</malay> you like told off what if <malay>sampai sini tempat dia dah tutup</malay> then like <malay>kita dah jauh perjalanan</malay> [kan] <malay>telah tutup</malay> so like
ya [lah] for me I'm quite a planner so but like for an ideal vacation other than planning
I would like to explore I wanna have a lot of nature in it so I <malay>ada orang suka bunuh</malay> very curious about <malay>bunuh</malay> [ah] and then I also like to <malay>tengok pokok</malay>
and then I also would like to go on autumn ya what about you like do you have like a favourite season
ya ya ya
sometimes I wish singapore has like four seasons so I can like you know you you there's something new to look forward to whether you just go out you look out your window [eh] <malay>hari ini ada pokok</malay> this colour [eh] <malay>hari ini ada salji</malay> [eh] <malay>hari ini ada</malay> and then like <malay>tapi kadang-kadang</malay> I <malay>fikir macam</malay> like
[eh] then that means our wardrobe would be like so interesting [ah] like (err) summer <malay>panas</malay> so like the material <malay>lain</malay> and then winter <malay>sejuk</malay> and then we get to wear more layers so it's it's it's interesting to like dress up but then I also think about [orh] the money
and then also like the <malay>rumah</malay> like
(um) we have to have heated floors <malay>ke</malay> heated <malay>jamban atau katil ke</malay>
<malay>lepas tu kita tak nak menggigil</malay> [kan] <malay>bila kita tidur</malay> like ya it's it's so it's so when I think about like why singapore don't have four seasons I also think about [oh] so if we have four seasons it's gonna be very pretty but it's also you also have to go through all these like
this small staff [lah] these small changes that you have to go through that maybe other people in other country they go through they don't like like maybe they don't like to clean their driveway from the snow because always slippery you know but then I don't know
cause I never gone through that ya [oh] (mm) so I wanna know right if you were tour guide where would you bring them if in singapore
how about I say first then maybe I give one then right
so <malay>untuk saya untuk saya</malay> ya <malay>untuk</malay> for me right I want to bring them to
gardens by the bay I'm gonna bring them to the cloud forest and flower dome because (uh)
it's to me it's one of a kind [ah] and then like (uh) so many different
flower species and then can can exist all in one place <malay>habis tu tapi kalau you fikir pasal taman-taman kat luar negeri macam tadi cakap pasal ada</malay> four seasons every country not [ah] countries have four seasons so if you go out to see a normal tree not in a park it's a different colour
so for them that's their speciality but for us since <malay>kita takde</malay> four seasons <malay>kita boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita pergi</malay> gardens by the bay [kan] to look at the different flowers and also different (uh) month would have different themes so I think that's quite cool so that's one place I would bring them gardens by the bay to see the the very pretty flowers
see experience all the different species in one area [lah] in a place like singapore where not everyday
where you won't get like four seasons
ya what about you like if you have like a favourite tourist place like
that is the #kampung glam# area
ya about the old school stuff like (uh) sometimes when we play card games you still have those like old maid or like
family is it poor family happy family [ah] sorry so like when I I I when I look at it you will still have this like !wow! so cool and you have like the complete set and then like like (err) last time it was easy to get right <malay>tapi sekarang macam</malay> like
<malay>mana</malay> [eh] <malay>nak beli mungkin kena pergi kedai ni tapi kalau kedai ni tapi sekarang kedai semua jual benda-benda</malay> modern so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>pun fikir</malay> [lah] like !wah! how how you get to source all of this old cards and then it's it's such a simple game also <malay>macam</malay> not so complicated and then also about games
(um) <malay>nanti kalau</malay> like if you bring tourists over to play games <malay>kalau kita tak berbual</malay> the same <malay>bahasa pun takpe</malay> because you know you just <malay>gitu gitu gini gini</malay> then maybe hopefully they will get it and then they will play along with us right this is like the joy of games like you don't really have to speak the same language
you just like have fun and like catch on from each other ya [oh] ya and I want to know (mm) which genre of drama or show do you enjoy the most
for me I really like (err)
drama like between people I mean I prefer (uh) movies [lah] because I I usually cannot sit in one to watch series so if I do watch movies I like to watch drama so drama between people they fighting
verbally ya not like doesn't have to be action-packed [lah] I also like reality (uh) so if it's based on true story then I can watch and then I will be like quite amazed like !wow! so this can happen in real life [ah] then like because like <malay>macam</malay> I'm quite curious [lah] on like
people story <malay>tapi takkan macam</malay> I <malay>nak keluar habis tanya orang</malay> [eh] <malay>jadi macam mana</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> life story ya I want to know more about it so I guess for me movies are one way to find out about people <malay>punya</malay>
<malay>jalan hidup</malay> without being so #kaypoh# about it
and then like after that (uh)
(um) [oh] there are some reality shows that I like which is kitchen nightmares have you heard
kitchen nightmares and I also love catfish
ya it's so like like whenever I watch this reality show especially kitchen nightmares and catfish right I always feel angry then like <malay>tengok dia orang macam</malay> like kitchen nightmare <malay>dia punya</malay>
[ah] chef of the restaurant then <malay>dia macam dia degil dia nak orang bantu dia dia nak</malay> gordon ramsay <malay>pun bantu dia punya</malay> restaurant <malay>kasi betul</malay> this stupid this chef of the restaurant he's like no I'm better than you no my food is
great so it makes me angry but then I still watch it and then it's the same thing with catfish it makes me angry because like how can people be so <malay>macam</malay> (err)
naive and like [oh] or <malay>tapi</malay> (uh)
<malay>muka dia macam gini mesti orang dia macam gini juga</malay>
you know people on the internet can be anybody they say to be right
you can lie on the internet how come these people are so <malay>macam senang nak percaya</malay> and then <malay>tapi</malay> like when I watch this also I can feel sad [lah] because when say if I watch catfish it's usually the same thing the people who have been catfish they just want
a friendship they want somebody to connect with and <malay>macam</malay> they cannot <malay>dapat</malay> that connection <malay>dalam</malay> real life so they have to go online ya and like what do you think about like catfishing <malay>macam</malay> have you experienced something like that or like
then then then that's the thing I like about gordon directs you don't care about what other people face but because he's just there to help you is is genuine enough to have user and ya I if you can't everywhere also got one side of the starting also
ya that's what three fun [oh] then like so what are your favourite movies
harry potter
for me my favourite movie <malay>banyak juga</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi macam</malay> <malay>ada satu jadi ada satu</malay> movie <malay>ni yang</malay> I <malay>suka</malay>
(uh) it's called #kahani# ya you've watched it with me before we've watched it
so one interesting fact is that (um)
I watch this movie I think four times already that is a lot for someone who cannot sit down and watch series let alone I watch like four times of the same movie so do you know that the
first time I watch the movie was during work
so (err) ya it wasn't even during lunch I was just like
<malay>macam</malay> my <malay>kat</malay> my handphone <malay>kat tepi jadi</malay> I <malay>tengah buka</malay> my computer <malay>jadi tangan tu</malay> I took out a keyboard my <malay>kepala</malay> facing my computer screen but then my eyes are darting towards like the the phone screen at the side so my body language is like trying to tell everyone okay guy
<malay>tengok</malay> I <malay>tu tengah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>bekerja ni</malay> [eh] <malay>tak ada apa-apa tapi sebenarnya mata</malay> I <malay>tu tengah tengok</malay> bollywood <malay>kat tepi tu</malay>
and like <malay>cerita</malay> bollywood how long is it usually three hours right
yes
I think (uh) also the thing about watching this (uh) a lot of times with different people right it makes me (uh) find out more about (err) the person how they think about that movie and then sometimes like <malay>dia orang dia orang akan tengokkan</malay> [ah] then <malay>dia orang akan</malay> pick up different things that you didn't see
ya so like [eh] I watched this the second time but I didn't see it the first time but this person that I'm watching it with
picked up in this movie so I think <malay>macam gitu</malay> it's quite cool to like <malay>tengok</malay> (err) with <malay>lain orang</malay> [ah] to see <malay>macam dia orang punya</malay> perspective <malay>tu semua</malay> ya and then like (um)
[oh] what about like cartoons when you were younger what kind of cartoons did you watch
(mm)
I think
cartoons I don't watch some cartoons that I watch (um)
I really enjoyed sesame street ya sesame street
it was so interesting because like there's humour is there there's also like (uh) this muppets is it so ya and they all look so different and everybody's living so happy together like !wah! damn cool [leh] <malay>macam macam</malay> and then like
(mm) I <malay>pun suka tengok tengok dia orang cuma dia orang kita tak dapat tengok kat sini</malay> so it's actually <malay>dari sana</malay> [lah] <malay>tibanya impian saya rumah idaman saya</malay> ya so like it's thanks to sesame street that I that's how my dream house is which is actually unfortunately very expensive [lah] it's like
millions of dollars and I only have like maybe not enough but it's a it's a childhood dream it's it's I I think it's still very important [lah] so it's ya sesame street was very fun all the different characters I think my favourite character do I have a favourite character I like big bird
he's a good guy ya and then elmo also <malay>macam</malay> quite interesting
ya so very cool cartoons [lah] and like just now you were saying about K dramas right so the K dramas the
you you say about boys over flowers that was also my first (uh)
first korean drama that I watch and that's also how I got into K pop ya because of their soundtrack ya so like
the soundtrack that I listen to and the actually <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dengar</malay> soundtrack
(um)
sometimes when I watch movies also <malay>lepas saya tengok</malay> movie <malay>tu</malay> I like to go and listen to the soundtrack cause I curious right I want to know (uh) how the song sound like all that ya what what
do you think about songs for movies like are there any particular songs or movies that are memorable to you
if you it will be what would it be
or what kind of like
[orh] ya [lah] soundtracks are very important to a movie right because like and then like when you remember a song maybe sorry when you hear a song and then you'll be like [oh] he most pair
almost paradise and you see you know immediately it's boys over flower so or like you know this song
the [ah] every night in my dreams what movie is that
titanic you see so iconic right you see
<malay>bercinta</malay>
[oh] I like this question because I like wishes
(uh)
honestly right I want a thousand more wishes <malay>kerana saya seorang yang tamak</malay>
ya okay so the other two wishes would be say for world peace <malay>jadi pasal</malay> (err)
<malay>lebih ramai</malay> [lah] <malay>jadi semua orang lebih baik hati menjaga hati</malay> #blah# #blah# #blah# and then also I want the environment to recover because we have done a lot of damage to earth right I don't want us to be sad I don't want earth to be sad ya what about you like what kind of three three wishes do you want
[oh] not a lot of people will say food why why why food
(mm)
unusual superpowers !wah! I've always wanted to try to be invisible because I think when I be invisible right I can like go anywhere I don't have to pay for my bus fare I don't have to pay for my ticket fare then I can do whatever I want so I can like eat
stuff I can just go behind the counter I can go to the cake eat or maybe if I want to try some clothes right then I can like <malay>masuk dalam</malay> and I <malay>pakai baju</malay> and I <malay>tengok cantik ke tak</malay> [eh] and then also maybe say if I want to go to like amusement park !wow! I don't have to queue [eh]
I just go inside I sit down and then I enjoy the ride and then people pay seventy dollar
then I pay nothing so I think ya [lah] that's that's what I want to
do wanna be invisible because <malay>macam</malay> quite
(uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> freeing [lah] ya freeing then (err) nobody knows
who I am I can do whatever I want so [kan] I can <malay>beli buat benda bodoh orang pun tak tahu siapa</malay> I [kan] <malay>pasal tak nampak pun</malay> ya what about you what kind of superpower you like
that's a very cool superpower
what do you think I am thinking of right now
it's always about food I think (uh) the reading about minds one sometimes (uh) I think it's cool but I'm also scared about it because like what if I find out something that's
I'm not supposed to find out
ya ask me
of course no problem
the one thing that I wish was free is (um)
actually why one thing [ah] why cannot be many things I say education ya
because like to put in perspective right this year I try to apply for uni so unfortunately the uni <malay>mahal</malay> [lah] <malay>satu tahun lima puluh ribu</malay> so you imagine <malay>kalau lepas tiga tahun berapa ribu tu</malay> (uh)
(err) <malay>ribu puluh ribu kali tiga</malay> it's like hundred fifty thousand where am I gonna get that money you know
<malay>yang tu caranya</malay> a lot of money so then and then (uh) I think so that's in my perspective personal perspective where I don't have like a lot of money and then like what if I think about other people like (uh) I remember (uh)
<malay>saudara</malay> where they had to lay <malay>antara dapat duit</malay> bursary <malay>atau budak tu</malay> move on to a better education so <malay>kalau budak tu dapat duit</malay> bursary <malay>maknanya dia kena</malay> stay in
(uh) not so not the best education <malay>untuk dia</malay> and then if that that <malay>budak</malay> goes on to (uh) a better education he might not get
(uh) the money so that is like so sad right why do you have to choose between money and education you know then also like because I think education <malay>macam</malay> it helps to break poverty cycles [lah]
ya so like the example I just gave you right people are stuck in this loop because they [ah] have to choose between these two and both are important right [ah] <malay>yang mana awak nak pilih yang duit ke untuk pelajaran</malay> ya [oh] ya another thing actually very important (uh)
sanitation which is clean clean toilets
ya because it's like you know sometimes when you go travelling right you go countries and then you'll be like okay <malay>kita pergi dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> petrol station <malay>nak pergi</malay> toilet <malay>nak pergi</malay> toilet <malay>tak kat</malay> [ah]
[ah] petrol station <malay>dia nampak tak dia punya jamban</malay> so many different
colours and so many different smells so like
it's so
basic clean toilets and then like so I cannot imagine how different countries
if we were to stop ourselves from going toilet because it's so disgusting and then in the end we become gross you know ya what about you what do you think what what do you one thing you wish was free
yes
[oh] if humans no longer needed to work to survive what would we do
okay so my friends and I <malay>kita selalu berbual</malay> how like we're stuck in jobs how we have to work from like nine to five <malay>habis tu bila dah habis kerja kita penat</malay> and then we don't feel like doing our own hobbies <malay>tapi kita tetap</malay> couldn't <malay>kerja</malay> because <malay>kita perlukan duit</malay> right
we need to keep working to get money because we also need to have bills to pay we want to buy stuff and then what if you want to enjoy so that you want to travel also you still need money so this is another loop
so I guess the one thing that everybody would want is just to take a break
you know just to be ourselves just to enjoy life so that's one thing I think that (uh) people would definitely be doing if we didn't have to work ya
what do you think like like what do you think about vacations and all that what would be your ideal vacation
[oh] ya so like ideal vacation would be so interesting right <malay>macam</malay> people <malay>ada dia punya macam jawapan dia orang dah tahu apa dia orang nak mana nak pergi tapi tak boleh buat pasal dia orang asyik kerja</malay> like how much more longer you gonna work man like ya
that's cool my mother likes gardening also ya and gardening (err) she has made a lot of friends [eh] from gardening like sometimes when she's in the the gardening the small garden community garden right downstairs so <malay>kalau dekat sana seorang kadang-kadang ada orang lalu nanti dia tanya</malay>
[eh] <malay>awak sini berkebun</malay> [eh] then they ask her [eh] can I join or not like
[eh] then they make friend blah blah blah so that's actually how she expand she expand and expand the network so it's quite interesting to see like [oh] it's through these hobbies we you know when you just doing your own thing you just enjoying and then people see you having fun and then they also want to have fun right
!wah! so nice and like she she she's I I like to see her having fun [lah]
ya what what about you like hobbies what kind of hobbies you want to try what kind of hobbies you wanna like !wah! how come hobbies that didn't work out what kind of hobbies do you enjoy now
for me my hobbies has always been arts [lah] I really like arts whether it's like <malay>macam</malay> music <malay>atau</malay>
makeup eye makeup <malay>lukis ke apa</malay> [kan] it's very fun and like (uh) I think about hobbies
say if I were to play like music or like (uh) art right I have to practise so I really enjoy practising music because it's like really fun ya what what do you think about practising do you think it's fun or do you think it's like annoying
ya it's true [oh] then I wanna ask (um)
see like (uh) what sort about like music right cause I'm interested in music I really like music right <malay>jadi apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> favourite <malay>lagu</malay> [eh]
<malay>apa-apa</malay> genre [lah]
(mm)
think for me (mm)
<malay>kalau lagu melayu</malay> [kan] <malay>lagu melayu</malay> I <malay>ingat macam</malay> more
to <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia I don't know why but I really like their music you won't need to recommend me more like malay stuff [lah] I think my <malay>bahasa</malay> indonesia is quite good so recently there's this song it's called
<malay>mengunci ikatan jadi maksud dia</malay> [kan] <malay>macam mengunci ikatan jadi macam</malay> memory [lah] <malay>dia nak simpan</malay> memory <malay>tu dia tak nak lupakan</malay> (uh) actually I got this song right from a drama a a drama on YouTube it's so good it's only
four episodes ya and then (err) the way they shot it also like the beach I mean everybody loves the beach it looks so beautiful and then they play this song also so it's also memorable
so ya that that's that's one of my newer favourite songs [lah] and it's also by an artist that I really like (uh) actually last year the <malay>dia ada datang</malay> singer last year maybe last year <malay>atau dua tahun lepas dia datang</malay> singapore <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tak tak pergi</malay> !alamak!
what about like live music (err) <malay>pernah ada pergi tak dengan</malay> experience <malay>ke tak</malay> live music
to this place
for me I really love concerts [leh] like it's too bad [lah] this year cannot go concerts but I think that's okay because I get to save money right
(uh) then like (mm)
for me [kan] my (uh)
concert <malay>yang macam paling</malay> memorable <malay>tu dengan</malay> my sister <malay>juga</malay> [ah] <malay>ni bila dua ribu tujuh belas tengok</malay> coldplay [oh] actually an interesting thing about this was (uh)
when I went to buy the tickets for this show so I remember the people in front of me they were not fans of the show they were people who wanted to buy as many tickets as they can right <malay>jadi dia orang nak jual</malay> at
a higher price
ya [lah] so like for me (uh)
as a frequent concert goer [kan] you always hear stories of people who
sell tickets at a higher price so it was quite surprising that [oh] my goodness I am standing in a line and then in front of me is the person who does this you know because all this time you read online and then suddenly you see the person in front of you it's like
ya so that was not only the concert itself was memorable [lah] <malay>tapi dia punya bila</malay> part <malay>beli tiket itu pun</malay> memorable but in a <malay>sedih punya</malay> memory ya
[oh] ya I (mm) what about <malay>macam</malay> (mm) <malay>ni punya</malay> fashion style like how would you describe your fashion style
think for me my fashion style I always like to (uh) dress up I like to experiment since I was a kid so I always like try to go for like maybe but my normal life would be say smart casual then maybe I would like to try streetwear
and then (uh) if you look at my closet I like to have outerwears because it's so easy you just layer on and then you go it's finish
ya and (err) I I like to wear navy blue what about you what what kind of colours you like to wear
ya so like colours are really fun right to play and then <malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>setiap orang</malay> [kan] <malay>ada warna dia tetap untuk diri dia</malay> I mean like ya if you wanna like have fun go ahead you wanna be comfortable go ahead ya I got random question for you (uh) ya do you believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight ya that's why I ask you I wanted to know your opinion ya because for me [kan] (uh)
<malay>apa jatuh cinta pada pemandangan yang pertama macam pelik</malay> [eh]
cause for me right my crushes are usually on like after I know the person after I know their character after
I see them do stuff after I hear them say stuff then it's like yes I like this <malay>ciri-ciri jadi</malay> I <malay>suka orang ni</malay> [lah]
so like (err) personally I've never fallen in love at first sight and I think it's
<malay>pelik</malay> ya
ya what is it
I think this [one] [eh] your hardest question [eh] how can you ask me to eat one dish for the rest of my life how can like that
when the world has so many very nice dishes you ask me to choose one dish (mm) how can I don't know about dish [lah] but I think right for I [kan] you know my <malay>mesti</malay> I <malay>pilih</malay> okay <malay>antara</malay> syrup <malay>limau atau teh</malay> O <malay>ais limau</malay>
ya I think (uh) like <malay>teh</malay> O ice also I mean you can <malay>minum panas</malay> it stays great and then you can <malay>minum sejuk</malay> it taste great
and then like but if you drink syrup <malay>limau panas-panas ada ke orang minum macam gitu tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>mungkin ada tapi</malay> I <malay>tak tahu</malay> ya and [oh] so (um)
about this the the one dish for the rest of your life then what about like (um) say if you want to move to a country to stay for the rest of your life where would it be
for me (uh) just now you mentioned korea right you say you really like the the place all that down to the culture
[oh] I was thinking
(mm) korea I think okay but like
I want to say the language is a barrier ya but sometimes it's the food also
ya
I had a
not a very nice experience when I was at the airport because
(err) <malay>apa ni kat</malay> airport <malay>tu dah nak terbang tapi lapar gila belum makan</malay> my <malay>makan tengah hari pun</malay>
<malay>sikit</malay> [jer] I think maybe just (err) what do they eat #japchae# [ah] #japchae# I guess I'm the person who has to eat rice right to be full but I ate #japchae# #japchae# is noodle ya ya
so then I didn't eat for like dinner and then I was at the airport and there was no halal food I mean there's halal food but you see their airport is
very big [ah] so I if I were to reach there I calculate [lah] like cannot reach there before my gate open what if I reach there then the the <malay>kedai tutup</malay> then <malay>mesti lapar</malay> [kan] so I remember I I I only bought <malay>kacang</malay>
<malay>kacang makan</malay>
<malay>habis tu</malay> I only ate in taiwan
!chey! cause taiwan
was the transit ya and then that's where the food on the plane [lah] so I the so these are the things that I think about when I want to think about living in the country
it's simple as food as simple as (uh) language culture culture I feel like you can adapt to it ya I don't know I don't think there's a country for me that I wanna stay forever I think I like to jump around
in singapore for tourist place right I like to go nature ya cause I like to relax <malay>jadi bila</malay> I <malay>nampak pokok</malay> I <malay>nampak</malay>
(uh) <malay>air air tenteram</malay> I <malay>tak fikir banyak</malay> I <malay>boleh dengar</malay>
I <malay>boleh tengok dia punya warna walaupun warna dia hijau</malay> [jer] but like there's so many different colours of green
like [eh] quite cool [leh] like [oh] and then like (uh) ya I like
to actually I like to listen to the leaves and the meet in the wind
what about you is there are there any favourite sounds you have
[oh] that's cool ya flowers really makes me happy also I I don't think I have a favourite flower [lah] but I I love looking at like baby breath tiny flowers it's like something small it's not about the size but
especially when they're small and then like daisies also ya you remember the daisies that we saw at coney island right !wah! they were so cool
ya like <malay>macam bunga-bunga pun</malay>
<malay>cantik</malay> very delicate
ya
very cool and like (um)
so like what kind of flower like do you wish you can plant
ya
so it's very cool to see (um) (err) what is this the flower moving
in the wind and then (err)
so ya [lah] I really like flowers I also like plant I like nature we all like to relax right it's so cool
and then everybody <malay>macam</malay> just <malay>bersenam dalam dia punya taman</malay>

<malay>kau buat apa</malay> the whole day
[oh] world of married
what is it about
[oh]
[oh]
(mm)
[oh]
you know
lately right
I feel that there's a lot of
celebrities
who are getting divorced
cause like you you know like #Syamsul Yusof# right
I feel very sad for him [seh] cause like he's like my favourite
then <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>dapat tahu</malay> yang <malay>dia akan cerai</malay> with <malay>dia punya</malay> (uh) <malay>isteri</malay> right
it really make me feel sad cause I thought that was the love of his life [seh]
(hmm)
but I don't know [eh] cause like
they were married since two thousand fourteen if I'm not wrong so it's been six years
and then (um)
actually I don't know <malay>asal dorang</malay> break up [ah] [eh] <malay>asal dorang nak</malay>
<malay>cerai</malay> everything
but I just feel that is sad cause they already have like
two
(uh) children I think one of it
(uh) is a guy one is a girl
then (um) I know #Puteri# (uh) which is
his wife right
is someone who is very like patient and kind and nice
and for her to file a
(uh) divorce right
it really shows that
maybe #Syamsul# did something [ah] but I don't know [seh]
or maybe like they just not happy with each other anymore
makes me feel
very sad honestly cause like
I will I saw their like (um)
marriage and everything
and then actually (uh) on the day that they got married right
he was
actually sick
he was really sick [eh] but then he went ahead with the marriage
and then it made me feel like
!wah! if he
went through that and if he like at that point of time
at that point of time <malay>yang aku rasa macam</malay> !wow! he found the one
and then
when this kind of thing happen right it make me doubt love
[seh] like how can he be so sure then at the end of the day
he's not going to be with her anymore
ya I guess
but you know
other than (um)
like #Syamsul Yusof# all right
I also remember got this
I think
it was just <malay>berapa tahun yang lalu</malay>
you know #Alif Aziz#
and Bella ya I think that that kind of stories also quite sad cause like
they
I feel like #Alif# is kind of a toxic person but
he kind of love Bella and Bella has no choice cause Bella is very soft
and I <malay>rasa macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I Bella I <malay>pun</malay> maybe will do the same thing cause I'm stuck in that cycle
of loving someone who is
toxic
ya they got back together I think time <malay>bulan ramadan</malay> I think they got back together that which make me feel <malay>macam</malay>
why but then bella was saying like [oh]
don't [ah] <malay>jangan</malay> [lah] judge and everything then I was like (oo) okay
ya
ya
ya ya ya ya
actually that time I <malay>terserempak dia</malay> then when I saw him right
I feel I don't feel (um)
like you know all those malay community or what right they were like bashing him and look down on him but when I look at him I feel <malay>kesian</malay> cause he looks very like
(um) scared but he put up a very like brave front like like he got everything under control
ya
(mm)
but I think it's also because (um) he
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] maybe it's the parents or maybe it's the the way his work is
cause that time I know [ah] <malay>dia kena tangkap pergi</malay> karaoke <malay>dengan</malay> like other girls
I mean the other girls were like not even
(um) saying sorry or anything
[oh] your hair
(um) I don't know [seh] I think you should just
<malay>buat kot</malay> cause like
it's really like half the price of the original price
ya I mean no harm trying [ah] <malay>sebab</malay> if you <malay>tak</malay> try then you'll never know what
ya so you should just go for it [ah]
I going school at I think I need to be in school by ten so I need to leave house at around nine
ya

to have like a sense of security <malay>kat sana</malay>

you know
I feel a bit
sad that you are not in the same school as me
[ah] cause I <malay>rasa</malay> lonely <malay>kat sekolah</malay>

(uh) our soccer friends
<malay>dorang</malay> actually <malay>kat</malay> <malay>sekarang</malay>
[ah] our captain remember
[ah] <malay>nama dia</malay> start with letter L
and <malay>dia punya kawan</malay> (uh) I think <malay>nama dia</malay> start letter B
ya
ya the same place as me [ah]
[ah] my our campus is
[ah] Dover
ya
ya [oh] my god I was so happy when I saw them I like went up to them hug them and everything
ya
you know I I <malay>nak beli baju daripada</malay> Shein you know Shein
is like a
a website [ah] where you can get like cheaper clothes
ya but then like I really need to look at the review [ah]
ya and I thought of buying it [ah] cause like
I feel like
I <malay>tak ada baju</malay> [seh] <malay>pergi sekolah</malay>
although I <malay>pergi sekolah dua hari</malay> [jer] every week
(mmhmm)
why fifty dollar quite a lot [what]
[oh]
but I think in your
in your like situation <malay>memang susah nak</malay> save [tau] actually
because you only receive like nine hundred [ah] spending money how to save
ya
[eh] I feel that the money that you have
for like <malay>kerja</malay> [kan] is just for you <malay>untuk</malay>
spend for the month
but like maybe okay [lah] not that
direct nine hundred [ah] but like
maybe one hundred you <malay>simpan</malay>
those kind of thing
you know I <malay>rasa macam</malay> this year has been the slowest yet fastest year ever
ya I I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I've been a snorlax for so long
then <malay>sekarang macam</malay>
<malay>baru bangun</malay>
[dah] <malay>bangun kena kerja keras pula tu</malay>
ya it's very hard
I mean
I think
it's normal for everyone to struggle but
those
who don't have biology background will struggle more
definitely
(mm) I like it but there are just some parts that is just too draining honestly
[orh] for #Anas# [eh]
you know I feel [kan] <malay>untuk</malay> present <malay>kita nak beli</malay> present <malay>untuk lelaki memang susah sebab</malay>
<malay>lelakinya</malay> present <malay>selalu mahal-mahal ataupun selalu</malay> because <malay>lelaki dorang macam</malay> very practical
ya I mean I feel for #Anas# right maybe you should get him clothes
I think it's safe to buy triple [eh]
cause he has been wearing the same thing for so long
no it's cause he doesn't where to shop he doesn't have
time to shop
ya
no as in can buy the casual kind like not black maybe like purple
or like blue
he bought
he bought purple okay like lavender purple
also cute
ya but he never use
cause [eh] I haven't finish <malay>cakap</malay> [lah]
because
<malay>dia tak muat</malay>
okay then <malay>takpe kot</malay>
ya you can buy
can buy him <malay>sabun</malay>
ya I mean if you want it easy then just <malay>baju</malay> [eh] then just (uh) perfume [lah]
(uh) I think it's okay it's just sometimes <malay>dia</malay> very busy
and everything
I think
he's
struggling
in a way
but at the same time I <malay>rasa dia boleh</malay> [lah]
<malay>takde</malay> [lah] I mean
sometimes you have no choice but to just suck it up
ya I mean he really has such a very packed schedule
I don't think he has time to meet people also
that time he met #Dakshah# also <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tak</malay> free
maybe if you just ask him out cause like even #Dakshah# had to ask him out
(mm)
ya that's true
depends [ah]
(uh) a bit of physics but other than that no
!huh! I very like packed with a lot of things [eh] I got I struggling with school <malay>takde</malay> time [ah]
[oh] did mama tell you that
[oh]
but it's really difficult to <malay>ajar</malay> him [seh] cause
(mm)
ya I mean it really stems to your parents also [lah] I mean
I don't know I just feel that sometimes
(um)
parents <malay>dorang tak tahu</malay> tau <malay>yang</malay> actually <malay>macam mana nak</malay> handle <malay>budak-budak</malay> and everything
and then they just like feel <malay>yang cikgu yang akan</malay>
<malay>betul</malay> [kan] <malay>budak-budak punya pelajaran</malay> and stuff but
doesn't work that way you know
[oh] he's nice
I thought he like don't want to do work all
[oh] he did !huh! what did he do
[oh]
that's cute you mean you mean when he was sick he came over
[orh] but how much were you paid per month
!huh! fifty [jer]
wasn't it seventy
fifty for four sessions
fifty divide by four is how much
for one hour two hour
[oh] my god not worth it sis
I mean like
ya [lah] you can say like [oh] you want to help the child everything but !wow!
that progress and also the time spent right
is very taxing <malay>penat</malay> [seh]
I [ah] <malay>boleh</malay>
ya I mean people always <malay>cakap</malay> !alah! [jer] [pe]
but really marks where you can go
to secondary and secondary is like <malay>macam</malay>
the place where you
make it or break it [seh]
ya I mean
I'm kind of thankful <malay>yang kita pergi</malay> a secondary school
<malay>yang</malay> not that <malay>macam</malay>
#minahish# and stuff you know
cause I feel that our secondary school was kind of decent in a way
but like if you look at other schools
that shall be not shall not be named right
!wah! like you can really see <malay>macam mana orang</malay> turn out to be [seh]
and all the <malay>mats</malay> and <malay>minahs</malay> and
the fact that they start smoking even during <malay>macam</malay> lower sec and doing a lot of other things
it's really scary
actually I scared [seh] <malay>sebab</malay> you know (uh) recently I <malay>nampak kat</malay> news [kan] <malay>macam</malay>
like you know all those
STOMP news and everything
(um) the
<malay>budak kecil</malay> right [eh] not <malay>budak kecil</malay> [ah] like just like lower secondary everything
<malay>dorang</malay> (um) they even like kiss or make out in the school staircase [eh] like it's damn
scary [ah] that how young and how brave are you to do that
[oh] primary school <malay>pun</malay>
what
then if I put myself in the shoe of like
a parent or like a secondary school teacher right
I wouldn't know how to deal with it [seh] like I feel that you are so young
and I feel that it's a lot to do with like
social media [ah] <malay>macam</malay> TikTok
Instagram
you know all these kind of things
I'm not sure whether like
there is an increase in like early pregnancy early teen pregnancy or whatever [seh]
ya cause like I feel
teachers
ya I mean I feel that
my secondary school is the reason why I have like anxiety in a way cause like they make such small things into very very big matter
and I just <malay>tak faham</malay> [ah] cause like I remember that time
(err) <malay>ada cikgu ni dia datang kat</malay>
me and then <malay>macam cakap</malay> [lah] like [ah] <malay>jangan buat malu keluarga</malay> [ah] <malay>jaga maruah keluarga</malay>
ya then like
being like what fourteen fifteen I was very affected by it
and then <malay>dia macam cakap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam kenapa awak nak kena buat benda macam gini ni semua</malay> then I just feel that (err) they don't really understand
and then they just (um) try to force their beliefs down our throats
you know I'm actually quite surprised
cause secondary school [kan] <malay>kita tak pernah lambat</malay> [seh] <malay>kita cuma lambat</malay> on the last day of school
and that one also like the discipline master don't know what to do then just let us go
#Afif# <malay>tak pernah lambat</malay> [ah]
secondary school
[oh] but I thought
but I thought we always go to school together
[oh]
[oh] my gosh okay
[ah] why he like that [seh]
you reminded me of our netball coach
<malay>dia pun lagi satu</malay> toxic <malay>nya orang dalam hidup</malay>
how old was she [ah] when she took our
so she was like in her early twenties right
!wah! early twenties then she act until like that
[oh]
she's another reason why I feel like I have anxiety
cause of her <malay>macam</malay>
I can't believe she make me do suicide run again with all the team just cause
like
I couldn't make it
then like the whole team like hates me for it
[oh] when was I there
[oh]
she left training halfway
ya that is really some kind of trauma that she leave us with [seh]
(mm)
[oh] my god ya it was during like the
(um)
exam [kan]
ya I cannot [seh] <malay>dia</malay> seriously something wrong with her
I mean how we've been overworked
I mean if you realize like those <malay>macam</malay>
talented players or what they always don't want to
pass the ball to us
ya
that and the fact that you know
there were like <malay>macam camne nak cakap</malay> [eh]
I feel that everyone was just so scared of coach
and that make everyone like try so hard to perform that they underperform
[oh] I know I know
she chinese that one right
ya I remember her [oh] my god
(err)
ya I didn't join any sports
just
I mean she gave me a lot of trauma [lah] to be honest
(mm)
(mm) you know I <malay>rasa</malay> [kan] the best coach <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>ada</malay> right was actually my Singapore poly <malay>nya</malay> coach they were really like
so supportive and stuff
and although I <malay>macam tak datang</malay> training <malay>atau</malay> I not that good [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> still never stop believing in me [seh]
and then <malay>dorang</malay> always <malay>cakap macam</malay> [oh] #Ayra# you can do this blah blah blah like that
ya
I mean you mean if you're skinny if you don't exercise [kan] actually <malay>tak</malay> healthy <malay>gila</malay> [seh]
flowers <malay>kenapa</malay> you <malay>ingat</malay> birthday I <malay>ke</malay>

I <malay>suka</malay> (um)
actually I <malay>suka</malay> mixed [ah] you know I'm over the years I get so bored of like roses and baby breath
now right I keep looking at <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know if you know this Instagram [ah] it's called Sanwraps
they sell like the cutest combination of flowers bouquet ever like they have daisies they have tulips and then they have roses
I mean like they have all these like carnation or whatever <malay>nanti dorang letak dalam satu</malay> bouquet right it's so colourful it's so pretty like sometime you have sunflower <malay>yang macam</malay> yellow colour everything then you have like <malay>macam</malay>
blue colour of flowers and I and then <malay>macam ada</malay> purple <malay>sikit</malay> and then I <malay>rasa macam</malay> [oh] my god it's so pretty
then they always wrap it in a <malay>macam</malay>
you know <malay>macam</malay> brown packaging <malay>gitu</malay>
ya
[oh] actually [kan] I <malay>takut</malay> [seh] <malay>nak simpan</malay> flowers so I I hope like people don't get me flowers for my birthday

but you know [ah] I don't know if you <malay>pernah dengar</malay> there's this cafe called Antea Social
and

they brew their coffee [eh] no they brew their tea
from scratch
and it's like supposedly the most like high quality tea
and then they sell like cakes [ah] [oh] my god <malay>bila</malay> I <malay>nampak</malay> I <malay>macam</malay> !whoa! <malay>macam sedap</malay> [jer]

[a'ah] Singapore
!huh! why you ask me that
[oh] (um)
!haiya! for me
(hmm) let me think
actually
I know that
if I cannot like <malay>macam</malay> give birth or what right
I should be open to having <malay>anak angkat</malay> [ah] cause like
like if especially if my husband wants a child
but at the same time I feel I don't know why but I feel <malay>macam tak</malay> comfortable
ya
ya I <malay>tak</malay> comfortable I think in a way because like
I mean like you can always say [oh] I will treat this as my my everything but
at the end of the day in black and white you know that this child is
someone else's one
someone <malay>punya</malay>
that's why
[ah]
wouldn't say it bothers
me but
it's just a thought in my head [ah]
<malay>kenapa</malay> would you consider
[ah]
ya
I I don't know [ah]
but
this says something about
I mean
I'm not really a fan of children in the first place also
so
that's some somewhere to start
but would you <malay>nak</malay> would you <malay>simpan</malay> like cat or whatever pet
you love cats
ya you know last time I thought that maybe I can [ah] <malay>pelihara</malay> like
<malay>kucing</malay> when I [dah] <malay>besar</malay> but when I think about it right
I don't think I will cause
I need to
be responsible of like their food their pee and then like the furniture is gonna get scretched
and I don't think I have the energy to do that
(mm)
I don't know [seh] it really depends [ah] whether I have time to <malay>jaga</malay> them or not
that's why
[oh] my god actually right last time I <malay>pergi rumah kawan</malay> I cause <malay>dia ada</malay> rabbit
and then I saw like the rabbits were like
having like sexual intercourse with one another and we like scarred before moment
and then like <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>dorang bising</malay> [tau]
because like
they keep rattling the cage and all makes me feel that actually like house all like not
suitable for their environment [ah] it's like why would you keep them there [seh]
[oh] actually [ah]
I okay with zoo [seh] cause I feel <malay>yang macam</malay>
(uh) ya it's true [ah] <malay>yang dorang patut</malay> be to be at the in the wild and everything but I also feel that
being in the zoo right it helps preserve like endangered species
and they create the habitat in a way that
is very like very very similar to those in the wild
[oh]
(mmhmm)
I mean those are just news [lah] I feel that Singapore zoo is like still having some efforts also [what]
[orh]

like the
(um) <malay>hidung mancung</malay> then after that I always thought my <malay>hidung</malay> was big

ya
but then it's like <malay>kecil</malay> then [oh] it's actually small and then when now when I look at the mirror
[oh] it's actually average looking nose it's not that bad you know like what you picture cause I last time I always thought I <malay>gemuk</malay>

<malay>mesti pun hantu ayam</malay> because <malay>kalau kakak beli macam daging ke atau apa kalau kak masak kakak makan sikit</malay> so <malay>macam bazir</malay> so might as well I cook whatever he wants to eat which is
freaking chicken
but that's because rice [lah]
no chicken is protein [what]
you sure
<malay>sahaja</malay> luckily your face don't turn into chicken
like a
(um) <malay>habis</malay> but then you skin will be saggy
<malay>mengadu saja engkau</malay>
<malay>lepas tu</malay>
<malay>kentang</malay> chicken
<malay>kau tak tahu masak apa hari ini</malay>

she's a bad taster
[ah] is <malay>abang</malay> home already
because of the medicine [ah]
ya
but actually [kan] it's better to put him at the living room
<malay>sebab</malay> because living room <malay>itu baru</malay> if you make <malay>dekat tu</malay> also so it's nicer for him whereas the <malay>bilik</malay> [kan] <malay>macam dah tunggang pecah</malay> if you understand
in the point of <malay>macam</malay> healing [kan] it's so much better to be in a clean and newer environment rather than <malay>macam</malay> old you understand
ya
<malay>kena buat</malay> partition [lah] <malay>ayah kena panggil buat</malay> partition
<malay>buat</malay> [lah] partition
[ah]
<malay>tu bila tu boleh datang pecahkan</malay>
that house that house is so big it has so many potential <malay>tapi macam</malay>
<malay>sedih esok nak pergi apa</malay>
[ah] recognise or <malay>macam ayah</malay> [eh] <malay>ayah ayah dah tak kuasa nak keluarkan duit untuk</malay> renovate and then <malay>ibu pula malas nak</malay> maintain so <malay>macam</malay> [oh] my god
[ah] ya ya ya
<malay>macam</malay> they they put the effort to
cause <malay>ayah</malay> will start something and then he he will expect <malay>ibu</malay> to follow up with it
ya that they both
what the heck bro
<malay>macam dah lapuk</malay> is so outdated already I think twenty years it was okay but now it's
maybe too outdated man
why so <malay>degil</malay> [one] [ah]
ya can you imagine <malay>kalau rumah aku buat ambin dalam bilik tu</malay> nah
<malay>kadang-kadang nak buat ambin tapi nak buat yang macam</malay> japanese style
[ah] ya ya ya <malay>macam lawa macam</malay> just like platform it doesn't need to be a permanent just you can buy the platform is have that one then you just put your bed on top I think quite nice [eh] <malay>macam</malay> those
zen
[oh] is it but you <malay>baring</malay> if you put your
<malay>tilam</malay> only if you put your <malay>tilam</malay> [ah]
cause like that time I went to japan the second time
you know I go before right
[oh] you know I told you then the bedroom is [ah]
the <malay>bawah</malay> is literally (err)
(err) <malay>apa ni</malay> like (err) literally like that <malay>tapi tak rasa</malay>
you don't feel it [ah] the only thing bad about that thing right they literally <malay>macam</malay> blew the <malay>papan</malay> onto the floor
so <malay>kalau macam</malay> in the future <malay>kalau nak macam</malay> shift shift but you can't shift it is like that
but I love a lot of things about japan especially <malay>macam dia orang</malay>
<malay>apanya</malay>
<malay>macam kecil macam dia orang punya</malay> design of <malay>barang macam macam kecil</malay> and it's so efficient in my opinion
so <malay>kakak cakap suka gila</malay> that time when we went to
#kyoto# [ah] then there's daiso a huge ass daiso and then beside it there was like a furniture <malay>kedai perabot</malay>
I think they literally <malay>jual macam</malay> one set <malay>macam sinki yang ni dan dia punya</malay>
cabinet <malay>atas dengan</malay> cabinet <malay>bawah dengan lampu dia dengan dia punya segala-gala</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> there is literally one unit
then when people moving [ah] they just buy that thing
and it's
and <malay>boleh masuk</malay> bathtub
[oh] my god like I think that one of the hotels we went the time is smaller than us and it can fit a fucking bathtub
can you imagine how amazing that is that's like this this this toilet [ah] <malay>macam bodoh</malay> [sia]
why can't they put the <malay>jamban</malay> and the sink side by side then we have a long ass
wooden door
[ah]
ya the the worst part you can't change the arrangement
that's the worst part
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
<malay>jamban</malay> just put together right [oh] my god
why they never think about it I don't know how they design it is so like so <malay>bodoh</malay> like even the <malay>tingkap</malay> this one [ah]
<malay>ni</malay> [kan] <malay>kalau rumah lama</malay> is <malay>dekat atas</malay> [pe]
this like for example <malay>kalau macam hujan</malay> but then you still want air ventilation you can open up the top windows [mah] then get air in
this one you open you can open the first one on top if you open the below <malay>air hujan masuk</malay> it's like so <malay>bodoh</malay> I don't know what are they thinking when designing the house
<malay>tapi ini macam bodoh</malay> <malay>macam bodoh gila</malay>
that is very even like wiring is inside [mah]
<malay>rumah</malay> #juan# <malay>yang dekat</malay> (uh) (uh huh)
[ah]
<malay>macam lawa macam</malay> it looks like a bedroom <malay>macam ni</malay> it looks like a fucking bedroom right no fucking storeroom I don't know it's so weird
the <malay>jemuran</malay> [eh]
this one is not custom made it's ikea [lah] but it's still okay looks it looks fine [lah] (mm) looks decent [pe]
ya
and it's so cluttered I don't know it
they don't even know what is inside the <malay>kotak</malay> right
[ah] [ah] ya
[ah] ya but like I think if you wanna buy your furniture <malay>macam tu</malay> if ikea stuff don't buy on the <malay>kedai</malay> itself <malay>pergi</malay> carousell
[ah] [ah] [ah]
<malay>jual</malay> and then <malay>jual dia harga macam murah gila babi yang itu macam apa</malay> [seh] dining table <malay>dua puluh aku beli dua ratus</malay>
so <malay>macam geram gila macam ini</malay> set alarm right (um) we bought this two hundred and forty
I think got some more online sell for a sixty dollar fifty dollar in good condition cause just imagine
<malay>kita nak kita nak</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam banyak</malay>
ya
ya
ya <malay>kau macam</malay> [eh] <malay>sakitnya hati</malay> ya #allah# ya
so <malay>macam tak perlu</malay> [seh] I mean like the thing <malay>macam almari ni</malay> seven hundred whereas we can actually bought it at
carousell for at like two hundred dollars
brand new <malay>lagi</malay> just have to fucking dismantle it and it is still very cheaper than buying a
a new wardrobe
<malay>itunya macam menyesal</malay> so <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] just buy from carousell
I mean <malay>yang paling biasa</malay> I carousell <malay>kadang-kadang dia ada kasih dengan</malay> free items [eh]

if you had three wishes what would you wish for
okay
okay that's one
ya
food business
okay
recently you went to schools to find stalls right
okay how was that
okay
why the <malay>sewa murah</malay>
[ah]
[ah] okay
how much was the rent for
five dollars per month
okay
then do they tell you what food you have to sell
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
okay
okay
so you can only hire locals
okay
(mm)
okay
but you can cook [what]
okay
(mm)
okay
okay
so what if you if you had a stall you'll be selling the same food
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so that's your second wish first wish is to
make sure your children
so those are your two wishes one is to make sure your children
(uh) good behaving
your second is to have your own business
then your third wish

of course of course you would say that
but your definition of healthy is very strict

(mmhmm)
ya
okay
(mm) okay
okay
can so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
okay
so so your three wishes are to have
good kids
good business and good health
okay
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
my three wishes
I think
my first wish is very materialistic and superficial which is
I want to have
success and wealth
because
we
didn't come from very rich family or background
we had it but we were not poor either we had enough
but because of our financial background we didn't get to enjoy many things that I see my rich friends are enjoying
like they get to they travel every six months to far away countries and all that
and we didn't get to do that
so
one of my wish is
to be able to do well in school so that I can get a good job
and earn money so that we can enjoy these things in life
that is my
first wish
second wish
is to be happy
whatever that means so that's my second wish
third wish is for you to be happy
that is my third wish
ya
<malay>itu sahaja</malay> I'm not gonna I'm not gonna explain or elaborate on my three wishes
it's okay I'll ask the second question
(um)
(err)
what was the most memorable meal you ever had and where did you have it
ya
ya food food
ya
(mm)
okay
I think for me
will be the first time I had smoked duck
ya the smoked duck pasta
<malay>dekat</malay> cafe #bedok# cafe <malay>dekat</malay> #bedok#
ya that's the first time I had the smoked duck pasta
and that ya it was very good I liked it
so that's ever since then I started to like eating duck because that was the first time I had duck
ya

(mm) <malay>entah aku pun tak tahu</malay> I think twenty twenty three maybe
or maybe <malay>mungkin tahun depan</malay>
ya or maybe <malay>tahun depan</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay>
but ya just one then they also say they have avatar three four and five also
planned out
ya
but honestly
you like twilight
the vampire movie
you know it's a trashy movie right people say is a terrible movie
but you like it
ya
(mmhmm)
[oh] okay okay
then the storyline
or <malay>kau tak ingat</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
that's that's something new I learn about you you liking to watch twilight
(mmhmm) okay
then
<malay>kau ada tengok ke</malay>
<malay>kau ada tengok ke aku tak pernah nampak engkau tengok pun</malay>
which superhero movies have you watched
[oh] <malay>yang hari itu aku bawa kau tengok</malay> [kan]
okay
so between the three do you know the three spidermans
the three actors who played spiderman three times
which one do you like
the first one your tobey maguire
or the most latest one
you like tobey
but <malay>dia tua</malay> [kan] <malay>kau suka</malay>
(mm) okay
(mm)
then
so if you were to
(mm)
(uh huh)
ya
so I'm
exploring two options right now
one is either to go to a private consulting firm
so I want to do consultancy
but I need to know first if consultancy is my thing
so I need to do internship again next year maybe
ya so
<malay>yang dekat</malay>
ya that wasn't consultancy it was more of research on and it's more on a
city like large scheme nation building
the consultancy firms usually what they do is they are more responsible for (err) (err) single projects
so let's say this mall developer wants to do the mall then he comes bring he brings his proposal [lah] his blueprint or whatever and then we have to see and approve and all that stuff
and <malay>yang</malay> help them
plan out their
master (err) their blueprint
the other option I'm considering is pursuing higher education so either do masters or
because I like educating
I like teaching so
if I do masters I can come back as professor in so that's my other option I'm considering also which is why monday is main
no [lah] professor as in
ya
as in
they all must still publish their research [what] like regularly publish their own research on top of teaching students
so
that's what I'm doing which is why on monday I'm going back to school
to meet my mentor
ya because when we when we
ya it's a professor so when we first come to each of us is assigned to a mentor
so we can just anytime email our mentor and ask if we can meet up and all that so I just wanna meet him and talk to him about it [lah] and
<malay>tengok kalau dia ada apa-apa nak nasihat nak bagi ke atau apa-apa</malay> then
ya then I'll decide then I also need to ask him about exchange about internship opportunities <malay>itu semua aku nak tanya nak</malay> settle
ya
ya <malay>hari isnin nak pergi</malay> then
probably <malay>jumaat balik</malay>
ya but (err) <malay>isnin isnin</malay> I meet my mentor then <malay>hari selasa aku ada</malay> event
in school
then wednesday
wednesday <malay>aku ada apa-apa tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> but probably I come back either on thursday or friday
cause I have events on tuesdays and wednesdays also so I either thursday or friday I'll come back
ya I enjoy a lot which is
a blessing [lah] because many of my friends
they
<malay>macam dia orang</malay> complain [lah] <malay>dia orang tak suka</malay>
<malay>tak suka apa yang dia orang buat</malay> then which makes it very difficult
not just my A level friends but also my friends from actually I mean it's mainly my A level friends because
the poly friends who come they most of them were already doing civil engineering in poly
so when they come to uni they know it's something that they like
but
my A level friends
they don't necessarily know if civil engineering is their thing
many of them are doing it because
they grades
ya poly poly their their structure is different [what]
for poly they already have a diploma in their diploma is specific to a course
so most of them were either doing civil engineering or they were
doing
common engineering or
something like construction
A level <malay>mana ada</malay> civil
you mean from my
no <malay>tak ada</malay> as in I
I only know one other person who's in
was from my also but the rest are all from different (err)
ya I mean I think
my school mainly all of them either went overseas
or they are in
or they are doing because civil engineering the cut off is quite low
it's all like and
so the people who come to civil engineering are not necessarily those who are interested
sometimes it's because
they are interested in another course but their grades grades couldn't make it
so they come to civil engineering instead
which is why I think
it's a fifty fifty thing [lah] <malay>ada orang suka ada orang tak suka</malay>
then <malay>yang tak suka itu dia orang</malay> struggle
then <malay>yang suka</malay> they they will thrive [lah] so fortunately for me I
I like what I'm doing
(mm)
I enjoy the courses I'm doing
mostly some courses I don't like
ya
so
ya which is why as in like I feel like which is why I'm considering pursuing higher education if I don't like it I won't pursue higher education [what]
ya
I'll probably still stay in
ya
probably still
ya they have and masters
but as in I think
ya they talk they <malay>cakap apa itu</malay> they all said something about how they send their students overseas for like a short period of time to study overseas and all that <malay>itu semua</malay> [lah] <malay>aku pun tak tahu</malay> that's why like I said monday I'm gonna go and talk to my profs to find out more information
also
and it's important to start early [lah] because
maybe there's something I can do now to help to accelerate the process also [mah]
then <malay>cepat-cepat datang</malay> then I <malay>dapat</malay> my
degree <malay>cepat-cepat habis</malay> my masters or
ya
I don't know so
but honestly ya
ya <malay>betul</malay> [lah] I I really like teaching
[eh] teaching ya
what
I don't know
full time teaching
!huh! go
after I graduate go
go <malay>belajar beberapa tahun</malay> then
<malay>aku ajar dekat</malay> primary school
okay <malay>boleh</malay> [eh] okay
ya that's why I say as in a good like a balance of me still doing
something related to my
field civil engineering and
get to teach is by pursuing [lah] and becoming a prof and do both
where I get to teach and still practice what I learned
ya so
so that's my plan
after I finish studying
then what about you
(mmhmm)
<malay>kau selalu duduk rumah sahaja</malay>
okay
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mmhmm)
okay
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then <malay>aku</malay>
<malay>tanya</malay> [eh]
what is the one thing that you wish was free
ya
<malay>percuma</malay>
anything [lah] ya what is the one thing if anything that you have to pay for what is the one thing that you wish was free
(uh huh)
(mmhmm)
okay
okay
okay
(mm) actually you why do you want to subsidise those shouldn't you subsidise treatment for the more common illnesses
<malay>yang macam kau cakap demam ke</malay>
or the <malay>selesema</malay>
as in you say you want to subsidise like treatment for the one that's unexpected right
but shouldn't you subsidise the one that's more common
like <malay>macam demam ke selesema itu semua</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
okay
(mm)
okay then
<malay>lagi apa</malay>
so
if
<malay>kalau</malay> [kan] <malay>boleh</malay> master three new skills what would they be
three new skills what are three skills that you wish you can master
okay
<malay>dekat mana</malay>
okay right
<malay>jauhnya</malay>

ya
I mean I mean
ya you can bring (um) rice we can bring prep rice cooker
(uh huh)
[oh] <malay>pernah dengar</malay> I've heard of it before is it is electricity powered right
so don't
so don't need stove or anything right
can (uh) I think you just bring to the room and
ya
ya I I I've seen it before someone cook like <malay>macam</malay> beef rose
or stew
<malay>berapa itu</malay>
ya no [lah] it's okay
I mean
because next year I only be staying in hall for half a semester more [what]
ya until august next year until may
ya
may ya april may
ya but you can go back [what]
I still have my hall room
probably ya I already say [what] monday I'm going back
ya
for as in then next next week also I still have events and all that stuff so I don't know
<malay>kena tengok</malay>
right schedule
so ya
largely now I'm just looking forward to exchange
ya I actually I can either go in august or I can go in
january
no next next january okay
because
I'm
I don't know if I go in january
six months [what] it's just one semester six months
[oh] [eh] not six months [lah] three months of school
so
january to april but which is <malay>kalau aku pergi dekat</malay> january on in january right then I finish school in april I can extend my stay there [what]
no school (uh) just come back (uh) three months later
ya
yes and then <malay>kau tahu aku punya kawan inshan</malay> [kan]
she's working in [what]
she's working in the big four company
big four accounting
(mm) so I think
like in the world there are four major companies responsible for like auditing
so
she's working in one of the big four companies [lah]
so ya she already graduated [what] she she no no and then
ya different <malay>dia tak ada</malay> then three years her course was just three years
ya
so she's working in the now
then is
ya so she's planning to work there and get her
audit certificate
is she doing while she's working [lah] and then once she gets her certificate and then she will come back
you know she has her own her own house there
she has her own apartment
<malay>dia punya bapak beli untuk dia</malay>
then they like they say they she say like she will rent it out and all that [lah] to make money
ya
so <malay>dia ada tempat dia sendiri dekat sana</malay>
ya [kan] just beside ireland
then can just cross over the little
sorry I think it's a little ireland
bridge
ya
I hope the COVID situation doesn't prevent us from going to ireland [ah]
going for exchange
other options are
ya can go canada but I don't know if canada have
modules that I can take
there's also
stay in asia
so india
korea japan
india <malay>pun ada</malay> north india
<malay>tak nak malas</malay> because very expensive [what]
and
the school only pay six thousand
or five I think five thousand
I think so
and it's more dangerous also I think
then I also I'm not interested I'm more interested in ireland has a nicer
like scenery and nature [what]
it's more it's less
(uh) that one <malay>aku dah</malay> check <malay>semua boleh ada yang aku boleh ambil</malay>
ya so
ireland
and then ireland also also beside
the interesting countries [what]
and then <malay>bawah itu ada</malay> spain I think <malay>semua</malay>
ya but I don't know if you can travel between countries like that so easily during exchange
(uh) but visa and something
might need to settle
ya
(uh huh)
so
will you sponsor my exchange
estimated cost
fifteen thousand the school will pay five thousand so remaining ten thousand I have some money in my bank so you probably need to sponsor half of that
then I'll sponsor the remaining half
you didn't have to pay for my you [eh] school fees right
why
or I can just go local exchange
ya
so <malay>pergi</malay> or I or I <malay>pergi</malay>
no I don't want go [ah]
<malay>ada orang kita tahu ke</malay> do we know anyone in the
we don't have relatives there
<malay>siapa</malay>
I don't know I think it's something related to
related

<malay>atau</malay> swing <malay>taruk dekat</malay> living room [ah] living room <malay>lagi nampak</malay>
(hmm)
okay so you want to put on the wall
the <malay>yang</malay>
okay okay
[eh] but but
but they provide the
mount <malay>nak kena</malay> pay extra [eh]
mount <malay>cuba kalau</malay> because if we mount <malay>kita tak boleh alih-alih</malay> [kan]
<malay>faham tak</malay>
why do I want to <malay>alih-alih</malay> [kan]
if let's say ya <malay>macam</malay> like <malay>macam kat rumah awak</malay>
[kan] <malay>macam mak</malay>
from this side then <malay>dia nak</malay> change to the other side
[ah] <malay>lepastu ni sekarang dia nak</malay> change to this side <malay>balik</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam dia boleh</malay> change <malay>tapi kalau</malay> [dah] mount
[dah] <malay>tak boleh tukar</malay> [dah] <malay>tak boleh ubah</malay>
the mount is inside the wall
ya you screw into the wall so if you take it down <malay>mana nak taruk</malay> <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>boleh memang betul</malay> but then
if we want to mount
<malay>dekat</malay> wall the other side is not
is not a wall it's a
wooden wall <malay>faham tak</malay>
it's not a actual wall it's a wooden wall
(mm)
but if you put it on a console
<malay>dia boleh alih</malay> even with the console <malay>dia boleh alih</malay>
[ah]
like that
<malay>sama juga</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
okay <malay>kalau kita ada</malay> console
we can move it to the window <malay>macam</malay> my house
ya okay <malay>pasal</malay> my house <malay>dia tak</malay> mount [kan] then on on top the console [pe]
[ah] so <malay>dia boleh alih-alih</malay>
so from there <malay>dia boleh kat situ dia boleh kat tingkap atau dia boleh dekat</malay> wall <malay>atau dia boleh dekat</malay> this wall
[ah]
that's what I mean so
so you can you can actually <malay>macam</malay> if let's say this year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay> then next year you <malay>nak macam gini</malay>
[ah] <malay>tukar</malay> mood you know <malay>tukar tukar tempat ke</malay>
it it might you know we don't know which which [one] <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>kena dengan kita</malay> [pe]
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm)
(mmhmm) (mmhmm) correct correct
no lights can just <malay>tampal belakang</malay> [jer]
<malay>tampal belakang</malay>
so the light shine <malay>dekat tembok</malay>
it moves with the it moves with the console [mah]
so it it if <malay>kalau taruk dekat tingkap memang</malay> [lah] <malay>dia tak</malay> shine
<malay>dia boleh</malay> shine <malay>boleh boleh</malay> shine <malay>tapi tak nampak sangat</malay> [ah]
not that not that really nice [lah]
but if you put on the wall <malay>kalau</malay> [ah] facing the wall
then the the light will show <malay>apa</malay>
will <malay>memacarkan</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dia punya dia punya cahaya dia memacar</malay>

(mm) <malay>tak ada apa</malay>
nothing
no I was thinking
I was thinking about
the the things that I saw on their
advertise advertisement
yes definitely
ya
(mmhmm)
but if you wash the sanitisation will wear off
means wash first no no no no
no when we go and check the house we must make sure that they already clean the house
and clean already the house
check [lah] we check like <malay>macam bawah</malay> bowl <malay>ke</malay> bowl seat bowl <malay>tu ke apa ke</malay>
correct
built-in
okay
then we need to find housekeeping
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] I think the sanitisation <malay>tak</malay> include cleaning <malay>ke</malay>
because down there they put cleaning and sanitisation you know
no no inside the inside the in Carousell the [one] that I see it's cleaning and sanitisation
(mm)
!wow! you want people to scrub some more then you scrub yourself [lah]
they will have a special
[ah] <malay>apa nama dia</malay> they will have a
special
ya
hijack
jet spray
jet no they don't need the jet spray you <malay>nak</malay>
<malay>dia nak</malay> scrub <malay>apa lantai</malay>
<malay>ye</malay> they have that they have that <malay>apa nama dia</malay>
that chemical

so ya
I <malay>nak minum</malay> hot chocolate <malay>dulu</malay>
!wow!
<malay>nak cakap apa</malay>
[oh] interesting
okay so <malay>kita memang dah tak</malay>
<malay>makan</malay>
meat products as much as we did before I mean <malay>dua ribu dua belas</malay> [eh] <malay>dua ribu dua puluh dah</malay> kind of okay
so how how far <malay>lang nak</malay> go in to into veganism
I <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
going into veganism would be fine by me but
I will not go as far as being a vegan because I don't think I can
be a
full time vegan
I think that will be quite hard
<malay>tapi</malay> in a way I think we're almost
there [lah] almost
into the
vegetarian lifestyle
my opinion is that
I <malay>rasa</malay>
selfish
if we keep eating animals
for the sake of our own tastes
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>macam ada</malay>
selfishness <malay>sebab</malay> I don't
feel the same thing <malay>bila macam guna ikan bilis</malay> just because they are smaller than a chicken or <malay>lembu</malay>
[ah] I <malay>rasa</malay> selfish <malay>sebab</malay> they should be equal
okay
ya ya ya <malay>faham</malay> #mukbang#
(mm)
[a'ah] in a way [lah] <malay>sebab</malay>
I mean <malay>orang boleh guna alasan sebab anjing</malay> is our companion pet <malay>banyak orang guna sebagai</malay> [ah] <malay>ada anjing</malay> as pet
but when it comes to chicken or duck
<malay>kita pun pernah bela itik</malay>
as a pet and we know how
clingy they can be how
<malay>manja</malay> [lah] <malay>binatang tu</malay> can be so is that the same comparison
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi kita</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> (err) hunting and gathering food from [ah] natural resource <malay>macam</malay>
(mm)
<malay>kalau orang dulu-dulu dia tak berkebun pun</malay>
<malay>berkebun tu selepas</malay>
<malay>dia pergi memburu semua</malay> [kan] then <malay>baru</malay> come this <malay>era bila orang</malay> start <malay>berkebun</malay> and <malay>jumpa teknik berkebun</malay>
(mmhmm)
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>tak ingat</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> go into veganism you <malay>akan</malay>
be a vegan [lah] <malay>bukan</malay> vegetarian
<malay>telur</malay> I cannot leave that I mean I
I <malay>boleh untuk tak makan daging ayam atau pun daging lembu</malay> but I feel like I need my protein <malay>daripada telur</malay>
(um)
[ah] mac D that was very selfish
that was one week before new year was it or few days before new year
<malay>tapi</malay> the challenge
is
<malay>macam kita dekat sini</malay>
[ah] you I <malay>tak</malay> sure <malay>tapi</malay> I
if I were to be a vegan
the challenge will come <malay>bila balik rumah mama</malay>
and mama
<malay>masak apa yang dia masak</malay> [lah] I don't think I have the strength to <malay>tolak</malay>
because it's not something <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>boleh dapat</malay> every day
I I can do that <malay>kalau pergi kedai kawan</malay>
<malay>tapi kalau balik rumah</malay> family <malay>dia bukan sebab tak nak dia orang paksa kita makan</malay>
but I myself don't have the strength to <malay>tolak apa yang dah ada tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] and <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tahu</malay>
<malay>dia masak sedap gila</malay>
so <malay>susah</malay> [ah]
you <malay>macam mana</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>apa yang</malay> spark your idea <malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>jadi</malay>
vegan
is is there a certain
(err) timeline <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>yang membuat</malay> you <malay>sampai ke</malay> part <malay>yang mana</malay> you <malay>nak jadi</malay> vegan <malay>ni ada cerita dia ke</malay>
(mm)
<malay>macam</malay> cringe cringey
(mm)
I <malay>rasa</malay>
I
don't have anything
<malay>yang betul-betul macam</malay> the moment <malay>yang</malay> spark but probably because of the pandemic as well
because of all the free time
(um)
and because of a lot of things [eh] <malay>yang</malay> you <malay>bagi</malay> [tau] I [lah] and <malay>dia macam</malay> I was brainwashed by your brainwashing
but actually (um)
in southeast asia
it's easier to be a vegetarian or vegan [kan] <malay>sebab</malay> we have abundant soy sauce we have that (err) we have abundant soy derived products <malay>macam tempeh tauhu</malay>
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) <malay>sedap</malay> [jer]
[oh] my god
ya [lah] <malay>sebab kita</malay> crave
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
ya [lah]
born born to be slaughtered [lah] basically
(mm)
spread <malay>penyakit ke macam nyamuk</malay> you you never know which one <malay>yang gigit</malay> you <malay>yang bawa</malay> aedes
extreme [lah] I mean I I think <malay>dua hari lepas</malay> #kot# I <malay>kena gigit nyamuk sampai hari ini tak hilang lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>selain</malay> delving into veganism <malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya azam dua puluh dua puluh satu</malay>
<malay>kalau ada</malay> [lah]
I think <malay>ada</malay> #kot#
and then
[oh] okay
I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>punya azam tahun ni</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
start drawing again
<malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>dah lama sangat tinggalkan</malay> drawing and <malay>sekarang</malay> I <malay>rasa janggal nak buat</malay> the kind of drawing <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>pernah buat dulu</malay>
<malay>janggal gila sampai sampai macam</malay> halfway <malay>tu dah menyampah</malay> [tau]
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> I I [tau] [lah] <malay>kalau kalau</malay> practise every day
<malay>dia makin lama makin</malay> okay so that's one of my
(err) two thousand twenty one resolution
<malay>lepas tu</malay> I <malay>nak</malay>
(err) come back to
<malay>belajar</malay> italian
and probably greek as well <malay>sebab tu pun dah tinggal</malay> quite <malay>lama padahal dah pergi jauh dah hari tu</malay>
(um) <malay>apa lagi</malay> [eh]
I
I wish I can say <malay>yang</malay> I <malay>nak</malay> seriously
<malay>belajar</malay> music but
but
but quit <malay>susah</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> I I don't have the same passion <malay>untuk tahu</malay> what's behind the system
[ah] <malay>dia</malay> not not as fulfilling but
by by time
(mm)
<malay>atau</malay> maybe about
(um)
<malay>nak cakap</malay> lack of audience <malay>pun tak juga</malay> [ah]
even <malay>dekat rumah pun</malay>
<malay>dia macam</malay> not as motivated [lah] <malay>untuk untuk pegang</malay> musical instruments
but maybe we have to buy a keyboard
just in case <malay>tapi kalau dah beli</malay> then <malay>tak main</malay>
<malay>bodoh juga</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] my other resolution
I wish that I can
fully depend on working from home [lah]
<malay>sebab</malay> [ah] before this <malay>kita</malay> depend on performance and
[ah] fully on music then
if we have side jobs <malay>yang</malay>
work from home
then <malay>tu macam</malay> bonus but by by the end of last year <malay>dia dah</malay> turn to the other way round
the income from working from home is
almost more than performances
<malay>memang</malay> [ah] <malay>memang</malay> more than performances so I hope that two thousand twenty one it will continue that way [lah] because I <malay>tak selesa pun untuk keluar</malay> and perform and <malay>jumpa orang</malay> in this kind of the in the middle of pandemic still <malay>nak ada</malay> event <malay>takut juga</malay> [ah]
(mm)
<malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> new year resolution <malay>apa yang dah boleh tiru dah</malay> I <malay>punya</malay>
(um)
greek
I I
<malay>berasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak belajar</malay> japanese <malay>sebab</malay> I <malay>tengok</malay> food wars <malay>tu tapi</malay>
better <malay>untuk</malay> focus <malay>dekat</malay>
one or two language first [lah] before ventured out
(mmhmm)
[oh] my god ya
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> so far italian is not that hard I <malay>rasa</malay> I <malay>boleh</malay> catch up <malay>balik</malay>
(mm)
[ah] and I <malay>suka sebab macam</malay> once you <malay>belajar</malay> italian you can kind of <malay>faham</malay> french as well <malay>dia ada kaitan</malay> [ah] <malay>dia dia ada kaitan</malay>
quite beneficial <malay>untuk</malay> learn that one language
<malay>sebab dia boleh</malay> branch out to <malay>bahasa-bahasa lain selain</malay> language to <malay>apa lagi</malay> you <malay>punya ni</malay> you <malay>punya azam</malay>
so
okay what what do you want in two thousand twenty one
(mm) (mm)
<malay>dia macam</malay>
(uh) I remember in harry potter the mirror of alice dumbledore <malay>cakap</malay> the happiest man will look into the mirror and see nothing but himself <malay>dia dah ada</malay> everything <malay>yang dia nak</malay>
but speaking of two thousand twenty I
I <malay>rasa</malay> it's not
a total shit show [lah]
we we started the year very
very the the very best we can get
and then ending <malay>pun</malay>
not as we expected but
not as not bad at all actually
(mm)
(mm)
(mm) what what is the best thing that
you like from two thousand twenty
ya [lah] cause we got we get to stay at home all the time
(mm)
[oh] but do we really need to buy another laptop
as soon as possible
but I still don't get the
the task
well for that job yet so we'll wait [lah]
(um)
what else [ah]
you you you you decide the topic <malay>pula</malay>
if you go
the the
<malay>apa yang akan jadi</malay> in two thousand twenty one [ah]
[ah] two thousand twenty one
I <malay>rasa akan ada</malay>
a burst of
creative contents
for sure <malay>sebab</malay> in two thousand twenty and none of creatives were deprived of
[ah] <malay>dia punya</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> musicians <malay>tak dapat buat</malay> shows
[ah] ya artist <malay>tak boleh buat</malay> exhibition
so in two thousand twenty one I think a lot of creatives will start <malay>macam</malay>
this this cannot
(um) go on for too long I have I have to do something to
to make everything better for myself [lah] <malay>sebenarnya</malay> especially if that's their only creative outlet
<malay>dia</malay> redundant it's very redundant
(mm)
but what about live shows I think (um) live shows <malay>pun dah</malay> start <malay>ada</malay> search <malay>juga</malay> because (um) <malay>sebanyak yang</malay> start to give out grants
for live events but but all these organisations <malay>memang</malay>
<malay>jaga</malay>
social distancing code scanning and everything so <malay>itu pun</malay> I <malay>rasa</malay> in two thousand twenty one there will be a lot of live events as well
K when when when the vaccine is ruled out
will will you be among the first one to
(mm)
ya I don't have any fear for the vaccine as well
I I don't fear the five G conspiracy
(mm) (mm)
natural selections
(mm) (mm)
I <malay>baca dekat</malay> twitter from the people who have taken the vaccine
<malay>dia orang cakap</malay> your arm will be soft for one or two days a lot of them don't even have
<malay>macam</malay> flu or fever side effect <malay>yang teruk-teruk</malay>
so I think I <malay>pun tak walaupun</malay> I <malay>takut jarum</malay> but I don't think I <malay>akan</malay> stray from I mean this is history in the making why why why don't you want to be part of history
then what else
what what do you predict will happen in two thousand twenty one
(mm)
it's a it's a paradise for introverts
(mm)
ya [lah] <malay>faham</malay>
I mean even <malay>sekarang masa</malay> pandemic <malay>pun</malay> I <malay>dah tak ingat</malay> what happened in june in may
duolingo
(mm)
I think everyone wanted to be a better version of themselves just in case pandemic <malay>ni akan berlangsung lama</malay> and they cannot depend on skill <malay>yang dia orang dah ada</malay> so they have to broaden their horizon
which is very interesting because that happens to us as well
do you miss pre-pandemic
years at all
okay explain yes
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
fifty fifty
so in a way you just you are a person
who
follows whatever happens
okay can you explain <malay>pasal</malay> stoicism <malay>sebab</malay> I try <malay>baca tapi</malay> I <malay>macam</malay>
[a'ah]
(mm)
(mm)
excited
I think that it's going to be a bit
hard for me because I am emotionally invested in everything
so
(mm)
I mean I appreciate the idea of
being a stoic
but to fully embody
the meaning behind the philosophy I don't think I can because I'm a very emotional person
other than stoicism
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay> philosophy philosophical standpoint
[ah]
(mm)
but nihilism sounds quite
dark and extreme actually
(mm)
so
in a way
what happens after you die is not your concern right now
because you don't know anyway
think too much about it yes yes
if there is you don't know anyway and if there's not you still don't know anyway
nihilism nature [lah]
(mm)
<malay>semua ni sebab</malay>
the good place because we watched the good places it or before that you <malay>memang dah</malay>
before that among the incomplete workplace to elicit directly explaining their explaining a
but but why do you think about people who
try so hard to make other people believe in their philosophy
I mean they push for other people to believe in what they believe in
because I think
<malay>benda ni macam</malay>
very personal because
two two people can can learn the same thing but they might not understand the same thing that understanding <malay>tak sama</malay> so
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so you decide
the next
the next thing
I ran out of idea already
(mm) (mm)
I don't have any other interest
and the new age #plato#
(mm)
okay
once the border <malay>buka</malay>
where do you want to go
where europe there's there's a facebook page
called [ah] the mighty nation of europe where people generalise europe as a as europe and not individual countries
(mm)
the difference
I want to go to greece again
(mm)
[oh] in addition to that scandinavian countries
scandinavian countries <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam apa nama</malay> european
<malay>bukan yang yang yang tak payah</malay> stamp passport <malay>tu</malay> [ah] <malay>dia tak termasuk dalam</malay> schengen countries [eh] [oh] <malay>termasuk</malay> [oh] then why
[oh] ya ya
sweden
[oh] yes denmark
K [lah] hopefully next time
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>memang</malay> curious on how they can manage to provide
pre-university cause I long for that I yearn for that
what about southeast asia or asia [lah] in general <malay>ada tak yang</malay> you <malay>nak pergi</malay>
<malay>ke kita memang</malay> western centric
euro centric okay my apologies
(mm)
(mm)
I think <malay>sebab</malay> I think the the the reason is because
(um) <malay>dia orang</malay> preserve their history historical buildings are still there you can still visit <malay>macam dekat sini</malay> most of them are
in ruins
(mm)
[ah] you you cannot see with your own eyes
<malay>tapi</malay> asia I
<malay>nak pergi tak</malay> I <malay>nak pergi</malay> indonesia but but but the parts <malay>yang kita tak pergi</malay> before [ah]
I think <malay>tu pun</malay> interesting and for some reason
I <malay>nak pergi</malay> thailand <malay>sangat sangat sebab</malay> I <malay>rasa macam</malay> I <malay>nak dia punya</malay> street food
(mm)
<malay>tu</malay> [jer] #kot# as for now
[ah] india but maybe <malay>bila umur dah lima puluh nanti</malay> [lah] #boulogne# and [lah]
(mm) <malay>selain tu</malay>
[eh] <malay>tapi yang</malay> tesla <malay>buat</malay>
the space flight <malay>yang</malay> you can travel around the world in like less than three hours to
running [eh]
[kan] they <malay>dia buat dia buat</malay> this (err) flight flight system <malay>baru yang mana</malay> you can travel across the world in less than three hours <malay>ke</malay> two hours [a'ah]
so I don't know if that is still running <malay>sebab dia nak</malay>
<malay>buat</malay>
<malay>benda tu</malay> affordable for everyone
I think that's a good thing as well hopefully within the next ten years <malay>ke</malay>
I mean if if we can if we can reach athens and in three hours !wow!
<malay>balik hari</malay> [jer] <malay>pun boleh</malay>
!wah! long silence very long silence
(uh huh) death to two thousand twenty
I <malay>suka</malay> that documentary
centric <malay>tapi</malay> understandable [lah] <malay>sebab</malay> creator <malay>dia pun</malay> from
but I think it's a good mockumentary [lah] to sum up
the whole two thousand twenty one [eh] two thousand twenty
(mm)
!wah! I <malay>punya soalan banyak banyak yang macam</malay> what do you want
and
you <malay>dah cakap</malay> you stoic so I <malay>dah tak boleh tanya soalan-soalan tu</malay>
(mm)
okay [lah] if if you could
be your younger self
<malay>apa yang</malay> you <malay>nak</malay> change
(mm)
you know what do you have against schools [ah]
(uh huh)
(mm)
(mm) I <malay>faham</malay>
(mm)
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] I think I learn more
<malay>kat rumah</malay>
[ah] <malay>dekat dekat</malay> internet for you I don't have internet at home
actually <malay>kat</malay> okay I mean form five <malay>pun</malay> I don't have
and I <malay>tak pakai</malay>
<malay>hujung</malay> form five I <malay>pakai</malay> iphone but before that I <malay>pakai</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> laptop but I don't have internet so what's the use [ah] but I
I <malay>lebih</malay> I I understand <malay>bila ayah yang ajar</malay>
but for you most of that internet [lah] [kan]
<malay>kena ambil</malay> to TOEFL [lah] <malay>lagi sekali</malay>
I think that will help a lot
<malay>tapi tu</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya</malay> price point expensive
and I don't know what to do with the TOEFL certificate afterwards so <malay>dia</malay> expire after like two years and then I don't know what to do within that two years
until <malay>dia</malay> expire <malay>macam</malay> the last time I <malay>ambil rugi</malay> [jer]
[ah]
then <malay>sia-sia</malay> even if you <malay>dapat</malay> offer travel while once you <malay>nak masuk dia akan minta balik</malay> your TOEFL <malay>punya sijil</malay> then you have to take again
(mmhmm)
two thousand twenty one <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>kira</malay> start of the decade [kan]
<malay>bukan yang</malay> two thousand twenty [kan] last year was the ending
this [one] is the beginning okay
[a'ah] <malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks
<malay>kita tunggu</malay> the fireworks but nothing happen
(mm) very anti climactic
okay [lah] I like new beginnings (um)
I <malay>pun takde</malay> expectation
as to what will happen this year but the bar is pretty low two thousand twenty one the bar is very low
so
well
<malay>tinggal lapan minit</malay>
that that [one] quite fast <malay>tiba-tiba dah lima puluh dua minit dah</malay>
[oh]
<malay>boleh</malay>
(mm)
I <malay>harap</malay>
<malay>entah</malay> [lah] I don't have any
any wish because it seems to be falling down chip
poll <malay>sekarang</malay>
like <malay>dia macam</malay>
<malay>tak dia</malay> from <malay>semua benda sebab</malay>
in a way
I <malay>tak rasa</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> you <malay>tadi cakap</malay> [lah] [ah]
afterlife <malay>punya benda kita tak tahu</malay> and it's not within our control [kan] <malay>dan ni pun sama</malay> it's not within my control so whatever happens happens [lah]
because I don't have the power to to do anything about it
(um)
and
<malay>apa pun yang dia orang buat</malay> I think the best thing to do is to focus on what you can do
you have yourself and people around you
<malay>tu</malay> [jer]
<malay>entah</malay> [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> I I'm quite positive about
this year
<malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak</malay> hopeless <malay>sangat</malay>
it's been awhile since I <malay>rasa</malay> hopeless <malay>dengan</malay>
the whole <malay>tahun</malay>
so you
institution
religion
<malay>agama kaum</malay>
[oh] <malay>kaum</malay> is a very sensitive issue
(mmhmm)
and I <malay>tak suka tengok</malay> Facebook comment
<malay>dia</malay> almost <malay>macam orang yang dia tuju atau orang yang baca tu</malay> you don't have any feelings at all
[ah] <malay>bangsa malas membaca</malay>
<malay>lepas tu tajuk</malay> everything click bait
[ah] I wish that <malay>kena</malay> change
<malay>yang tu kena</malay> change
[ah]
(mm)
but journalism <malay>yang</malay> spark head
<malay>orang yang malas membaca tu</malay> ya <malay>malas membaca orang yang suka membaca pun</malay> they have to click in order to know the
essence of the story not even full story you can
straight to the point
(mm)
<malay>ni</malay> nurse <malay>yang</malay> nurse <malay>yang yang ni</malay> infected <malay>tu dekat</malay> <malay>yang vaksin</malay> (mm) (mm)
(mm)
and then <malay>kismis dan</malay>
that's my vaccine !wah!
(mm) <malay>tapi yang</malay> news <malay>pasal</malay> nurse <malay>tu</malay> very misleading <malay>sebab</malay> even if you take your first vaccine <malay>untuk dia sampai ke</malay> fifty percent immunity <malay>tu dia ambil dua minggu</malay>
<malay>dia kena</malay> COVID within I think <malay>hari ke sembilan ke sepuluh macam tu</malay> it's not even two full weeks yet and even <malay>kalau dah</malay> two full weeks <malay>pun</malay> not a full total immunity
second shot <malay>baru ni tapi</malay>
<malay>orang malas membaca</malay>
<malay>dia buat orang takut untuk buat benda yang betul</malay>
and <malay>lagi pun</malay> journalisms <malay>sekarang</malay> mostly it's just screenshot of
most retweeted tweets then <malay>jadi satu bentuk berita</malay> [ah] <malay>yang penting ada</malay> content ya monetisation and <malay>yang penting duit jalan</malay> K
<malay>tapi</malay> content <malay>memang tak</malay> best <malay>langsung</malay> especially because the audience <malay>dalam</malay> Twitter and <malay>dalam</malay> Facebook is two totally different kind of audience
(mm)

<malay>penat</malay> <malay>entah macam</malay> okay one of the reason [eh] <malay>sebab</malay> secondary school <malay>dengan</malay> primary school <malay>dah habis sekolah</malay> [tau] so <malay>macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dah nak masuk</malay> holiday mindset <malay>aku dah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>nak</malay> holiday <malay>abeh tapi</malay> poly <malay>masih ada lagi apa nak kena buat kerja</malay> [ah] <malay>lagipun</malay> during this period [ah] the exams are like
the exams are like cut off about
<malay>nak kena apa jaga</malay> safe distancing [kan] so like the exams are out so most of our
exam are replaced with (err) graded assignments
so <malay>macam</malay> and most of the time [kan] my graded assignment <malay>semua kena buat</malay> report and for report confirm <malay>nak kena buat</malay> research <malay>banyak</malay>
so I had to like research like yesterday I had to research like a <malay>banyak benda</malay> [ah] so
<malay>macam</malay> by the time <malay>dah habis sekolah macam</malay> [ah] <malay>dah dah aku dah penat aku dah penat</malay> and <malay>nak balik rumah</malay> one hour journey <malay>macam</malay> just the thought about it <malay>dah buat aku penat</malay> and when I came home
I just couldn't do anything
even like school related work I didn't even had I didn't even finish my work yesterday [ah] [ah]
I submit [lah] but it was like [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
half half <malay>macam</malay> <malay>macam</malay> fifty percent <malay>punya</malay> reflection journal [a'ah] ya it was just a fifty fifty then I just submit
ya <malay>itu</malay> [jer] <malay>abeh</malay> like
like you saw [ah] <malay>macam</malay> I just <malay>macam mandi terus tidur terus lepak habis</malay> !oi!
[eh] but your poly days <malay>macam lagi rabak</malay> because
you design [tau] like
like creativity like (err) <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
no because three point one is more of <malay>macam</malay> internship [tau] and these tuesday <malay>ada</malay> briefing on the internship [ah] and then
like honestly I'm actually afraid of it <malay>macam</malay> I don't know because <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>macam</malay> I don't know [eh] because of your experience I don't know even though like you're experienced <malay>kau macam</malay> put it in a beautiful way
<malay>tapi tapi</malay> just the thought of (um) having like supervisor I just okay the reason I'm really afraid of industry is I cannot do something that they passed me to do
I know but just I'm I'm just afraid that something I cannot remember I did this and this or did I forget or
but at your internship in the pass there is another someone that intern from your school from your class and someone that you have met before
ya what if I don't have someone like that
[ah]
(hmm)
(um)
but you know what (uh) I had this one senior the internship was during the period yes so
no
okay I think I would like love to be in that situation because the internship is at home no I mean (err) ya it was at home so like but quite like <malay>mendak macam</malay> like (err) no (err) so like
because ya so they are she interacted with her supervisors or like the one that <malay>yang</malay> assigned <malay>dia</malay> through
zoom or [ah] microsoft teams
[oh] she is (uh) in human resource
ya but that point of time almost everyone had to
[ah] work from school even internship [eh] [ah] ya from home I mean
[ah] so like so the only task like
she was given like mostly it was research
I don't know [lah] <malay>dia tak</malay> elaborate [ah] but but yeah it was mostly a research
and like even but then right
<malay>dia datang</malay> for like one two days first two days [leh] then the period starts
but then during period like almost everyone had to like stop going to work [what]
but you can still like send your work through emails or something like that [what]
I mean like most probably like one work one operator ya then have to go to work
no ya for especially year ones because ya I had a friend in year one okay first [kan] orientation they cut off so like they couldn't like <malay>macam</malay> familiarise the building ya because during orientation right I like at least I can get the glimpse of how the things work over there how to go to this building how to go to that building <malay>tapi</malay> for my friend right the orientation is cut off so she never even like even like
have friends like she cannot even make friends like just just in case like and but then (um)
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah] so like and [kan] <malay>dorang</malay> like most of my <malay>kawan yang</malay> year ones
<malay>dorang</malay> like
like suddenly they had to use microsoft teams and the [ah] school <malay>punya</malay> website
so <malay>macam</malay>
and for us like year two and year threes like we already like accustomed to like the the school website like how to download things how to submit things but year one they like clueless so like most of my friends here from year one they had a terrible semester one like first year ya and they couldn't like communicate okay like for someone that you meet online for the first time you would be like very awkward right [kan] so <malay>macam dorang macam</malay>
how am I supposed to <malay>berbual</malay> with this person <malay>gitu</malay> [ah]
actually diff races okay [lah]
no [lah] I <malay>berbual</malay> english because by the time right for my batch <malay>dah banyak ada yang ambil</malay> tamil <malay>gini semua</malay>
but then one thing I don't regret I mean I did not regret <malay>masuk</malay> poly ya but
but I didn't regret <malay>masuk</malay> poly because like because certain things <malay>macam</malay> how
okay so <malay>aku macam</malay> old schools <malay>sikit</malay> computer I'm not like
I'm not I don't know how to operate a computer ya ya I was I couldn't even I don't even know how to like eject thumb drive that is how <malay>kental</malay> I am
ya so <malay>diam</malay> so [ah] so <malay>bila masuk</malay> poly <malay>tiba-tiba dah kena buat</malay> [ah] share document and all that then I was like <malay>apa ni apa ni</malay> I don't know I don't know I don't know or like on the first day it was just like <malay>macam</malay>
what is happening what is happening I don't know a thing but then right in polytechnic I
acquired many skills that I think that if I go to pre-university or
diploma [ah] outside private school I couldn't I don't have that skills like and I would be still that clueless girl
like I don't know I don't know [ah] <malay>macam</malay> if I think that <malay>macam</malay> [eh]
why like will I like explore these kind of things like
during secondary school I know the like term google docs but I don't know like !huh! <malay>apa ni</malay> like what am I supposed to do there [ah] so <malay>macam</malay>
[oh] my god
<malay>kau tak bilang aku</malay>
[oh] you mean secondary school or what
[oh] primary five then I still in the kindergarten [lah]
no wonder <malay>kau selalu pergi</malay> library I thought it was to like to <malay>baca buku</malay> no
youtube game Y eight Y seven Y two
because I think because you had no one to refer though because at least for me right
okay so okay so okay [ah]
since I'm already eighteen right so <malay>macam</malay> some some things that actually almost all of the things [kan] <malay>kau</malay> <malay>kat aku</malay>
but at that point of time I was
just a small girl so I couldn't even help you I don't even understand like what kind of situation you are in even then so <malay>macam</malay> I <malay>tak boleh tak tolong apa-apa</malay> because I just look at the bright side like how you get all these things <malay>daripada mami dan</malay> #abi# <malay>macam dapat ni dapat tu macam semua benda</malay> everything first hand <malay>aku selalu dapat</malay> second or third hand <malay>aku macam</malay> I was kind of jealous at that point of time <malay>tapi</malay> that
I
<malay>macam dengar</malay> like what's like actually what happened actually so <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] not deserved [lah] <malay>macam</malay>
not deserve [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay [lah] deserve [lah] <malay>sikit</malay> deserve [lah]
messenger
<malay>macam</malay> messenger facebook
true [lah]
eighteen [oh] ya
(hmm)
[oh] secondary three secondary four okay so <malay>macam</malay>
okay firstly [kan] since [ah] okay so the teachers <malay>pun macam tahu</malay> [ah] like how they stress on O-level O-level O-level but then right and my classmates <malay>semua macam</malay> [ah] heck care <malay>macam aku tak nak kesah pun pasal benda ni</malay> just it was that bad (uh) like even like teacher <malay>pun macam</malay> what
why is this class not like taking it seriously
<malay>tapi</malay> for me right
<malay>aku pun macam</malay>
why not have fun <malay>macam macam</malay> this is the last few days <malay>sebelum</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> like some <malay>macam</malay> ya <malay>macam</malay> ya
not something to be like
a good memory [lah] so like our class <malay>macam</malay> quite
<malay>rabak</malay> [ah] to be honest okay to be honest and okay since I'm the monitress
I couldn't like <malay>macam</malay> act <malay>serabak dorang</malay> [lah] like I couldn't be that rebel or something like that ya and even because and the monitor at that point of time
like absent for like out of five days [leh]
three days absent and and even if he was present
he didn't do anything
[ah] so <malay>macam</malay>
I had to do most of the things that <malay>macam</malay>
like attendance [ah] keep track of <malay>apa</malay>
<malay>dah hantar</malay> acknowledgement slip or whatsoever [ah] so and most of the time even the teachers know that [ah]
(uh) ya so even the teachers know that [ah] anytime like they had to
<malay>macam tanya</malay> monitor they will just go to me monitress so even the monitors the guy together I will be the one <malay>yang akan</malay> represent the class it was that bad so I had to be like the responsible one so sometimes no I had to be the most responsible ones
no this is like monitress other student monitor cause the monitor doesn't even come
it was that bad so <malay>macam</malay> all of the things that I I had to do on my own because our class only had like around ten guys out of how many students [ah] twenty nine so nineteen girls and so the ten days and ten guys the responsible ones
became the prefect then the useless
they like serious [lah]
like to be honest for me right
<malay>tak ada satu pun yang layak</malay>
<malay>tak ada satu pun</malay> [ah] <malay>terpaksa</malay> [ah] [ah]
and it was because of a vote class voting at the starting of the year so right for the whole secondary years I became the monitor slash monitress secondary one [lah] the four years [lah] it was chosen by the form teacher because the form teacher knew you so apparently so apparently like <malay>kakak</malay> was the major contribution why I became like the
monitress at that point of time (err) I don't know [leh] because [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> like they most of the teacher point out [ah] like I am so different from you and <malay>abang</malay> ya because both of you can go to like on stage and public speaking or can just go up on stage but for me right I avoid
going on stage or just just presentation in class ya I just I will just avoid it like no matter what <malay>macam</malay> ya no matter what [ah]
<malay>aku akan</malay> avoid at all cost to the point that at one point of time
I took
and it was the major presentation and it was like (err) for my grade it was forty percent
it was during secondary four it was during secondary four but then (um)
for that grade I got a
B three I don't want to tell you <malay>tak payah</malay> [ah] so and during secondary three secondary four
well most of us <malay>dah macam</malay> go through many things so like and sec three sec four <malay>ada macam</malay> project <malay>macam masa tu ada</malay> this international is a <malay>apa</malay> humanitarian job [ah] so even before that going overseas right
we had to do that fund raising [lah] so like almost like everyday <malay>kita orang</malay> stay back and <malay>macam</malay> pop up <malay>macam</malay> this one booth <malay>kita orang jual air jual roti jual</malay> pizza and all
and until like the cost one dollar two dollar but then the thing is it accumulates [lah] so <malay>macam</malay> and had a lot of fun [lah] then <malay>bila</malay> secondary four okay by the time secondary four <malay>semua orang dah tahu</malay> that is going to be the last year and this is the last time <malay>untuk macam</malay> rebel [ah] <malay>bukan</malay> rebel [ah] as in show your true colours to everyone
somehow [ah] <malay>macam</malay> and since <malay>kita orang dah tahu</malay> is our last year [kan] <malay>semua orang makin rapat</malay>
then (um)
and then so <malay>macam</malay>
I don't know like
all of us became much closer
even when <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the teachers like complain about us and then our class <malay>macam</malay> [ah] it's okay it's okay it's our class like that even like the teachers
<malay>macam</malay> this class <malay>macam</malay> !hais! this class like [ah] [ah]
but it's actually good memory like even like during stay backs or upper extra class during saturday ya this and there was this one time during one saturday our chemistry teacher showed us (err) pictures during secondary one secondary two no no it was a chemistry teacher malay guy (err) male guy male so he showed us during our sec one sec two during our orientation and we were like [oh] my god you were this lame or you were this short because I had this one guy during secondary one he was like (err) on my ear ear height by the end of secondary four I am at his ear <malay>punya</malay> height
[eh] <malay>tak</malay> actually I'm like his shoulder shoulder [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> everytime right I will like <malay>gaduh dengan dia kau dulu pendek</malay> then <malay>sekarang dia macam sekarang aku lagi tinggi</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> (uh) <malay>geram</malay> [ah] but this kind of memories like <malay>macam</malay> [ah]
so but for you
like since you already like from primary secondary diploma in (uh)
poly diploma in (uh) arabic private school so
but to be honest right I couldn't even remember most of my primary school days <malay>macam</malay> it's just like
passed by
no I think I was too young to remember that
[oh] [oh] ya ya yes
vanguard
vanguard [ah] vanguard
[oh]
[oh]
but then how do they split the class like academic results or just randomly split
[ah] because for my primary school like
like they like
[ah] separate into our six six
A B C D E F [ah] so <malay>macam</malay> but some more pressure for being in the top class second top class [ah]
but then like for the lower class right <malay>dorang</malay> like stay back like almost everyday then is like one thing <malay>kesian juga macam</malay> like everyone <malay>akan tengok</malay> ya but then but the thing I hated the most because <malay>kita orang</malay> the first two class couldn't like they didn't apply us for camp
during primary six no because <malay>kita orang macam macam</malay> [ah] okay [ah] <malay>tak payah</malay> apex camp no I am more of a person of <malay>yang tak suka</malay> interact <malay>bukan</malay> antisocial
I don't label myself as antisocial
<malay>cuma</malay> I prefer less interaction
boyfriend girlfriend [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
okay
was it a few people or just like
that one person one girl a group [ah]
<malay>kau</malay> hold grudge [eh]
[oh] she put the blame on you you haven't told me this about it
then what did you do
they put the blame on you
no like do your classmates suspect you as the
[oh] [oh] okay okay
[oh] no
so means <malay>dorang</malay> stay back longer than <malay>kau</malay> stay back [ah]
[oh]
then issac was six
[oh] then why didn't you like <malay>cakap</malay> to your
but I but you guys didn't voice out that it was the primary six <malay>punya kerja</malay>
[oh] primary six [oh] [oh] but I thought you had someone who you knew
from primary six
okay
varsity jacket
[oh] that clip okay
so you had to like
[oh]
but did you realise everytime during camp or <malay>macam</malay> stay over <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
like most of us are <malay>macam tak tidur</malay>
[oh] <malay>korang tidur</malay> [eh]
[oh] no because for my batch right <malay>macam</malay> everytime <malay>kalau ada macam ada</malay> #qiyam# or <malay>macam macam</malay> sleep <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan]
<malay>selalu</malay> like <malay>malam</malay> [kan] <malay>kita orang tak tidur</malay>
and there was this one time it was the it was the guys [ah]
<malay>kita orang kita orang</malay> (uh) <malay>tidur dekat</malay> level three the boys <malay>tidur dekat</malay> level one but then [ah] #toa payoh#
I mean like canteen
[ah] okay so [ah] so but then <malay>kita orang dekat</malay> level three <malay>kita orang tengah tidur-tidur tengah berbual berbual</malay> [ah] with the girls [ah] <malay>kita orang berbual</malay> [ah] <malay>macam</malay> gossip something like that
so suddenly we saw someone running to the school gate
like <malay>dekat</malay> parade square running to the school gate then go to the parade square and stand <malay>kita orang macam</malay> curious [ah] like why is this guy doing this such a thing like during like it was one in the morning [oh] one [lah]
then <malay>kita orang semua</malay> gather <malay>abeh tengok</malay> like
they got
it was a punishment
I don't know I don't know what the guys did but it was a punishment suddenly there were like suddenly <malay>tiba-tiba ada empat orang pun apa lari</malay> to the gate and go to the parade square just stand there for like probably ten minutes it was a punishment but I don't know what they did [ah] but I think was something stupid or they did it just like ya I I think that they did it just like <malay>tak tidur</malay> so the rest <malay>kena</malay> punishment but then right I think the male teachers like <malay>macam</malay>
they walk around but for the female teachers right they just slept so like our girls sleep <malay>macam tak terganggu</malay> with any check
[oh] ya
like quite
creepy <malay>keras</malay>

<malay>kuning</malay> the other price right colour <malay>hijau</malay> do you remember because colour <malay>hijau</malay> is the cheapest [mah] right so what kinds of foods do they have in the ya green plates do you do you remember
[oh] sounds yummy ya okay <malay>apa</malay>
[ah] it will be nice right I went to the website just now then I saw they got a #satay# soup base #laksa# soup base I'm like !wah! confirm <malay>sedap</malay> [ah] <malay>macam gitu</malay>
<malay>baik</malay> #satay# sauce soup base ya ya I think it's a new flavour maybe
#satay# sauce soup base I was like !wah! that's kind of cool then maybe we can
<malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tengah</malay> diet
<malay>tapi takpe</malay> [lah] <malay>hari ini dimaafkan</malay> [lah]
cheat day yes <malay>betul tu</malay> cheat day
<malay>macam mana</malay> I <malay>tak tahu kejap</malay> I <malay>tanya adik</malay> I adam
<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>mata tutup</malay> [ah] <malay>tiba-tiba</malay>
<malay>apa</malay> B B nine
(err) <malay>bukan bukan bukan</malay>
ya <malay>bukan</malay>
so okay <malay>kita ada banyak masa nak berbual apa boleh kita cakap ni</malay> [eh] <malay>mari kita</malay>
[ah] <malay>nak cakap pasal orang tak</malay>
<malay>nak cakap tentang apa</malay>
<malay>tak senonoh gitu</malay> [eh]
<malay>orang kasih</malay> assignment <malay>kita mengumpat</malay>
okay okay ya alright <malay>kita jadi</malay> serious (um) <malay>apa kita nak berbual</malay> [eh] (um)
<malay>kita boleh cakap pasal</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita punya keluarga</malay> or okay no [lah] no [lah] [ah] shares [lah] stock market [lah] [eh]
so (um) you <malay>ada</malay> any investment you you <malay>dah buat ke</malay> or anything you <malay>nak</malay> recommend
(mm) (mm)
[oh]
me ya
I I also don't know [lah] I I'm actually looking into the stock market also
but I <malay>tak tahu</malay> because <malay>sekarang nak beli</malay> tesla <malay>mahal tak mampu</malay> though
so
I think <malay>kalau</malay> I I will <malay>beli</malay> the stock (uh) for what I have now [lah] my capital <malay>yang ada</malay> I would probably invest in cheaper stocks [lah] singapore based stocks like
(uh) old #chang kee# for example (err) <malay>murah</malay> [jer] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> old #chang kee# <malay>dia punya</malay> share price is (err) <malay>enam puluh satu sen saje</malay> [tau] [ah] serious [a'ah] <malay>betul tu</malay> then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>ada macam seratus ke dua ratus</malay> dollar then you <malay>akan</malay>
hold a lot of shares [tau] so I think
<malay>berbaloi</malay> [lah] then I I I mean [ah] I was looking at their annual report then old #chang kee# [kan]
<malay>dia orang akan</malay> open more outlets in more countries especially like in western countries where like <malay>macam</malay> the demand for asian foods are rising <malay>tapi</malay> supply <malay>tak banyak</malay>
so I would say maybe since they're are going to expand in region [kan] then <malay>agaknya</malay> I would think [lah] it's a good good good you know investment I would say some more they are like (um) they are singapore company so I would think
they won't grow so much but you can get money through dividend [lah] so I mean that's my thing [lah] cause <malay>sekarang</malay> I don't think I I <malay>boleh mampu</malay> [lah] tesla <malay>mahal saje</malay>
ya <malay>tapi itu</malay> my thing [lah] on stocks
<malay>tapi masalahnya</malay> some some stocks <malay>dia orang tak</malay> how to say <malay>dia orang tak syariah</malay> on client [tau] so <malay>nanti dia orang tak</malay>
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>kita tak boleh ambil dia punya</malay> (um) benefits [lah] from that stocks so ya I don't know [lah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>ni semua</malay> islamic financial [ah] you <malay>tahu tak</malay> anything about it
I see I see I see actually now that you say it [lah] that time I went for this (uh) website so they have this website online that they help with screen the stocks if the stocks are you get <malay>syariah pampasan</malay> or not
so it's very interesting because <malay>macam</malay> they will literally say like a tick or cross if it's (uh) allowed or not <malay>haram</malay> or halal [lah] in that sense <malay>tapi</malay> the problem with that website [ah] they very limited if you want to see more of like their ratings you <malay>kena bayar</malay>
then I'm like !alamak! then you muslim <malay>pun nak buat duit</malay>
<malay>nak tengok</malay> stocks halal <malay>ke tak</malay>
but I would say it's good [lah] like you know they give you like a listing and they helped you to screen up the stocks and and it's very <malay>macam</malay> you look at the platform very easy to understand so I'm like okay [lah] that there's very good especially sometimes because we think that the company might
be everything okay but then when you look at the screening process and they say actually cannot because in some sort they have like a subdivision debts investing in this like
but which is which might not be very halal link assets so
ya I think <malay>bagus</malay> [lah] <malay>kita sekarang</malay> (err) I would say the muslim world is getting very progressive [lah]
in that sense you know there's a lot of this kind of thingy
so ya <malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay>
ya (um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
(um)
you <malay>rasa</malay>
good <malay>tak</malay> stocks
(mm)
I see I see
ya anyway (err) <malay>betul tu</malay> ya but I heard [kan] <malay>itu kalau</malay> you <malay>nak pakai wahed</malay> invest then
<malay>ada</malay> some fees involved right like <malay>apa tu</malay>
but how much [ah] the fees is it cheap to to put in money inside
(mm)
ya ya
(um) okay <malay>apa</malay> [eh] <malay>nak bilang</malay> you [oh] ya anyway I I found out there is days
new (um) way
technically grow your money but with very low return [lah] so <malay>macam kalau</malay> you got some money to invest but you you are still looking for investment opportunity and you don't want to put the money in the bank let let's say you got two thousand dollars then you <malay>tak nak letak</malay> it in the bank [lah]
because firstly <malay>kalau</malay> you want to follow the islamic banking the you know the <malay>hibah tak banyak</malay>
so if you it an alternative is I was just looking at this it's called the money market fund so it's quite good because you invest like one thousand dollars in these funds right then it will technically a new <malay>saham</malay> returns <malay>tapi tak banyak</malay> the goal of this fund is to just preserve a capital when this ends so it's like (uh) <malay>macam</malay> it's like a savings account with a little bit more (uh)
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
return that you get back and then also they're they're in their brochure they say they are supportive of socially responsible investing which means <malay>dia orang tak</malay> invest in a alcohol gambling pork related literary predicted of tobacco
so
wasted [lah] I think like a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> lot of banks they don't really know that bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal
so
ya [lah] wasted <malay>kalau dia orang tak</malay> invest in bonds then <malay>kita dah boleh letak duit kat dalam</malay> [seh] if this can be our like primary savings account you know took up the money inside here
right [kan]
can [lah] <malay>nanti</malay> I call <malay>dia orang</malay>
ya [lah] I call [lah] I call [lah] I <malay>bilang</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay> right
that's true that's true
I I I think like the the notion of ethical investing is like getting more
gaining popularity [lah] because like you know (um)
[eh] not not sorry it's the international monetary fund right
they recently like two years back I think they they started to look at islamic finance and they are pushing forward [lah] for
for the idea of islamic finance because technically (um) you are being you are being very ethical with your investing and also <malay>macam</malay> in terms of risks right you are not passing so much risk towards their consumer so
that's why I think (err)
they are pushing it like especially in like the middle eastern countries so it's quite good but but unfortunately I feel like singapore <malay>macam</malay> not progressive yet in term of islamic finance
ya possibly because (um) even a lot of like muslim
people or other muslims they will still invest in
interest yielding accounts and maybe <malay>dia orang tak tahu</malay> [lah] it's <malay>haram</malay> because you would need to kind of know [mah] <malay>yang kita tak boleh yang</malay> interest and all bonds are <malay>tak</malay> halal I mean this is not like general knowledge so I think that's one thing you know education is important within the muslim community
ya <malay>kita terus</malay> deep [eh] <malay>berbual</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul betul betul</malay> I was looking at (um) the equivalent of bonds so called a interpreter islamic finance so I mean interesting [lah] because (uh) one good thing is our neighbour malaysia they are (err) they technically malaysia and indonesia they issue a lot of SOCOE so
(um) maybe there's one thing we can consider [lah]
so ya
SOCOE will be a good <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>pun macam tak faham sangat</malay> [lah] how how the SOCOE (um) investment works but halal [kan] <malay>dia</malay> [kan] so <malay>boleh</malay> [lah] [eh]
ya so
ya
[oh] <malay>kita punya</malay> trip [eh] [ah] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] I I <malay>punya adik kejap</malay> [eh] I call my <malay>adik</malay> hello
<malay>adik</malay> I <malay>baru kentut adik</malay> I <malay>kentut adik</malay> I <malay>lepas ni nak kena</malay>
<malay>bau dia kuat</malay>
I <malay>tak tahu dia punya ada</malay> like a mix of a and I don't know <malay>dia makan apa tapi bau dia</malay> like one kind you know toxic toxic
<malay>kentut</malay> [ah] I think maybe yes [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> eating [lah] agaknya rasa gitu</malay> [ah]
so (um)
ya ya <malay>itu</malay> I I I <malay>tu tak</malay> okay [ha] [ha] so anyway (um)
<malay>nak pergi makan</malay> I <malay>pun lapar sekarang belum makan</malay> so I <malay>pun nak pergi makan</malay> actually [kan] is #hafizah# going or not to #sedap# mania like what what do you think the chances are
(mm)
(mm) (mm) ya [lor] actually <malay>semua pun dah</malay> agree <malay>apa</malay> sunday <malay>semua</malay> okay
!aiyo! unless <malay>kita</malay> just go somewhere to like <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
then after that we just <malay>lepak</malay> then because you say she want a weekend actually we can do another day where we can have everyone work together then we can cycle and all right so if you want maybe today we can just go somewhere to like <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>makan</malay> [lor]
I would think maybe #seletar# cafe will be good <malay>tapi sana makanan dia</malay> <malay>tak</malay> halal so <malay>mana kita boleh makan</malay> [oh] maybe we can eat at #seletar# airport the mister <malay>teh tarik</malay> express <malay>dia tu mahal ke</malay>
okay (um)
I <malay>tak tahu</malay> what are good things for us to <malay>makan</malay> [eh] (err)

<malay>mana</malay> #boon keng# is it
at this block block block <malay>sebelas</malay> [eh]
<malay>ada yang sebelah</malay> main road <malay>tu yang</malay> you pass by <malay>satu</malay> block <malay>macam</malay> horizontal
[ah] block block <malay>tu</malay> I <malay>dengar dulu dulu banyak banyak dayak</malay> [eh] block <malay>tu ada dadah semua</malay> I heard a lot of stories you know about the block
I don't know [lah]
[oh] [oh] your uncle was from there
so ya ya
ya so what did your uncle say though about about the block
it is it like your uncles or your friend like who is this person
[oh] distant [eh] <malay>jauh</malay> [lah] <malay>tu</malay>
[oh] okay okay
[oh]
<malay>nama dia</malay> Q

I see I see ya I mean is is it because <malay>dia tinggal kat</malay> #boon keng# <malay>takde bapa ke tinggal</malay> #boon keng# <malay>pasal takde bapa</malay>
I I curious [lah] <malay>macam</malay> you know this kind of at risk areas what are the demographic of the people
[oh]
[oh] <malay>dengan datuk dia</malay>
<malay>tiba-tiba letak datuk</malay>
<malay>contohnya apa khabar</malay> [eh] are you close with the <malay>datuk</malay>
<malay>mak dia</malay> doctor <malay>apa</malay> though
like !wah! so I mean not bad [eh] <malay>walaupun dia tinggal</malay> at risk block <malay>mak dia</malay> doctor
<malay>kencang</malay> [seh] then <malay>kenapa mak dia doktor mak dia pun macam tak nak</malay> take her out you know
but ya ya this mom is specialising in what kind of medicine [ah]
I I'm wondering (uh) honestly curious
[oh] interesting [eh] psychology
[ah] psychology you <malay>pernah nampak tak dia punya dia punya mak</malay> I mean it will be very interesting you know to talk to her you know her antics and all
!wah!
very good very good I mean now nowadays they say you cannot specialized you need to generalize you know in your career
diversify [kan]
<malay>bagus bagus bagus</malay> very good
I actually now you speaking of which [ah] I think I met someone like this you know <malay>tak tahu orang sama ke</malay> this one this doctor like I'm talking about
that time I I was near the #boon keng# area then there was this doctor <malay>dan dia punya kucing</malay>
so I was like <malay>tapi dia tengah pakai</malay> white coat [lah] [eh] doctor <malay>dengan kucing</malay>
ya so maybe [lah] it's the it's the same person [lah] loves animal right
[ah] [a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> vet I mean we don't know [lah] <malay>pasal</malay> career <malay>banyak</malay>
a lot of careers ya
but I mean okay [lah] so <malay>maknya</malay> consider good [lah] doctor
good [lah] <malay>tapi anaknya</malay>
(um) I <malay>tak tahu</malay> I heard <malay>anak dia</malay>
[ah] I don't know how I heard [lah] where I heard [lah] <malay>agaknya kat</malay> mothership <malay>anak dia macam</malay>
<malay>apa seorang</malay> [ah] <malay>sampai</malay> or rather act a bit <malay>pelik</malay> you know
so I feel like if your mom is the psychologist then your daughter cannot be like that you know
maybe <malay>dia punya anak</malay> needs treatment [lah] like like do you think so
[oh] mother's gossip
[a'ah] [lah] <malay>agaknya</malay> [lah] however <malay>tak tahu</malay>
ya ya ya <malay>betul tu</malay> maybe what we can do is we can actually find this (um) Q your distant relative we can <malay>ajak</malay> her [lah] go <malay>makan</malay> [oh] maybe #sedap# mania you know I heard right although they are like you know in this kind of bad situation they got a lot money in their bank account you know
<malay>banyak banyak banyak banyak</malay>
<malay>duit</malay> so
<malay>lagi</malay> more reason [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah] <malay>takde</malay> [lah]
(uh) maybe we should help [lah] we should help please tell
like include them into our conversation because I mean to think about it ya well what you say is true [lah] if someone is put in that environment they kind of <malay>macam</malay> angry or you know whatever emotion it just gets bottled up because you <malay>takde</malay> you know outlet <malay>boleh keluarkan</malay> the <malay>perasaan</malay>
so in the end you know it's gonna eat her up internally [lah] [eh] <malay>macam mana</malay> her [eh] I [tau] eat him or her up like internally
so (um) it's important [lah] to seek medical treatment I say I mean twenty twenty now mental health is very important
so ya
they're not stigmatized [lah] in
(mm) [ah] <malay>kenapa ni</malay>
[ah] ya ya I I I redeem it I put it on nineteen as well which is this coming saturday [lah]
[ah] #sentosa# is it
that's how [ah] we've got twenty dollars worth of credits right
(um) #sentosa# I'm not sure because if we were to go for all the attractions and all that kind of cost a lot of money then you know the bungee jump <malay>itu</malay> I <malay>tak berani</malay>
so (um) #sentosa# maybe we can
picnic
I don't know cycle
we can
sit at the bar [ah]
you know we can just hang around at #sentosa# #sentosa# I think we can go to the
deeper deeper parts [lor]
[ah] yes yes maybe we can go there also over the fort #serapong# can just cycle there I don't think it's very far
it's like within the
tramp <malay>punya</malay> trail then we just <malay>macam</malay>
I'm not sure about the
whether it's legal or not
I would I would think these kind of place
they don't say [lah] they don't say illegal they don't say it's legal but then they will say if anything happens to you then
you cannot claim compensation [lah] because it's at your own risk [mah] you <malay>masuk tempat gitu</malay> so
ya but I think we just be very careful like you want to visit all of these places and I think now because we are in lock down and all there's nothing much we can do so
I think you know the COVID and the circumstances has pushed us to you know venture
find out all these spaces within our own country which is good [lah] cause <malay>kalau kalau tak</malay> then we wouldn't have even thought about this right so only you know interesting interesting
[oh] ya ya how much is it [ah]
I'm not too sure I really don't
[oh] ya we can do that also (uh) I think twenty dollar thing can get us about three right
(err) (um) can [lah] I mean
we we can go for the luge but luge is like
can also then luge <malay>macam laju</malay> [lah] a bit too fast don't you think so
ya as in [eh] as in the the timing also [lah]
I anytime if some more if it's on a saturday then I think will be best if we go
morning will be best <malay>tapi</malay>
we can go <malay>malam</malay> [lah] or we can go like in the evening <malay>macam</malay> cold [kan] <malay>begitu</malay> so <malay>macam</malay> sunset
<malay>dia tak panas sangat</malay> and ya
not <malay>pergi maghrib</malay> I mean
can also [lah] because okay if you want right because we get about twenty dollars but do we have do we have to book on the tickets in advance
(mm) okay okay then then good [lah] I would think of saturday <malay>banyak orang</malay> but it should be fine [lah] should be fine [lah]

you steal is because you need to survive kind [tau]
it's not the worst sin [lah] but they believe that <malay>macam</malay>
ya [lah] but <malay>kalau kau bunuh diri sendiri pun</malay> it's not it's not a
you want to <malay>bunuh</malay> people with what [seh] I don't know you have don't have anything [what]
ya but at the point of time it's not <malay>kira dia macam</malay> you are not of sound mind [tau] at the point of time
ya but then that's the only <malay>kira macam</malay> that's the only sin [lah] [kan]
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] that's the only sin that's the only sin that you have
but if you rich then you got a lot of sin you need to bribe a lot that's right
but islam is very fair
<malay>tak juga</malay> no I mean like islam is fair because <malay>macam dia orang akan</malay>
<malay>akan timbang kau punya buruk dengan baik engkau</malay> and then after that if you have your <malay>buruk</malay> and then you will just go through all that you will be punished for all your <malay>buruk</malay> but then after that you will be given a chance to
ya let that's why you have to prepare yourself that's like another question
<malay>taubat</malay> [lah] that's why got
I asked this question during <malay>umrah</malay>
ya [lah] then that's why I say that's why that time I was in <malay>umrah</malay> then they they was talking about this [lah] like [ah] before we went to <malay>umrah</malay> we have like the course [kan] <malay>habis dia orang tanya</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> okay then <malay>bila kita zaman</malay> [ah] this <malay>ustaz macam</malay> rock rock <malay>sikit</malay> [lah] <malay>habis dia cakap</malay> then <malay>bila kita zaman</malay> time <malay>zaman</malay> rock <malay>kita pun terlepas solat</malay> then <malay>dia cakap kita buat apa yang kita mampu then kita solat taubat</malay> [lah] <malay>solat taubat</malay> then whatever that you can do like if you have extra time then you just pay back <malay>macam qada</malay> because you know you don't know how many
<malay>mana boleh</malay>
(mm)
(mmhmm)
how would I know <malay>siapa kita nak</malay> judge that's why say at the end of the day you can only hear say all all of these kind of thing
but okay then there is the thing about <malay>orang yang kafir tapi dapat syurga</malay> just because <malay>dia kasi air dekat anjing tu</malay> so that's why I said like who are we to judge who are we to <malay>pertikaikan kita punya amalan</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>kalau aku pun aku bunuh</malay> [sia] <malay>aku nak taubat kau cakap macam itu kau kurang ajar apa</malay>
but he already <malay>bunuh</malay> the <malay>ustaz</malay>
[oh]
<malay>niat dia berjihad apa</malay>
ya [lah]
ya
ya [lah] that's why [kan] <malay>aku cakap nawaitu tu penting nawaitu tu penting</malay> sis [kan] <malay>aku dah cakap tadi tadi pagi tu jatuh niat nak maki</malay> [ah] <malay>tapi dah maki</malay> [lah] <malay>tu jangan nak macam nak cakap benda</malay> word this word is for another word but actually <malay>kau nak maki tu dah jatuh niat dah dah jatuh niat nak maki tu</malay>
(mm) <malay>maki</malay> [jer]
ya but they always say that the paradise is not for the good people it's for the sinners
who repent ya
that's why <malay>macam kalau kau macam niat kau nak solat pun tu kita dah dah dah dah</malay> plus point <malay>dah malaikat dah tulis dah</malay> [oh] <malay>dia nak solat</malay> [ah] <malay>dia terus nak pergi tak</malay> [oh] <malay>tak dia tak pergi tapi tak</malay> minus <malay>tapi dah dah jatuh niatnya</malay> ya then if <malay>kau nak buat jahat pun dia tak ada nak tulis macam nak</malay> [oh] <malay>nak buat jahat tak tulis sampai</malay> [lah] <malay>orang tu pergi dekat tempat tu</malay> and <malay>dia buat jahat</malay> then <malay>baru dia orang tulis</malay>
[kan] but I think all these all these people all these typical
people in our community makes it
it makes it <malay>macam susah untuk orang nak terima islam</malay> because
you guys are judgy bunch
like <malay>orang pergi masuk dalam masjid tak pakai tudung kau orang tengok atas bawah apa salahnya</malay> sister sister <malay>nak sembahyang pun</malay> sister <malay>nak solat kita buat</malay> [jer] <malay>yang wajib</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya
[kan]
ya [lah]
doesn't mean like you don't wear your <malay>tudung</malay> your <malay>amalan</malay> is lesser than
that was the thing that was flying
<malay>yang</malay> spaghetti bolognese <malay>punya</malay> hook <malay>tu aku cakap apa tu yang</malay>
I don't know maybe
okay
okay I will see you in twenty twenty two
<malay>lepas tu aku rasa macam orang orang-orang ni semua</malay> I don't know how they educate their children and all
I mean I'm not saying that <malay>aku ni</malay> [ah] <malay>aku ni</malay> perfect but like I have ground rules of not judging people [lah]
ya man
okay
(mmhmm)
(mm)
but it's a it's typical [what] to do that
(mmhmm)
(mm)
[oh] sis <malay>lagi kena teruk</malay> everytime I wear <malay>tudung</malay> then people all like <malay>macam cakap aku ni macam-macam</malay>
it's not about step good good [ah] <malay>dia macam macam</malay> [ah] !alah! <malay>perempuan tudung ni semua</malay> you know the guys that I like get to know right they say <malay>macam perempuan tudung ni</malay>
[ah]
actually <malay>senang</malay> [jer]
[kan] then [ah] it's like you cover your head but you never cover your bottom
<malay>macam kira senang dapat</malay> [ah]
then I was like okay but not all of them are like that [what] like how right now I have the stigma of a single mother
[kan]
but
it doesn't matter [lah] I think it doesn't matter like what people think of us if it's just <malay>apa kita</malay>
how we react to that it shows
shows [ah] shows how we are as a person [ah] so I don't care [lah]
[kan]
(hmm)
be more proper
[kan]
ya
(mmhmm)
[kan]
like I think those kind of things so so <malay>macam</malay>
to certain people it will be like
<malay>mengghairahkan</malay> and
men are known to have like mental images and they keep
[ha]
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
seriously
[oh] damn you weird
weirdo
<malay>siapa</malay> #nurul#
<malay>siapa</malay>
the <malay>cantik</malay> one
I don't know [lah] whatever [lah] then
!wow!
she what her display picture [ah] <malay>yang tunjuk muka dia pakai niqab</malay>
(hmm)
!wow!
should we do that like for our
like
gain popularity
for goodness
no I mean like <malay>macam</malay> you know we want to be we want to try to be influencers so why not like
(mmhmm)
[oh] man I can't do that
ya but that's another way for you to tone down your voice [what]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] sis more aware [ah]
but how to <malay>makan</malay> [ah] with <malay>niqab</malay> so you just open like that then <malay>makan</malay> I mean like ya ya [lah]
it's like a beat man
ya but then <malay>macam</malay> that's how people see you as a #hijabi# [ah] so when <malay>kau macam jatuhkan</malay> judgement <malay>dekat niqabi</malay> when orang <malay>jatuhkan</malay> judgement as
<malay>dekat kau</malay> as a #hijabi# then <malay>kau macam tak boleh terima</malay>
what [sia]
<malay>apa</malay>
but actually <malay>macam betul</malay> [lah] <malay>cuma pada aku macam kalau kau nak pakai niqab kau punya niat bukan untuk</malay> just to cover yourself but I think you need to have
<malay>ilmu</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa kau nak pakai niqab</malay> so <malay>engkau punya</malay> journey
[a'ah]
so <malay>macam kau punya</malay> journey <malay>tak tersekat-sekat macam bila kita nak pakai tudung pun kita kena tahu</malay>
what to expect how to bring yourself
[a'ah]
(mmhmm)
ya
[kan]
[kan]
is it the time for me to wear
<malay>dia macam</malay> there's an opening there's an opportunity there is it time for me to change and wear
[kan]
okay [lah] not really [lah]
[kan]
(mmhmm)
<malay>tapi macam</malay> okay speaking of this [eh] I was like thinking [tau] <malay>masa tu macam orang-orang yang pakai niqab ni semua semua macam</malay> very [ah] small sized you noticed or not they are very small sized and <malay>dia orang punya tulang</malay> is very small so like
sis is already is big it's not like I am
not say <malay>macam</malay> fat fat you know but it's like I'm already born big ya big build but then <malay>macam bila aku pakai</malay> [eh] <malay>aku rasa macam</malay> then I was saying this to #nek yam# you know then I was like <malay>macam</malay> [eh] <malay>habis nanti orang pakai habis macam</malay>
you know all these people <malay>macam pakai macam terletak</malay> [jer] then <malay>macam</malay> for me is like <malay>terletak</malay> and then <malay>tiba-tiba macam</malay> shoulder <malay>besar</malay>
and shoulder <malay>besar</malay> and then like then <malay>macam tergantung</malay> [ah] <malay>macam tergantung kita macam</malay> hanger so it's like it's not nice [ah] <malay>pada aku</malay> then after that #nek yam# said something that <malay>macam terus macam aku terus</malay> (ugh)
<malay>macam</malay> then she say you wear things you want to wear a <malay>niqab</malay> you want to wear to impress people or you want to wear because of #allah#
sis <malay>terus</malay> shut up [lah]
ya [lah] but doesn't mean <malay>kau</malay> presentable it
it doesn't have to do with yourself it just <malay>macam kau tak boleh</malay> change <malay>diri engkau</malay>
exactly that's why like you know sometimes and I'm I'm thinking like you know moving forward like what kind of clothes I would want to wear as a #hijabi# that
with big build or who is plus size or you know like for people who are bigger [lah]
ya that's why
(mm)
<malay>dapat</malay> sis looking at her
it's like looking
at myself like you know like I said to you at that time <malay>macam</malay> she became a basic
I don't want to say that word
#ringarde#
ya
but then <malay>macam</malay> but when you wear all these things you need to be slightly #ringarde# [lah]
because you are not supposed to stand out you are supposed to
be modest for yourself and for your creator
in <malay>dunia</malay> [lah] (mmhmm)
<malay>tapi macam kalau kau dah</malay> actually <malay>kau pakai hijab</malay> [jer] <malay>kau dah kena</malay> sacrifice all these things [seh] slowly [lah]

if that day right I already start (uh) applying for jobs on this (uh)
fast job app online then a few of the jobs [ah] like very interesting
<malay>dia macam</malay> [ah] there's one application that I tried is [ah] mystery shopper
have you ever tried that before
but (uh) because the pay they say it's about hundred and twenty per visit
so then they pay you upfront <malay>ke</malay> or they
they will see your they will see your feedback and then after that they will (uh) record and then they will see then they will pay
(mm)
(mm) but that time when you got the pay how much is it
so they pay according to the outlet you go or they just pay according to the assignment
(mm)
[ah]
so basically you just have to rate the (uh) display and then the customer service price you know but price should be the same right
[oh] my god
but it's so weird right I mean like you are being a demanding difficult customer and then end up you never buy #paiseh# right
so it's kind of like they are expecting you to come [lah] it's just that they don't know who only right
[oh] my god
but imagine [ah] if let's say they
there's like two or three shopper inside and then they are showing good service to other people except you
then [ah] another job I tried right is the
then they call me actually they said the (um) it's a permanent part time but it's at unity
that means doing the pharmacy <malay>punya</malay> side [lah] but the problem is I have to
be to commit long term because I was telling them
I can only work until december but then <malay>dia orang cakap</malay> cannot they have to I have to commit at least one year
wasted right and then the (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> we the we bounce email back and forth back and forth and then ended up you know what my colleague got it
and she resigned straightaway you know ya she just informed my boss she just say that (uh) she got a new job
and then she just decided to leave the company [lah] but anyway the market is also not so good right now right
so ya [lah] anyway I don't know how much is the pay though but it's quite good [lah] it's three times a week only
(mm) permanent part time but they need it (uh) long term
(uh) shift work I think they will give it to you eight hours per day
(mm) <malay>tapi dekat</malay> jems <malay>kau</malay>
is so it's quite convenient [what] it's just like one train away
don't have to even change train
(mm)
ya
that's why I was thinking I was attracted to the job because I was thinking
I have to work twice a week with the current employer
so these three three another three days right I can actually
ya I can actually <malay>kerja dekat</malay> (uh) <malay>sana</malay> [kan] if they can <malay>ini</malay> but then too bad
they ask me to commit until one year who knows what's going to happen next year right
because if the economy pick up then I will have to work full time already [mah]
that's why then another one I tried is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay>
(uh) the hypermart the shopping mall at your place
but that one is (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> that one <malay>pun</malay> (uh) <malay>ada</malay> shift [ah] seven to
three three to eleven or something like that the one that I think you say too early to come right
but anyway they only need two staff [lah]
(mm) (mm)
so just anyway just send [lah] just see how
but some of them [ah] don't even bother to reply
even (uh) temperature taking also they ask you to <malay>apa ni</malay> they will ask you to commit for at least
one six months [ah] six months to one year you know
and then (uh) they say you cannot choose the shift
you cannot choose (uh) the day that you want to work everything will be assigned by the manager
and it's just temperature taking
and the what do they do they just sit there right and then they make sure that you do the safe entry and then they make sure that your temperature is okay and then you wear mask
ten dollar [eh]
the one
<malay>tapi</malay> dormitories is very risky because
there are so many infection
then you don't know if you are going to get infected
because the one that I saw published is a wet market
ten dollar per hour
then after that (err) also I think it's mondays to
[eh] it's alternate days [eh]
like monday you work tuesday you off and then wednesday you work
but the problem is my current job we won't know our work schedule until nearer the date
so I cannot commit to the days that the temperature screening wants to take also
yes
no because sometimes it's up to the <malay>apa tu</malay> management to
put in the days that they want us to work like sometimes I can work monday friday sometimes it's like wednesday thursday sometimes in a week I only work one time
sometimes they ask me to take annual leave right so the whole week I will not be working like this week [ah]
actually they will give us (uh) every end of the month for the following month
<malay>tapi nanti dia</malay> last minute there's always a lot of changes and the changes are always come
say one week before [lah] <malay>macam</malay> like this week right by thursday friday they will tell me my next week schedule to confirm
what day I'm working so hopefully <malay>tak ada</malay> change
<malay>tapi kalau ada</malay> change then <malay>susah</malay> [lah] how am I going to call the <malay>ini</malay> [kan] the other job
and the worst part is of course you have to prioritize your current job
[ah] rather than your part time job
correct that's why I think my colleague [kan] <malay>dia tak nak</malay> she doesn't want to do this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> because one thing the part time that the unity one you cannot choose
the shift and you cannot choose the time so she doesn't want to commit
and then down here got problem so in the end she decided to quit [lah] and then she choose she told the unity side to that you want to work full time instead
ya she requested for a full time <malay>tapi bagus kau dia punya</malay> because of
the qualification [lah] I think
actually they are looking for a cashier cum store assistant take stock all these [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> because of <malay>dia punya</malay> qualification and maybe also because she want to do full time right
they actually put her to a supervisor slash manager role you know
ya I mean it's good for her also anyway she's <malay>dia dia pun</malay> I think on work pass [eh]
(mm) because we cannot my current employer <malay>dia cakap</malay> if let's say you're on work pass because a few of them were asking can they
work go back to their country and still work because we work remotely right
so they are asking if they can go back to their country and then still work as per normal [lah] but so just log in <malay>apa</malay>
then my company say cannot because (uh) according to the rule you cannot do that [lah] if you work in singapore
you are under singapore employment you cannot go back philippines or malaysia or brunei then work from their remotely because
it will I think there's some law thingy [ah] and then <malay>kesian</malay> [kan] all these (uh)
passes holder like because what they are thinking is <malay>dia orang nak</malay> save on rental
[ah] then down there <malay>tak ada</malay> imagine one person rent one room like five six hundred and then now your pay is like half
so basically [ah] you are giving all your pay to your landlord you know
even my ex colleague also I I heard (uh) my ex company
some of the pinoys [ah] they instead of staying one room one person right now what they did is
two person or three person in one room so they share the rental so at least if the rental is like six hundred each of them pay two hundred
<malay>kesian</malay> [seh]
rent
<malay>tak tahu tapi kau tahu si apa tu kawan aku dulu yang si azman tu</malay>
he actually rented out his room you know to malaysian
because <malay>dia cakap</malay> that time [kan] [ah] during the COVID period then all these malaysian <malay>tak boleh balik</malay>
so what he did is because he's staying alone now
the father passed away a few years back [lah] so he staying the whole house alone and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> [ah] he advertise on gumtree (um)
<malay>apa ni dia cakap ada</malay> all these during this period whereby the malaysian cannot go back
so these (uh) factory workers right actually contacted him directly and rent his room the two rooms
so you know what monthly he got extra (uh) I think thousand five or two thousand you know
for the two rooms [eh] and then I think there's (uh) three three or four people only renting like per room I think got two people [lah]
and most of the time he say he just stay in his room
with aircon and with (uh) that's it <malay>tak keluar pun</malay> and all these factory workers they are working at night right so they are during the day they are at home
whereas <malay>si azman ni pula</malay> (uh) <malay>dia kerja</malay>
day time he's at home he's working remotely [lah]
and then at night he say he have the house to all to himself <malay>tak kecoh-kecoh</malay> you know
and
ya and then anyway they come back also just to sleep so I ask him then cooking how <malay>dia cakap</malay> cooking because all male
so he said (uh) sometimes they #dabao# then sometimes they cook so he just eat
then when come to cleaning the house and everything right
everybody just do their part [lah]
then I say the toilet how then he say the toilet toilet they clean [lah] then I'm like [eh] but you are using the toilet also [eh]
how can you ask people to clean and some more they pay you rent [eh]
(uh) I think five room also [ah] <malay>dekat</malay> woodlands
good money right actually
<malay>tu dia cakap</malay> (uh) because his pay was (uh) cut I think about thirty percent [eh] thirty
thirty percent <malay>ke</malay> forty percent so the rental income that he got makes up for the pay that he <malay>kena</malay> cut
that's why at least something right
too bad I don't have room to spare
ya
but I guess it's okay [lah] because he's a guy <malay>abeh dia pun macam tak keluar bilik</malay> unlike <malay>macam perempuan</malay> [kan] <malay>suka keluar</malay>
we every time have to go to the kitchen go to the toilet you know
for him is everything he have is in the room he can just lock himself in the room
so I guess it's better for him also [lah]
ya actually he was saying maybe after COVID over right he was thinking of selling off the house also
so we were telling him why do you want to sell the house you see it can generate income for you you know even if you want to retire early right you can just
rent out the extra rooms that you have and then ya get income from there
you don't have to work so hard anymore
I think still have a bit [ah] that time he mentioned
but cool right I mean like you don't really have to struggle [lah] <malay>macam ada</malay> job <malay>ada</malay> job <malay>tak ada</malay> job <malay>tak ada</malay> job anyway I have extra income
it's just that when it comes to spending you have to be more prudent [lah] you cannot (um) anyhow spend
<malay>tak boleh</malay> order <malay>tak boleh keluar makan</malay> I mean like once in a while
that's why
ya
so that's why then what about your side your company okay <malay>tak</malay>
maybe have [lah] because (um) they had they didn't really close all the borders worldwide
it's just that right now travel is only restricted to business or people going back to their hometown own country
ya
and (um) I think flights also not regular so you have to
those who are urgently need to <malay>balik kampung</malay> or urgently need to go travel for business sign contract or whatever thing right
they have to go means they have to go [lah] I guess but then
ya [lah] like you say I that day I went to linkedin also I saw they can still offer salary at like six thousand for or you know
I mean like it's too good to be true right
actually I also think so you know I mean like maybe most of the (uh) advertisement right or the job (uh) post on link in linkedin
are mostly <malay>macam</malay> like attracting you you know and then like you say maybe is just to collect data so once the
because I think now they know that a lot of people are being retrenched out of job
so people are looking for a job so what they do is they just entice you
<malay>lepas tu bila kau dah kasih kau punya</malay> resume <malay>apa semua</malay> then they will say okay we will call you once there's any opening
maybe interview will be just with the recruitment agency [lah]
and then once they interview you they will rate you and then they will if let's say anybody looking for
any position any position open right then they will see who qualifies best [lor]
but then six thousand [eh]
I didn't know that (uh) all these personal assistant right and executive assistant can earn until so much you know
but but with six K [ah] I don't think the job is going to be as easy as it looks [ah] sometimes you know all these bosses
retrench
golden handshake
ya I guess <malay>tapi</malay> ten K [eh]
that is what we call work smart
I'm sure [ah] when she earn ten K per month that time right she will
she will keep some and like you say she got rental from condo all these rental from condo [ah] is not cheap you know I mean like if it's a corporate rental [ah] can
give her like four five K per month [eh]
because I have friends who married #ang moh# right so expat [ah]
she said she rented one condo <malay>dekat</malay> (uh) harbourfront down there per month is five K you know
so can you imagine the owner of the condo every month [ah] you can just shake leg if you don't work also can you just take it rental five thousand
ya
good right
anyway then after that you guys don't keep contact already [ah]
but how long have she been working with the company
but sometimes boys boss bosses [lah] I mean like (um)
as male bosses are okay
<malay>tapi bila</malay> sometimes [ah] when it comes to their private travel [ah] !wah! then the the wife can be bossy
ya they can demand a lot of things or this one cannot that one cannot you know I don't like this I don't like that
that's why sometimes I hear complain from [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
(err) the husband is paying [what] why is the wife getting involved you know
but sometimes again you cannot blame the the bosses because the bosses are too busy
so they leave it over to the wife to handle and that's where it gets complicated
[ah] I also got one experience because <malay>apa ni dia punya</malay> secretary <malay>punya</malay> boss the boss is a very nice guy you know
and then [ah] (uh) every year they have this (uh) <malay>macam</malay> trip home trip [lah] so call home leave
entitlement so instead of going back home they can use it for their holiday trip
as long as the amount don't exceed if exceed the amount then of course they have to top-up themselves (um) so if they don't use and then just <malay>rugi</malay> [lah] it's like forfeited
so what the they did is they always [ah] book first book a travel first
then <malay>lepas tu</malay> [kan] <malay>nanti</malay> along the way there will be changes of course
then got one time [ah] suddenly the the secretary call me and say [eh] how come my boss [ah] the krisflyer point is (um)
(uh) <malay>apa ni kenapa</malay> deduct [eh] I think about two two hundred thousand or something like that it's a lot you know it's a lot of amount
so <malay>dia cakap</malay> (uh) did he upgrade or any he asked me to check <malay>dia kata bila</malay> krisflyer actually deduct <malay>salah</malay> or what
so I check check check then I say no so far is all paid by this (uh) relocation company
nothing we don't do anything with krisflyer or anything (uh) we didn't do any claim [lah] check <malay>punya</malay> check <malay>rupanya</malay> wife <malay>dia</malay>
the wife redeem (uh) free ticket
to go to london and then after that go to new york to visit the daughter
she never she never tell him that's why then he like what
and the best part [ah] they didn't even (uh) say anything to me you know
then after that (uh) until I ask again [ah]
<malay>aku tanya dia</malay> (uh) <malay>apa ni</malay> so the
the how you find out about the missing miles
is it really our fault or krisflyer for or whose fault
and then the secretary also #paiseh# [ah] I said [oh] ya we found out actually the wife claim the miles because want to get free ticket
she thought that the (uh) points are expiring so she thought maybe ya she just claim [lor]
and never even bother to tell him
ya funny right can you imagine he <malay>sekali</malay> [ah] he keep keep keep the point to do something or to bring the family out or what <malay>sekali</malay> [ah] the
<malay>dia punya</malay> wife claim everything #siao#
ya
[ah] every time like that <malay>nanti karang</malay> (uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> you I I purposely want to travel with this airline because I
I got this card and then I want to claim mileage here I want to <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah]
ya and then yet the company is telling us to save cost save cost
what the hell right
ya because the fare <malay>pun</malay> if you take the lowest you cannot claim mileage
so you have to take either the mid range but maybe you can only (uh) get like fifty percent of the mileage
but if let's say you take the highest one the one that (uh) got no rule [ah] <malay>macam</malay>
very flexible [one] [ah] that one you will get hundred percent of the mileage
yes <malay>lepas tu</malay> the company is telling us to save cost
so of course we have to choose the lowest right and then when it comes to changes <malay>dia bising</malay>
I always get like you see [lah] you you keep on telling us to get the cheapest one the cheapest one then in the end
we when we change it become more expensive like hello it's not my job you know you company is telling is your company's direction
<malay>susah</malay> [seh] but you never know what sometimes [ah] last minute changes or last minute <malay>nak kena pergi sana pergi sini</malay>
but some of the traveller I will tell them I say no no no your boss better don't <malay>ini</malay>
otherwise right if you want to sell this type of ticket [ah] you must tell them this one [ah] if you change right is so much so much already so you better
you better think first before we do the changes before we proceed to book or issue the ticket
remember that time <malay>yang kau punya si</malay> ex
then in the end what happen
<malay>terbalik</malay> right
but how much was the ticket
and then how you explain to your boss
but how much how much was the ticket
okay [lah] not that much [ah]
ya because usually the cheapest one then you cannot no refund no nothing everything cannot right
of course it's the chance for airlines to just freely get four hundred dollars and nobody is travelling they can sell back the seat to the public
why not
no but but how come you book you don't book all three together
!aiya! for actually for them [ah] definitely they want to they will <malay>apa ni</malay> push push to somebody [what]
even if it's their fault also they will just push to somebody cause but then you cannot [lah] because this is obviously your mistake
for us [ah] the reason is always like that we already send to you the email why you never check and then now you want to say that we did it wrongly
when actually it's
obviously it's our fault [lah] because by right whatever that they give us we have to counter check and make sure that everything is alright [what] how can we just you know
book <malay>lepas tu tak</malay> check and then just give
but it's actually very scary [ah] especially if
luckily he is a nice person can you imagine if he's the demanding one like no I want to fly now
I don't care what flight you get for me blah blah blah blah blah blah
so that means you actually buy him a new ticket
<malay>baru dia cakap</malay> don't don't repeat the same mistake
<malay>ni apa</malay> flight actually you take
and then the new flight that you take for him
ya
no I think it's expensive <malay>pasal</malay> [ah] it's either a different airline or you buy a one way ticket
but he's from which airport
it's either #ho chin minh# or #hanoi#
actually #ho chin minh# <malay>ada banyak</malay> flight <malay>apa</malay> vietnam air I think at least got three or four flight
so in the end I think you must have booked him on [lah] because only these two fly direct [what]
other than that <malay>ada</malay> budget airlines
ya
ya [lah] very scary especially the hotel bit
of course it's not funny [lah] you crazy <malay>macam</malay> I can imagine you don't have anything down there and then here he call you and you are laughing away
of course he's also angry right that's why I say luckily he didn't jump and you know scold you on the spot
actually you shouldn't divide like that you should do the flight and then one person do the flight one person do the hotel
<malay>tak</malay> messy <malay>sangat pasal</malay> [kan] if you were to do like that [ah] <malay>macam</malay> like
you do this batch I do this batch [ah] it's quite difficult
or maybe what you can do is what you should do is
<malay>macam</malay> departure for saturday I do then departure for monday you do both hotel and flight
so it's by by departure date [tau] <malay>dia bukan macam</malay>
you know if you have always if you have a group of people travelling [ah] it's very messy so you have to see <malay>macam</malay>
if you want to divide the job right so you based on the departure date [lah] so at least [eh]
<malay>aku cuma ambil yang</malay> departure on the saturday
which is more urgent and then you take the one departure departing on monday which is less urgent and you got more time to check
wait wait wait so that means [ah] the person that you cock up is your team or
<malay>tak pasal</malay> the different website got different allotment why sometimes [ah] like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] agoda they got ten ten room
the hotel sell to them ten room and then booking dot com maybe the hotel sell fifteen rooms
so that's why if you go agoda all the ten rooms are booked <malay>tapi bila</malay> you go to booking dot com maybe they are still five rooms available
so it depends on how much how many rooms the website want to buy from the hotel [lah]
<malay>tapi</malay> actually if you want to play safe right for for this type of group or what you should just contact the hotel directly
you tell them that you have a group of more than ten people then see negotiate the pay rate [ah]
maybe you should have gotten the hang of it of it already [what]
<malay>tapi</malay> okay [ah] because okay [lah] <malay>macam</malay> let's say it's individual booking
you can always book (um) through
all these third party from the website [lah] no problem it's just that we can group is a bit is going to be a bit messy so maybe you just have to organise
and when it comes to hotel because sometimes [ah] hotel themselves even though they give (uh) they sell their rooms to all these third party
I'm sure they have their own <malay>bilik</malay> [tau]
yes they have to they have to keep a few rooms available in case if people walk-in [what]
then they will sell it at a higher rate of course [lah] right
so if let's say you have a group of at least more than ten even five people [ah]
you can also tell them you you have five people coming in on this date
so what is the best price that you can give that's what we always do also
okay if let's say you have like long stay
people staying like a week or ten days at least [ah] you also can call them and you tell them okay I have this one [ah] family who wants to stay for ten days
so what is your best rate
ya you can just call them don't go to the third party first because (uh) booking from third party [ah] I know it's quite difficult
because you have to do one by one one by one right
ya
actually the best if you call the hotel like they will organize everything we just say okay saturday departure I have five and then maybe monday
monday (uh) sorry saturday arrival I have five pax
and then monday arrival I have another ten pax
<malay>nanti</malay> they will expect they will know that there's a group booking they are expecting you <malay>tak</malay> from this company this company [ah] so it's easier
then how
I think it's china #hong kong# <malay>tak payah</malay> visa
but #hong kong# passport don't need visa [what]
I know vietnam visa is very expensive
you can it can cost about four hundred to six hundred dollars
<malay>tapi kalau</malay> china visa [ah]
[ah] <malay>apa tu</malay> passport I think it's about three hundred dollars
no but usually visa upon arrival [lah] always (uh) tourist
so probably this time round when he go he at airport where they ask him what is your purpose of travel he say business
that's why he cannot
they don't allow him to go
I guess when you arrange for travel you just have to
most importantly is the visa
especially those people holding like indian passport indonesia china
[ah] you can still it depends [ah] <malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> if they are travelling around asia pac [ah] you definitely have to check they will definitely need business visa
<malay>cuma kalau dia</malay> declare as tourists then they don't need
(mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> tourist also you don't declare as tourist then you wear your jacket smart smart tie all go of course they don't believe you [lah]
but luckily <malay>tak payah</malay> I mean they don't have to is a paper visa you don't have to stamp it on the passport
otherwise you will waste one day
<malay>aku rasa kalau tu baru lagi dia</malay> jump
they he will not be chilling he will be like screaming at you
he he must have hated the person so much or it's just
it's just the you know <malay>dia punya</malay> screw <malay>dia terpleot</malay>
he's like telling the camera person to just F off
but he's like one of the bosses or no
ya
I mean don't judge a book by it's cover <malay>tapi</malay>
I think people everybody have their evil side
sometimes [ah] you just
can you imagine [ah] if you are working with all these fun people then suddenly one day the company just go bust
everybody have to go your separate way sad right
but then [ah] I mean like for your case also it's quite difficult
the company is like neither here nor there <malay>kalau kau</malay> apply for a job and let's say you get a job
so are you going to take it or you just want to stay with the company you know
I mean like if you move on you have start all over again
but if you stay on you don't know what is your future going to be like
I think this company (uh) based right
[oh]
<malay>susah</malay> [lah]
so I guess I think everybody also scared it's better to have a second job
well maybe if you see that probably all the linkedin <malay>punya tu</malay> is under recruitment agency no harm just go [lah] anyway they just want to collect data [what]
ya
I mean if it comes up then you see the situation your company
if it's not getting any better then you just grab the opportunity [ah] anyway if you go interview also doesn't mean that you get it !duh!
ya just put out your resume first [ah]
(mm)

it's all guy on guy crime that's one
then it's all on the N it's all in you know then (err)
and this is not the and I mean there's been one or two cases right very very recently that they just brought up

then (err) but this wasn't new you know because like say about a year
about a year ago right about a year a year two years ago [ah]
because I sleep in school

most of the it's
it's always guy on guy it's guy <malay>macam</malay> there's a recent rise right on guy on guy crime
and some more it's in you know how embarrassing
no [lah] but
no [lah] but it it it you know it just it just happens right that I'm also schooling in you know shit
so <malay>macam</malay> it it it kind of pisses me off [ah]
no
but then again but but then again but then again
(err) most of the
(err) most of the incidents takes (err) take place in [ah]
hostel <malay>punya</malay> the hostel environment [ah]
whereas the places where I
patron right (err)
the toilets where I go to [ah] they are more like
public access whereas the
hostel ones right they (uh) most of them
ya most of the incidents happen at hostel <malay>punya</malay> area do you know that do you know that
(err) some of these hostels right they some from what I from my knowledge [ah]
I'm not too sure about this [lah] I can't confirm but
there are some right where
(err)
I think this [one] also depends on the price of your accommodation [ah]
like some is you only get a room only the toilet is shared
there's only like one toilet on one floor
for you to enter you have to there's everybody has a key
everybody has a key then you have to open the thing there was one time after an exam
I really really really needed to take a
I really really needed to take to take a piss <malay>nak cepat-cepat kencing</malay> and it really cannot <malay>tahan punya</malay>
so
(err)
we wanted to use the complex <malay>punya</malay> toilet right but there was so many people
and then a lot of people were still there so <malay>macam</malay> we like
cannot already
so me and my friends we actually went over
knock on the knock on some random person's door and then tell them
bro bro bro bro bro <malay>aku nak pakai</malay> toilet bro bro bro then he was a malay guy he was like okay okay okay <malay>kau tunggu kejap kau tunggu kejap</malay> so he actually
so the guy actually (err) took I still remember you (err) he had the
<malay>kunci</malay> he had the key inside (err) he had the key on the rubber band [ah] then he like
quickly rushed with us you know to the toilet then open then I I entered [ah] so that was the
first and probably the last time right I entered a
(err)
you know that like single floor toilet [ah]
it's just a
it commune toilet [ah] communal toilet [ah] that's all only which I can
I can see why right I can see I can probably tell you why [lah] people
(err) those #pervs# right they are more inclined to
to to do this kind of nonsense [ah]
in a sense yes last time (err) in a sense yes last time <malay>abang abang</malay> #han# [ah] he's the one who told me
he was the one who told me [kan] <malay>yang</malay>
(um) there
for you to do that there's only two ways one is you have a
second if you don't have a you need to (uh) (err)
you need to involve yourself in hall activities
but
that's lame [ah] (err) that's lame [lah] (uh) I
I for one right can tell them to <malay>kirim salam</malay> [lah]
then (uh) I'll probably tell them to <malay>kirim salam</malay> (uh) but
a friend of mine who I used to serve with when I was in wallaby
he told me right that that's that used to be the case but it's no longer but currently it's no longer the case already like
(uh) for them right they're just willing to rent out the accommodation to you [ah]
that's it only there's no need for you to like
you know and then sweat your punk ass
and then (err) like or hall activities [ah] like
!yay! sixers or whatever
so lame
it's quite it's quite cringey [ah] it's quite cringey like
there was one there was one time (err)
(err) they had like
a orientation week orientation week
it's always the week before the semester starts [ah]
so they had I swear to you [ah] it was really cringey
(err) they had those like (err) orientation games [ah] then
they printed out shirts and everything so it was a game of thrones theme
so they (uh) like what I saw like a bunch of guys in a bunch of guys and girls right they were all
wearing the same thing blue T-shirt then it was like starks and then like
running away from a group of red people in red right who were like gangsters so to me right that's a bit cringey [lah]
who the hell is running man

I don't know [lah] you kids these days right <malay>korang anak-anak zaman sekarang</malay> [lah] <malay>aku tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>apa nak cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>kau orang</malay>

that ethics of becoming an Instagram model
is there anything ethical is is there an ethical aspect right to being an Instagram model
because Instagram after all right is just a page where you put photos
I mean ultimately ultimately right when it when it boils down to the you know like
common denominator type thing [ah]
it's just a web page it's just a page where you see photos
so is there and ethical ground right behind being an a model on Instagram
like what what constitutes ethics [ah] in
Instagram modelling like what you you have to

she
she kind of like jams
jams YouTube with her shit [ah]
like I I don't want I don't want to watch this this is this is
this doesn't do anything for me

male (err) like these YouTube celebrities right that's why or like #ridhwan# right because <malay>macam</malay> I don't see any of the things that they do right <malay>macam</malay>
applicable to my life useful in useful useful in my life right or <malay>macam</malay> I don't see them possessing any characteristics right which I as a man right can look up to and respect [ah]

(err) I don't see them as as men right I don't see them as masculine
I'm I'm not buff you know I'm I'm incredibly fat but in all honesty I think that I'm more mescaline than they are
although the (err) <malay>macam</malay> at fate
on the exterior right I think that I'm
manlier than I'm manlier than they are then <malay>macam</malay> like
what skills that what skills right do they possess right that

I don't know [ah] <malay>dia macam</malay>
I think <malay>dia dah</malay> gonna get
engaged [eh] <malay>ke kahwin tak tahu</malay> [lah] cause <malay>dia</malay> I don't know <malay>aku selalu nampak dia</malay> on Instagram <malay>dengan</malay> this one indo girl
ya I know she's not local [lah] cause
in the video I think I got hear before <malay>dia berbual</malay> indo <malay>macam</malay> indo <malay>punya</malay> kind
so that time <malay>dia dengan</malay> dorothy together
and then <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram is still <malay>dia dengan perempuan tu</malay>
I don't know [eh] but dorothy <malay>punya</malay> Instagram is different dorothy <malay>dengan dia</malay>
so I don't know [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
what kind of three way <malay>ke apa binatang</malay> it's called is going on with them it's just damn weird <malay>pelik</malay> also
then that time <malay>yang aku pergi tengok</malay> thai <malay>punya</malay> performance <malay>kat</malay> monti
then <malay>kita</malay> invite #rumi# also [lah] cause #rumi# <malay>cakap dia nak tengok</malay> like (um) drag performance those <malay>nya</malay> kind
and then <malay>banyak-banyak</malay> then
<malay>tertiba dia macam tak ada</malay> girlfriend
<malay>dia dia cakap dia</malay> single cause
know thai <malay>punya</malay> friends those gay friends keep asking [ah] like <malay>apa tu</malay> [oh] [ah] where's your girlfriend and stuff no girlfriend you single or what <malay>dorang macam nak menggatal</malay> [kan] then <malay>macam</malay> like
[oh] no [lah] I'm single and some more <malay>dia tengah</malay> in <malay>ke apa</malay>

and then just damn <malay>pelik</malay> [ah] [sia] and he host around with anything that moves
<malay>aku pun tak tahu aku</malay> just don't know [lah]
but I know #zul# <malay>tak</malay> comfortable <malay>dengan</malay> #rumi# also
they been friends for damn long [ah] but
#zul# <malay>pun</malay> petty <malay>nak mampus kau tahu dia cakap</malay> like I don't want to talk to #rumi# cause he never wish me happy birthday
<malay>macam apa kau merepek</malay> [eh]
ya apparently then <malay>aku macam</malay>
girl <malay>kalau aku lupa nak</malay> wish <malay>kau macam mana</malay> [eh] how [ah] and was like I probably won't talk to you [ah]
I <malay>tak faham</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> just <malay>tak faham</malay> I think
justin also quite petty when it comes to birthday <malay>dia macam</malay> like <malay>dia cakap</malay> birthday is important [what] it's once a year what so hard
what's so hard about (um) wishing some happy birthday
then <malay>aku cakap</malay> like if you're not
in good terms with that person why you expecting that person to wish
it doesn't make sense wouldn't you be more boiled up then
than happy
[ah] <malay>aku tak faham</malay> [ah]
but #zul# know I know #zul# (um) <malay>tak</malay> comfortable cause of <malay>tu</malay> [ah]
<malay>apa tu namanya</malay>
(um) #rumi# I think #rumi# <malay>macam menggatal dengan dia</malay> also
(mm)
yes
unfortunately for his case [lah] but I think that time #zul# was with dylan <malay>dengan mata air dia</malay> [ah]
ya and then <malay>dia cakap</malay> like #rumi# [eh] #rumi# uncomfortable and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I know we are all closed <malay>kita</malay> very touchy also cause we hug a lot <malay>ni semua</malay> then
<malay>dia cakap</malay> #rumi# #rumi# does that [ah] but #rumi# <malay>macam</malay>
kind of
give the weird weird vibe
(mm)
you know when it's not touchy cause you are naturally touchy but
it's <malay>kau</malay>
<malay>nak menggatal</malay>
<malay>macam gitu</malay> [jer] [ah]
but #rumi# I've always seen as that way cause first time <malay>aku jumpa dia pun macam gitu</malay>
but first night is cool cause
<malay>kita semua minum</malay> [pe] together at sticky fingers
(ugh)
yes boss
(um) ya
but I like to see <malay>dia punya</malay> Instagram cause <malay>dia selalu pergi merayap makan</malay> and he eats good food

petition for <malay>apa</malay> [eh]
of course [lah] <malay>dia nak</malay> standardise <malay>dia nya</malay> family

two of her oldest sisters there
<malay>ada dua satu ambil gambar satu diri dengan mak dia</malay>
#mairah# was with us

all youngest cause #tahir# youngest <malay>aku</malay> youngest <malay>kau</malay> youngest so we thought she also youngest she don't give off the slightly older sister vibe
but she she is one
but ya got see the two sisters [lah] there
cause the mum <malay>tanya apa</malay> like [ah] this [one] can trust or not go overseas this [one] how old already twenty nine twenty three we are turning twenty two

it's too much already [eh] now <malay>banyak</malay> [sia] <malay>kawan aku dah</malay> post <malay>macam</malay> like
(um) much needed [eh] <malay>apa tu</malay> much misses holiday either #bali# [lah] #patong# beach [lah] all those
<malay>aku</malay> was there like
my last trip was #langkawi#
is it
I was only nineteen [ah] as in like flight flight kind
okay that's it for now

so
mama
so mama you already you know right that <malay>kakak</malay> [kan] <malay>suka makan ayam goreng</malay> right and then lately <malay>kakak macam makan</malay> popeyes <malay>sebab</malay> I think popeyes <malay>punya ayam goreng</malay> is way nicer than what do you think
but I think
popeyes <malay>punya ayam</malay> is more crunchy [eh] I think it's like it's not
I don't know but I think it's more crunchy then it's not that oily compared to and then ya the mashed potato popeye <malay>punya</malay> like <malay>lebih sedap</malay>
and then compared to <malay>punya tak sedap langsung</malay> I mean like it's it's it's nice
one is nice but
(err) the popeyes' one has a lot more things in it compared to is just like mashed potato and the gravy but popeyes is like gravy mashed potato then got like the vegetables and everything
ya
(mm)
[oh] ya you know (err) starbucks right now cause (err) christmas
starbucks right now it's christmas right so
(err) they got the toffee nut
crunch latte and then they got these new other flavours also like really want to try before because that time so many times I want to try never get to try the starbucks one before but ya
(err) but they say it's quite sweet because my friend
allowed me to like taste some of hers then it's was like okay [lah] quite sweet but actually quite nice also
and then they got the one at they sell the packet [one] also
feel like buying it because you know like home
like
I be my own barista at home right because of (err) coronavirus and everything
so ya do you want to try it with me
I want I don't know I want like I want what's that called the turkey with the cranberry sauce
I don't know why but I think because I watch
so many videos of people like preparing christmas
dinners thanksgiving dinners then I'm like I keep on wanting it and also want my
what's that called [ah] gingerbread cookie because
<malay>lagi-lagi</malay> like right now melvados is so nearby right so it's really easy to get the the so-called the gingerbread cookies and all the christmas stuff
and then [oh] christmas cake the log cake everything ya I also want that one
ya
ya that's why
and then
like right now also I think you know I got my performance right then everybody want to celebrate also very hard because
(um) because of the coronavirus the maximum group of five thing and all
which is okay [lah] but at the same time quite sad especially when it's around this time of the year when it's like christmas and then everyone to
everyone want to throw like chalet or like meet up to gather together
but then you still have to wear your mask <malay>macam susah</malay> and then it's also <malay>tak</malay> fun <malay>langsung sebab</malay>
you cannot meet your friend
ya
[oh] ya they got the hundred dollar fees the hundred dollars
tourism voucher right and then like
that one I searched up they say you can use for dining also in certain places then but the problem right now is that a lot of people <malay>macam</malay> complain
<malay>dia susah</malay> to <malay>dapat</malay> the vouchers <malay>sebab ada berapa banyak</malay> website you have to go like you have a lot choices to choose then website <malay>tu</malay> then in the process <malay>semua pun macam</malay> very <malay>sulit</malay> and very complicated so
ya and then you can only redeem it I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> first of december
and then starting to starting on monday also got the mask
can take our masks also I don't know if you know
ya
I don't know [eh] I think so like I saw at <malay>kita punya</malay> void deck they put the poster everything then they say (um) start date thirtieth this monday [lah] thirtieth november until like
two weeks later
ya and it's very dirty and like very uncomfortable already cause the metal keep like the metal thing at the nose is like twisted and bent already
haven't yet haven't yet school holidays still got school
ya
like usual [lah]
ya
I also don't know we all don't know yet
[oh] I don't know I see first how cause we also don't know what we want to do with the vouchers cause in case we got any celebration or what
then (uh)
the mask
ya the mask I never put in the washing machine but it because keep on using and then keep on washing then like when you dump in your bag when you take it off or like when you want to eat all these are very hard
very uncomfortable already and very dirty already like you can see the before and after got ya got before is white clean <malay>kemas</malay> and then the after is yellow very dirty then <malay>macam macam asyik lunyai</malay> and everything so ya
the one that I painted all cannot use because the paint smell very strong then if I tried I tried wearing it but then
like he did like that
ya
ya cannot
ya even after washing cannot wear cause it's very (err) smelly and all
ya the paint is not the paint I think and the material also because the paint is acrylic paint it's not fabric paint then the material like I told you it's very thin also so I think that's like those two are like the contributing factors to why the mask <malay>tak boleh dipakai</malay> so ya
but fabric painting the problem is that <malay>dia punya</malay> paint very faint very thin <malay>macam</malay> acrylic <malay>dia</malay> it's very thick right so it's very easy to get the colour everything but fabric paint one is that it's very thin so it's very it's basically water but with (err) like a bit more <malay>macam</malay> like you add flour to it right then you add a bit of food colouring like that then secondly fabric paint like if I buy like waste of money like that because I only use it for the mask and then like I won't buy small bottles also like we need to get good quality fabric paint to last [mah] so that's the problem then it's not like I just want to try then I look at the mask also I feel like wearing so like
very <malay>rugi</malay> because I don't want it to get dirty so ya
so I've been searching up then they all sell like big big bottles [one] but I don't want big bottle I want like small bottle because like if I buy a big bottle there's no point for me because I won't be using it often
and then it like my room already have so many arts supplies so there's no point for me to buy more arts supplies and then put it there and then when I want to clean it up I have to clean everything up again like you saw last time plastic bag <malay>banyak</malay> all my stuff so ya I don't know see how [lor] even if I buy like (um) the big big bottles now I won't buy all colours I just need certain colours but the problem is you know like I love to use a lot of colours for my paintings so ya
ya like that [lor] don't know how see first
I also don't know we see how we have whole month then we have school we also don't know how then ya
no the problem is right now is that we all have like all these extra activities and everything then we because of coronavirus we all don't know like the timetable then the internship preparation everything so it's all over the place and then COVID doesn't help us also like makes it harder for all of us so <malay>tak tahu</malay> [ah] <malay>macam mana</malay>
I don't know see how like if I can get into uni then go into uni [lah] if cannot then see how start working first or what
ya like that [lor] see how don't know how already
cause it's also quite hard [what] poly and very different you know go into then with the whole coronavirus also very hard already
tomorrow got my (err) I got school what so then after that I need to rush my assignments
ya
ya if can by monday if not by tuesday because I need to print it out and then submit by thursday morning then on monday also I got another assignment due so that one I need to clean up also
ya
until six seven
ya
no more already but the normal class is until six seven like that
okay
ya
[meh]
no I don't think I can meet you all because I need to finish all my assignments already then <malay>kalau tak habis</malay> then I will be rushing then <malay>susah</malay> if I rush because
I got like my two thousand word assignment essay and then got my (uh) reflection journal that I have to clean up
finish already the reflection journal finish already but then I have to clean it up and then
for the
essay the two thousand word essay I'm only at like nine hundred words so ya
two thousand
ya
ya
but it's actually very easy just the organisation and the
because we have to cite all our work and everything so that one is a problem but but it's actually quite easy [lah] because I got all my articles already
the reflection is about just like (um)
the reflection is all about like emotional intelligence cause of my elective and then like the essays about like kids and then their development and everything so ya
no still have
ya I still have my religious school until next year
no it's not finish end of this year semester ends mid year [what]
ya
I think so [ah] that one also not so sure you have to check with the <malay>ustazah</malay> again
no
ya
ya the water sports sounds fun [ah] but I also don't know because holiday a lot of people but then we got the hundred dollars also I very scared it's very packed so <malay>tak tahu macam mana</malay>
until june two thousand and twenty is <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> the expiration date for the hundred dollar voucher
ya
I also don't know see what have [lah] what you cook or what's in the house
and then just eat whatever there is I think tomorrow will like
I don't think I'll be eating a lot also cause I need to rush my assignment like I maybe just eat lunch then try to finish everything by tomorrow
even tonight later after this I have to
do my assignment I have to find some articles because we have group work and then monday we need to think what to do before class
no school you go to school no but during the break time we meet instead to do the work
ya but like the school website the school library all then we have to find the articles
then after that we have to discuss on what we want to do everything because it's due in two weeks time but my classmate is like the very
(um) chop chop type of person ya you know so <malay>kena</malay> we all <malay>nak buat macam cepat-cepat</malay> because he also wants to do it very fast because his idea is that if we do fast then <malay>dapat rehat cepat</malay> so ya
ya
ya
I think you can ask #adi# if he want to go market with you if he not working because I cannot go I got <malay>madrasah</malay> tomorrow
no [eh] no preference
I think like a lot I think maybe just like your finger food like nuggets or like hotdog <malay>goreng</malay> or like fishball like that
the <malay>epok-epok</malay> also just now (err) <malay>orang sebelah kasih</malay> also like very nice also
I never get to try the sardine I wanted to try the sardine but apparently they make sardine and the potato one
but the <malay>epok-epok</malay> like very oily also like it's very crunchy and very <malay>garing</malay>
but it's also like very oily the moment you eat it you will know they fry instead of what you usually do which is
(um)
bake it
[oh]
I think like the <malay>epok-epok</malay> when I eat it kind of remind me a bit of the potato one reminded me of of like old #chang kee# [one] cause it's like
(err) taste a bit like it but I feel like this one was more filling and was like more satisfying to eat <malay>sebab dia banyak inti</malay> and then <malay>dia pun macam dia pun macam</malay> very crunchy <malay>rangup</malay> like that
the old #chang kee# one is like you know sometimes like it's not crunchy it's just like dough and then like
very oil but this one was like very nice to eat
the doughnut was very sweet like the doughnut was very nice but very sweet I tried the #ondeh-ondeh# and the red velvet one
ya the #ondeh-ondeh# one
but it's like
the #ondeh-ondeh# one was more of like colour it's just that
you can take the #ondeh-ondeh# because the coconut was roasted
other than that it was nothing it was just like green icing with like whipped cream inside the bombom
the coconut was (uh) on top of the bombom just for decoration purposes
but it was like very little but got flavour [lah] and then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap macam rasa macam</malay> those #ondeh-ondeh# cake but the problem was that
altogether it's very sweet and then maybe because I ate the red velvet before that then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>manis</malay> and everything then I cannot <malay>tahan</malay> also
ya
the <malay>apam</malay> I ate and
I eat one and I think there's one more right now in the kitchen
[oh] then I don't know cause the <malay>apam</malay> was actually supposed to be one for me and one for <malay>adik</malay> but I think I know I ate it but I don't know if <malay>adik</malay> ate it cause he was very full very full after eating the #bhatoora#
I thought there's like a brown the brown plastic
on the kitchen stove I thought that was the <malay>apam</malay>
ya I mean ya I also don't know
ya but then the potato from just now morning still have inside the fridge so like
if you want eat the #briyani# with the potato also can
and then the the <malay>kuah</malay> from the #bhatoora# also still have
in the kitchen so ya
ya but the #bhatoora# like in the morning eat very nice [ah] but also like really oily
I think they like I ya they deep fried or something
but then the chickpea also very oily like when you want to <malay>tuang</malay> it's on the #bhatoora#
the oil all come out first then the chickpeas but I don't know but the chickpeas also very nice cause it's like spicy a bit like
[ah] got sour sour taste a bit
ya that one but I think
and you know when I was eating the chickpeas I thought like [oh] maybe can make hummus then we eat with we brought hummus then we eat with like the tortilla bread or something also very nice
maybe cause your chickpeas from india or something not the singapore chickpeas or malaysian ones that's why the chickpeas very big
very juicy also got like very nice taste
we can make like hummus we can make like that time we made a lot right but we can make we can separate into three containers we made the normal one then we make a bit more spicy and then another one like a different flavour or something
so like ya then we can buy like those you know those like tortilla chips or something also eat with the hummus instead of pita bread I think very nice also
ya that's why I was saying [ah] so we divide into three portions then each portion is that each portion is a different flavour
I think I don't know maybe you
wednesday or friday can see first (uh)
and then I don't know why but like when we were talking just now you talked about
doing hummus right <malay>tiba-tiba ingat macam minum teh turki makan</malay> hummus
<malay>macam sedap</malay> [seh]
but turkish tea very hard to make cause they have their own set of tea leaves and they have their own ways of doing it
I so shocked cause I really wanted to drink
cause it's like very nice very sweet very floral but apparently it's very hard to make
[oh] ya #baklava# also very nice #baklava# with like <malay>teh</malay> O <malay>sedap</malay> [seh]
#kunafe# is which one
(mm) I don't think I tried #kunafe# before but I think I've heard about it before
the is something like very pastry and then like it's
they it's just like pastry and then got a bit of nuts on top everything then you got like syrup like that then you pour over
I think
I don't know see first (uh) I think like
[ah] cannot commit to anything right now cause don't know the timetable everything then we also one of our modules also we have to meet with the senior and then we we planned on going out but we don't know when cause right now also the senior not feeling that well
I don't know I I actually want to eat like something like fish and co manhattan or like what's that called the shellout like that also very nice
ya
[oh] ya that
the the charcoal waffle with the earl grey syrup and the dark chocolate ice cream that one was very nice
but I very scared if we go back then later like we have all these expectations then <malay>bila dah nak makan</malay> then <malay>macam rasa dia berbeza</malay> cause <malay>orang lain yang buat</malay>
so ya <malay>macam tak tahu</malay> [ah] like
hopefully if we go back which is all the way at #joo chiat# right like (err) that that place
hopefully like it will taste the same
!huh! #ang mo kio# A&W halal
wait then the jewel one also halal already is it
I thought they say got A&W [oh] no that one is shake shack
[oh] I want the shortcake very nice but the thing is the cream they do it like they spread the cream <malay>macam tak</malay>
ya the whipped cream it's like <malay>macam</malay> it's not like <malay>serasi</malay> in that not not not <malay>serasi</malay> it's like <malay>tak</malay> equal like that <malay>bila dia</malay> spread if you see but the strawberries everything very fresh also
ya the strawberry shortcake was small but the thing is it's small but very filling and then the strawberries also like on top a lot and then like in between the cake the sponge cage there's also a lot of strawberries and then it's all very fresh not the like freeze dried strawberry type
I think the #satay# when you eat it really warm and it was very nice because it's like got the charcoal taste and then got the <malay>lemak</malay> and then you know the #satay# <malay>punya minyak</malay> [ah] like that right and then you eat with the <malay>lontong</malay> the <malay>bawang timun</malay> everything then you <malay>cecah</malay> in the <malay>kuah</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay> and then <malay>macam</malay>
ya the <malay>babat</malay> I thought the <malay>babat</malay> #satay# I wouldn't like but when I ate it <malay>bila masih panas</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap gila</malay> then <malay>macam tapi bila dah sejuk tu macam susah nak makan</malay>
I think the I don't know for me was the <malay>nasi</malay> was nothing special it was like <malay>nasi minyak</malay> like that
and then like the I think like overall it was really nice [ah] but the they have the like the <malay>sambal</malay> not the <malay>sambal</malay> but like the chilli
chilli oil like that right I expected it to be spicy but not spicy then you eat the green chilli <malay>makan dengan</malay> green chilli <malay>gitu</malay> with the <malay>nasi macam tak pedas setakat macam</malay> crunchy crunchy <malay>gitu</malay>
but the <malay>daging</malay> very nice <malay>macam makan gitu macam sendiri</malay> because it's very easily peel off then <malay>macam</malay> very <malay>sedap</malay>
and then <malay>macam</malay> the <malay>minyak</malay> right I was thinking if like if <malay>kalau kat rumah sendiri</malay> right the <malay>nasi</malay> you put in the <malay>minyak</malay> then you <malay>panaskan</malay> you <malay>buang</malay> you <malay>buat macam nasi goreng</malay> like that
ya but I think I like it [ah] cause
I I was like in the mood for like just not
not a lot of flavour but like just the <malay>daging</malay> taste with a bit of salt and like chilli like raw chilli <malay>makan tepi gitu</malay>
but the sad thing is the vegetables <malay>dia orang tak kasih banyak sikit</malay> [jer] the lettuce and everything ya
<malay>sebab</malay> if I have a lot then <malay>macam makan pun macam tak segan</malay> right then can put and wrap everything nicely
ya
ya
I've been wanting to eat that also like I think maybe buy seaweed and then <malay>nasi</malay> then we still have a bit of the <malay>serunding</malay> right
and (uh)
ya I saw then I was like thinking maybe I don't I don't think seaweed and <malay>serunding</malay> will taste nice so I think <malay>macam beli</malay> lettuce <malay>atau</malay> cabbage <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] <malay>serunding</malay> and then <malay>buat macam</malay> wrap wrap <malay>gitu</malay> then <malay>sambal belacan</malay> and then a bit of <malay>macam daging ke apa dah tu bawang putih bawang bawang besar gitu letak letak</malay>
<malay>kat dalam makan</malay>
but chicken on christmas like
japanese cheaper you know japanese people
ya japanese people you know (err) during christmas they don't eat turkey or what you know they go for you know even their right the each chicken bucket right they have a christmas special you know
no [eh] I don't think so then we also want to do like me and my friends we also very broke already so <malay>nak beli barang tu semua</malay> but maybe we all like
<malay>keluar keluar</malay> to cause <malay>hari ni</malay> is
(uh) naomi's birthday and then like we all thought <malay>macam</malay>
(uh) <malay>kita pun terlupa</malay> then it's like [oh] then we just okay [lah] december we can go out because by then everyone should be free because right now it's exam period for a lot of people
so
ya
ya during december then (err) I also meeting like some of my (err) like
(err) #kailey# and #ayumi# the couple that I tell you about right then I am meeting them so like <malay>macam</malay>
to cause like <malay>dah lama nak jumpa tapi kita punya</malay> timetable <malay>semua</malay> very busy right so <malay>nak jumpa</malay> and then <malay>macam makan sama-sama</malay> or something then that time I told you me and #ayumi# we eat this very nice ice cream at paragon right <malay>dia belanja</malay> because she got the voucher then we thought of like maybe we go eat the ice cream or what [ah] see how
I want (uh) we cannot go cause the person not feeling well but ya then see how [lah] because we waiting for another week to see if she okay or not then if we can go we can go if cannot then we need to find another person to go to then I cannot talk a lot about it also like even with you because it's like
personal private thing
but we all my group all very stressed [ah] because like we all thought like (err) we all planned already and then like that night last minute (uh) that night last minute got that text that cannot go and we already missed out on two sessions then we have to a certain activity with her [mah] but don't know how [lah] see how
no we waited for her to see how if you okay or not then if you are okay then we continue if not need find another person cause we skipped two sessions already and then if this week she cannot then three sessions skipped <malay>kena</malay> find <malay>orang baru</malay> [ah] don't know how see first
I think you should order the strawberry shortcake because first is halal secondly the strawberry shortcake there I think it's like
bet the person bought <malay>lebih sedap daripada</malay> you <malay>beli</malay> because like really like the strawberries and everything are really fresh and then <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>tak was-was</malay> also <malay>nak makan</malay>
so ya then <malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>beli besar pun</malay> like knowing you you know like you <malay>makan</malay> one slice then you can <malay>simpan</malay> if not you just buy the five hundred grams keep some for yourself like that
ya but the thing is right that cake everyone was forcing to finish it also cause everybody was like and ya and then cause the cake was whipped cream it's not chocolate or what it's like whipped cream then we also had that apple strudel [oh] the apple strudel was so nice
strudel strudel shop still have but not at #jurong# point anymore I only eat the
chocolate one the chocolate one very nice very like <malay>lemak manis</malay> everything I never try the mango one but I tried like a bit [lah] because I also cleaning up right then I tried a bit but not bad also but the chocolate one !wah! very nice I <malay>rugi</malay> they never buy the apple flavour
she she also a bit hard right now because like she also on like diet and everything then she not eating a lot of things also or she like controlling herself
if not then go eat at <malay>hajjah maimunah</malay> or something <malay>sana</malay> [kan] <malay>sedap</malay> and then like
you guys can eat #bingsu# or like eat at the cafe like the ice-cream waffle I can tell you the place that I eat ice-cream waffle with my friend because that one also not bad
it's <malay>besar</malay> so <malay>dua orang makan kenyang</malay>
ya and then the environment also very cosy for both of you to talk to one another
if she eat the turkish food you can bring her to that restaurant that day if she eat [lah] but I doubt so she will eat because the
turkish food is either very oily or very sweet then she doesn't like both things [what]
buy for her exercise pants
buy for her exercise pants and sports bra
if not if not just go out with her go to a cafe and then like <malay>belanja</malay> her drinks or that one because she usually drink coffee like flat white she doesn't drink like sweet drinks anymore
and she is nowadays more of a coffee person
dessert also that time went out with her she doesn't eat a lot like she only eat one or two bites then she expected me to finish but then both of us cannot finish when we ate the ice cream waffle because it was very it was very nice but we were very full after our lunch
if not then like go to
like maybe if not just go to a cafe and then buy finger food like
fries or something like that we saw and then like
buy like one or two finger food and then dessert and then like a drink and then that's all
if not just go for dessert or like tea break like that something like that
ya
then not worth it [seh]
if not
if not go dessert tea break or you can go like those if you really want like <malay>macam</malay> treat her very nicely then you can go to those restaurants or
got few restaurants offer tea break
but like eat cake and
<malay>minum teh</malay> like that or like TWG got like the two set the two people set
ya so you <malay>boleh makan kat situ macam</malay> tea break I don't know if you remember but they got this tea break thing where <malay>macam dia orang makan</malay> [ah] you pay for two people and then you can eat all the treats you want and the tea you can choose from TWG
then
that time also
(uh) my friends they they went on a date right then she shared with me they also did the (uh) tea break thing and then they also eat she say very nice cause it's a lot of floral fruity fruity tea then the tea also <malay>dia minum macam sedap</malay>
then she say it's actually quite affordable so it's expensive [lah] but in terms of like the quality and the atmosphere she say was very nice if <malay>betul-betul nak lepak-lepak makan-makan</malay> catch up with one another
no that one is
another one I don't really remember but I can ask her
cause like the one that I do my painting right the one that I said like <malay>buka</malay> the community painting that one they also offer
like tea break session but I think <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> it's
about
either
plus minus ten dollars from hundred dollar so I think like hundred thin or below hundred
but it's also very nice because the
the desserts all like really nicely <malay>macam betul-betul sedap-sedap</malay> they got assortments <malay>macam</malay> like small little kids everything then the tea the atmosphere at the place is also very comfortable
certain places only like I searched up only certain hotels they will accept the voucher and then only certain timings and all so you have to really search up on how to use right cause right now a lot of people complain <malay>macam susah nak pakai</malay> voucher <malay>ni sebab</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> really <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> you <malay>tak tahu</malay> hotel <malay>mana</malay> accept hotel <malay>mana tak</malay>
but ya like that one also I wanted to tell you certain hotels they will accept the hundred dollar voucher
ya so from what I remember is that you cannot join the voucher you can only use it like one person one person but you can meet in the same place you cannot use it together
or you can like use hundred dollars but you can pay for four people [lah] but you cannot like (err) four hundred dollars
ya
I think
(err) if not you can go #bugis# like the #bugis# #haji# area that one confirm got a lot
very nice one if you the lavender area the lavender to #bugis# street there right that one that time I went out with my friends a lot of cafe and it's (err) like it's like affordable (uh) not bad quality also really nice atmosphere also really nice if not
like the one that my friends told me at somerset ion there that that area around there got a lot a few cafes also which is below hundred dollars you can go for
and then
(err) ya and then if not you can go to the that time the #joo chiat#
#changi# area
the ya then <malay>macam</malay> got a few cafes [lah] if not also the
around her area
#choa chu kang# area like that or like
further about there got a lot of really nice cafes also but you need to know how to walk around there because it's quite #ulu# [mah] so ya
ya
that time I went with her at #jurong# east the coffeesmith
we ate also not bad but the price like (uh) the like I bought a medium she bought for me a medium matcha
in fact
not bad [lah] but like not worth it also so it's better if you want
like really get quality and atmosphere wise right it's better for you to just go to like #bugis# or something to <malay>lepak</malay> and <malay>berbual-berbual kat situ</malay> because atmosphere <malay>pun</malay> #shiok# and then <malay>makanan pun</malay> actually really not bad and then nowadays #bugis# area I think got a lot few more cafes and then
that time I <malay>makan</malay> burger with my friend right then I told you that the atmosphere also not bad
ya that one if you want also can eat burger that cause they have like a meal
I want eat the I don't know I want to eat like
christmas log cake not really log cake but I just want the atmosphere back the christmas atmosphere cause party all cannot happen already
ya so only five people like that but ya and then like we want do house party
I think five like I know in school it's still five people
but
to be honest there's no difference whether five to eight people it's still like you still cannot find a seat where you can sit together
because usually almost all the seats are like five five people
[oh] ya cannot refund right
<malay>tapi</malay> if like that <malay>macam susah</malay> because from the look of it <malay>susah nak</malay> travel <malay>sebab pasal</malay> COVID and then I read up they said that <malay>kalau nak</malay> travel <malay>pun sekarang dah ada banyak</malay> measurements like they open borders but you have to go through a lot of things for you to be able to travel overseas
ya the stay home notice right so <malay>macam susah</malay> like waste of time
but I don't know then the fact that they don't refund the airplane tickets but will only bring to next year but <malay>sekarang pun macam</malay> end of year <malay>pun belum lagi</malay> okay everything <malay>macam</malay> we are still <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> in phase two
so <malay>macam</malay> I don't know [ah] quite <malay>susah</malay>
is it the ticket we can go anywhere or certain locations
!huh! if can why not we go europe with their plane ticket
we go #bali#
indonesia
I want eat I want to eat the I really want to eat the indonesian <malay>bakso sedap</malay> [seh] <malay>dengan macam</malay> chilli <malay>sendiri dengan kicap dia gitu kat tepi-tepi</malay> roadside <malay>makan-makan gitu</malay>
<malay>dengan dia orang punya soda gembira</malay> everything and then the atmosphere <malay>orang-orang rokok</malay> everything
I want the <malay>murtabak manis</malay>
[oh] ya this whole year <malay>takde pasar malam</malay> [seh]
I don't think will have
luckily my school has some of the <malay>pasar malam</malay> food like #takoyaki# all and then like cantine all have the <malay>goreng pisang goreng keledek</malay> all so okay [lah] can still <malay>tahan</malay> but the #you zha kueh# burger ramly all !wah! I really miss <malay>keropok lekor</malay>
and then the <malay>susu</malay> honeydew <malay>tu semua macam dengan minum macam air-air dia orang air</malay> sugar cane <malay>dia orang suka</malay> [seh] <malay>tu rindu</malay> [seh]
[oh] I want to go the I want the indian sweet again the pink colour one you know the pink and white one I always eat then I want to buy one of the skirts again
ya but

[ah] ya that time <malay>yang</malay> #deepavali# that one that #adit# left halfway
ya that one that one the mango #lassi# very nice
[oh] ya
why suddenly got a lot of face wash [ah]
[oh]
I suddenly like I go back home right I like shower and then I was like okay and then shower shower I looked at the face wash area I saw like [eh] a lot of face wash then all the face wash was like the brand that
like you see like I never used before right then I was [oh] okay then didn't think about it then I was like [eh] <malay>rezeki sebab</malay> my face wash also <malay>nak dekat habis</malay> then I actually wanted to buy my new face wash then I saw got new face wash already I was like okay [lah] can
two face wash and then one pimple cream and then her perfume and her makeup stuff
but I don't think <malay>adik</malay> will use because <malay>adik</malay> very particular about his face
ya
[oh] ya then the perfume <malay>nenek</malay> give right the <malay>bau</malay> right stay for very long [eh]
ya like I spray like my class nine eight right I spray right until like I spray like on my like on my because I was wearing like inner clothing then I was wearing outer clothing so I spray on the inner clothing on my body also until like
one after <malay>zohor</malay> like one two <malay>masih ada bau dia</malay> like it's very faint but <malay>tapi masih ada bau dia</malay> and then <malay>nenek punya</malay>
the lipstick and <malay>bedak muka</malay> right I <malay>pakai</malay> right !wah! it's like [eh] very nice because the thing is like <malay>bedak muka</malay> I wanted to I was like I I I
like
<malay>bedak muka</malay> I already because like my foundation I needed something to set and then when she gave it to me I was like okay I can use it and then like I used right and then her lipstick I was like [eh] like !wow! okay very nice very like very comfortable [lah] then I was like okay this is like my <malay>nenek</malay>
and then the lipstick colour also because like very
no no no the lipstick colour you know <malay>dulu dulu nenek</malay> has like old photos of her when she go out right then you know that that signature like
(um) like smokey maroon red
it's that type of colour
ya
so
like
then I looked at it right I was like !wah! actually my lipstick colour and my <malay>nenek punya</malay> lipstick colour about the same [ah] because like
I mean like I
I usually the one wearing red lipstick what you always like go for purple or like glosses more then
<malay>nenek</malay> wear lipstick like that so I was like !wah! okay and then when I wore it and then the <malay>bedak muka</malay> [eh] okay
then it's like okay [lah] comfortable [lah] can can
but then I didn't dare to share with my friend because like my friend was like asking can I use then I was like no cannot this one my mum <malay>punya</malay>

and my name is #haziqah#
and I'm twenty five we are ten years apart and we are sisters
want to go first
so what is
by
ya
work is okay [ah] (um) just scanning the and taking temperature in the morning that's about it coronavirus is not going away
I hope the for now it's not that sucks
ya it's on nineteen june now today is what is it today [ah]
ya so two more days before friday !woohoo! and it's a friday night as well
so we don't know if we're gonna go out or just gonna stay home and do just things at home
how long is your
[oh] so you go back to school all the way
!wow! we're moving into phase two I don't know people say it's a bit too soon but I'm not sure if it is and also my friend has started like a group chat on whatsapp asking to meet like right after phase two
this weekend so I don't even know if it's safe to meet them yet cause I've been out in public for awhile now and I don't know if it's safe to meet my friends cause I don't want to put them at risk
[ah] the mask is so hot I can't even it's so bad like the cloth mask the first time that the government gave us was just a cloth mask they say it's breathable and washable reusable everything right but number one it's not breathable number two ya you can wash it it's it's like a garment but like
<malay>adalah kaedah</malay> get in the workers are you get everyday
I don't know it does get stinky after awhile cause I use it everyday so I have to be consistently washing it quite often
wait so you still have physical education during this period
so what do you do if it's not in contact like what kind of sports do you play
interesting
you're using your mask as well right
she made it herself
<malay>kuih suji</malay> is smelly shouldn't be smelly what should be flour you know
[oh] I think I know what you mean it's the very big one
LOL
if you so hungry I think you have to dirty your cloth when it stinks
I think I think that's why people use the the disposable ones cause [ah] number one you can speak clearly can actually hear people cause it's very permeable like it's not even it's not even muffled when you speak then number two is like you can actually breathe because it's permeable you can breathe properly and everything not that I've tried it before but [eh] actually I did try before it's not bad at all
but it feels like you're not wearing anything feels like air which is I think that's why people will consider buying it like a box of it costs twenty five dollars it used to be twenty eight dollars for fifty pieces at and now it's twenty five so it's reduced but ya haven't really see a lot of people buying it
but I'm sure they do I'm sure they stock up as well so just imagine having [eh] a mask everyday I don't know if they change the mask everyday they like they wear like new ones everyday cause I don't think it's (uh) I don't think that it is (uh) economical sustainable and environmentally friendly
ya they even have the children size one I think your face might fit children one more than the big ones or like so awkward cause you are a teenager and you're not like an adult adult per se or you're not a child child so I think in terms of like okay maybe your face shape is more towards like child size cause it's small
ya it might not fit for you
ya that I think that's one of the reasons why I don't use it cause especially for work I have to speak to the customer who's coming in and say like [oh] hello good morning like greet them and then (um) scan their and direct them whether you know they can choose to either scan their or the code right to enter because the safe entry right either way it's still under safe entry which is a government website for contact tracing
so (um) ya it's just a lot more hassle when I have to use the the second mask that they gave us cause it's so muffled and it's just like there's no way I'm going to repeat myself ten thousand times just for them to hear me out like ya
and I think that's why I I I went back to the first mask cause (uh) it's just a lot clearer and less heavy on the face as well cause I think the second one is quite like ya it fit's nicely what but at the same time it's quite like <malay>berat</malay> it's just so heavy and
I I don't know I've never sweat in that before but like [oh] my god it's the worst like I would never I can't even imagine wearing it sweaty like I wouldn't
ya I'm very curious like I have a few friends colleagues [ah] they all wear that disposal mask and I'm just wondering like how often do they actually use that mask
[eh] I don't know [eh] I think they might be just using the mask again and again and again
ya I was contemplating in buying like a new mask so so actually fit's my face nicely and like I don't know just something cause I wear it on a daily basis so it just makes sense for me to get a proper mask at least that that the ones that I'm comfortable with at the minute like the first one that the government give is still
a bit annoying cause I have to fold up the bottom bit cause it's quite long on my face my face quite tiny what not not even long like my face as in my face is not even long so like for me to wear that mask I just need to like fold it up
how what do you mean by you know what did she say
<malay>ada aku kisah</malay>
!wow!
so deep
ya I think ya I think when it comes to girls we have to be not trying to be sexist or anything but I think girls are a lot more dramatic they're they're a lot more sensitive not sensitive in a bad way but it's more of like they are emotionally driven so they do a lot of things out of like
either very difficult emotions to deal with so they lash out or they just kind of like keep it in and keep themselves numb or they just
ya they just throw shade on you and it's not it's not the best sort of like friendship you want to have especially when you're growing up in secondary school and like you wanna build that sort of cause you you sort of rely on your friends quite a bit for that companionship that sort of like drive to want
to do well in school as well cause like you you're not going to school just because of homework or school work or just enjoying some sort of like math lesson or like science or whatever but it's more because of your friends so ya I think choosing your friends are very important as well
very very important that social circle of friends is very important cause it help lift you up in times of like when you're stressed under a lot of pressure especially when you're doing O N level whichever right like they will be the ones that cheer you on cause you are in it together with them so you definitely need that support
I mean especially when it comes to exams ya you can't help to compare but I also think that like you know if you are quite upset about your grades you shouldn't impose them on others it's more of like you know you should be like [eh] well done like you pass maths like I haven't but like I will like I'm inspired by you because you passed maths and I haven't achieved that so I will do that for the next time
or you can just ask say because since you passed maths and I don't right take that as an example [lor] then you can always ask for help like there's no harm in asking for help or like just check with each other like if any of the questions that you actually don't understand and you actually got it right
you know
and I think you know just that peer sort of like support is also very important and I think that is one thing that the school needs to foster that sort of like culture instead of like being very competitive and be like !aww! you got a forty seven [oh] I got a fifty four so like I'm better than you
no I also think it puts like because of the education system here in singapore they put a lot of pressure on (um) students (uh) to get very good grades since since as young as we can remember studying like since nursery to kindergarten and then going on to even before that you might be child care you know
(um) and then you know we are expected because there's examination every per term or like every quarterly of the year then it kind of stresses on like the result very result driven more than like the process of like learning and understanding and why you are doing it rather
so you're only looking for results at the end of the day because that's what exams make you do so ya and I think having to try and unlearn that and re-cultivate sort of like a more healthier relationship with education and knowledge and learning
would be I would say is a challenge for the singapore system because I think we haven't really got it all even though we say we are like the top in the world and all that but you also do see a lot of like setback like you know
very
very troubled minds in terms of like mental health and like the emotional wellbeing of like the students especially kids when you're growing up all you need is like a lot a lot of like emotional support and if you don't get that I think it's very difficult for one of for them to like thrive
and like you're practically studying five days a week from like seven to one seven to two however long it is right three sometimes
ya so it's like a good six hours you know just studying like crazy just intense back to back as well like you don't even have break in between say okay ten minutes break go off the only break that you probably get is like from one class to another you just go and run the toilet and come back and it's also within like five minutes
sometimes you your brain needs to process things and let it like sit for a minute with that knowledge and then move on to the next task so I think even that in itself that transition period between one subject to another right your brain needs to like tackle that quickly and it needs to adapt because it is a daily thing like you kind of force yourself to (um)
ya you just kind of force yourself to have to you know work a certain way according to the system and I think I feel I personally feel this is just my own sort of opinion but like I think that the system doesn't work for you instead you worked for the system
ya because at the end of the day singapore's resources are the people and without the people we are actually nothing ya we are very very well placed on the map because the west can't cross to the east without passing through singapore and that's why our port of harbour is very
it's very well known and also it very efficient because we know if we invest in that heavily heavily invest in that and like make sure it's like top in the world right then a lot of people would come by and make business come by and trade come by and like
ya just import their goods and all that because we are reliable in that way it's all geopolitics [lah] so that is for another day
you see that's another thing right I wanna talk about cause like [eh] you know in education they are so they are so boxed up with just like [oh] english maths science right chinese whatever mother tongue [oh] and like
[oh] and then social studies combined humanities but they never really like ya we got history we got geography but they never really tackle on like the political aspect of it because I think at the end of the day day how systems are made right and how the society works is through the system and the system the way is being done is
the political aspect of it and I think we don't understand as we are growing up we just don't really know our human rights we don't really know like [oh] like what what we can do can we sat can we give feedback to the grassroot organisation you know then you will go to the government that kind of thing or can we not do we just abide to the rules you know there's no sort of like clear
ground saying that like [eh] you know you you have that freedom of speech you can say whatever you want if you feel like say the system not doing for you you can speak up but I think the matter of fact is that like singapore don't have that openness if you will they are not open to the ideas of the people I feel like the system here works
(um) only because the people are kinda like pushing it and not the other way round
ya because you're going through right now right even not even going through right you're on the way there I've already done it and ya it's true that like I do feel pressured because like when I was sixteen I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to go to junior college for obviously with my score and all that like I did try and appeal for no I think I appealed for one of the schools I think it was novena [eh] novena innova innova and obviously didn't get in that's why I went to poly but like
ya I think that's one of the reasons why I strongly strongly just wanted to I was very adamant on just going to rather than (err) poly because I didn't know what I want to do so when I you know when I had no choice but to go into poly then obviously I kinda you know I didn't really had any dreams of being anything for a start right so I just kinda went into [ah] mama's business
because that was the only thing that I've kind of like I've been exposed to and I was quite okay with it and obviously pursued architecture degree so ya but I now even now I'm just thinking like do I actually want to do that in life cause I feel like I kind of sort of shift my priorities and
what I actually am interested in doing cause I am like I know that I am very in tune with like just wanting to help people in general like I think I thrive when people when I when I help them when I help people it in any way possible and I think I just need to find my sort calling I don't even know exactly where
or what I wanna do but it's definitely something to do with people but then again you know I've kinda narrow it down to like teaching because all these years I've been teaching (um) teaching kids and then obviously teaching asylum seekers and refugees after that it just kind of went on from there and like I really really like that open up my political sphere because before that I was very deluded I was just like
ya just living my life you know I'm going to a new country going abroad to study and that's it you know and then don't really need to have any sort of experiences come home every summer and then you know you be back home by three years by the end of three years and then like you know you can get a job decent job decent pay because you already got degree but that's not the case at all even though you got like papers even though you've got
O level N level whatever right you are still stuck in that limbo where [eh] you know even if you get the job say not not that the one that you want but it's sort of like you are qualified for it then it's like but then you're not happy in it do you actually
ya do you actually want to do what you have already set your mind to do say six years ago because that was in poly [what] that's that was when you were seventeen you got in and like you thought ya okay I love I love drawing I love I love and that's what I'm gonna do and then realising that like that's not very not very long lived
ya I'm very inclined to
helping those that are in need ya I know there is different aspects of like or different look or different forms of how poverty can look like in first world countries even it's not just about third world countries like africa or like (um) india or
at any
any colonised (um) sort of land from the western world
because obviously their resources are being stripped from them and like all that's left is the people and the people are living in poverty because the resources are scarce (mmhmm) scares I don't know
ya because of what they did to their land in say if agriculture is their only source of income that way that like you can earn the money but because that is already being abused and violated and you cannot and it takes a long time for like the soil to grow and re-fertilise and everything before they can actually go back to normal
so it's not just that [lah] that's just one aspects of it that I'm talking about haiti here
(uh) I think near the america
yes
ya then there's also this (um) having that divide you know (uh) haiti versus the dominican republic
#puerto rican#
!wow!
ya [lor] so
[oh] also from that right because that's a third world country it's very obvious very tangible look of poverty you know say or like you know if tsunami keeps happening in their land or like flooding like in #jakarta# per se like in indonesia it's always flooding because you know high rise water levels are rising
and their [ah] ground basically their land sinking already because of global warming so ya even that in itself right has so much implications and like it's not just the third world [leh] even in singapore like we see we have our own sort of poverty line that we do not it's not obvious to us because
we may not be the one that suffering it we're not the one that is like in it but there are (um) there are little glimpses of it you know that we see say you know a lot of like the social services
that I know of like they help people who actually don't have enough money to go around (um) say like you know elderly people who need help and they don't have help because like their children just don't want to take care of them that's a that's a that's also poverty like you growing old but like
there's no sort of support from anyone especially your family members cause you expect we we expect to rely on them [what] at the end of the day right but they're not there and then like you know people just trying to survive in business I think singapore singapore businesses is just very overcrowded at the minute so like
ya so like it's just difficult to make business because everyone is so competitive like the food business itself is really into millions you know and like you just have to stand out and in order to stand out you have to do something different and then like you know if you're an entrepreneur like you'll be struggling to meet ends meet cause like
you know just thinking of ways to make sure that you sustain that business
and I think with singapore's cost of living is not cheap either it's not
like say you have a house it's already like one big asset and one big liability that you have to basically commit the rest of your life then that's that sets that and then after that what else are you gonna have I don't know gonna have
you have to sustain that job that you work for five days a week six days a week don't know depends on the industry that you're in and it's crazy cause like
cause like there's no work life balance in singapore like people are overworked here to death
it's not as bad as japan but you cannot really you cannot really compare apple to orange you know like japan has their very own sort of culture of just working and like really perfecting every like their niche sort of like profession whereas like singapore is like
you know we just work work work earn money money money because there's so many bills to pay so many outgoing and like lesser of like the income so you gotta keep working to earn that like I think we both suffer from that sort of like repercussions of just our parents working very very hard just to sustain our sort of lifestyle also
<malay>malas nak layan</malay>
you know if they put I know it it is a very big struggle cause like money is very very very important in singapore if you got no money you no talk no money no talk easily like that that that's why where the the sentence come about like the phrase come about cause like you really you really get very stressed out when you have no money here in singapore cause you cannot live without money ya like like the importance of money is so real cause like
and like that costs money I think it's just that sort of like living in a bit of like a fear as well because the government has already set that has already put that in place in you and a lot of it links money and I think it's just very
it it gets to a point where it's not healthy anymore yes it does it's very effective in stopping people from doing you know things like illegal or like things that you know you're not supposed to do and all that but like I'm sure there's other ways of policing I think there is something there needs to be some sort of balance in
ya there needs to be some sort of balance in just like money and people
I think weighs more than people at the minute cause like
like really <malay>tak kisah</malay> like the people and that's where the the people always lose out yes your business is thriving you are in the top number one in the world whatever whatever it's like your business and all that is thriving and all that you're earning billions got a lot of reserve and
and all that but like the truth of the matter is the people are not happy
yes they are only happy because they got the money but other than that are they truly happy living here
yes you got like amenities here you built billions and like millions and millions of dollars and you built the marina bay sands you built all the hotels tourism you know gardens by the bay everything but is that truly for like the locals or is it just to boost tourism because you need the money ya we do get the money back in terms of like you know we
like because we pay taxes and all that we do get to enjoy them because we get to you know visit these places without having to pay cause we singaporeans or but at the same time like I think that act of balancing between work and life is just not there at all
and I think that's why we get very overload and get stressed out and like nothing fills in our mind but just work because with no work we will die we cannot survive
ya I mean in sec one sec two already have like ten subjects or something like that [lah] even more right cause art music and like D&T F&N are all included in right you doing literally everything trying to juggle from four subjects in primary school say music and art but they're not really counted there
but like when you come to secondary school everything is suddenly like [oh] it's graded and it's like shit how like that big I think it's just a very big transitioning from primary school to secondary school because like number one there's already a streaming sort of thing and I know there's sort of a one two three but it's not as prevalent and it's not so like
it's not so like you know it's being set for your path you know like [oh] say like in primary school you don't have like [oh] you you have to spend extra year to just complete like say right but like in secondary school obviously there is that case cause like we got the express normal acad and normal tech stream and sometimes special screaming in like better schools
so ya it's just that disparity where like you being classed into
ya
you the <malay>minah</malay> that's very <malay>bising</malay>
<malay>mulut besar</malay>
I feel like it's just dirty
every once in awhile is not clean
why would I wash my <malay>selimut</malay>
whatever but you bring yours everywhere you drag it out to the living room to the seat and then (uh)
I'm tired
stop yawning
!wow! okay we're like three quarters of the way in we got less than fifteen minutes now which is good
ya I think it it helps to reflect on the society at large and might as an individual on how you can play a part to be better
even though you're just like a small speck of dust what you you can make that difference
I had no part in that I'm sorry that one is on you
#kaypoh# boy #kaypoh#
(mm)
I don't know how to interact with the bird I'm scared
he has a tongue !duh! is it long is it snakey
so what they have like very big taste bud I mean like the buds [ah] cause giraffe tongue is like very
then you give him your old phone case
because your your purple one has some sort of like three dimension thickness to it what and it's very bright so I think that catches his eye and it's like something bulging out hydraulic black
ya but he doesn't know anything
that's enough for pets I think pets are nice to have but they are very they need maintenance and if you cannot and need commitment and if you cannot do any of that you shouldn't have pet
I bond with #gingy# though
how do you know you haven't even met her
eat each other
(mm)
well it's like tom and jerry
ya but like the concept is still very similar it's like prey and predator
so ya
[oh] speaking of that right (uh) there's this tweet saying that (uh) what [ah]
(uh) the tom and jerry just think about it right the only reason why tom no why jerry is always after tom and try and like just (uh) what do you call it [ah]
try to like capture his attention is because maybe he doesn't want to let him eat other mices or it could be that
[eh] doesn't make sense [oh] is that or or because jerry cause jerry is it needs to pretend that he is chasing after a mice in the house because the owner is quite like
I I I you're here for a reason you know you're a cat you gotta go and chase the mice cause that's what cats do right so for him to maintain that sort of status he jerry becomes like his ally essentially
no they're not friends if not they wouldn't it be so tiring to keep constantly having you are like track each other
ya maybe I don't know
but ya just food for thought I think that was a very interesting way of seeing it you never know if this actually what the creators wants you to think
I feel like cartoons in general are quite intriguing they are actually very deep as it is so ironic cause like they look so simple and they look so far away from reality right
but the truth of the matter is like every underlying you know say episode of that cartoon like family guy like the simpsons like (um) south park
like all of them cartoon spongebob squarepants there's so many like symbolism and like underlying meaning to the certain things that they put out for animation
no
you got a minute to explain yourself again
ya but there's still a lot of meaning behind the things that they do or like
a lot of symbolism so so you can't really
you just don't see it it's more okay it's more prevalent in say simpsons or family guy cause they are direct you know in terms of like speaking about world problems or like
you know real life character like justin bieber donald trump they are all in the simpsons
or like family guy speaking about like politics you know there is but ya
I think that's another good topic to speak about for another day
it's nice
as a permanent thing
everyday we're doing it

(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
my wish [ah]
my wish
actually
<malay>anak-anak aku jadi anak yang baik</malay>

(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
so (um) <malay>sofian nak</malay>
if if you are considering higher education <malay>mana awak nak belajar</malay> singapore <malay>ke</malay> overseas
okay
[oh] they have and all masters and all [ah]
you are of second approximate they all say something about how they send their students overseas for like
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
teaching
then
(um) but the same time you will also have a job right
I mean beside teaching
then you wanna take it as full time
ya
[eh]
<malay>tak boleh</malay> [lah] <malay>mana boleh buat apa susah-susah belajar ini</malay> then go
<malay>ajar budak</malay> primary
(mm)
(mm)
(mm)
me
ya
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>saya nak</malay> like I said
<malay>nak buka</malay> business
ya so
(uh) we are trying to find a suitable place do not want to jump
you know (err) take our time then
because now (err) when I study the market because of COVID
there's a lot of businesses are closing down
no business
so we need to be very careful when we invest
(uh) and not to invest too much
because we don't know what's the outcome
ya
<malay>kalau tak</malay> another option would be like <malay>macam</malay> work from home [lah]
like
[mah] do something like ecommerce <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay>
it's all in the process
nothing [eh]
have
has my tedious life
(mm)
ya
so
what [lah]
(mm)
ya
free
<malay>dekat sini</malay>
[oh] there was (err) it's (err) healthcare
<malay>bukan tapi bukan untuk sakit yang</malay>
normal <malay>macam demam macam</malay> the normal you know cold flu things no I don't want that for free
<malay>tapi bila orang betul-betul sakit</malay>
(err) <malay>macam</malay> you know unexpected
so like like terminally ill or critically ill (uh) and there is no choice but to get a treatment
also it's very (uh)
you know (um)
<malay>mahal sangat</malay>
so let's
(err) <malay>bayangkan kalau orang itu tak ada duit</malay>
then <malay>memang orang itu dah</malay> stress because of the illness
ya so <malay>kalau dia tak ada duit</malay>
so that's going to
(um) make the recovery even
harder
ya so I wish
(um)
I wish [lah] if <malay>orang yang macam</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa tak ada tak ada tak mampu untuk merawat</malay>
so they get I think government <malay>ada juga</malay> [lah] <malay>bagi untuk orang yang tak mampu tapi</malay> I wish they
ya I wish they get the best treatment also
[eh] common in what sense
you you mean the outpatient
ya
ya <malay>itu</malay> maybe we can
if not that
maybe we can afford
<malay>tapi yang macam</malay> chronically ill and the bill is like very high how
how we are going to afford
ya
(mm)
<malay>lagi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>nanti kena</malay>
master
[oh] okay
<malay>itu satu</malay> (err) swimming <malay>sebab sekarang saya tengah belajar</malay> swimming
<malay>berenang</malay>
(err) is with is with a private coach
<malay>dekat</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat itu</malay>
(err) <malay>apa</malay>
#yio chu kang#
#yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
ya <malay>sebab</malay> (err) coach <malay>itu boleh datang</malay>
(mm) <malay>dia punya tempat dia ajar itu dekat situ</malay>
ya I think #yio chu kang# or #choa chu kang#
(mm) ya
it's (err) four lessons
(mm)
(mm) four lessons is hundred seventy seven
ya
just four lessons
but
the coach is quite hands on [lah]
I mean (uh) last time <malay>saya pernah ada juga pergi</malay>
(mm)
<malay>dua tahun selepas</malay>
(err) I mean (uh) two years before two years ago
<malay>tapi</malay> coach <malay>itu walaupun</malay> <malay>dia bagi tiga ratus dollar untuk sepuluh</malay> lessons
<malay>tapi</malay> the coach is like (uh) not hands on he he
just a coach just expect us to do on our own (mm) but this one even though we pay four lessons hundred seventy seven <malay>tapi</malay> each lesson <malay>itu</malay>
it's very
meaning I mean very (err)
<malay>ada dia punya itu</malay> [lah] result
so (um) <malay>berenang itu</malay>
(uh) so I I I I think I need (err) more practice
but
I think with more practice I can master the skill [lah] but it will take time
for me
ya
<malay>lagi satu itu saya</malay>
because <malay>sekarang saya banyak sekarang saya umur empat puluh lima</malay>
so <malay>sekarang</malay>
like I feel like my body is like ache here ache ache there ache here you know
so I want
rather then I do I I I want to go for pilates
so it that one is actually not for weight loss
but is to correct your
posture
your you know like <malay>macam</malay>
alignment to make it
correct your alignment something like that ya
active
<malay>ada</malay> pilates
is it with the equipment
pilates
[ah]

<malay>yang</malay> pilates <malay>itu ada banyak macam ada banyak jenis yang</malay>
<malay>ada yang buat</malay>
with our body just on the mat the yoga mat <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>tapi ada lagi yang pakai</malay> equipments
just (uh) designed for pilates which will help you to correct your
postures more
so I feel rather than
(um) the normal pilates I think I
I do this pilates [lah] I want to try but I haven't signed for the classes
ya
active <malay>itu saya kena</malay> check <malay>kalau dia orang ada</malay> the same kind of pilates
<malay>kalau ada</malay> (uh) ya obviously I go for that
because private ones I think is quite expensive
(mm)
(mm)
active <malay>belum</malay>
<malay>saya pernah pakai untuk</malay> swimming pool <malay>sahaja pernah</malay>
I mean the credit
no <malay>yang saya cakap itu dulu</malay>
<malay>dua tahun sebelum</malay>
<malay>itu dekat</malay> redhill
(uh)
delta delta
delta swimming pool
so far [lah] because the coach (um) <malay>yang</malay> coach can only come there
so we need to
it's not we decide when we want but the coach will decide which pool
ya like I said <malay>dulu punya</malay> coach <malay>itu</malay>
(um) I didn't learn anything from
the coach (uh) <malay>tapi sekarang punya</malay> coach <malay>itu</malay>
at least <malay>ada</malay> [lah] <malay>ajar sikit-sikit</malay> but I know I would I will take with some
practice
I can master the skills but not too fast for me
(mm)

then will compete
so if you want again you need to pay
(mmhmm)
ya
one dish
(mm)
I like bread toast
no
but I like bread toast [lah]
I don't mind
but (err) only the downside is that
(err) because it's all carbohydrates so I don't think I can eat
but if you if you ask me
no bread toast is just I like [lah] but not (mm) not I eat something that I eat rest of my life <malay>tapi kalau macam</malay>
(um)
I would rather go for something with proteins
like <malay>macam</malay>
chicken
or fish
ya I can eat that
from
ya with some fruits and veggies
<malay>kalau nak cakap macam gitu apa</malay> [eh]
[ah] <malay>saya tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>awak</malay>

so how was the rice today (uh) the #mandi# rice
the <malay>nasi</malay> arab <malay>itu</malay>
ya smoke <malay>sebab</malay> smoke <malay>itu tak kuat</malay> smoke
the smoke is just like only on the surface
then it will you know <malay>dia akan hilang cepat</malay>
ya
<malay>itu bukan keras</malay> [lah] <malay>itu</malay>
<malay>bawah itu yang dah rangup</malay>
<malay>nasi yang dah</malay>
curry
(hmm)
ya <malay>tak tak tapi</malay>
I like it very much the rice
for me it's like
one of the best (um) #mandi# rice I cooked so far
no I did before with the whole chicken
ya
no for me this was this this is more flavourful
than the previous one
(mm)
okay
(mm)
pizza <malay>dekat mana</malay>
pizza hut
!hey! which pizza you ate [ah]
half half
half half you can order like that
is this the same price
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
(mm) (mm)
(err) tomorrow bought probably will be
no
probably will be
chicken curry
ya why not and #ghee# rice is very simple to make
very easy to make
it's very easy [lah]
(err) you need a little bit of <malay>minyak sapi</malay>
(err) depends [lah] if you want to put it all <malay>minyak sapi</malay> or you can mix with other oils like any other vegetable oil half half
let's say you take (err) one cup of rice
any cups [lah]
I'm talking about the normal measurement cup
let's say you take (um) you can make it with the #basmati# rice
or you like the small small rice
okay you you measure one cup of rice
then you (err) if let's say one cup of rice (uh) you only need probably about
one and a half tablespoon of #ghee#
you put the #ghee#
then you slice like one medium size onion
(um) but the onion you should you should slice (err) very thin
because you need to fry
if it's to thick then it's difficult to
become crispy
so once it's like
(err) translucent like a bit brown then you put
you <malay>boleh</malay> you <malay>boleh letak rempah-rempah dia</malay> like <malay>kayu manis buah pelaga</malay> is
(err) what is the name in english (uh)
<malay>bunga lawa tapi jangan taruh banyak</malay> [lah] because it's only one cup of rice
so just one one will do one small piece of
<malay>kayu manis</malay>
<malay>buah pelaga satu cukup</malay>
then <malay>cengkih</malay> is clove
then
ya that's all [lah] if you have
<malay>macam daun salam</malay> is basil leaves basil leaves also can put one
then you [dah] fry then you you take one cup of rice
put one and a half cup of
water then when it starts to boil you put
(err) you <malay>letak garam</malay>
(err) according to your taste [lah]
<malay>garam</malay> then when it when the
water starts to boil you <malay>letak itu beras</malay>
then you cook [lah] rice cooker
ya
that's the simple version [lah] there's many kind of
(err) <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you are talking about <malay>nasi minyak</malay> right
(uh) <malay>nasi minyak kalau ikutkan cara sini</malay>
<malay>dia</malay>
<malay>ada letak</malay>
instead of (uh) instead of
all water they will mix with half half like <malay>susu cair</malay>
half <malay>susu cair</malay> half water
so what's that one and a half cup right
no <malay>nasi lemak kita letak santan</malay>
this is <malay>nasi minyak</malay>
ya <malay>nasi minyak</malay> you can also do that way but the taste will be a bit [lah]
(mm) then you <malay>boleh letak daun pandan daun serai</malay>
you know that one is a different taste but if you like it you can do that way also <malay>macam</malay> you <malay>boleh letak</malay> tomato
(uh)
you (uh) <malay>boleh letak</malay> chilli <malay>hijau semua</malay> [lah] then you put half half [lah] <malay>separuh</malay>
<malay>separuh susu cair</malay>
<malay>jadi tiga suku tiga suku</malay>
(uh) then the same method you put the (uh) <malay>garam</malay>
then you put the rice
the other one the taste will be <malay>macam kenduri punya nasi lemak</malay> [lah]
[ah]
ya
ya that one is more like (uh) is (uh) more with it goes well with like <malay>macam ayam masak merah rendang semua</malay>
ya <malay>ini nasi minyak</malay> simple <malay>punya</malay> so it goes well with (uh) curry chicken

<malay>azam baru dengan</malay> veganism
(mm) (mm)
(mm) <malay>mungkin dalam</malay>
<malay>dalam masa</malay>
<malay>tiga bulan</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay> depend <malay>juga</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> have <malay>ada</malay> deteriorate <malay>ke</malay>
<malay>atau</malay>
(mm)
<malay>atau ada apa-apa yang mengubah persepsi dalam</malay> morality
depends [lah] you <malay>rasa macam mana</malay>
<malay>tapi macam ada</malay> standpoint morality
<malay>apa</malay> you <malay>punya</malay>
opinion
[oh] <malay>sebab tu rasa</malay> selfish [ah]
(mm) <malay>itu dia panggil</malay> cognitive dissonance (err) basically
<malay>bila</malay> you <malay>tengok</malay>
(err) <malay>dekat</malay> certain <malay>negara</malay>
some of them
<malay>ada yang makan anjing</malay>
you <malay>boleh tengok dekat</malay> YouTube
<malay>ada yang</malay>
<malay>yang buat video dia tengah makan anjing macam yang video orang korea selalu buat dia</malay> [kan] <malay>makan makanan</malay> [ah] <malay>jadi kat situ kelakar</malay> [tau] <malay>sebab</malay>
<malay>kita boleh nampak</malay> dislike <malay>pada video orang yang makan anjing tu banyak tapi bila dia makan</malay> steak <malay>biasa</malay>
beef
[ah] <malay>banyak</malay> [jer] like <malay>lepas tu korang</malay> comments <malay>semua yang elok-elok</malay> [lah] <malay>cakap sedap</malay> [lah] <malay>tapi bila yang anjing tu ramai yang</malay> dislike then <malay>bagi</malay> comment
<malay>yang marah</malay> [lah] <malay>marah sebab makan anjing tapi kat situ macam mana dia agak</malay>
hypocrite [kan] (mm)
(mm) <malay>sebenarnya tu memang</malay> argument <malay>yang orang selalu pakai</malay>
(err) <malay>tapi dekat situ timbul satu</malay> problem <malay>macam mana</malay> intelligence <malay>satu</malay> sentient being <malay>diukur macam mana dia orang</malay> measure
so <malay>dah jadi satu</malay> problem <malay>kat situ</malay>
<malay>jadi kalau</malay>
<malay>kalau</malay> I <malay>sendiri</malay> [ah] <malay>rasa</malay> (mm) morally <malay>memang kita salah</malay> [lah] <malay>kalau nak ikut daripada</malay> standpoint moral
<malay>cuma</malay>
I <malay>suka juga tengok daripada satu</malay>
<malay>daripada satu</malay> (uh)
evolutionary standpoint <malay>yang mana</malay>
<malay>kita dah dah</malay> mutated <malay>dah</malay> evolved
<malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk makan</malay>
sentient being <malay>lain</malay> though so <malay>dah</malay> in a way <malay>dah</malay> adapt <malay>sebab tu bila kita cuma nak tinggalkan</malay>
<malay>tinggalkan</malay>
(mm) tradition <malay>bukan</malay> tradition <malay>tinggalkan</malay> diet <malay>tu dia bagi kesan sampingan pada badan</malay> [lah] <malay>sebab banyak juga</malay>
<malay>orang-orang yang</malay> ex-vegan <malay>yang dah</malay>
ten years being vegan
last <malay>sekali dia orang</malay>
<malay>dia orang tinggalkan juga</malay> veganism <malay>sebab</malay>
health <malay>semakin teruk</malay> [kan]
(mm)
[ah] in fact <malay>baru</malay> five thousand years <malay>dari</malay> ya <malay>yang yang</malay> recorded [lah] five thousand years <malay>baru</malay> start <malay>ada</malay>
[ah] agriculture
before that <malay>takde yang dikenal pasti</malay> [lah]
<malay>itu masa</malay> mesopotamia [kan]
(mm)
<malay>tak</malay> I <malay>akan</malay> start <malay>dengan</malay> vegetarian <malay>dulu sebab macam biasa</malay> [ah] <malay>ni</malay>
<malay>ramai orang yang cakap benda yang sama dia tak boleh tinggalkan</malay> cheese
<malay>telur</malay> yes yes <malay>tak boleh</malay>
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
last <malay>kita makan</malay> beef <malay>pun bila</malay>
mac D [lah]
[a'ah] [ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay [lah] <malay>kira itu tahun lepas punya cerita ini sekarang tahun baru</malay>
(mm)
(mm) <malay>tapi kita</malay> [kan] <malay>pernah</malay> discuss <malay>sebelum ni kalau macam susah</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay>
<malay>kalau tak nak nampak poyo kita kena buat buat ada macam</malay> health issue <malay>macam ada</malay> allergy <malay>ke makan makan</malay> meat products
<malay>ada</malay> allergy <malay>jadi kita boleh pura-pura ada</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> illness [ah] <malay>ada penyakit yang tak boleh yang membuatkan kita tak boleh</malay>
<malay>makan daging</malay>
[oh] ya [lah] <malay>rasa serba salah rasa</malay> guilty <malay>dia dah masak</malay> [kan]
I was many <malay>tak tahu pun</malay>
just just <malay>fikir bila dah tengok banyak</malay>
<malay>banyak</malay> debate
then <malay>dia macam dia</malay> start to make sense [lah] <malay>bila</malay>
<malay>tengok</malay>
discussion <malay>pasal</malay> morality issues
(mm) back then I consider <malay>juga</malay> standpoint <malay>yang lagi satu</malay> [lah] <malay>yang memang</malay>
<malay>kalau ikutkan daripada</malay> organism <malay>yang pertama pun memang dia</malay>
<malay>menelan satu sama lain agaknya</malay>
even plants <malay>pun</malay> evolve <malay>daripada</malay> organism <malay>yang</malay>
<malay>yang</malay> first
(mm)
mostly <malay>pasal</malay> philosophy <malay>yang mana yang mana</malay> start
start into into <malay>betul pun lepas</malay>
<malay>lepas</malay>
start pandemic
and <malay>jadi banyak masa untuk</malay>
<malay>untuk</malay> reflect
<malay>untuk fikir</malay> (err) meaning of life
and then <malay>macam-macam</malay> [lah] (err)
<malay>macam-macam</malay>
argument <malay>macam-macam</malay> discussion <malay>dapat</malay>
<malay>dapat tengok sebab</malay> free <malay>sangat</malay> [kan] <malay>banyak</malay> free time <malay>masa</malay> pandemic <malay>ni</malay>
so <malay>daripada situ</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik</malay>
(um)
<malay>dapat</malay> counter <malay>balik permikiran yang sebelum-sebelum ni</malay>
<malay>macam dulu tak boleh dengar pun sebenarnya bila orang</malay>
<malay>bincangkan pasal</malay> veganism
<malay>dia macam selalu</malay> irritating [kan] annoying <malay>macam mana</malay> [ah]
<malay>tapi</malay> (err) recently [lah] <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>macam</malay> okay <malay>nampak</malay> [ah] <malay>kenapa dia</malay>
<malay>dia</malay> make sense
(mm) (mm)
(mm)
(mm) ya [lah] source of protein <malay>tu senang nak dapat</malay> ya especially is <malay>buat tempeh</malay> [lah]
<malay>sedap</malay>

(mm)
meat
<malay>kita sendiri pun makan</malay> sandwich <malay>yang hidang dengan tempeh</malay>
alright [jer] (mm)
<malay>tapi</malay> still once in a while <malay>memang rasa</malay> craving <malay>untuk</malay>
(err) beef too especially <malay>bila bayangkan</malay> steak
(um) <malay>yang</malay> medium rare [ah]
<malay>sedap</malay>

<malay>kesian</malay>
pathetic <malay>pun ada</malay>
(um) [oh]
<malay>tak tahu apa nak buat</malay>
actually honestly [kan] like since <malay>aku</malay> first [kan] among <malay>kita punya</malay> siblings [kan] so <malay>macam aku tak ada kakak</malay> or <malay>abang</malay> to ask things from mummy and is like totally <malay>apa ni</malay> <malay>dorang tak tahu apa-apa</malay> and they depend on me <malay>kalau tak pun dorang tanya cik</malay> #shahrul# <malay>macam mana nak anuh ni semua</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu bila aku</malay> start <malay>pun kau nak tahu apa aku tanya kawan-kawan aku</malay> can imagine last time before <malay>kita ada</malay> internet at home
like I will go to the library my friend <malay>yang pandai</malay> internet
they will actually accompany me to the library and last time library we can rent hours <malay>pakai dia punya</malay> internet computer remember so <malay>aku pergi sana dorang tolong buatkan aku punya</malay> email <malay>dorang tolong buatkan aku punya</malay> friendster and things like that
yes it was really that bad <malay>tak akan aku nak tunjuk</malay> and you like what kindergarten <malay>lagi</malay> [pe] time <malay>tu</malay> like time <malay>tu</malay> I was
okay <malay>kau baru</malay> primary [kan]
no it was like primary four primary six ya [lah] ya so primary four primary six <malay>yang kita jalan gi apa ni</malay> #bedok# library no you know when I start reading book secondary one
or ask everytime <malay>nak pergi mana</malay> then I say or else mummy <malay>tanya aku macam kak nak gi mana nak pergi</malay> library so last time <malay>kalau nak buat</malay> research <malay>ke apa pergi</malay> library [ah] <malay>abeh tu</malay> then <malay>bila</malay> #abi# <malay>beli</malay> computer <malay>letak dekat bilik</malay> that's when slowly but then <malay>kita pakai</malay> internet <malay>untuk buat apa tengok</malay> youtube video game
ya so <malay>dulu pun macam</malay> struggle <malay>pun</malay> struggle <malay>sendiri juga</malay> like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] yes and that's the <malay>ni apa ni</malay>
<malay>aku</malay> by the time [kan] <malay>boleh nampak beza</malay> [tau] so time <malay>tu aku ingat masa aku</malay> tuition [ah] <malay>aku</malay> tuition <malay>dengan</malay> #kak mon# #kak mon# <malay>sama umur</malay> [kan] <malay>cuma aku</malay> first child <malay>dia</malay> third
third daughter
can't
so <malay>bila kita kat</malay> tuition I never felt the difference between me and #mon# so <malay>aku rasa macam kita orang sama merepek sama-sama ketawa sama-sama</malay> like we learn together we grew up together like we had <malay>silat</malay> and everything like that and like on these last few days of the <malay>kita orang punya</malay> tuition <malay>ni</malay> the <malay>kakak cakap</malay>
[ah] #mar# <malay>anak nombor berapa</malay> then I say first then #mun# <malay>berapa</malay> [oh] <malay>patut</malay> [lah] <malay>nampak beza</malay> then I was like !huh! there is a difference <malay>macam dia kata</malay> in how I do my work in how responsibility in how I act even though I feel like I act as childish as her <malay>macam aku merepek-merepek pun</malay> there is still a difference between
your level of #merepekness# [ah] things like that
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] so last time <malay>aku</malay> struggle [ah] <malay>kau nampak aku macam</malay> I had it all like some (uh) <malay>macam senang</malay> but actually I had to learn a lot of things by myself like <malay>macam mana nak pakai</malay> computer <malay>macam mana nak buat ni nak buat</malay> report <malay>macam mana nak buat</malay> homework okay of course I had tuitions [lah] back then but
I had tuition is about mummy and #abi# cannot help us
[ah] yes
<malay>memang kau tak tahu aku susah ke tak</malay>
<malay>dapat</malay> laptop
I deserve that first hand items !hey!
<malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>susah</malay> [kan] <malay>dulu hidup</malay>
and <malay>tak macam dulu</malay>
<malay>macam kau sekarang</malay> by then even though when you ask me how to do certain things I would <malay>macam</malay> !huh! <malay>benda macam gini pun kau tak tahu</malay>
but then <malay>kau</malay> imagine <malay>kau</malay> and last time it was not as <malay>apa ni</malay> is not an in thing
it is still new to the whole generation [tau] so <malay>macam memang kena belajar</malay> and last time I honestly I was one of the <malay>macam lembab</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> everyone have already have email friendster imagine the year <malay>aku buat</malay> friendster
<malay>dah tak</malay> popular by then I am not sure if it was facebook [oh] I think it was facebook facebook <malay>atau</malay> messenger it was the messenger <malay>yang</malay> popular
<malay>kau tak tahu</malay> messenger <malay>apa</malay> [kan]
<malay>dia macam</malay> chatting <malay>punya benda</malay>
<malay>itu pun</malay> I only
ya I only ya it's either hotmail <malay>ke</malay> microsoft so <malay>tapi</malay> by then <malay>aku dah ada</malay> messenger <malay>terus</malay> facebook <malay>dah</malay> popular so <malay>macam bila orang berbual pasal</malay> friendster <malay>aku macam</malay> (hmm) [oh] I also had friendster [oh] <malay>nama apa</malay> then I was like
(um) I don't remember my handle at all
ya those were the days [lah]
but I would love to go back to those days
less stressful than now
ya
if you okay <malay>kalau</malay> #aisha# <malay>ada</malay> time okay [lah] I know #aisha# <malay>baru masuk</malay> poly life [kan] like primary secondary poly two point two out of these stages of your life which one <malay>macam pada kau paling</malay> memorable <malay>sekali</malay>
why
last few years you mean
<malay>rabak</malay> in what sense
have to live up to the name of the monitress
but you are the monitress you have to be the responsible one [oh] so instead of monitor monitress other students is like monitress monitor
then why was he the monitor
<malay>tak ada satu pun jadi</malay> monitor <malay>ni atas dasar terpaksa pun jadi</malay> [lah]
(um) [oh] class voting
since but <malay>bila</malay> first time <malay>kau jadi</malay> monitress [kan] was it chosen by the form teacher or also was yes <malay>aku tahu aku</malay> favourite child favourite student
so sorry imagine if you were in school when we were still in school both me and <malay>abang</malay>
going [oh] [oh]
the thing
<malay>bila ni</malay> which year [oh] my god okay the cat is out of the bag secondary four it was during secondary four
for what subject for what subject <malay>cakap</malay> [jer] [lah] <malay>dah lepas pun</malay>
[oh] where you guys go overseas
[ah] class <malay>ni tak payah dengar</malay> [lah]
[oh] because she was the same form teacher [oh] what
malay guy [oh] ya I think I know her okay [oh]
<malay>kat</malay> ear <malay>punya</malay> height [oh]
<malay>tak tinggi mana</malay> shoulder [oh]
polytechnic private
favourite [eh] I think in terms of memories
I would say secondary
it's about the thing is we've known each other since primary school because unlike you you are the system whereby after primary six you <malay>pilih</malay> which <malay>madrasah</malay> you want to go whether you want to focus academic girl probably but during <malay>kak punya</malay> time
<malay>kita orang tak ada pilihan</malay> unless you choose to change school then <malay>kita</malay> change school <malay>kalau tak</malay> all the way <malay>kita</malay> in the same school [lah]
so time <malay>tu bila dah masuk</malay> secondary [kan] <malay>bila</malay> primary [kan] <malay>kita orang macam</malay>
[ah] less drama more fun
so when it comes to secondary so all this while
[oh] okay I think for me I remember my primary school because the best year was during primary four
whereby madam #rosanna# was our form teacher and she taught us everything <malay>dia ajar</malay>
<malay>dia ajar</malay> [ah] english maths and science
so she taught all this three subjects okay so during lessons where everyday <malay>kita orang akan</malay> mix so someday we just do all english
because she is going to cover everything within all her periods and everything and during that time we have young entrepreneur scheme competition
whereby all of us work together you know one whole class [ah] like thirty five of us work together madam #rosanna# being herself a creative teacher she like do art project <malay>untuk kita orang semua</malay> and that's how we became closer especially during [ah] like even though there was six main members but behind the scenes like we came back to school during the june holidays
[ah] during the june holidays <malay>lepas itu kita orang apa ni buat</malay> artworks for example [ah] old vases <malay>kita orang</malay> paint <malay>balik</malay> to sell during our end <malay>kita orang punya tempat yang kita</malay> for the competition was at #tampines# mall you know where <malay>dorang</malay> have the bazaar <malay>sebelah</malay> #tampines# mall
every ramadan they have the bazaar <malay>hari raya</malay>
no even now <malay>yang kalau ada</malay> bazaar <malay>dekat</malay> #tampines#
yes so that was where we held the competition and everyone came imagine one of <malay>aku punya</malay> classmate <malay>dia kau tahu yang</malay> vanguard sheet it's not vanguard is it <malay>yang</malay> colour colour purple colour blue <malay>macam</malay> vanguard sheet [oh] my god it's been so long since I used that word vanguard sheet [ah]
so <malay>dia pakai macam</malay> vanguard sheet <malay>depan belakang</malay> and then <malay>dia jual</malay> envelope <malay>macam untuk</malay> envelope <malay>macam salam kahwin salam hari raya kita orang</malay> fold from wrapping paper and at the end of competition <malay>kita orang punya</malay> class <malay>dapat</malay> [eh] <malay>kita orang punya sekolah</malay> we first time <malay>arabia masuk</malay> and <malay>kita orang menang dapat</malay> fourth position
all thanks to madam #rosanna# so but she put the most effort [lah] because we were like only primary four <malay>kita berapa</malay> years old then ten years old we don't <malay>tak tahu banyak benda</malay> [kan] so then after that when <malay>kita orang dah bersatu hati bersatu padu</malay> primary four <malay>bila</malay> primary five <malay>kita</malay> split class
I also imagine like primary one primary two primary three and primary four
everyone was in the same class
they just <malay>tak ada</malay>
so last time during my <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> my time right <malay>dorang tak ada macam</malay> [ah] <malay>yang pandai</malay>
<malay>yang paling pandai yang pandai yang perlu bantuan untuk jadi lebih pandai tu tiga</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang tak ada</malay> split so all of us are in one class so it must have been a struggle for those <malay>yang susah juga</malay> [lah]
(uh)
<malay>korang</malay> seven levels [seh] A B C D E F six okay
and also the lower class [lah]
<malay>kesiannya</malay>
[oh] because they want you guys to focus on studies or [ah] but did you look forward to that camp so <malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>kesah sangat</malay>
antisocial
okay then
antisocial [lah] <malay>tu</malay> so okay back <malay>tu aku punya cerita</malay> so <malay>bila</malay> primary five <malay>kita</malay> split class [tau] <malay>abeh kita orang punya</malay> class ground level ground level [kan] so <malay>satu</malay> class <malay>satu</malay> class it all happen when mummy [kan] <malay>dah</malay> start <malay>jual</malay> [kan] <malay>kat situ</malay> so <malay>aku selalu</malay> stay back
so I think there was a <malay>kita orang punya</malay> senior <malay>ke apa tak puas hati dengan</malay> some girl from of course [lah] boy so <malay>dorang macam</malay> unhappy with the between class five A and five B [ah] so boyfriend <malay>kat</malay> five B <malay>suka</malay> girl <malay>kat</malay> five A girl <malay>kat</malay> five A <malay>suka lelaki kat</malay> five B but lucky for five B they actually stayed back during primary six so girls primary six <malay>tak puas hati</malay>
so what happen was like one of <malay>kita orang punya</malay> time find that I always stay back <malay>pasal</malay> mummy <malay>jualan</malay> [kan] <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan] so <malay>aku tunggu</malay> [lah] mummy <malay>habis baru balik sama-sama</malay> what happen was them knowing that I always stay back you know what they do <malay>dorang koyakkan benda dalam</malay> class <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>dorang koyakkan benda dalam</malay> class <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>ada</malay> a few clique until today <malay>aku masih ingat pasal</malay> that is the same clique
who <malay>koyakkan aku punya</malay> duty roster <malay>bila</malay> secondary one
[ah] [ah] I hold grudge
<malay>kalau dengar</malay> okay so <malay>dorang dah koyakkan</malay> the duty roster and the next day <malay>bila</malay> five B <malay>datang dorang cakap</malay> [lah] <malay>aku yang koyakkan</malay>
<malay>sebab aku yang</malay> stay back
yes and ya ya <malay>pasal aku tak</malay> hold grudge <malay>sangat aku</malay> hold grudge yang secondary one <malay>punya tapi semua dah besar</malay>
so <malay>lepas tu</malay> then after that after that whole incident
<malay>mengamuk</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak</malay> [ah] because it was just not me I was with another friend <malay>kita orang sama-sama</malay>
[ah] <malay>macam tak mungkin aku koyakkan</malay> by the time <malay>akak balik dia pun balik</malay> so all this while <malay>kita orang sama-sama</malay> but the other class knowing that <malay>aku yang selalu</malay> stay back <malay>tunggu</malay> mummy
then <malay>dorang ni</malay> [ah]
or maybe <malay>bila aku tak ada dekat</malay> class I didn't stay at the classroom [what] I will just stay at the #musollah# <malay>ataupun dekat luar</malay>
[ah] so what happen afterwards was <malay>kita orang</malay> start to have extra classes after school hours so that's where the whole saga started <malay>dorang sembunyikan kasut hilangkan</malay> pencil box it's like to the extent one day after school <malay>semua orang kena</malay> stay back <malay>semua dari</malay> five A <malay>semua dari</malay> five B <malay>kena</malay> stay back <malay>aku daripada</malay> five A [kan] <malay>dengar</malay>
<malay>dorang tak tahu tu</malay> primary six <malay>aku tahu pasal siapa lagi</malay> yang stay back <malay>tapi pasal dia</malay> senior <malay>aku tak ada</malay> senior <malay>lagi nak tolong aku</malay> so it happen to the extent that madam #rosanna# form teacher <malay>kita orang bila</malay> primary four gather <malay>kita orang balik untuk berbual dengan kita orang</malay>
then I say you were together last year <malay>macam sama-sama apasal bila masuk</malay> primary five <malay>semua macam gini</malay> things like that so in the end <malay>kita salam</malay> and <malay>dah habis</malay> [ah]
<malay>tak ada orang nak mengaku sebab tak ada</malay> proof
we didn't have any proof that it was primary six but I knew because I know this <malay>kakak-kakak</malay> stay back
and I knew the history of all this <malay>aku</malay> [kan] <malay>orang tengah semua benda aku tahu</malay> [ah] yes
ya <malay>tapi</malay> time <malay>rapat dengan dia</malay> so ya
<malay>tu</malay> [lah] <malay>kakak tak suka tu</malay> primary five <malay>bila</malay> but then <malay>bila dah masuk</malay> secondary <malay>kita masih</malay> split class <malay>sampai</malay> secondary one time <malay>tu pun</malay> sec one a <malay>lawan dengan</malay> sec one B
<malay>pasal</malay>
<malay>pasal kita</malay> just annoyed <malay>dengan dorang</malay> like there was this one trend <malay>semua orang akan pakai</malay> this jacket do you know my jacket <malay>bukan</malay> varsity jacket it was before varsity jacket it was like a hoodie jacket <malay>yang kau tahu yang</malay> grey and another pink

and I was so annoyed <malay>pasal dorang macam</malay> flaunt <malay>dorang punya</malay> because it was in trend and <malay>dorang macam</malay> flaunt and the whole group <malay>nanti ambil gambar</malay> and things like that <malay>abeh aku</malay> annoyed <malay>gila</malay> [seh] so <malay>aku pun tak suka dorang</malay> then comes the teacher day <malay>punya</malay> time [tau] so <malay>bila tengah</malay> teacher day <malay>punya</malay> time one of <malay>aku punya</malay> classmate instead of <malay>tolong</malay> decorate <malay>aku punya</malay> class
<malay>dia pergi kelas sebelah tolong</malay> decorate [kan] <malay>kelas sebelah kita orang dah macam</malay> [oh] my god <malay>abeh kita orang memang tak puas hati dengan dorang</malay> until <malay>dorang</malay> secondary one
then <malay>bila kita orang masuk</malay> secondary two <malay>kita sama kelas balik</malay>
so it was like primary five primary six secondary one
<malay>kita orang</malay> different class after that <malay>bila masuk balik</malay> secondary everyone was in the same class secondary two <malay>pasal</malay> by then pun <malay>kita dah pindah dekat</malay> #toa payoh# [kan] so classroom <malay>dah lagi besar</malay> so <malay>bila yang</malay> secondary two <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>kita orang macam ada</malay> certain <malay>orang kita tak</malay> click <malay>sebab dia gatal</malay>
but other certain students we are okay with them [ah] by then <malay>kita dah</malay> quite click then after that <malay>bila masuk</malay> secondary three end of secondary three <malay>kita ada</malay> secondary three camp
[ah] whereby <malay>dalam</malay> secondary three camp because we have never been in situation whereby <malay>kita orang semua sama-sama</malay> except <malay>kita orang punya macam apa ni tidur kat sekolah bulan ramadan punya</malay> time
so other than <malay>kita orang semua tak sama-sama</malay> actually <malay>bila</malay> camp <malay>itu</malay> [lah] <malay>semua orang</malay> start <malay>rapat</malay>
<malay>tak kita tidur pasal penat</malay>
(um) level one <malay>ni kat sekolah mana</malay>
[ah] level one meaning
[oh]
should be something stupid
girls
[oh]
I think the only time whereby <malay>kita orang tak tidur sekolah</malay> so last time <malay>kita ada</malay> was one week and
<malay>apa ni kita orang ada</malay> arabic paper and among all the paper of course arabic language <malay>paling susah</malay> [kan] so what was <malay>ustazah</malay> #mashallah# <malay>beterima kasih dia sanggup tidur</malay> a day before the paper I think that was thursday <malay>kira</malay> arabic paper was on friday so <malay>dia tidur kat sekolah dengan kita orang</malay> so the reason why <malay>kita semua tidur kat sekolah</malay> was to revise our arabic
and in the end we didn't really revised instead <malay>kita</malay> of course girls being girls when we are together <malay>kita orang ketawa-ketawa</malay> and the thing is only girls <malay>yang tidur</malay>
<malay>kat sekolah</malay> and there was only one <malay>ustaz</malay> and another male student to accompany the <malay>ustaz</malay> [lah] is the only guy in school <malay>ustaz</malay> was there to look after us [lah] <malay>tak akan kalau</malay> all girls <malay>kalau apa-apa jadi kat sekolah apa jadi</malay> [kan]
then after that during <malay>kita orang punya ni ada</malay> something happen again so <malay>kita orang tidur dekat</malay> creepy honestly even <malay>bila</malay> camp <malay>bila ada kat situ itu jangan cakap aku buat bodoh</malay> and last time <malay>tak ada cermin</malay> last time there was no mirrors then we <malay>bila dah</malay> new <malay>sikit</malay> that is scary [lah] so last time <malay>bila masih tengah kat</malay> <malay>kita orang semua tengah duduk</malay> it was already at eleven plus
[mah] then <malay>kita orang pun dah habis</malay> revise because we going to wake up earlier before <malay>subuh</malay> the next day to like refresh before we keep school because school <malay>kat sekolah</malay> [kan] exam <malay>dia esok pagi semua</malay> student <malay>datang balik</malay> [ah] <malay>dekat arabiah dekat</malay> hall
then <malay>lepas tu</malay>
so was it in hall
no I don't think it was in hall it was in one of the classroom <malay>yang tingkat dua hujung sini yang</malay> facing parade square I think it was there
<malay>lepas tu</malay> what happen was we were just talking amongst ourselves and you know the sound whereby <malay>kereta jalan</malay> then <malay>bunyi</malay> imagine #ustaz muhammad# <malay>kereta</malay> was parked
no he was parked there he was parked way before so <malay>tak gerakkan kereta pun</malay> <malay>semua orang</malay>
[ah]
<malay>yang kereta jalan</malay> ya
except for staff
park <malay>kereta dekat depan</malay>
other side
[oh] <malay>yang sebelah</malay> security <malay>punya</malay> ya
and it couldn't be from the road <malay>pasal</malay> road <malay>dah jauh</malay>
the real do
[oh] ya
so <malay>kakak punya</malay> the more okay I
<malay>tak pernah</malay> experience <malay>benda-benda seram</malay>
<malay>sampai orang</malay> point out
so meaning <malay>ataupun</malay> staycation <malay>ingat</malay> staycation <malay>dekat dengan</malay> old #changi# hospital
I know the place is eerie but I don't sense or feel <malay>pasal aku tak nak takutkan diri aku sendiri macam kau tahu aku takut tengok cerita hantu</malay> [kan] so <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>aku macam tahu tempat dia</malay> very eerie very <malay>seram</malay>
our chalet time <malay>kita ambil yang paling hujung sekali</malay> [kan] <malay>tapi aku tak cakap apa-apa cuma bila dah habis</malay> the whole thing <malay>baru orang cakap kau rasa bila</malay> [oh] it wasn't only me
[ah] <malay>tapi</malay> okay <malay>tapi itu bukan</malay> the most scariest experience <malay>aku ada</malay> the one imagine <malay>ada satu kali tu kita orang ada</malay> staycation [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> staycation <malay>yang</malay> chalet <malay>dekat</malay> #pasir ris#

then the following year <malay>baru kita buat kat</malay> #pasir ris# <malay>pasal dorang dah</malay> renovate <malay>tempat dia</malay> so [ah] so that time <malay>aku pasal aku tak boleh</malay> overnight that day <malay>kita orang buat</malay> barbecue <malay>aku tolong</malay> the day before
<malay>pasal</malay> after that day barbecue [kan] <malay>kita balik siang cik</malay> #shahrul# fetch <malay>kita orang</malay>
so I decided to help a day earlier because <malay>kita ambil</malay> four days three night so thursday just <malay>ambil kunci</malay> friday <malay>datang petang</malay> decorate prepare <malay>benda-benda</malay> barbecue then saturday the event barbecue some more then saturday is the event sunday is the <malay>punya macam</malay> retreat <malay>pasal tengah ada</malay> submission

so then it was three of us <malay>sekejap lagi tengah buat kerja</malay> thirty minutes <malay>ke apa</malay> later
<malay>terus</malay> google <malay>punya ni</malay> google no it was google [ah] google [ah] <malay>atau</malay> SIRI SIRI <malay>ada pakai</malay> iphone
you have arrived at your destination
<malay>terus semua orang macam</malay>
don't say anything don't say anything <malay>tengah buat kerja</malay>
#astaghfirullah# #astaghfirullah# then after that <malay>terus balik</malay> [ah] imagine <malay>balik kul dua belas lebih daripada</malay> #pasir ris#
<malay>kau tahu</malay> [kan] the chalet we slept is <malay>tengah-tengah laut</malay> [eh] is at <malay>hujung depan dia laut pokok-pokok</malay> #pasir ris# park
[ah] [ah] [ah]
so like <malay>terus kita orang macam</malay> (hmm) that was the
the closest
scary experience <malay>pasal aku sendiri dengar</malay> I myself heard
that thing that beyond that <malay>macam aku kadang</malay> is it my just my imagination is it something that because from all those ghost story <malay>yang aku tengok</malay> or was it just me but this [one] everyone heard and everyone was like <malay>macam</malay>
okay let's not talk about this anymore so then <malay>cepat-cepat</malay> [ah] <malay>habiskan dorang yang tidur sana selamat macam gitu</malay>
but you don't seem like one <malay>aku nak tengok cerita hantu</malay>
mafia
for telegram <malay>ke</malay>
spy [lah] spy four
classroom <malay>yang mana</malay> which classroom
[oh] [ah] okay
so you will like
keep pointing fingers but no knowing who is the <malay>dia punya ni</malay>
but did you guys select the correct number of people playing
[ah]
<malay>mengundang</malay> [kan] <malay>mengundang</malay>
but those one of the stupid things <malay>korang buat lepas aku</malay> it was polytechnic <malay>punya</malay> time like it was during it was between <malay>kita orang punya</malay> from one class to another [oh] from one consultation to another consultation the session <malay>kalau tak salah</malay> [eh]
no it was during year three three point one where we still have a few attorney modules final modules to the end
ya but it's that is like the
other half
so <malay>macam daripada</malay> april to like before the september october september holiday I take a few module then after september october november is so september october november was my internship december came back to school for
all the way till april [lah]
[eh] all the way to january [eh] march all the way to march [lah]
then <malay>kita orang tengah tengok</malay> so from one class to another class is like three hours break <malay>pasal kita orang punya</malay> class straight so during that three hours we have our own <malay>lepak</malay> place and only we can enter only my course mates can enter the class [ah] tap to <malay>masuk</malay>
<malay>pasal lain semua tak boleh masuk</malay> so it became our <malay>macam</malay> hangout room for our course [ah]
so what happened was the <malay>dia punya</malay> laptop computer is inside a cupboard so the lecturer needs the key to open up certain things in order for him to play the project plan everything him being him
the most creative guy ever
<malay>tak tahu macam mana dia buat terus boleh pakai</malay> projector <malay>semua</malay> so <malay>kita</malay> have access to <malay>main cerita dia macam</malay> cupboard <malay>dia buka</malay>
<malay>dia yang buka</malay> the whole thing [ah] so <malay>kita buat</malay>
<malay>tak ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia</malay> just <malay>pakai macam</malay> ruler I don't know how he open I think it was just a <malay>macam</malay> he needs to put his hand into something to take out the wire that connects from the laptop to the projector so he managed to do that so even when the lecturer pass by <malay>dorang pun tak cakap apa-apa</malay> so
<malay>tak ada apa-apa</malay> [lah] so should be okay so <malay>kita tengok</malay> movie so like majority of us were in the class <malay>tengah tengok</malay> movie and
since <malay>dia</malay> is a glass door <malay>dia</malay> glass door <malay>kita kena orang luar boleh nampak kita</malay> but then the glass door <malay>dia tutup dengan</malay> projector <malay>kau faham</malay> [ah] so <malay>kita</malay> facing projector <malay>belakang</malay> projector glass door <malay>kira orang lalu boleh nampak tengah tengok</malay> so like <malay>macam</malay> some of my classmate <malay>dorang tak nak duduk tengok</malay> movie <malay>dorang nak keluar</malay> or <malay>lepak</malay> with others the mix [ah] from different courses or just <malay>nak pergi</malay> lunch so one of <malay>aku punya kawan masuk dia cakap</malay> [eh] what you guys are watching you know what we are watching shaun the sheep
the average age of students in the class were like what between
seven [eh] <malay>bukan</malay> eighteen nineteen eighteen to like the oldest one twenty six <malay>umur yang</malay> twenty six <malay>yang buka cerita</malay> shaun the sheep <malay>kau faham tak</malay> so we were watching shaun the sheep <malay>abeh kelakar-kelakar dah ketawa ketawa ketawa</malay> after that <malay>kita tengok cerita apa</malay> [tau] final destination five
the the contrast between the two movies so the friend <malay>yang</malay> shaun the sheep <malay>keluar dia masuk balik</malay> [kan] <malay>kita tengok</malay> final destination five <malay>dia macam</malay> !wow! you guys [ah] <malay>asal tengok</malay> one <malay>cerita</malay> to the other <malay>tapi kita tengok pun ketawa-ketawa</malay> but that was one of the best <malay>ni</malay> [lah]
and another best thing I <malay>yang kita orang pernah buat</malay> was
<malay>main</malay> hide and seek <malay>dekat</malay> airport
poly
<malay>akak punya</malay> clique my clique <malay>dengan</malay> a few guys so time <malay>tu kita orang dah habis</malay>
I think <malay>sebab kita orang habis sekolah siang ke apa ke pasal</malay> that day I think that day was
<malay>kita orang main</malay> terminal two <malay>kita orang main</malay> terminal two [ah] <malay>kita orang main</malay> hide and seek the thing is <malay>kita orang tak boleh</malay> hide <malay>dekat</malay> toilet [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> boys <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> girls toilet girls <malay>tak boleh masuk</malay> but it was so fun
we should play hide and seek at the airport you know
okay [lah] not now [lah] but
should play like if you have like a large group of friends to play <malay>main</malay> hide and seek <malay>paling</malay> best
!huh!
[ah] going to another classroom
thinking of all the possibilities that it could not be what I thinking it is
ya and then I ask my friend [lah] which I
and why you describing it to me now I'm starting to imagine okay
(um)
[ah]
are you sitting by the window
[ah] <malay>teman</malay>
[ah]
<malay>kau dah dengar cerita aku punya bukan cerita seram kelakar seram</malay> [ah] so during <malay>kita orang punya</malay>
secondary four secondary five <malay>kita pergi</malay> malaysia
<malay>tak</malay> [lah] no is different <malay>tak ada</malay> during our time <malay>tak ada</malay> such thing
so was when the graduating batch went a year before they graduate <malay>kita pergi</malay> overseas <malay>kita pergi</malay> malaysia and visit universities to <malay>macam kononnya</malay> future <malay>nak kenal-kenal</malay> [ah] universities <malay>luar</malay> singapore
so <malay>kita orang semua dapat bilik</malay> hotel okay [lah] actually <malay>ni cerita seram</malay> [ah]
so <malay>kita orang dapat bilik</malay> hotel so there are <malay>kita orang dibagi</malay> like our classes are being divided into three levels so example <malay>dia</malay> level seven eight nine so level seven <malay>semua</malay> guys
level nine <malay>semua</malay> girls
level eight either mix of guys either mix of girls
so <malay>macam</malay> guys <malay>punya</malay> room this thing is the guys room is <malay>sebelah depan</malay> girls room <malay>sebelah belakang</malay>
so there was this one time
<malay>jauh daripada</malay> lift so you have to walk in like <malay>macam</malay> and my room is one of the last few room for that floor <malay>kita orang punya</malay> that level <malay>kita punya</malay> room last few
<malay>akak punya bilik</malay>
and #kak mun# was also on the same floor so <malay>kita dua bukan</malay> the type <malay>yang akan takut</malay> because we usually travel go hotel [kan] so <malay>macam benda ni tak akan</malay> occur unless before this <malay>kita ada dengar orang-orang berbual</malay> which
unfortunately they did talk about or all these things that happen in their room [lah] so time <malay>tu kita ada</malay> <malay>ada macam</malay> seminar <malay>sekejap atau kat atas kat macam dia punya</malay> hall [ah] so <malay>aku dengan</malay> #kak mun# <malay>pun terlupa</malay> something so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> rush <malay>pergi bilik</malay> so #kak mun# <malay>dengan bilik aku sama</malay> level [ah]
so <malay>kita masuk terus</malay> time <malay>tu ada</malay> hall and it's a long way [tau] like <malay>macam</malay> [ah] the corridor <malay>macam panjang</malay> have to pass by around ten rooms
the room <malay>dia macam</malay> zig zag
so #kak mun# <malay>punya</malay> room is around seven <malay>aku punya</malay> room eleven <malay>tak salah</malay>
<malay>sama</malay> floor <malay>tak ada dalam bilik tu ada empat orang dua</malay> sec five <malay>dua</malay> sec four <malay>dua</malay> sec five <malay>dua</malay> sec four <malay>dorang</malay> split <malay>macam gitu</malay> [ah]
<malay>lepas tu kita orang lari</malay>
<malay>terus aku tengok</malay> #kak mun# <malay>tengok</malay> each other <malay>lari masuk bilik letak benda lari</malay>
<malay>patah balik</malay> all the way
<malay>itu</malay> the worst experience
<malay>tak</malay> they dim the whole the very old school <malay>punya macam</malay> yellow light corridor and the carpet was red

A&T [kan] then <malay>apa macam ada dia orang cakap kat situ</malay> I tell you the number one nine seven two

ya you know that you are actually
ya do you know that actually are you are supposed to
!huh! what is it [ah] actually you are supposed to go and get her like tested that like for five years ago like when it was at the peak of the light where she keep asking is it already <malay>azan</malay> is it time to pray is you already <malay>azan</malay> then you can get their diagnoses which is at the mild stage because right now already at the moderate right
so it was at the mild stage right you should
gotten it diagnosed then because if you get got it diagnosed then then doctor can frequently follow up but they cannot just do [ah] the
(err) what actually dementia you can see from their brain that it is (um) they having dementia [lah] but because stroke also can cause you to have some deformities in the brain say dementia is still like a mental condition right they have to do all test there like depression schizophrenia all these they still do test
like verbal assessments you know but
it is there's some like the guidelines to [ah] diagnose mental conditions <malay>susah</malay> like it is continuous assessment because [ah] <malay>apa</malay>
doctor <malay>cakap macam</malay> okay <malay>dah dia ni</malay> he show like five out [ah] like out of ten he show eight sign then ya diagnosed with dementia or depression but then <malay>apa</malay>

[ah] <malay>tu dah</malay> schizophrenia <malay>tu</malay> but then you see is like mental condition is <malay>terlalu susah</malay> cause
it's continuous assessment that's why dementia you'd all these mental condition you get diagnosed early you are follow up by doctor psychiatrist early like continuously so they know they see a progression <malay>dia ni</malay> [oh] <malay>dia ni dah tukar dah lain</malay>

quote and be be scold or something also like that right <malay>pun tak boleh</malay> because <malay>apa</malay>
ya so like if there is something like that I think it's very attractive [lah] because some is an enclosed space so you can come and visit your
family members isn't that in singapore if we don't use it have enough resource <malay>kita tak ada banyak kebolehan untuk</malay> like build something from scratch start from ground zero we have no space and then it's like
our only resource <malay>kita punya apa kita ada</malay> is [ah] <malay>hasil kita</malay> is <malay>orang</malay> you know we only have people that I would like crops like that that we can export and import so that's why like
you wanna have a village like that it has to be somewhere that is already developed that still needs more developing like nursing (um)
you know those (uh) I think last time your late aunty [ah] <malay>arwah tu dia duduk situ</malay>
[ah]
<malay>apa</malay>
you mean senior activities <malay>macam tu</malay>
but if you have to understand <malay>sebab kalau dia orang keluarkan</malay> I think <malay>banyak sangat orang nak</malay> literally like rental flats are never enough in singapore
ya
but (um) <malay>apa</malay>
the (mmhmm)
there are because like if they know then some people might take advantage of it
<malay>macam</malay> that time <malay>yang</malay> for hundred dollar COVID fund <malay>tu orang ambil</malay> advantage
ya
ya
<malay>tu</malay> [lah]
ya
I think
for like the elderly right is you in okay maybe not in singapore because I'm mean in singapore but why doubt popular another reason is <malay>orang dah tua orang nak pergi masjid nak pergi</malay> temple <malay>nak pergi</malay> church
you <malay>ada</malay> that club house especially as senior activity centre it doesn't appeal do you know that that clubhouse one session can facilitate up to thirty maximum sixty [lah] if the centre is really big
but if you have (um) your rental flat that is above it right that studio apartment that is above you have two hundred to four hundred unit [eh] two hundred unit so two hundred units
ya so it's like there are people who have to go every everyday because they are alone and very at risk <malay>tapi</malay> for those <malay>yang habis</malay> bad manpower is in low you know like if there's not enough space so <malay>macam</malay>
and not in the activities to appeal to everyone <malay>tak tak semua orang nak</malay> karaoke <malay>tak semua orang nak</malay> colour <malay>tak semua orang nak main</malay> #mahjong# <malay>ada orang nak pergi</malay> church <malay>nak pergi solat</malay> you know <malay>nak pergi</malay> prayer <malay>nak pergi</malay> temple so it's like
they should be away like for it to integrate (um) the spiritual part plus the active aging but it's just that <malay>dekat</malay> singapore is black <malay>kita</malay> neutral [kan] kita apa</malay>
(um) <malay>kita apa macam mana nak cakap apa tu yang</malay>
[ah] <malay>kita tak nak</malay> emphasize right that kind of thing you know and then
so because of that it is not about how I should say are very highly encouraging play a country to practice your religion first that if <malay>tapi kita kena buat</malay> moderately <malay>kita tak boleh</malay> over of course [lah] <malay>kita tak nak</malay> extremist [kan] <malay>kita nak</malay> be good to our neighbours
but because her dad like everybody has (err) I mean maybe not just singapore everybody
it every individual <malay>tahap</malay> (um) how religious they are <malay>tahap dia punya iman</malay> it's more like eat in the bowl
so <malay>bila</malay> you <malay>nak bawa orang orang ni cakap</malay> okay [ah] <malay>siapa nak pergi</malay> mall <malay>nak buat</malay> you know <malay>macam kalau</malay> let's say <malay>dia orang taruk</malay> rental flat like one of the benefit <malay>atau</malay> studio apartment [eh] what are the benefit is <malay>boleh buat pergi</malay> church temple and
(um) mosque mosque this mosque <malay>lepas tu</malay> [ah] church let's say is a catholic church then [ah]
temple is a hindu temple
you know but how about the buddhist how about the carton how about the christians how about any
ya [lah]
(mm) ya
but I didn't <malay>tinggalkan dia seorang seorang</malay>
I think
(mm) ya (mm)
(mm)
(mm)
I'm not
so I I wanted that I'm not so keen but I'm not so sure about how it will pan out like because I'm not raised in the environment you know I'm raised in like <malay>nenek dekat rumah</malay>
that kind of thing then (um) then like then
(um) how to say [ah] <malay>macam nenek kat rumah</malay> so I am not the one that go out to seek my to accompany my elders my elders is the one that (um) my elders is the one that come [ah]
anything with me if with my family right so it's like you know that that the dynamic is already different <malay>dia punya</malay> (um) relationship is different so
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] I I think it's not that I'm not keen maybe it's the fear of the unknown because I'm not used to it [mah] so it's like I'm I don't know how will it
[a'ah]
ya so like or don't no and then I feel maybe
(um) I feel sad also <malay>macam budak-budak kecil budak-budak</malay> secondary school <malay>yang macam dia orang nak duduk dekat rumah dalam bilik dia orang</malay> because they are because they are the oldest [one]
then <malay>dia orang nak kena</malay> sacrifice <malay>nak kena pergi rumah nenek</malay>
(mm)
(oo)
I think there are a few points that be
take away from here is the number one
<malay>apa</malay> [ah] for those elder grandkids who have been tasked to take care of the grandparents to accompany I think (um) the parents should the parents themselves should naturally let it flow you know
[oh] <malay>semalam ada cakap</malay> [kan] the discussion <malay>dari kecil</malay> is what is important how you <malay>didik</malay> and show right (um)
because
<malay>kalau</malay> you <malay>tunjuk dia orang</malay> that [oh] you have to go you monday is usually is me feel like !alamak! this is a task this is a task
[ah]
[ah] because once it becomes a task it becomes a chore <malay>nanti macam tak</malay> happy then ya but you know you can never know even though they are your kids they are still human beings you made me me like what they are actually very happy with the idea because for me it be like
(mm)
why didn't you do [lah] <malay>bila kita nak kena pergi</malay>
<malay>ke apa kita tak nak pergi sebab apa</malay> [oh] cannot cannot I need to take care of my grandma if my friend <malay>ajak</malay> me go out <malay>nak keluar</malay> [oh] sorry sorry <malay>tak boleh tak boleh</malay> need to take care of my grandma you know like is it for me <malay>nenek dah kat rumah</malay> it convenient
but
but it's just me like I because I don't like to travel so you are convenient [lah] that I'm already at my house like that
ya it is a team effort <malay>macam mana dekat</malay> nursing home <malay>ada satu orang satu orang</malay> [jer] <malay>ada tiga orang</malay>
<malay>tadi</malay>
ya but so <malay>jadi ke masa cakap apalah kebaikan apalah sebaliknya jaga penjagaan</malay> like you all this <malay>tanya</malay> right <malay>dah tak cabaran lagi</malay> [lah] so it's just a learning experience
<malay>sebaliknya penjagaan ini</malay>
<malay>tapi</malay>
<malay>tadi mak cakap yang apa jaga nenek baru dapat tahu macam mana nak lain kali</malay> in the future <malay>macam mana mak nak dijaga</malay> don't you think that is the reward don't you think that is the <malay>syurga</malay>
ya so
(mm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
you think you have
(um) next [ah] what
I think
so far from what I learned about this are taking care of a being a secondary caregiver or living in the same household right
is that you have to always <malay>selalu</malay>
be prepared to <malay>tukar</malay> mindset
[a'ah]
what I think
<malay>tukar</malay> mindset
ya like
that's the main thing that's the main thing ya like you have to always be prepared like because the thing is for progressive condition right
then you move on on on you
it's like <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] if metaphorically is if you put it in a
so you like you're drowning you
you can [ah] whatever <malay>makin turun makin turun kalau</malay> you <malay>tukar</malay> your you will say okay I'm trying to swim now okay swimming doesn't work okay let me take a path I let me do some breathing exercises that me just tried to float for a while you know
I try to swim okay let me [ah] see how I if I can go and get help it really is that they're getting help
[ah] swimming is trying to move forward right is really paying like you really can't and sometimes when you want
swimming you are trying to get to where you want to go you get a cramp in your leg and then there is like you know you <malay>patah balik patah balik</malay> right <malay>kadang-kadang</malay> like it can be like
it three weeks of peaceful snipping all of a sudden one day it is [ah] again ya and <malay>apa</malay> that sucks [lah] because
<malay>apa kita selalu</malay> (um) try our best too you (oo) <malay>kita nak beritahu mak kita jumpa kawan kita hari tu</malay> imagine [eh] <malay>kalau</malay>
<malay>dia badan langsing</malay>
and <malay>dia cakap</malay> lecturer <malay>dia</malay> is [ah] <malay>mak dia pun ada</malay> dementia she's the main caregiver [lah] okay you when even a lady who is teaching nursing who you would know is a <malay>pakar</malay> a professional in these right in having patience and <malay>kesabaran</malay> cause they take care [kan]
she also experiences ya she was experience caregiver stress that really affect her work so what my <malay>kawan bilang</malay> me was that
(uh) okay [lah] <malay>dia</malay> because <malay>dia ada</malay> background the towel the thick and jake's dump the limit jacket you should you hire professional you know they know what to do so her her tips and tricks is that the disrupt
the incident was (um) <malay>dia</malay> try her very very best <malay>untuk mak dia tak akan berak dan kencing</malay> anywhere
<malay>bila nak berak</malay> [kan] <malay>dan kencing</malay> I <malay>rasa dia ada strategi</malay> [lah] <malay>macam</malay> every one hour you bring every minute you bring you know that kind of thing she has already picked up the mothers are non-verbal cue (err) <malay>bila dia nak pergi berak nak pergi kencing dia cakap</malay> I try my very best I try so hard and it happen
<malay>siapa dia nak marah tu dia nak marah mak dia ke mak dia</malay> cannot help it [kan] <malay>dia nak marah diri dia ke dia ada</malay> choice all along ya so she like even like a I'm not sure whether nursing professionals or [what] [lah] but a professional who is teaching
(mm)
it's like (um)
it's like <malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] ya like okay now I realise that even you doctor you nurse as you <malay>ni cuma</malay> you you also don't treat the patient twenty four seven
family <malay>yang dah ada</malay> history with that person and then like you they have a lot of emotional
attachment for nurses and practitioners they can always be like okay this is not working you try as so much with your client you try and like ask them work with then work with the family <malay>tapi kalau</malay> family do decide that one day
you know why I believe that it is not working I would like to close the case I would like to go somewhere else then you you have to be let alright I will close the case and then
what for the (um) for the
professional sometimes if they feel like the case is not is not going smoothly it's not working out they can actually feedback to their supervisor and be like I'm sorry but I think this case any if not working out you know
there is a professional boundary where you stop at like you will never go beyond it so like family there is no like is unconditional you <malay>selalu kena</malay> not not <malay>selalu kena</malay> actually you have to always be there [what] not what not
you already have that bond and the attachment
and for professionals that is that boundary
ya
(mm)
(mm) (mm)
ya
ya you guys are doing experimenting on your own you know like that's what doctors want it's because doctors are not there twenty four seven
sometimes doctors are also like unhappy [lah] like you want you keep the medication here medication there but it's just that dementia is so different that dementia is not
yet studied in that I guess especially in the asian society dementia is the <malay>terikut perangai lama</malay> [jer] <malay>perangai lamanya mana doktor tahu</malay> you know even like as much as you share with the doctor or my mother is like this like this like this
but <malay>doktor macam</malay> as much they are only able to do so much with the information you give <malay>tapi</malay> like I
think I had one someone I know right (um) <malay>dia punya mak dia tak nak makan kat rumah cakap makanan tu berpasir</malay> [lah] <malay>apalah</malay> [a'ah] <malay>macam tak suka kalau anak balik lagi</malay> so it's like instead of
sitting and eating that meal half an hour she takes four hours to finish that meal [ah] but did you know what actually what is the history is because she ya she stay in a different child's house now <malay>anak dia yang dulu duduk dengan dia ada dia ada bermampu</malay> [lah]
<malay>untuk bawa dia keluar makan tapi</malay> dementia makes you lose your ability to communicate right so <malay>dia tak tahu macam mana dia nak cakap yang dia nak makan kat luar</malay>
[ah]
(mm)
<malay>jadi cerita dia macam ni</malay> (mm)
(mm) so we know [lah] that communication is like the key to
(mm)
(mm)
<malay>dia cerita dia macam ni</malay> [lah] like
dementia is you can (um) <malay>jaga</malay> because you have heard stories fifteen years taking care but (um) it's your ability can you go through it or not and communicate they lose a lot of things they lose communication they lose their memory they lose their ability so
(mm)
(mm)
phenomenon
[oh] okay [lah]
yup so it's very important to communicate with your family members because <malay>walaupun jaga</malay> dementia <malay>ke tak bila dah nak tua</malay> like <malay>mak cakap</malay> the blessing in all of this is that you know next time how you want to be taken care of <malay>macam mana mak nak dijaga jadi mak tahu mak nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak</malay> so <malay>bila nak cakap dengan anak-anak mak sekarang</malay>
okay

#stalisha#
my day today is very tiring obviously (um) it's been two days [ah] I sleep very late
<malay>dalam pukul enam pagi</malay>
because I started a business selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> selling <malay>tahu begedil</malay> yes
(um) and so far it's been well (um) it went well
unexpectedly but it's still so tiring [lah]
basically because I like to eat <malay>tahu begedil</malay>
(um) quite recently [eh] [ah] like last month [ah] late last month when <malay>tahu begedil</malay> was was like a trend
(um) it's among the home-based sellers [lah]
ya it became a trend and everyone is like trying and I tried like two locals'
(um) <malay>tahu begedil</malay> and they both
have their
<malay>apa tu macam ada</malay> [lah] <malay>dia punya kesedapan tu</malay> [kan] ya
ya and then I tried myself
so ya
actually I've been learning how to cook
for a while because <malay>ibu</malay> force me to
but (um) making this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> of course I only started recently
when I like crave it
and at that time there were no orders
(um) [eh] I mean there were no <malay>macam kedai</malay> taking any orders so like I decide just to do myself
[ah] [ah]
customers [ah]
yes
delivery is
(um) by my partner he because he also did Deliveroo as a part time
and ya [ah] so every delivery charges I will just pay him straight [lah] hundred per cent goes to him
this is only the first
the first launch ya the first week of it
ya yesterday and today
(um)
I don't think it will sustain in a in the long run because
I have a lot of things to do
[ah] I have school I have (um) freelance job I have part time jobs I have a lot of things to juggle
so I think [ah] this <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I will only sell <malay>bila ada</malay> time [lah] <malay>macam</malay> holidays
ya
go [ah] because this is not like an official business this is just like
something that I like to do and share with other people
and maybe like some in the future the menu will change [lah] because I like to bake also
so maybe like maybe the next week is not <malay>tahu begedil</malay> it's like
(um) brownies or cookies something like that
branding
[oh] I didn't call I didn't name it but <malay>ibu</malay> and <malay>abang</malay> named it as
#tahbegs# #tahbegs#
ya it's #tahbegs# is from #tahu# and #begedil# but we make it very hipster
so it's #tahbegs#
ya T H B E G S
[oh] ya (um) I also own a small business selling #bawals#
<malay>bawal</malay> yes <malay>tudung bawal</malay> you know there's square scarf
[eh] it's on hold right now because we literally have no idea what the next collection will be [eh] next collection will be
collection
ya
for now we only have two collections
(um) one is the our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> and another is our satin silk
matte satin silk <malay>bawal</malay> and our cotton <malay>bawal</malay> it sells
(um) better than our recent one
so and the stocks is like stuck up there because I guess we didn't learn about our customers that well yet
[ah] because (um) me and my partner [lah]
ya we we
<malay>kita suka</malay> try <malay>benda</malay> like try to do things new things and we try to ya [lah]
ya we like to okay the most common thing about both of us is we like to hustle
we hustle a lot <malay>macam tak kesah</malay> [ah] <malay>kalau hari-hari kerja</malay>
<malay>asalkan</malay> like <malay>kita boleh rasa duit tu</malay> [ah]
[ah] #inshallah# !wah! <malay>untuk</malay> [ah] <malay>benda yang halal</malay>
twenty one
that young
[oh]
[ah]
(mm) (mm)
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
that's the best you can sleep
[oh] okay okay okay
you are staying still for two and a half hours
[oh] (mm) [ah]
(mm) (mm)
!wow! okay
(uh) (uh)
(mm) (mm)
I you like wrapped
[oh] like <malay>mati macam melayu</malay>
[oh] okay okay okay
(uh) (uh)
(uh) (uh)
[oh] my god
they didn't pay you
[oh] ya ya ya
(mm) (mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] I see
(um)
what am I doing at nineteen
(um) I work
part time
ya at Starbucks and I was also schooling
at that point and also doing my freelance model
I start since I was
seventeen years old
(um)
there was this
<malay>apa tu</malay> open casting for new models
and then (um) I was very camera shy last time
like <malay>tak suka ambil gambar</malay> and I don't feel like I was pretty to become a model a <malay>hijabi</malay> model
so I'm like [meh] like I I don't even bother [lah] but then my partner saw like [eh] you should try [lah] you just try then [orh]
I said no I don't want (err) I'm not comfortable with other people taking photos of me because it's very awkward
then say just try one and then he post the (um) the the model entry
on Instagram
and
ya I did know
[ah] he applied to two [ah] company and I got accepted by two of them both of them
[ah] it was an unpaid job
for
(um) until I was maybe
(um) nineteen
so did
instead of paying me by money they pay me by
(um)
by their apparel
so I was a bit stupid at that point of time no I I didn't <malay>simpan</malay> because the quality is like shit
it's like so bad and then then like imagine like (um) the shooting place is like gardens by the bay then like the amount of time I need to travel there
and then I come back with just a piece of <malay>tudung</malay> for me it's like <malay>merepek</malay> so
(err) when it comes to nineteen years old something like somewhere there
<malay>ibu</malay> (um)
tell me [lah] like [oh] you need to start
(um) charging these people because you are having a lot of (um)
<malay>apa ni</malay> (um) shops coming to you (uh) for shooting she said then okay [lah] I start from fifteen dollars now I charge fifty per hour
and #alhamdulillah# it also went well
[ah]
people also come to me (um) to do to create <malay>apa</malay> to help their business boost by doing marketing and video edits
so people always see me as like the those model influencer but I don't consider myself as an influencer I'm just helping business to
(um) sell their products [ah]
ya
influencer I feel like they just
take
I don't know whatever <malay>barang</malay> that the company gave with plus money and then they just look pretty on it
because I've tried (uh) an influencer before to boost start my (um) Kamash (um) the <malay>tudung</malay> brand
(uh) and it didn't work [ah]
I lost two hundred and fifty dollars
because [ah] her charges was hundred fifty for one Instagram post
and fifty dollars
for one story
and it does it didn't
bring any sales [lah] so I was like okay (um) actually I would rate influencers is our customers
ya the most honest person and they can make sales and they (um) they really spread the word and tag you know
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
other companies ya
(mmhmm)
usually (um) before we post something right for the company we also like send the
<malay>apa tu</malay> our
what do they call it
okay [lah] the context [ah] the context of the post [ah] we
ya the description we always like (um) send it
to the company first let them approve <malay>apa-apa macam</malay> if they want to change they can change and then then we just write it up some people [ah] <malay>macam tambah-tambah</malay> [lah] [ah] themselves and then they
then they send back to us then <malay>baru kita</malay> copy paste and then put
[ah] on our post
(uh) it's our post because we are like (um) ya
usually is like that
[ah] no that that's the thing that's why I don't (um) I don't
consider myself an influencer because
I don't think I'm a good influence influence to young people
to be honest just that people a lot of people look up to me because I'm very hype
that's all
sorry
because like (um) they told me [lah] like they don't know how I juggle because I was a full time student and being a fashion designer
(um) is very difficult
(um) and it's very time consuming so
there's people like
they quit their part time because they really cannot juggle [lah] but for me I can at that point of time I can juggle two jobs my freelance and Starbucks
and like before school like I mean
imagine like school starts at twelve A twelve
so I work Starbucks from six opening to eleven
and then I go school and then after school (um) there's a photo shoot maybe that lesson (um) end at three or four
so the shoot starts at like six six P M until night [lah] something like that
ya it's like it's very bad [lah] is unhealthy also but ya a lot of people look up to me because if I want to work hard I really work
for it
I want to open up (uh) my own company [ah]
selling clothes selling <malay>muslimah</malay> clothes but of course not those you know typical those resellers or whatever it's just like
(um)
from my own manufacture from my own designs everything
!alamak! we didn't sign up for a third party
the company
(mm)
because all of this (um) of course I did research prior
and
I am thankful that my school also
teach marketing
and ya I got to apply a lot of you know what I learn from school put into business and
like one thing that I really see something wrong with my business is not knowing my customers well and at the same time at that point of time I was like learning this
(um) creative thinking creative thinking is where you
know your customers well [lah] and
<malay>macam</malay> [ah] you need to do your research (err) do survey do prototype everything
(uh) (uh)
ya
yes the sustain is very difficult
and like
(um) sellers <malay>terdahulu biasa</malay> about <malay>apa yang dorang suka</malay> instead of what
their customers like
you get what I mean <malay>macam</malay> they
assume that [orh] <malay>aku suka ni</malay> so confirm <malay>orang lain akan suka</malay>
it
hundred percent wrong in so many ways because we cannot just assume like that
ya and ya there's a lot of
that's one of the difficult things that I face [lah] when I'm opening this (um) Kamash
<malay>pasal</malay> (um) a lot of people say [eh] <malay>ni lawa</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> confirm <malay>ada orang suka</malay> but we cannot hear what our family members really (um) say we need to reach out to people
(um)
yes
and
ya one mistake is I listen to my partner's mum [ah] she said like [orh] <malay>ni</malay> colour <malay>cantik</malay> everything whatever shit
but then actually <malay>salah</malay> [ah] it's not selling our first
out first what [ah] [ah]
ya and I thought no it's nice it's luxurious but
but my customers are young
so they want things very
simple <malay>macam</malay> not too flashy can be an everyday wear so our first collection was successful <malay>tapi</malay> a lot of people was doubting like especially families were doubting
like [eh] [eh] <malay>ni mana ada orang pakai</malay> cotton <malay>lagi</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> [kan] <malay>panas</malay> but it sell out like a lot (um) we bought I'm ten colours
eight colours already sold out
ya
[ah] we manufacture ourself
[ah] no (uh) we liaise with a factory in #jakarta#
yes
research
we need a lot of research yes
(mm)
no [lah] I mean like obviously (uh) when you grow up
[eh]
[ah] my god okay it needs to switch
naturally (um)
<malay>bila dah membesar</malay> right <malay>sambil membesar</malay>
ya <malay>sambil nak membesar tu kita selalu tukar-tukar</malay> [tau] <malay>apa kita nak jadi apa kita suka</malay>
so firstly I really wanted to be a lawyer
I love debating a lot ya I love debating and then <malay>ibu tak suka</malay> so like okay then I say I told her I want to be a nurse
(um) she said [oh] you know (um) <malay>macam</malay> she tell told me all the negative things [lah] all the
cons about being a nurse
and then [ah]
it's like <malay>jaga mayat</malay> <malay>jaga mayat</malay> and then like
some personal reasons [lah] for me but I feel like it's very selfish of her because her that personal reason I cannot become what I want to become
and also another thing I like to travel around the world
so I thought I want to be a
crew
but of course <malay>ibu</malay> also <malay>tak kasi</malay> because she say I will <malay>mati cepat</malay> the I'm like <malay>kalau ajal tu ada mati</malay> [lah] I mean like we cannot
<malay>macam mana nak cakap</malay> [eh] like
those type of
incident
car crash [eh] plane crash ya
you cannot like foresee [what]
and
ya [lah] exactly then I was like okay sure
so [ah] basically [ah]
technically this what I'm doing right now fashion design is what <malay>ibu</malay> wants me to do [lah]
so I'm like okay [lah] since I cannot do anything else right I just learn fashion design and that's where I
grew to liking it
(um) ya
ya first you said you want to be doctor
right
ya I want to be
what doctor [orh] an acting
[orh] okay [ah] clown doctor
okay
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
ya
[oh] okay
(uh)
I can fix my own teeth
(mm)
(mm)
!wow!
ya
[oh] my god
so that's what
inspired you to become an actor
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mm) I see
now last time I remember the first play that I went
[eh] the first ya your first show is it
is the <malay>hantu</malay> remember
ya the first show I've watched and it was I think that was the most
favourite
like
ya show I've been too because it's like so nice and it's mix of scary because I was little <malay>masih kecil</malay> [kan] that time
so its mix of scary and like very funny then I'm like it's very interesting it's also my first time like
watching a theatre like !wah!
well quite nice [lor]
so
ya
but it was good though
(mm)
[oh] I see
[oh]
(mmhmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mm)
ya that's that's the thing
(um) usually people are afraid to set a price
(um)
we calculate our expenses [ah] and everything
and then we just like divide it and then we see [lah] (um) like we come up with a few prices and then we see a range like [oh] we can sell it from this price to this price no (uh) no lower than that
if it's lower than that (um) means
(uh) <malay>apa tu</malay> (um) <malay>aku rugi</malay> [lah] (mm) (mm)
obviously <malay>tahu begedil</malay> I I can eat that every day then after that I always doubt myself like [oh] I need to to control myself because
<malay>dah lama nanti aku aku juga jadi santau bagedil</malay> [kan]
<malay>tak</malay> okay <malay>aku tak boleh tak makan</malay> but if I can
and not gain weight I will eat it everyday
ya
(mm) (mm)
ya
why is it that nice
ya but not #chai# I don't like #chai#
[oh] really
[oh] I see
[ah] [ah]
tak
ya
it's continuing
ya it's a bit much
[oh] my god no wonder ya ya ya
ya ya ya
but you would rather eat something healthy every day the hell
[oh] okay you thinking far
yes
(uh huh)
[oh] okay okay okay
<malay>apa</malay> [seh]
I don't know [ah] I feel like
even if people <malay>bila</malay>
during a sale for a plastic spoon people will still buy it
I don't know
[oh] ya
why would you need okay those like big things like tables fridge (um) washing machine
!wow! such expensive
but you need to there's a lot of electricity
coming in [what] and you use a lot of water
first martial arts
ya
I don't know I feel
<malay>silat</malay> ya but then we stop because like (um)
the <malay>penjuru</malay> is it the guru the head of the <malay>silat</malay> or something like that I don't know what what they call him
he <malay>campur</malay> with
<malay>benda tak elok</malay> [lah] (um) with
<malay>jin</malay> yes
no sister his sister <malay>yang ini kat luar</malay> I it was at #sengkang# it was at #sengkang# you know those <malay>macam</malay> got court badminton court ya we <malay>silat</malay> there
and then like I was training at
one point of time <malay>macam tengah buat benda sendiri</malay> [ah] and then like
<malay>tapi</malay> like I saw this <malay>guru</malay> and this student like a teenage student
(um) <malay>tengah terbaring</malay> [tau]
and then
the guru is like <malay>macam gitu macam baca-baca</malay> then I'm like what the hell is this person doing like (um) like what <malay>macam dia sakit ke</malay> I don't know anything but then I heard that she was
he made that person <malay>rasuk</malay> [lah] <malay>katakan</malay>
ya ya on purpose I don't know I have no idea
so I was like ya because there's (um)
one of our uncle also was in the same <malay>silat</malay> with us <malay>siapa tu</malay> [ah] #ariff# [ah] he quitted first and then we quit
so ya
I feel like is a traditional (err) okay (um) one thing I learned about <malay>silat</malay> while doing my research for my last time was
the their <malay>silat</malay> is actually
(um) how to say [ah]
they hold their respect [lah] towards their opponent
[a'ah] <malay>tekan</malay>
like how to say (um) okay <malay>selalunya sekarang orang kat luar</malay> [kan] <malay>dorang gaduh</malay> [kan] <malay>dia rembat</malay> [jer] <malay>tapi dulu masa orang melayu zaman dulu</malay> when they are in a battle
(um) they <malay>tunjuk</malay> respect to one another first and they you know <malay>buka bunga</malay> is where you show like [oh] are you ready
to <malay>silat</malay> then ya
ya <malay>macam gitu</malay> [lah]
like are ready to like [ah] I want to challenge you are you agree or not do you agree or not ya
last time they really gold the <malay>adat</malay> [lah]
various [lah] <malay>silat</malay> #taekwando#
a lot of things
it's also for like self defence purposes especially when you are a woman
ya
(um)
but
ya
so you literally need to fly
you need to like jump and like
[oh] okay okay okay I can see
(mm)
counselling
no
for who for kids
[oh]
ya
no violent cause
no
!huh!
(uh huh)
cannot two weeks [ah]
ya
as long as you <malay>belah</malay> after two weeks [ah] I don't mind
<malay>lama</malay>
(mm)
(hmm)
ya
(mm)
ya correct
(mmhmm)
(mm)
(mmhmm)
(mmhmm)
[oh] like to ask if you think like it's rude
is it
ya
I feel like the only
the problem with that it's just the people
they cannot they cannot stand being direct
ya
the see it as rude rather than being straightforward
like being straightforward it's like just say [lah] like [oh] <malay>apa</malay> I don't like it like can you like pick pick the clothes up
but to them I say [oh] okay I'm so sorry I will like improve myself I'll be like pick up the clothes
like (uh) <malay>aku akan ambil macam angkat</malay> [ah] <malay>baju-baju kotor ni</malay> but some people see it as rude <malay>macam</malay> [orh]
(uh) so <malay>macam katakan kau tak nak aku sini</malay> [ah] <malay>aku kena buat semua benda</malay> [ah] <malay>kat rumah ni</malay>
so something like that
what if what
if you drop everything to follow your dreams
what would you risk
I don't know [eh]
ya the <malay>melayu</malay> so formal I cannot
[ah] no we only speak it when <malay>ada</malay> oral <malay>ke</malay>
!wah! that was so long time ago
<malay>melayu</malay>
with <malay>abang</malay>
<malay>biasanya</malay> with <malay>abang</malay> or <malay>ibu</malay> a bit [lah] <malay>macam gini</malay> [lah] like transition between english and malay but for #hilah# hundred percent english
ya and !wow! her malay is just
I think her malay is very formal
ya
ya
(uh)
[ah] I also don't know [eh] but (um) one of my friends like <malay>dia sekarang dalam</malay> uni and he is a
he major in journalist <malay>bahasa melayu</malay> [lah] so
when I see his works he !wah! like
I feel like
I don't know malay at all because it's another
language ya <malay>macam ada perkataan</malay> like <malay>tak pernah dengar</malay> and then like the whole sentence like what I don't even understand
so <malay>macam</malay> I feel like
<malay>bahasa melayu ni</malay> is not for today [lah]
it's more of
<malay>orang dulu-dulu</malay> because <malay>orang dulu</malay>
<malay>macam bahasa baku</malay> [kan]
ya correct
it's
like singlish [lah]
<malay>macam</malay>
we don't usually speak like this but
along the way people <malay>macam</malay> get lazier and they tend to shorten the words so instead of <malay>dekat kau kena</malay>

because I remember reading before <malay>dia orang kata</malay> can just keep
(um) can just keep in the box you know keep in a dry place
keep in a box the original [ah] in the dust bag the box and then at a dry place
but then so I thought cause my bags now are in their zips <malay>dekat dia orang punya</malay> zips covered [kan] in in like its original packaging <malay>kita tak buka</malay> so it's all just there <malay>abeh kita takut</malay> [ah] okay so I thought was safe
<malay>abeh</malay> I followed his wife <malay>macam</malay> a luxury person [lah] okay on instagram <malay>abeh dia ada macam</malay> Q&A session <malay>gitu</malay> sometimes <malay>abeh dia punya</malay> one of <malay>dia punya itu</malay> is (um) don't keep it in the original box like take it out it needs to breathe sometimes sometime <malay>abeh</malay> if you keep it for inside for too long then because it's leather and everything right then (um) the humidity and also whatever whatever
okay but I don't know and I've kept like this one bag has
been in their zip in the cupboard
since like august
ya so so I'm worried about it <malay>tapi kalau</malay> if I ask him to <malay>keluarkan</malay>
then <malay>tak</malay> [oh] my god <malay>tapi</malay> that time <malay>itu saya tengah</malay> because <malay>saya beli banyak benda</malay> [kan] then I just have this small section in the cupboard now because <malay>kakak dia belum keluarkan</malay> her clothes
so in that so <malay>ada</malay> a small section where I can put the stuff [lah] <malay>abeh</malay>
you know <malay>bila macam nak</malay> unboxing or whatever right you want to keep like the the boxes and the the the bags you know what is it called the the yellow bag [ah] <malay>macam</malay> all nice <malay>gitu</malay> [kan] so !woohoo! open it up
so okay you need to carefully place everything
(um) so that they can all fit nicely
and then like (um) without crumpling or whatever [lah]
then <malay>tak</malay> enough space [tau] so long as it can I can you <malay>gerakkan</malay> your <malay>tempat baju sikit</malay> so that I can more space <malay>lepas itu dia</malay> how why you just <malay>taruh dekat atas</malay> [lah] then no <malay>nanti</malay> crumple so what it's just a bag case so the thing is <malay>kalau kak suruh dia</malay> like can you <malay>keluarkan</malay> this bag just to check the bag I already know how's he handle he's going to handle the bag
<malay>nanti dia</malay> just <malay>macam campak</malay> or whatever <malay>nanti semua</malay> like I don't know <malay>nanti macam</malay> crumpled or whatever because he just doesn't care for this and ya
so that's why <malay>macam</malay> [oh] if I want to check ya probably like check then I have to I have to go there myself
and like check on the bag but the thing is now <malay>kak punya kerja</malay> like
I don't want to the days that I have off
I always say I don't want to do anything
just <malay>nak duduk rumah</malay> ya
ya I thought of that also
(um) because now <malay>dia</malay> apple boy he got a macbook
we can face time phone we are waiting for our contract to end
then when your contract ends <malay>kita sama tak</malay> mine is on february
<malay>tapi</malay> yours is the same <malay>kita sama</malay> plan [kan] <malay>ada abah</malay>
[oh]
[oh]
then when did we get ours
[oh]
okay ya so this was before ours for ours you got yours or ours okay then then ya but anyway I think <malay>dia punya pun</malay> end at like end of the year or something like that then probably we'll change to iphone [ah]
where did you change
he hasn't been using a laptop for awhile
ya then <malay>macam</malay> all the other laptops <malay>macam</malay> will
die faster or something [lah] something to start then cause I told him that my macbook has
can survive like freaking seven or eight years or something
[ah] then <malay>macam</malay> not bad [ah] then like ya <malay>macam</malay>
<malay>macam</malay> all the food that <malay>abah simpan masih boleh masih boleh pakai</malay> [seh]
then <malay>dia</malay> okay [lah] then <malay>dia</malay> ya

one and a half minutes okay prompt question <malay>kita</malay> how how the thing
okay we would be <malay>macam</malay> in the caveman <malay>ambil</malay> rock [oh] no longer need to work to survive
if you are we are not working at anymore we don't have to work you don't have to work what would you do
there was that one movie <malay>yang macam</malay> they were all in space or something like that <malay>dia orang semua macam makan</malay>
<malay>bukan</malay> E wall E [ah] wall E they just in <malay>dia punya</malay> school air school tour so <malay>ada ada</malay> a drink and then <malay>ada</malay> like <malay>ada</malay> just for just ya [ah] I should watch wall E ya <malay>ke</malay>
nina hate wall E actually <malay>kau dah tengok</malay> the first thirty minutes I watch the
E wall [oh] I <malay>tak tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>mana aku tahu</malay> E wall <malay>iya</malay>

so #fathul# I have a question for you (mm) if you have three wishes what are (err) what three wishes would you want to have
well for me the first wish that would want to have is to have more wishes I think you would (err) void their rules of the wishes but that is the first wish that I would like to have provided there is no rules to the wishes with these more wishes that I can attain whatever I want in this world
and my second wish is to live happily to like you say (um) by giving others you feel happy I think there's a research that says whereby when one give to the poor or when one give what they have in out of sincerity they have a spark of happiness so maybe this can apply to me also
and to live happily means a lot of things (hmm) maybe to have a good family to have a good career to have a stable job and after all to live happily is what everyone wants [lah]
and lastly (err) the last wish that I want to have is to have the all the skills that I can attain in this world <malay>sebab bila</malay> you have all the skills you can impress people and people will also look up to you and with these skills also you you will feel good [ah] when you can do things <malay>yang orang lain semua tak boleh buat</malay>
(mm) and some skills that I want to have (err) maybe include (err) having all the capabilities to all the knowledge that that exist in this world [ah]
(mm) <malay>pasal ilmu ni</malay> but <malay>dia ada banyak</malay> (err) <malay>rangkuman ilmu nak dapat semua ilmu memang tak boleh tapi</malay> (hmm) <malay>kalau dapat ni</malay> best [ah] <malay>pasal ilmu ni nak nak dapat susah sangat</malay> (mm) and <malay>bila dapat ilmu ni orang akan mencari awak untuk mendapatkan ilmu ni</malay> (mm)
so <malay>ini adalah yang tiga</malay> wishes <malay>yang saya nak</malay> (mm) so <malay>kita</malay> (err) what about you #fathul#
so your three wishes were getting rich fit and what and intelligence right I think my my wishes actually encompass your wishes because to have to live happily (err) to us to some people to live happily is to have (err) the money and the wealth
<malay>pasal banyak orang ada persepsi bahawa bila awak kaya awak akan boleh</malay> spend on whatever and what not and <malay>bila awak dapat</malay> spend whatever and what not then means (err) with every spending <malay>awak akan rasa</malay> this happiness
(err) so and also when you are fit the goal of getting fit is also to feel good and to be happy [ah] and intelligence also [ah] this is to me I think it relates to me also [ah] because to have the intelligence is to have the skills and to acquire skills within a short period of time
(uh) so maybe for now we move (uh) to the next question which is (err) superpowers #fathul# what (err) if you have if you can have any superpowers only one one superpowers what would it be
[ah] [eh]
actually I disagree when you say teleportation could reduce the number of [ah] the number of COVID cases because if for example when people that have this virus they freely want to teleport away from the place maybe they don't know that they have this virus but then they just teleport so in this case
to the place that he teleported the people around him will be infected also and let let's say the people around him also have teleportation ability then it might come to a point whereby everyone in this world might be infected don't you agree
I see where you are coming from but I still hold the view whereby you (err) by accident
<malay>kononnya orang tu dia dah dia dah ada virus tu tapi dia yang</malay> teleport <malay>ke tempat lain</malay> so <malay>dia jadi</malay> the source of this (err) <malay>kuman</malay> [lah] so <malay>dia yang</malay> spread to others
<malay>dia tak dia tak tahu pasal dia tak dia tak tahu yang dia ada virus</malay> (mm) so I stay over this view whereby teleportation could actually increase
the the
the amount of (err) infection or the possibilities of (uh) infection rate [ah] you have anything to argue
yes correct
okay <malay>mungkin awak dah cakap ini</malay> okay maybe <malay>saya</malay> agree <malay>sikit</malay>
maybe <malay>awak ada</malay> point over there
<malay>tapi yang</malay> contact tracing <malay>tu mungkin tak tak senangkan</malay> [lah]
<malay>pasal orang sendiri tak ingat apa yang dia makan semalam ambil macam dia nak ingat mana dia</malay> teleport <malay>kalau dia sendiri dah suka</malay> teleport
(mm) <malay>tapi ini</malay> interesting point of view (mm) so <malay>kalau awak tanya saya apa</malay> superpower <malay>yang saya nak saya nak</malay> power of regeneration
so <malay>contohnya</malay> (err) <malay>jari saya terpotong</malay> [ah] <malay>nanti dia akan</malay> heal <malay>sendiri</malay>
<malay>saya rasa kononnya awaknya kaki</malay> dislocate [ah] dia regenerate <malay>sendiri</malay>
so if this regeneration ability I can do whatever I want all the high risk activity or all the high risk (uh) ambitions that I have
or maybe (uh) I I can take risks without having worrying that I might (uh) injured too much of my body because I know that I have this regeneration ability
so I can also maybe (err) get into fights knowing that I can fully regenerate myself and my opponent got no ability to do that so in that case I will definitely win [ah]
provided I am strong [ah] and maybe with this regeneration
(hmm)
I can donate let's say some parts of my (uh) limbs to those who need it so for example some people need a leg
(hmm) where I have this ability so I can do is (err) I request my leg to be cut off and then give away (err) in that case then my leg will regenerate itself like how the lizard (uh) tails it regenerates after some time of it losing the thing
(mm) what do you think about this regeneration ability
(mm) it's interesting twist
one day of my life in that case then I would maybe accept but then reduce the high risk activity that I want to indulge in
<malay>dah tahu hidup akan kurang satu hari tak</malay> [kan] <malay>nak buat benda yang merepek-merepek atau benda yang</malay> high risk
<malay>itu meminta kematian</malay> [lah]
to
to shorten your lifespan is to asking for death to come nearer
and about this regeneration maybe well since it will reduce my life by one day like what you give me the twist
then I would maybe choose another ability maybe the ability that I would want is invincibility because with invincibility
what I think is I can go through
the customs or the immigrations or flight without having (uh) to be looked at or without (err) being detected was one of my dreams is to travel around the world
so if this ability of invincibility I can do whatever I want without anyone noticing where I've gone or where where I'm heading towards cause I have this
(hmm) I have this
think of living in isolation (uh) maybe one maybe <malay>satu hari bila dah dah</malay> experienced everything <malay>yang kita nak</malay> [ah]
I want to be (uh) isolated from everyone just to focus on myself focus on my being
and my my own self [ah] to be isolated from this world not being distracted by everyone around me cause personally
when when I when I'm around people at times I feel whereby their worries and problems (uh) affected me so with that sometimes I prefer to be alone
(mm)
how long maybe until I feel peace [ah] so is actually quite subjective so if if you were to ask me how long
I couldn't give a I I cannot give a number of years or months [ah] but maybe for a start maybe I will start by months [ah] then slowly maybe I will
(err) increase the number of the period [ah] slowly
okay <malay>mungkin apa yang awak cakap telah mengubah persepsi saya</malay> and <malay>betul</malay> [lah] <malay>yang apa awak cakap yang kita kena</malay>
<malay>bergaul dengan orang untuk untuk memahami keadaan orang</malay>
<malay>sebab tanpa kita bergaul dengan orang</malay> we will never know what they face
(hmm)
we can never do something to improve the people around us
so for example <malay>bila kita tahu orang ini menghadapi masalah ini tapi kita nak tolong</malay> so <malay>kita akan mencari</malay> solution <malay>untuk menolong seseorang itu</malay>
so <malay>mungkin apa awak cakap</malay> (err) <malay>betul juga</malay> [ah] and <malay>tapi bila awak</malay> (err) <malay>saya</malay>
(hmm) <malay>hairan</malay> [lah] <malay>kenapa awak</malay> (err) question <malay>bila seseorang itu nak</malay> isolate maybe for months
because for me months is actually not a long time is actually maybe compared to years years is definitely longer but if for months maybe is still bearable [lah]
but it has to be looked in a certain way [ah] whereby the person
(err)
he is not affecting badly (uh) around the people (uh) (uh) he don't affect the people around him badly so he have to live in a good state [ah]
(uh)
interesting question
in this case I think he shouldn't because he still have responsibility and if he were to leave
his child behind then <malay>anak-anak dia akan merana</malay> [ah] and
<malay>kalau</malay> months okay months maybe <malay>saya rasa maksimum</malay> (err) maybe not more than nine months [ah]
lesser than that <malay>mungkin</malay> okay
<malay>kenapa</malay> nine months <malay>sebab</malay> within this nine months (um) <malay>budak tu dia akan</malay> grow and after this nine months
they will change a lot [lah] so if the father is not there to to be there with the child then the father will miss out on the child's development the child's small (err) goals small (err)
small achievement so this child will live without (uh) having a father figure and also the emotional
emotional of the emotion of the wife [ah] he shouldn't leave
that long unless the wife (err) agrees even with that I think he shouldn't fully isolate himself he should maybe still keep on in contact
with the person that he is responsible for but in in a case whereby the person has no responsibilities is not responsible for anything then I think he's free [ah] to do anything that he wants
do you think so
[eh]
okay <malay>soalan tu</malay> interesting <malay>sepuluh tahun</malay> means <malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay>
<malay>sebelas tahun yang lalu</malay> okay <malay>saya</malay> definitely <malay>akan suruh diri saya</malay> (err) <malay>ini</malay> [ah] invest [ah] invest in bitcoin
(uh) cause bitcoin ten years ago it's it it's very cheap compared to now one bitcoin is maybe up to eleven thousand
ten years ago it's maybe just few few hundred maybe even below hundred and you K if for example you buy hundred bitcoin back then
you can be a millionaire now then it is what I would tell my ten year old self
(err)
if if I were to be able to go back in time and maybe that is in terms of monetary [ah] but in terms of my life I would just tell him to go through what is going through and maybe to study properly and chase your dreams [ah]
cause after all even ten years
ahead which is now I'm actually quite satisfied with what I've done
so I'm I will just tell him to just do what he is going to do and follow his heart [ah]
(mm) so what about you what will you tell your own self ten years ago
talking about the investment part when I said tell my ten-year-old self (err) I don't mean to start at ten years old what I meant was that maybe if I'm able to convince him then I would tell him okay two years along the road invest in this in this in this
you will get rich I think when I say you will get rich you will entice my ten-year-old self [ah]
<malay>sebab</malay> at <malay>umur</malay> ten years old <malay>memang awak cakap betul</malay> (uh) <malay>nak nak faham tentang</malay> certain <malay>barang memang susah tapi bila kita dapat</malay> convince [ah]
satu orang ni</malay> at ten years old <malay>dia akan ingat</malay>
and maybe along the way <malay>mungkin dia dah dua belas tahun tiga belas</malay> and then <malay>dia akan</malay> start
(err) thinking back (err) <malay>apa yang orang itu cakap betul ke tak</malay>
[ah] <malay>adakah orang orang tu dia yang ada bilang saya</malay> ten years <malay>bila saya ten-year-old</malay> <malay>akan</malay> <malay>betul</malay>
then maybe if I if I have a impact on myself at ten years old then maybe it will bring benefit whereby I can reap what I sow today
(mm) and just now you were saying about
the second topic what was it
after investment
sorry
okay nowadays
(um) what is a time capsule
yes yes I think I've heard of this before and I think so I think is not limited to videos (uh) I think even people they put items which bring memories to them to bring forward to maybe the next ten years or
how many years down or even maybe even to the next generation few will sing about this time capsule what is it what is it about
if you can't remember it now and then maybe you should start back and that you have to wait ten years more to to get the video done
but it's a interesting concept where where you record yourself maybe I will start
start doing that myself and (uh) an option that you can do maybe is a suggestion is to save it in a cloud [lah] or maybe just email yourself [ah] so that you won't lose the video and the video will be online
it's interesting I think you can actually even see these types of video on the social media like youtube and all then there are people that that started this thing quite some time ago talking about this I I remember seeing
(err) a video whereby someone he takes a picture of himself (uh) since he was teenager all the way until he's married and all the way until he is (err) I think about early thirties
it's interesting to see (err) how that person progresses throughout his life so maybe this might entice you to maybe (err) start doing it
to because you are into this time capsule and things
so <malay>mungkin yang barang-barang begini semua akan</malay> (err) (um) <malay>akan</malay> interest <malay>awak</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal</malay> maybe one day <malay>juga awak akan jadi</malay> famous because of this [ah]
(mm)
K
you maybe you next we should talk about (um) near death experience
whereby you almost lost your life but maybe due to some miracles or some
(err) some luck you managed to stay alive [ah] so for you (err) <malay>apa yang</malay> experience <malay>awak pernah mengalami yang awak lagi sikit menghadapi kematian</malay>
I need to add on <malay>apa awak cakap memang betul biar kena maki jangan mati</malay>
okay for me my near death experience that I remember maybe quite clearly is whereby I went kayaking it was maybe when I was (err) I'm around fourteen years old fourteen or fifteen years old
it happens whereby we have to train where (err) train our capsizing skill so we have to capsize this is done intentionally intentionally so <malay>kita orang kena</malay> capsize <malay>habis tu bila</malay> capsize <malay>ini kita kena</malay> grab <malay>kawan kita punya kayak</malay>
and get back up [ah] so <malay>bila saya tengah</malay> practice capsize <malay>ini</malay>
instructor <malay>jauh</malay> so <malay>kita jauh daripada semua orang</malay>
<malay>habis tu kita bila saya tengah</malay> capsize <malay>kawan saya dia</malay> lose control of <malay>dia punya kayak habis saya dah kat dalam air ni saya dah</malay> capsize <malay>terus saya</malay> tap <malay>saya punya kayak</malay>
<malay>bila saya tengok terbalik ini</malay> so <malay>kawan saya punya bot tak ada</malay>
<malay>saya dekat situ saya</malay> stuck [ah] <malay>saya nak nak keluarkan yang kita orang ada</malay> skirt skirt <malay>ini akan</malay> prevent water from entering our kayak
<malay>nak keluarkan</malay> skirt <malay>tu kena ketat dan saya tak tak boleh keluarkan saya cuba cuba cuba tak boleh</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay>
tap <malay>kuat-kuat</malay> (uh) in hope that <malay>kawan saya dengar saya</malay> [ah] <malay>pasal saya tengah dekat</malay>
<malay>dia tak dia punya dia tak lihat saya saya dekat belakang dia saya sedang pegang kayak dia</malay> so <malay>saya</malay> tap tap tap <malay>dia tak dengar</malay> alright <malay>bila dia dengar ini dia kata</malay> [ah] <malay>lepas</malay> incident <malay>dia cuba</malay> paddle <malay>tapi</malay> I <malay>tolak dia</malay> so <malay>dia nak</malay> paddle <malay>susah sikit</malay>
so <malay>saya dekat bawah air</malay> maybe for one minute [ah]
and that one minute I swallow a lot of water
so after that one week then my instructor from afar he heard my the knocking of my kayak when I was (uh) stiff capsize
then he heard me then he quickly rushed towards me then offered his kayak for me to to use as a support to gain myself stability
so that was one of my near death experience I almost drown cause I drank a lot of water and almost suffocated that is one
and another near death experience that I can recall (uh) is when I was
(err) riding bike (uh) it happens maybe due to
(err) rushing factor that I I wanted to go home fast cause I just ended work
so it happens when there is two lorry in front of me initially I didn't know there was two lorry I thought it was just one so I was following the lorry behind
and that lorry was moving so slow so I decided to (uh) overtake him when I wanted to overtake him on the right
he signal right okay then I decided okay give him way to the right then I overtake him on his left and when it when it happens that he change lane I arise my engine to move on his left
that was when I realised there's a second lorry
at that point of time I had to break because I already speed up and when I break I
free still my back tyre and I almost skid but I managed to gain control of the bike
so luckily nothing serious happened I did get out of the lane to gain control of my bike but nothing serious happened on that note and to me
accident happens when people rush or they are not focused on the road so from through this experience I I really took it at as a lesson to be more cautious and not to rush when you are on the road
interesting point maybe we should move on to the next (uh) topic that I have in mind which is (err) a new hobby
what would you want to have as a new hobby can be now or maybe like
(uh) ten years ago that you would have picked up or maybe in the future what will you want to learn
or maybe in the future what would you want to learn as a or to get into for your new hobby
(hmm) whereas for me if I were to start a hobby ten years ago I would start skateboarding
cause now I see skateboarding as a interest so if I were to start maybe ten years ago I would definitely be good by now and
now that I want to learn is also skateboarding in fact I just started and what made me start is that (err) there was one one of the days I had a dream whereby I was skateboarding I don't know how to dream come about
but I was skateboarding and <malay>dalam mimpi tu saya rasa</malay> best <malay>nak bila</malay> skateboard <malay>ni rasa seronok</malay> [jer] and
<malay>bila</malay> skateboard <malay>tu dah mimpi itu bila saya bangun</malay> [oh] [eh] <malay>rasa macam apa ni macam nak nak</malay> skateboard [ah] [ah] <malay>dari situlah saya start</malay>
start skateboard <malay>tapi nak belajar</malay> skateboard <malay>ni dia susah sangat</malay> (err) it's actually very difficult to learn skateboard because there's a lot of
(um) synchronisation and body movement that you have to execute and it also is prone to injuries
and for me at this age where I start skateboarding
it's difficult because once I injure myself it will take a very long time for me to recover like for example (uh) few months back I accidentally sprained my ankle
(err) I landed wrongly on the board
and then I sprained my ankle and that sprain actually took about three weeks three weeks for me to recover fully and even that three weeks I I feel still that is not properly recover yet
and even after the three weeks I tried to learn to get back on the board but I still find it difficult and maybe that is the negative thing of starting skateboarding late
had I start ten years ago maybe I would I wouldn't have faced what I face today
but I see a lot of people at my age they stop skateboarding so I wonder why they do that so maybe in a few
minds or maybe yes then maybe I would figure out why they stop skateboarding in the future (um) a hobby that I would pick up is maybe
diving I have an interest for diving also and to me I find it very interesting where people can dive and if especially those free drivers free divers
those free divers they can go (uh) deep in deep water in just a single breath to me that is very interesting
and why I took (uh) I looked at is at it as interesting is because I tried to hold my breath in the water and I managed to get like two minutes fifteen seconds and to me it was very good but compared to the free driver free divers I I'm actually a noob
and <malay>bila dapat tahan</malay> breath <malay>saya lama begitu saya nak start nak belajar</malay> (uh) free dive and that time <malay>bila kat</malay> swimming pool (uh) <malay>saya ada</malay> swimming <malay>dekat</malay> nine metre pool [ah] [ah] <malay>itu saya cuba</malay>
and <malay>dapat</malay> [lah] <malay>dapat sampai ke</malay> bottom <malay>tapi I was having difficulty breathing [ah] and to control my breath is actually difficult so those are the ambitions that I have
so you have anything to add on

[oh] is it I don't know about that but
<malay>betul</malay> [lah] I I really learn to love new language I think mandarin (err) is my choice right now because
(um)
living in a country that have chinese in it I think it will be important for me to
know how to converse with them

(mm) (mm)
this is good for my networking [lah]
(mm) (mm)
(err) and
I remember that
(err) I really have strong interest in language because back in
back in high school I try to enroll in as many language class as I can
(err) sadly only one language is (err) permissible for for for a student (err) we can only choose one additional language to learn

(mmhmm)
[a'ah]
[kan]
<malay>pasal dia dah</malay> bring the character <malay>tu</malay>
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
[a'ah] <malay>betul</malay>

(mm) (mm)
<malay>cuma jadi kaya</malay>
<malay>ada kereta juga</malay>
(um) <malay>ni macam</malay> very small small small thing <malay>tapi</malay> important [lah]
[kan]
<malay>tak nak</malay> procrastinate [ah]
[kan] <malay>sebab itu</malay> [lah] <malay>punca kepada segala-galanya dua puluh dua puluh tak jadi</malay> <malay>faham ke kita bertangguh tangguh tangguh tangguh</malay> [ha] #hapo# <malay>pun takde</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mm)
<malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay> (err) and I agree that sometimes when we procrastinate actually the result turns out to be better <malay>faham ke macam</malay> like very last minute <malay>tapi</malay> it push us to to make a better thing <malay>faham ke</malay> ya that's true but
when it comes to working the the the that is quite hard [lah] actually <malay>faham ke sebab</malay> ya maybe maybe
so <malay>tahu</malay> [lah] <malay>kita ada</malay> deadline [kan] deadline is twentieth october [lah] <malay>konon</malay> [kan] but the boss want to see the progress <malay>bukannya</malay> on twenty nine <malay>tu</malay> I can do everything <malay>faham ke</malay>
yes <malay>betul</malay>
(mmhmm)
ya I think
for things that are going to cost me myself is okay actually to procrastinate even though it's it is not good but if I I cannot prioritise that then it's okay but when it comes to something that involve others I have to
get up
and do it
like right away
(hmm) <malay>tapi susah</malay> [lah]
<malay>sekali</malay>
(uh huh)
[ah]
(mm) (mm)

the the algorithm <malay>dia</malay> (mmhmm)
<malay>betul</malay>
[a'ah] [eh] <malay>tapi kadang-kadang</malay> [kan] <malay>bukan kita sebut</malay> [tau] <malay>benda kita fikir pun macam keluar juga</malay>

live okay <malay>lagi ni</malay> some people (err) even make like house tour #kot#
I think I think that is very something that unacceptable to me [lah] maybe others think that it's for fun but for me it's like you are showing to people how to enter your house <malay>faham ke</malay>
